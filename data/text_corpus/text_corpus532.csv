2660,globally the large rivers export amounts of particulate nitrogen pn to the ocean and studying the source and biogeochemical processes of the pn in the large river is important to regional global n budget and cycle however the source apportionments and transformations of the pn along the yangtze river remain unclear here the elemental and isotopic compositions n δ15n and δ13c value of suspended particulate n spn and surface sediment n ssn were determined in the wet and dry seasons along the yangtze river to investigate the seasonal and spatial variation in sources apportionments and transformations of the pn in the wet season the δ15n and pn content of spn increased from the headwater stream 2 3 3 9 and 0 12 0 04 respectively to the lower stream 6 8 2 4 and 0 47 0 41 respectively due to the imported anthropogenic n into the downriver section while there was no significant change in the dry season there were no distinctly spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of spn phytoplankton was identified as the dominant source of the spn 42 3 56 9 which is probably the result of reducing soil erosion reservoir construction rapid urbanization and development of freshwater aquaculture terrestrial soil was the major source of ssn 34 5 49 8 furthermore the significant relationship between the δ15n spn values and no3 concentrations as well as the lower δ15n spn value compared to that of δ15n no3 indicated a strong assimilation process of nitrate during phytoplankton growth meanwhile most of the ssn showed lower c and n concentrations and higher δ13c and δ15n values compared to those of the spn samples at the corresponding sampling sites which might be due to the ssn degradation our findings provided valuable information for the n cycle in the yangtze river and underlined the importance of phytoplankton in the pn inputs keywords particulate nitrogen spatiotemporal pattern siar model phytoplankton yangtze river data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen n inputs to river ecosystems have continuously increased over the past decades owing to the intensive anthropogenic influence boyer et al 2002 and hydroclimate change impacts sinha and michalak 2016 this has posed various potential threats to river ecosystems and human health kaushal et al 2011 rockstrom et al 2009 n generally enters the water in both dissolved and particulate forms it is estimated that the yield of particulate n pn exported yearly by global rivers from watersheds to the coastal ecosystems is approximately 23 0 tg n which is almost equivalent to that of dissolved n seitzinger et al 2002 nevertheless much of the previous work on n source apportionments and transformation processes within river ecosystems has typically focused on the dissolved n species li et al 2010 pan et al 2021 pn mainly originates from terrestrial soils plant litter and autochthonous production e g plankton and macrophyte kendall et al 2001 a greater amount of pn is deposited and preserved in sediments following a series of physical biological and chemical processes liu et al 2006 while the remaining pn is suspended in the water column and ultimately transported to coastal and oceanic realms on a global scale approximately 40 of the river transported pn is exported by the world s ten largest rivers particularly the amazon river huanghe river and yangtze river dagg et al 2004 seitzinger et al 2002 hence studying the source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of the pn from the large rivers is important to the regional global n budget and cycle previous studies on pn in the large rivers have mainly focused on their estuaries chen et al 2015 gaye et al 2009 inamdar et al 2015 however the relative contribution of pn sources is considerably controlled by the catchment characteristics bahadori et al 2020 meng et al 2021 dams construction grabb et al 2021 urbanization and associated increased sewage discharge liu et al 2021 which lead to the significant spatial variation of pn source in addition a significant biogeochemical process is also assumed to be happened from the headwater to the estuary especially for large rivers reschke et al 2002 wu et al 2007a thus only collecting samples at the river outlet resulted in limited awareness of the sources and transformation of pn at different sections of the river ecosystem this has negatively affected the effective measures put in place for environmental policies implementation n isotopic signature is considered as an indicator of the pn migration and transformation process kendall et al 2001 the high δ15n value in the lower reaches of the hebisuna river indicated the more anthropogenic n loading nishikawa et al 2009 however the ability to quantitatively estimate a potential source is hindered by the overlapping δ15n value with the end members hence other ancillary data e g c n c n ratios δ13c value have been often combined to infer more realistic predictions based on the isotopic approach previous studies found that the sources of pn were significantly affected by the sampling time terrigenous deposits via rain runoff were responsible for pn inputs in the wet season while the phytoplankton production was the dominant source in the dry season xuan et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 furthermore the perturbations of anthropogenic activities e g reservoir construction agricultural cultivation also greatly influence downstream pn input and transformation ock and takemon 2014 xu et al 2021 however most of those studies were carried out within small river ecosystems where runoff was relatively low and it was easy to identify the potential sources hence studies concerning large rivers are needed to increase awareness for all potential pn sources being one of the largest rivers in the world the yangtze river exported approximately 297 9 103 t pn 15 of total n every year to the east china sea duan 2000 and the contribution of pn in the upper reaches is close to 30 to the total n flux shen 2004 previous studies conducted in the estuaries of the yangtze river indicated that the pn is mainly derived from terrestrial soil and plants bao et al 2014 and its characteristic was strongly influenced by sampling season gao et al 2014 gao et al 2012 about 50 000 reservoirs including the world famous three gorges reservoir tgr were constructed throughout the yangtze river basin which lead to the pn annual fluxes decreasing over the recent decades but the particulate properties δ15n δ13c c n ratios in the estuary indicate no significant changes gao et al 2012 nonetheless distinct changes have been found in its tributaries or sections such as tgr grabb et al 2021 and wujiang river ji et al 2016 therefore it is indispensable to get a more comprehensive understanding of pn source apportionments and biogeochemical processes along the yangtze river which could provide theoretical reference for addressing environmental problems in the watersheds in the present study the seasonal and spatial variation of elemental and isotopic data c n δ13c δ15n of suspended particulate and surface sediments as well as the potential sources terrestrial soils were determined along the yangtze river watershed to provide a high precision picture on the origin and processing of pn in this large social economic natural complex ecosystem specifically our objectives were to 1 quantitatively trace the source of pn during the wet and dry season along the yangtze river 2 clarify the pattern of migration and transformation of pn in the suspended particulate spn and surface sediments ssn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river is the largest and primary river in china with a drainage area of approximately 180 104 km2 fig 1 it flows 6397 km from the tanggula mountains in qinghai tibetan plateau to the east china sea with an average annual water discharge of 8574 108 m3 and sediments discharge of 480 106 t data from https www cjw gov cn the yangtze river basin mainly belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate with cold dry winters and hot wet summers the mean annual precipitation for the entire catchment is 1045 mm and precipitation is mostly concentrated from may to september chen et al 2014 fig s1 the elevation increases from east to

to 2017 cui et al 2021 the population and industrialization in the yangtze river basin have also rapidly expanded in recent decades especially in the middle and lower reaches thus intensified anthropogenic disturbances have been putting more pressure on the yangtze river catchment cui et al 2021 ding et al 2019 2 2 sampling and analyses based on the hydrological characteristics two sampling campaigns were adopted during the wet season in july 2019 and the dry season in december 2019 respectively fig 1 suspended particulate nitrogen spn and surface sedimentary nitrogen ssn were sampled to reveal their source and transformation fig 1 table s1 the total number of spn and ssn samples were 48 and 10 in the wet seasons and 48 and 14 in the dry seasons respectively table s1 the

samples were mixed meanwhile river surface water samples were also collected from the sampling sites fig 1 for terrestrial soil sampling 47 sampling locations during the wet season and 19 sampling locations during the dry season were selected throughout the catchment fig s2 at each location a composite mixture of five sampling points was collected from surface soil 0 10 cm using a soil auger samples including the spn ssn terrestrial soil and river water samples were packed in ice boxes for transportation to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until analysis spn ssn and terrestrial soil samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 72 h xuan et al 2020 the spn samples with filter were weighted for the measurement of spn weight concentrations and then the spn samples were scraped carefully from the filters the freeze dried spn ssn and terrestrial soil samples were sieved through 200 mesh and acidified with 1 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon then the samples were rinsed repeatedly with deionized water three times and freeze dried again subsequently all of the samples were ground to a fine powder for experimental analysis concentrations of total particulate nitrogen pn and particulate organic carbon poc were measured by an elemental analyzer elemental vario macro cube isotopic compositions δ13c δ15n were determined by an elemental analyzer flash ea2000 thermo fisher

precipitation data were provided by the china meteorological administration https data cma cn 2 3 estimation of pn source contributions with siar to quantitatively estimate the proportional contributions of different sources to spn and ssn in the different sub basins of the yangtze river including the mainstream and tributary the bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar with δ13c and δ15n values of end members was used parnell et al 2010 in this study four potential pn sources terrestrial soil terrestrial leaf litter effluent detritus and phytoplankton were considered the typical values of the δ15n and δ13c of the potential pn sources are summarized in table 2 which were used by the siar model except for the terrestrial soil end member due to the characteristics of terrestrial soil end member showed a significantly broad variability δ13c 34 1 4 7 δ15n 2 1 10 9 and c n ratio 7 0 31 5 fig s5 the terrestrial soils samples in the two seasons were respectively divided into eight groups 2 seasons 4 sub basins which are similar to spn and ssn to better constrain the sources of pn the characteristics of terrestrial soils in the different sub basins and seasons were shown in table s3 and were used when estimated the pn source contributions besides for the headwater stream where human activities are limited the effluent detritus was excluded as a potential pn source due to the lack of sewage inputs meanwhile the phytoplankton was also not considered as the potential pn source in the headwater stream because the phytoplankton growth is affected by the low temperatures and or turbid water conditions in this area table s2 2 4 statistics and calculations to test whether the n concentrations c concentrations c n ratios δ15n and δ13c values of pn differ between seasons and among sub basins one way anova was used differences between individuals were compared with a post hoc tukey s test pearson correlations and simple linear regression analysis were employed to evaluate the relationships between pn concentration and poc concentration δ15n spn value and no3 n concentrations and poc pn δ15n and δ13c in the spn and ssn the above statistical analyses were performed using all of the samples including the mainstream and tributary samples statistical significance was set at p 0 05 all plots and statistical analysis were performed using r version 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations in the spn there was no significant difference between the dry and wet season p 0 05 except for δ15n spn in the lower stream p 0 05 table 1 however the spn concentrations were slightly higher in the wet season than that found in the dry season expressed as mg l p 0 05 especially in the headwater stream fig 2 a b in the wet season the results demonstrated that the sampling area is more likely to influence the isotopic and elemental compositions of spn p 0 05 table 1 the δ15n spn and pn values recorded in the lower stream 6 8 2 4 and 0 47 0 41 respectively were relatively higher than those recorded in the headwater stream 2 3 3 9 and 0 12 0 04 respectively fig 2c e table 1 by contrast during the dry season there were no significant spatial variations in the δ15n and pn across the river with values ranged from 3 4 1 1 to 5 6 2 8 and from 0 20 0 10 to 0 41 0 34 respectively fig 2d f table 1 the average c n ratio was dramatically higher in the headwater stream for both seasons 23 4 0 0 in the wet season and 22 8 0 1 in the dry season compared to the remaining stream segments the values ranged between 4 9 and 14 3 in the wet season and between 5 6 and 16 5 in the dry season from lower to upper stream table 1 fig 2g h 3 2 seasonal and spatial variations in the ssn considering ssn there is no significant difference found in the δ15n or pn or c n ratio between the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 1 fig 3 from the headwater to lower reaches the δ15n ssn values increased from 3 8 to 6 2 in the wet season and from 5 1 to 7 6 in the dry season while the c n ratio decreased from 22 7 to 9 1 in the wet season and from 20 1 to 9 0 in the dry season table 1 the pn in the wet season slightly changed in headwater upper stream but showed high variability in the middle lower stream 0 04 0 29 fig 3c in the dry season the pn exhibited gentle alterations with a small range between 0 02 and 0 13 except the outlying sample from site 40 0 69 fig 3d 3 3 source apportionments of pn in the suspended particulates and surface sediment the relationship of δ15n δ13c and c n ratio for the spn and ssn are plotted in figs 4 and s6 together with typical values of the potential sources samples of spn and ssn were almost within the scope of the four potential pn sources figs 4 and s6 however all the samples were not clearly separated by the season and sampling site the characteristics of ssn samples were beyond the scope of terrestrial leaf litter so terrestrial leaf litter was not included while calculating the relative contributions of pn sources in the surface sediment except for the headwater stream area which was covered by dense primary forest the siar model outputs showed that there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of both spn and ssn fig 5 spn in the headwater stream area was mainly from terrestrial soil 63 0 and 64 3 in the dry and wet seasons respectively on the other hand the source of spn in other stream segments was dominated by phytoplankton 42 3 56 9 during both the dry and wet seasons fig 5a b in the ssn the terrestrial soil was the greatest contributor 34 5 49 3 in the dry season 42 6 49 8 in the wet season fig 5c d the phytoplankton and effluent detritus showed almost similar contributions to the ssn for both the dry and wet seasons wet season 19 3 27 5 and 25 5 36 6 respectively dry season 25 3 33 4 and 28 8 32 8 respectively fig 5c d 3 4 correlation between element isotopes and other parameters the δ15n value of spn was significantly correlated with the no3 concentration p 0 05 but not with nh4 concentration p 0 05 fig 6 in addition the significant positive correlation between pn concentration and poc concentration was also observed in both wet and dry seasons p 0 01 fig s7 however the δ13c and δ15n of the spn were not significantly related to the δ13c p 0 05 and δ15n p 0 05 of the ssn respectively fig s8 the total suspended sediment concentration was also neither related to pn concentration nor to poc concentration fig s8 4 discussion 4 1 source apportionments of spn and ssn unlike the general concept that spn and ssn especially in the large rivers are mostly derived from terrestrial soil hemingway et al 2017 wu et al 2007b the phytoplankton was the dominant source of spn in the present study fig 5 similar results were mainly found in some highly urbanized rivers xuan et al 2020 river estuary dalu et al 2016 and reservoirs cai et al 2019 in the large lowland river meuse river phytoplankton was also found to be dominant with nearly 60 of the pn accounted and its low light acclimation might be responsible for this high contribution descy and gosselain 1994 however the increased phytoplankton contribution in our study could be explained by the following three reasons first and most important is the construction of 50 000 reservoirs throughout the yangtze river watershed particularly the tgr which significantly decreased water velocity thereby increasing the deposition of suspended particles these reservoirs indeed enhanced the trap of sediment loads 92 in the reservoirs of the upper reach that would otherwise be transported all the way to river estuary yan et al 2022 moreover the relatively stagnant and low water turbidity promotes the in situ growth of phytoplankton ji et al 2016 ock and takemon 2014 a previous study in the amagase dam of the uji river found that the pn was mainly derived from plankton 68 which heavily influences the downstream pn source and transformation ock and takemon 2014 the second reason is that the chinese government has taken a series of strategies and management practices for reducing soil erosion e g the construction of levees along the banks of the river the creation of terraces on sloping land afforestation and grass planting the introduction and promotion of sprinkler irrigation technology as well as the construction of concrete canals and ponds also reduced the erosion loss of agricultural soils thirdly the yangtze river basin which accounts for half of the nation s gross national product and one third human population of china is one of the developed regions in china increased loading of anthropogenic sewages mainly domestic and industrial sewages during the urbanization provided lots of nutrients e g phosphorus for phytoplankton growth xuan et al 2020 indeed the phytoplankton abundance chlorophyll a concentration in the middle lower stream of yangtze river was 0 03 2 0 mg l 1 in 2015 which is significantly higher than that in 2003 7 5 10 4 mg l 1 fang 2015 sheng 2019 wu et al 2007a therefore under hydrological and anthropogenic pressures the decreasing sediment load together with increasing phytoplankton production alter the source apportionment of pn and significantly influence the biogeochemical processes of n cycling in the aquatic ecosystems in addition we found that effluent detritus untreated sewage which contributed 16 8 26 6 to the spn inputs and 25 5 36 6 to the ssn is also a worth consideration pn source fig 5 several studies also reported that effluent detritus was an important source in many urban rivers such as the pearl river 15 55 beiyun river in beijing 10 42 etc liu et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 as a highly urbanized area in china the yangtze river basin discharges lots of sewage domestic sewage 273 9 108 tons and industrial wastewater 57 2 108 tons however it should be noted that the isotopic compositions of the fish feed δ15n 8 0 and δ13c 21 4 are completely covered by effluent detritus and cannot be effectively identified so the contributions of effluent detritus in this study actually included the n loading from aquaculture wastewater wang et al 2020b the results from global nutrient model demonstrated that nutrient release from freshwater aquaculture in china especially in the middle and lower stream areas of the yangtze river is very high n 1 0 1 6 mt year p 0 1 0 2 mt year and growing rapidly wang et al 2020a 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of pn characteristics and source contributions the results showed an increasing trend of δ15n and n contents in the spn and ssn along with the direction of flow in the wet season figs 2 and 3 this increase may be explained by the import of more anthropogenic n to the downstream section compared to the headwater area nishikawa et al 2009 the 15n rich nutrition could be assimilated by phytoplankton which was expected to result in the enrichment of 15n in the sediment kendall et al 2001 teranes and bernasconi 2000 as for the reasons for the rise of n concentration might be due to the n contents in the phytoplankton that increased along with the available n e g nitrate from the headwater stream to the lower stream pedersen and borum 1996 fig 6 the change in n contents can also be explained by the spatial variation of terrestrial soil n despite the amounts of terrestrial soil input was change slightly the n contents in terrestrial soil changed across the river fig s5 which enhanced the characterization of pn for instance n contents in both terrestrial soil and spn increased from the headwater stream to the upper area and slightly decreased in the lower stream furthermore the spatial pattern of δ13c and c n ratio in the spn was similar to that in the terrestrial soil which can hypothetically support the effect of terrestrial soil figs 2 and s5 however in the dry season the loading of terrestrial soil was reduced due to the decrease in rainfall and the effect of terrestrial soil was accordingly weak this has rendered to indistinct spatial variations in the δ15n and pn content along the river fig 2 the more possible explanation for the complicated spatial variations could be that the shift of phytoplankton community structure caused by the water temperature and nutrient concentrations has significantly changed in the dry season table s2 the different phytoplankton species have different characteristics of δ15n and pn content needoba et al 2003 sheng 2019 for example the increased molybdenum content in the dry season might lead to the blooms of n2 fixing cyanobacteria because the molybdenum is an important element for nitrogenase production burgess and lowe 1996 table s2 therefore the different rates of n2 fixation can lead to the complex spatial variations of the δ15n and pn content further studies concerning community composition and structure of phytoplankton in the different seasons could help to better understand the role of phytoplankton in pn source and transformation even though the temperature was low 9 15 c during the dry season the lower water velocity decreased runoff and increased nutrient concentration could still facilitate the growth of phytoplankton kendall et al 2001 lu et al 2016 xuan et al 2020 which further result in higher spn contribution from phytoplankton however the increased contribution has only been found in the lower stream fig 5b and the contribution of phytoplankton in the upper middle stream was not significantly different between the wet and dry seasons fig 5a b these results were obtained for several possible reasons the first reason is that the upper middle stream was more affected by anthropogenic activities rather than seasonal change lambert et al 2017 for example the construction of tgr has severely influenced the hydrological characteristics e g flow velocity and flux secondly the phytoplankton input from aquaculture significantly decreases in the dry season which might offset the increases of pn input from the endogenous phytoplankton in the upper and middle stream wang et al 2009 thirdly the strong events of precipitation and flooding did not happen during the sampling periods thus the loading of terrestrial sources did not vary much between the two sampling occasions fig 2a b table s1 therefore this has enhanced the sources apportionments of pn to be relatively stabilized 4 3 migration and transformation of spn and ssn it is necessary to study the migration and transformation of spn and ssn since it substantially determines the reliability of source apportionments and also influences the n load from the river to the estuary kendall et al 2001 in the present study the low correlation between tss concentration and pn or poc concentration in the dry and wet season p 0 05 fig s8a b suggests that there are various sources of pn e g phytoplankton and terrestrial soil maksymowska et al 2000 and might also reflect the spatial distributions of soil organic nitrogen across the river zhang et al 2009 in addition the poc and pn of the spn exhibited a relatively strong correlation p 0 001 and the intercepts in the y axis were minor 0 002 in the dry season 0 241 in the wet season suggesting that most of the n was bound to organic matter and the impact of inorganic n in the spn could be neglected fig s7 hu et al 2006 previous studies have revealed that the n isotopes of pn at least in part reflect their source though isotopic fractionation occurs during the n cycle douglas et al 2002 sigleo and macko 2002 assimilation of phytoplankton which is the process of inorganic n e g no3 and nh4 transformation into an organic form is regarded as a crucial process for pn transformation xuan et al 2020 in this study δ15n spn values were correlated with no3 concentrations p 0 05 but not with nh4 concentrations p 0 05 fig 6 indicating that nitrate was preferably utilized by phytoplankton especially in the ammonium limited environment kendall et al 2001 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2001 furthermore the light 14n was preferably assimilated by phytoplankton instead of the heavy 15n which caused the depletion of 15n in the production of organic n spn xuan et al 2019 the δ15n of no3 in the river water sample was 5 8 0 8 and 5 9 1 1 unpublished data in the dry season and wet season respectively yet higher than δ15n spn values of the present study dry season 4 7 2 6 and wet season 5 5 3 6 which affirmed the strong assimilation between the spn and ssn the isotope values δ13c and δ15n were not significantly related in both the wet and dry season p 0 05 fig s8c d indicating the vertical mixing of the water column and the deposition from suspended particles was weak xuan et al 2020 therefore the resuspension of surface sediments had little effect on the source identification of spn in this study in addition the results from the siar model suggested that most spn derived from phytoplankton as characterized by low c n ratio and easy decomposition sigleo and macko 2002 during the degradation of spn the 14n and 13c were preferential loss and subsequently particulate matter enriched heavy isotope 15n and 14c and lower c and n contents remained in the sediment figs 2 3 and s8 however the potential isotopic fractionation effects during the degradation might lead to the large uncertainties involved in source apportionments of ssn 5 conclusion in this study the isotopic and elemental compositions n δ15n and δ13c value of spn and ssn were determined in the wet and dry seasons along the yangtze river to investigate the seasonal and spatial variation in sources apportionments and transformations of the pn in the wet season the δ15n spn and pn content were increased from the headwater to the lower stream reflecting the increase of anthropogenic n inputs while there was no significant change in the dry season the results of the siar mixing model showed that there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of spn and ssn phytoplankton except for the headwater stream was the major source that contributed to the spn while the source of ssn was dominated by terrestrial soil in addition the effluent detritus was also a considerable source of pn the strong relationship between the δ15n spn values and no3 concentrations as well as the low δ15n spn compared to δ15n no3 indicated that nitrate was preferably assimilated by phytoplankton meanwhile most of the ssn samples showed lower c and n concentrations and higher δ13c and δ15n values compared to the spn samples at the corresponding sampling sites which might be related to the degradation of spn our findings highlighted the importance of phytoplankton in the pn inputs and n cycle in the heavily disturbed river system credit authorship contribution statemt jun zhang methodology data curation writing original draft writing review

respectively due to the imported anthropogenic n into the downriver section while there was no significant change in the dry season there were no distinctly spatial and seasonal variations in the

influence boyer et al 2002 and hydroclimate change impacts sinha and michalak 2016 this has posed various potential threats to river ecosystems and human health kaushal et al 2011 rockstrom et al 2009 n generally enters the water in both dissolved and particulate forms it is estimated that the yield of particulate n pn exported yearly by global rivers from watersheds to the coastal ecosystems is approximately 23 0 tg n which is almost equivalent to that of dissolved n seitzinger et al 2002 nevertheless much of the previous work on n source apportionments and transformation processes within river ecosystems has typically focused on the dissolved n species li et al 2010 pan et al 2021 pn mainly originates from terrestrial soils plant litter and autochthonous production e g plankton and macrophyte kendall et al 2001 a greater amount of pn is deposited and preserved in sediments following a series of physical biological and chemical processes liu et al 2006 while the remaining pn is suspended in the water column and ultimately transported to coastal and oceanic realms on a global scale approximately 40 of the river transported pn is exported by the world s ten largest rivers particularly the amazon river huanghe river and yangtze river dagg et al 2004 seitzinger et al 2002 hence studying the source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of the pn from the large rivers is important to the regional global n budget and cycle previous studies on pn in the large rivers have mainly focused on their estuaries chen et al 2015 gaye et al 2009 inamdar et al 2015 however the relative contribution of pn sources is considerably controlled by the catchment characteristics bahadori et al 2020 meng et al 2021 dams construction grabb et al 2021 urbanization and associated increased sewage discharge liu et al 2021 which lead to the significant spatial variation of pn source in addition a significant biogeochemical process is also assumed to be happened from the headwater to the estuary especially for large rivers reschke et al 2002 wu et al 2007a thus only collecting samples at the river outlet resulted in limited awareness of the sources and transformation of pn at different sections of the river ecosystem this has negatively affected the effective measures put in place for environmental policies implementation n isotopic signature is considered as an indicator of the pn migration and transformation process kendall et al 2001 the high δ15n value in the lower reaches of the hebisuna river indicated the more anthropogenic n loading nishikawa et al 2009 however the ability to quantitatively estimate a potential source is hindered by the overlapping δ15n value with the end members hence other ancillary data e g c n c n ratios δ13c value have been often combined to infer more realistic predictions based on the isotopic approach previous studies found that the sources of pn were significantly affected by the sampling time terrigenous deposits via rain runoff were responsible for pn inputs in the wet season while the phytoplankton production was the dominant source in the dry season xuan et al 2020 yuan et al 2017 furthermore the perturbations of anthropogenic activities e g reservoir construction agricultural cultivation also greatly influence downstream pn input and transformation ock and takemon 2014 xu et al 2021 however most of those studies were carried out within small river ecosystems where runoff was relatively low and it was easy to identify the potential sources hence studies concerning large rivers are needed to increase awareness for all potential pn sources being one of the largest rivers in the world the yangtze river exported approximately 297 9 103 t pn 15 of total n every year to the east china sea duan 2000 and the contribution of pn in the upper reaches is close to 30 to the total n flux shen 2004 previous studies conducted in the estuaries of the yangtze river indicated that the pn is mainly derived from terrestrial soil and plants bao et al 2014 and its characteristic was strongly influenced by sampling season gao et al 2014 gao et al 2012 about 50 000 reservoirs including the world famous three gorges reservoir tgr were constructed throughout the yangtze river basin which lead to the pn annual fluxes decreasing over the recent decades but the particulate properties δ15n δ13c c n ratios in the estuary indicate no significant changes gao et al 2012 nonetheless distinct changes have been found in its tributaries or sections such as tgr grabb et al 2021 and wujiang river ji et al 2016 therefore it is indispensable to get a more comprehensive understanding of pn source apportionments and biogeochemical processes along the yangtze river which could provide theoretical reference for addressing environmental problems in the watersheds in the present study the seasonal and spatial variation of elemental and isotopic data c n δ13c δ15n of suspended particulate and surface sediments as well as the potential sources terrestrial soils were determined along the yangtze river watershed to provide a high precision picture on the origin and processing of pn in this large social economic natural complex ecosystem specifically our objectives were to 1 quantitatively trace the source of pn during the wet and dry season along the yangtze river 2 clarify the pattern of migration and transformation of pn in the suspended particulate spn and surface sediments ssn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river is the largest and primary river in china with a drainage area of approximately 180 104 km2 fig 1 it flows 6397 km from the tanggula mountains in qinghai tibetan plateau to the east china sea with an average annual water

anthropogenic disturbances have been putting more pressure on the yangtze river catchment cui et al 2021 ding et al 2019 2 2 sampling and analyses based on the hydrological characteristics two sampling campaigns were adopted during the wet season in july 2019 and the dry season in december 2019 respectively fig 1 suspended particulate nitrogen spn and surface sedimentary nitrogen ssn were sampled to reveal their source and transformation fig 1 table s1 the total number of spn and ssn samples were 48 and 10 in the wet seasons and 48 and 14 in the dry seasons respectively table s1 the

from the filters the freeze dried spn ssn and terrestrial soil samples were sieved through 200 mesh and acidified with 1 m hcl to remove inorganic carbon then the samples were rinsed repeatedly with deionized water three times and freeze dried again subsequently all of the samples were ground to a fine powder for experimental analysis concentrations of total particulate nitrogen pn and

contributions of different sources to spn and ssn in the different sub basins of the yangtze river including the mainstream and tributary the bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar with δ13c and δ15n values of end members was used parnell et al 2010 in this study four potential pn sources terrestrial soil terrestrial leaf litter effluent detritus and phytoplankton were considered the typical values of the δ15n and δ13c of the potential pn sources are summarized in table 2 which were used by the siar model except for the terrestrial soil end member due to the characteristics of terrestrial soil end member showed a significantly broad variability δ13c 34 1 4 7 δ15n 2 1 10 9 and c n ratio 7 0 31 5 fig s5 the terrestrial soils samples in the two seasons were respectively divided into eight groups 2 seasons 4 sub basins which are similar to spn and ssn to better constrain the sources of pn the characteristics of terrestrial soils in the different sub basins and seasons were shown in table s3 and were used when estimated the pn source contributions besides for the headwater stream where human activities are limited the effluent detritus was excluded as a potential pn source due to the lack of sewage inputs meanwhile the phytoplankton was also not considered as the potential pn source in the headwater stream because the phytoplankton growth is affected by the low temperatures and or turbid water conditions in this area table s2 2 4 statistics and calculations to test whether the n concentrations c concentrations c n ratios δ15n and δ13c values of pn differ between seasons and among sub basins one way anova was used differences between individuals were compared with a post hoc tukey s test pearson correlations and simple linear regression analysis were employed to evaluate the relationships between pn concentration and poc concentration δ15n spn value and no3 n concentrations and poc pn δ15n and δ13c in the spn and ssn the above statistical analyses were performed using all of the samples including the mainstream and tributary samples statistical significance was set at p 0 05 all plots and statistical analysis were performed using r version 4 0 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations in the spn there was no significant difference between the dry and wet season p 0 05 except for δ15n spn in the lower stream p 0 05 table 1 however the spn concentrations were slightly higher in the wet season than that found in the dry season expressed as mg l p 0 05 especially in the headwater stream fig 2 a b in the wet season the results demonstrated that the sampling area is more likely to influence the isotopic and elemental compositions of spn p 0 05 table 1 the δ15n spn and pn values recorded in the lower stream 6 8 2 4 and 0 47 0 41 respectively were relatively higher than those recorded in the headwater stream 2 3 3 9 and 0 12 0 04 respectively fig 2c e table 1 by contrast during the dry season there were no significant spatial variations in the δ15n and pn across the river with values ranged from 3 4 1 1 to 5 6 2 8 and from 0 20 0 10 to 0 41 0 34 respectively fig 2d f table 1 the average c n ratio was dramatically higher in the headwater stream for both seasons 23 4 0 0 in the wet season and 22 8 0 1 in the dry season compared to the remaining stream segments the values ranged between 4

significant difference found in the δ15n or pn or c n ratio between the wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 1 fig 3 from the headwater to lower reaches the δ15n ssn values increased from 3 8 to 6 2 in the wet season and from 5 1 to 7 6 in the dry season while the c n ratio decreased from 22 7 to 9 1 in the wet season and from 20 1 to 9 0 in the dry season table 1 the pn in the wet season slightly changed in headwater upper stream but showed high variability in the middle lower stream 0 04 0 29 fig 3c in the dry season the pn exhibited gentle alterations with a small range between 0 02 and 0 13 except the outlying sample from site 40 0 69 fig 3d 3 3 source apportionments of pn in the suspended particulates and surface sediment the relationship of δ15n δ13c and c n ratio for the spn and ssn are plotted in figs 4 and s6 together with typical values of the potential sources samples of spn and ssn were almost within the scope of the four potential pn sources figs 4 and s6 however all the samples were not clearly separated by the season and sampling site the characteristics of ssn samples were beyond the scope of terrestrial leaf litter so terrestrial leaf litter was not included while calculating the relative contributions of pn sources in the surface sediment except for the headwater stream area which was covered by dense primary forest the siar model outputs showed that there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of both spn and ssn fig 5 spn in the headwater stream area was mainly from terrestrial soil 63 0 and 64 3 in the dry and wet seasons respectively on the other hand the source of spn in other stream segments was dominated by phytoplankton 42 3 56 9 during both the dry and wet seasons fig 5a b in the ssn the terrestrial soil was the greatest contributor 34 5 49 3 in the dry season 42 6 49 8 in the wet season fig 5c d the phytoplankton and effluent detritus showed almost similar contributions to the ssn for both the dry and wet seasons wet season 19 3 27 5 and 25 5 36 6 respectively dry season 25 3 33 4 and 28 8 32 8 respectively fig 5c d 3 4 correlation between element isotopes and other parameters the δ15n value of spn was significantly correlated with the no3 concentration p 0 05 but not with nh4 concentration p 0 05 fig 6 in addition the significant positive correlation between pn concentration and poc concentration was also observed in both wet and dry seasons p 0 01 fig s7 however the δ13c and δ15n of the spn were not significantly related to the δ13c p 0 05 and δ15n p 0 05 of the ssn respectively fig s8 the total suspended sediment concentration was also neither related to pn concentration nor to poc concentration fig s8 4 discussion 4 1 source apportionments of spn and ssn unlike the general concept that spn and ssn especially in the large rivers are mostly derived from terrestrial soil hemingway et al 2017 wu et al 2007b the phytoplankton was the dominant source of spn in the present study fig 5 similar results were mainly found in some highly urbanized rivers xuan et al 2020 river estuary dalu et al 2016 and reservoirs cai et al 2019 in the large lowland river meuse river phytoplankton was also found to be dominant with nearly 60 of the pn accounted and its low light acclimation might be responsible for this high contribution descy and gosselain 1994 however the increased phytoplankton contribution in our study could be explained by the following three reasons first and most important is the construction of 50 000 reservoirs throughout the yangtze river watershed particularly the tgr which significantly decreased water velocity thereby increasing the deposition of suspended particles these reservoirs indeed enhanced the trap of sediment loads 92 in the reservoirs of the upper reach that would otherwise be transported all the way to river estuary yan et al 2022 moreover the relatively stagnant and low water turbidity promotes the in situ growth of phytoplankton ji et al 2016 ock and takemon 2014 a previous study in the amagase dam of the uji river found that the pn was mainly derived from plankton 68 which heavily influences the downstream pn source and transformation ock and takemon 2014 the second reason is that the chinese government has taken a series of strategies and management practices for reducing soil erosion e g the construction of levees along the banks of the river the creation of terraces on sloping land afforestation and grass planting the introduction and promotion of sprinkler irrigation technology as well as the construction of concrete canals and ponds also reduced the erosion loss of agricultural soils thirdly the yangtze river basin which accounts for half of the nation s gross national product and one third human population of china is one of the developed regions in china increased loading of anthropogenic sewages mainly domestic and industrial sewages during the urbanization provided lots of nutrients e g phosphorus for phytoplankton growth xuan et al 2020 indeed the phytoplankton abundance chlorophyll a concentration in the middle lower stream of yangtze river was 0 03 2 0 mg l 1 in 2015 which is significantly higher than that in 2003 7 5 10 4 mg l 1 fang 2015 sheng 2019 wu et al 2007a therefore under hydrological and anthropogenic pressures the decreasing sediment load together with increasing phytoplankton production alter the source apportionment of pn and significantly influence the biogeochemical processes of n cycling in the aquatic ecosystems in addition we found that effluent detritus untreated sewage which contributed 16 8 26 6 to the spn inputs and 25 5 36 6 to the ssn is also a worth consideration pn source fig 5 several studies also reported that effluent detritus was an important source in many urban rivers such as the pearl river 15 55 beiyun river in beijing 10 42 etc liu et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 as a highly urbanized area in china the yangtze river basin discharges lots of sewage domestic sewage 273 9 108 tons and industrial wastewater 57 2 108 tons however it should be noted that the isotopic compositions of the fish feed δ15n 8 0 and δ13c 21 4 are completely covered by effluent detritus and cannot be effectively identified so the contributions of effluent detritus in this study actually included the n loading from aquaculture wastewater wang et al 2020b the results from global nutrient model demonstrated that nutrient release from freshwater aquaculture in china especially in the middle and lower stream areas of the yangtze river is very high n 1 0 1 6 mt year p 0 1 0 2 mt year and growing rapidly wang et al 2020a 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of pn characteristics and source contributions the results showed an increasing trend of δ15n and n contents in the spn and ssn along with the direction of flow in the wet season figs 2 and 3 this increase may be explained by the import of more anthropogenic n to the downstream section compared to the headwater area nishikawa et al 2009 the 15n rich nutrition could be assimilated by phytoplankton which was expected to result in the enrichment of 15n in the sediment kendall et al 2001 teranes and bernasconi 2000 as for the reasons for the rise of n concentration might be due to the n contents in the phytoplankton that increased along with the available n e g nitrate from the headwater stream to the lower stream pedersen and borum 1996 fig 6 the change in n contents can also be explained by the spatial variation of terrestrial soil n despite the amounts of terrestrial soil input was change slightly the n contents in terrestrial soil changed across the river fig s5 which enhanced the characterization of pn for instance n contents in both terrestrial soil and spn increased from the headwater stream to the upper area and slightly decreased in the lower stream furthermore the spatial pattern of δ13c and c n ratio in the spn was similar to that in the terrestrial soil which can hypothetically support the effect of terrestrial soil figs 2 and s5 however in the dry season the loading of terrestrial soil was reduced due to the decrease in rainfall and the effect of terrestrial soil was accordingly weak this has rendered to indistinct spatial variations in the δ15n and pn content along the river fig 2 the more possible explanation for the complicated spatial variations could be that the shift of phytoplankton community structure caused by the water temperature and nutrient concentrations has significantly changed in the dry season table s2 the different phytoplankton species have different characteristics of δ15n and pn content needoba et al 2003 sheng 2019 for example the increased molybdenum content in the dry season might lead to the blooms of n2 fixing cyanobacteria because the molybdenum is an important element for nitrogenase production burgess and lowe 1996 table s2 therefore the different rates of n2 fixation can lead to the complex spatial variations of the δ15n and pn content further studies concerning community composition and structure of phytoplankton in the different seasons could help to better understand the role of phytoplankton in pn source and transformation even though the temperature was low 9 15 c during the dry season the lower water velocity decreased runoff and increased nutrient concentration could still facilitate the growth of phytoplankton kendall et al 2001 lu et al 2016 xuan et al 2020 which further result in higher spn contribution from phytoplankton however the increased contribution has only been found in the lower stream fig 5b and the contribution of phytoplankton in the upper middle stream was not significantly different between the wet and dry seasons fig 5a b these results were obtained for several possible reasons the first reason is that the upper middle stream was more affected by anthropogenic activities rather than seasonal change lambert et al 2017 for example the construction of tgr has severely influenced the hydrological characteristics e g flow velocity and flux secondly the phytoplankton input from aquaculture significantly decreases in the dry season which might offset the increases of pn input from the endogenous phytoplankton in the upper and middle stream wang et al 2009 thirdly the strong events of precipitation and flooding did not happen during the sampling periods thus the loading of terrestrial sources did not vary much between the two sampling occasions fig 2a b table s1 therefore this has enhanced the sources apportionments of pn to be relatively stabilized 4 3 migration and transformation of spn and ssn it is necessary to study the migration and transformation of spn and ssn since it substantially determines the reliability of source apportionments and also influences the n load from the river to the estuary kendall et al 2001 in the present study the low correlation between tss concentration and pn or poc concentration in the dry and wet season p 0 05 fig s8a b suggests that there are various sources of pn e g phytoplankton and terrestrial soil maksymowska et al 2000 and might also reflect the spatial distributions of soil organic nitrogen across the river zhang et al 2009 in addition the poc and pn of the spn exhibited a relatively strong correlation p 0 001 and the intercepts in the y axis were minor 0 002 in the dry season 0 241 in the wet season suggesting that most of the n was bound to organic matter and the impact of inorganic n in the spn could be neglected fig s7 hu et al 2006 previous studies have revealed that the n isotopes of pn at least in part reflect their source though isotopic fractionation occurs during the n cycle douglas et al 2002 sigleo and macko 2002 assimilation of phytoplankton which is the process of inorganic n e g no3 and nh4 transformation into an organic form is regarded as a crucial process for pn transformation xuan et al 2020 in this study δ15n spn values were correlated with no3 concentrations p 0 05 but not with nh4 concentrations p 0 05 fig 6 indicating that nitrate was preferably utilized by phytoplankton especially in the ammonium limited environment kendall et al 2001 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2001 furthermore the light 14n was preferably assimilated by phytoplankton instead of the heavy 15n which caused the depletion of 15n in the production of organic n spn xuan et al 2019 the δ15n of no3 in the river water sample was 5 8 0 8 and 5 9 1 1 unpublished data in the dry season and wet season respectively yet higher than δ15n spn values of the present study dry season 4 7 2 6 and wet season 5 5 3 6 which affirmed the strong assimilation between the spn and ssn the isotope values δ13c and δ15n were not significantly related in both the wet and dry season p 0 05 fig s8c d indicating the vertical mixing of the water column and the deposition from suspended particles was weak xuan et al 2020 therefore the resuspension of surface sediments had little effect on the source identification of spn in this study in addition the results from the siar model suggested that most spn derived from phytoplankton as characterized by low c n ratio and easy decomposition sigleo and macko 2002 during the degradation of spn the 14n and 13c were preferential loss and subsequently particulate matter enriched heavy isotope 15n and 14c and lower c and n contents remained in the sediment figs 2 3 and s8 however the potential isotopic fractionation effects during the degradation might lead to the large uncertainties involved in source apportionments of ssn 5 conclusion in this study the isotopic and elemental compositions n δ15n and δ13c value of spn and ssn were determined in the wet and dry seasons along the yangtze river to investigate the seasonal and spatial variation in sources apportionments and transformations of the pn in the wet season the δ15n spn and pn content were increased from the headwater to the lower stream reflecting the increase of anthropogenic n inputs while there was no significant change in the dry season the results of the siar mixing model showed that there were no distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of spn and ssn phytoplankton except for the headwater stream was the major source that contributed to the spn while the source of ssn was dominated by terrestrial soil in addition the effluent detritus was also a considerable source of pn the strong relationship between the δ15n spn values and no3 concentrations as well as the low δ15n spn compared to δ15n no3 indicated that nitrate was preferably assimilated by phytoplankton meanwhile most of the ssn samples showed lower c and n concentrations and higher δ13c and δ15n values compared to the spn samples at the corresponding sampling sites which might be related to the degradation of spn our findings highlighted the importance of phytoplankton in the pn inputs and n cycle in the heavily disturbed river system credit authorship contribution statemt jun zhang methodology data curation writing original draft writing review

2661,here we review the contributions of professor barbara sherwood lollar to compound specific isotope analysis csia in contaminant hydrogeology and environmental chemistry we first discuss the seminal work by professor sherwood lollar s lab on establishing csia as a quantitative tool for contaminant bio transformation at contaminated groundwater sites we describe the critical research by her lab in the development and validation of sample collection techniques single and multi element csia and isotope data evaluation for reliable interpretations we highlight the contributions of professor sherwood lollar s lab towards the development of best practices for the successful application of csia by industry to demonstrate the occurrence of bio transformation identify bio transformation mechanisms quantify the extent and rate of degradation and differentiate among potential contaminant sources we then explore professor sherwood lollar s applications of csia to hydrogeology of the deep subsurface and the fast widening of the field to new environments e g sediments contaminants e g chlorofluorocarbons pesticides and systems e g plant enzymes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction legacy contaminants in groundwater are contaminants with a long history of industrial use that have been regulated or banned due to findings on their adverse effects on human and or environmental health however these contaminants persist in the environment due to past improper storage handling or disposal practices this includes classes of contaminants such as chlorinated solvents which began to receive awareness in the 1970s tackling this problem not only requires strategies to remediate contaminated groundwater sites but reliable monitoring tools to make robust interpretations on the success of these strategies compound specific isotope analysis csia was developed as a result of this crucial need leading to its evolution to an established tool for monitoring the fate of legacy contaminants in groundwater today professor barbara sherwood lollar s research team has pioneered the approach of csia to investigate contaminant fate and the success of remediation strategies at field sites the research from sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has been crucial in establishing the principles of csia and its application for differentiating contaminant sources detecting the occurrence of degradation identifying the degradation mechanisms and quantifying degradation efficiency i e extents and rates in the subsurface in this review we refer to both biotic and abiotic contaminant transformation as bio transformation the path toward the development of csia began in the mid to late 1990s at that time there was great interest in the potential of the recently commercially available gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc irms systems to elucidate the behavior of organic contaminants in groundwater systems using δ13c analysis sessions 2006 however no publications had yet demonstrated that δ13c analysis of dissolved groundwater contaminants by gc irms could be achieved at concentrations relevant to field applications nor that such analysis would yield insights into the fate and transport of these compounds in this review we summarize the current state of csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology highlighting the contributions of sherwood lollar and her team and how they have shaped the field we conclude by summarizing how we can continue to build on the foundation sherwood lollar has established by identifying important future areas of research in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology 2 establishing csia as a potential quantitative tool for investigating contaminant fate and transport compound specific isotope analysis relies on the natural abundance of a light l and heavy h stable isotope of an element e in a compound which is represented by the isotope signature or delta value δhe 1 δ h e r sample r standard 1 where rsample and rstandard are the he le ratios in a sample and an international standard respectively δhe is commonly expressed in permil which is equivalent to milliurey mur or parts per thousand brand et al 2014 today csia is a widely accepted tool for in situ monitoring of natural and engineered attenuation of solvents and other organic contaminants in groundwater as illustrated by the epa publication a guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia that was co authored by sherwood lollar hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar recognized that the first requirement to achieve the application of csia to groundwater systems was to develop sampling and sample preparation approaches that were demonstrated to preserve the isotopic signature of the dissolved organics of interest her group publications demonstrated that pentane extraction dempster et al 1997 and headspace analysis slater et al 1999 conserved the δ13c signature of petroleum hydrocarbons such as toluene and chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce while achieving field relevant concentrations this laid the foundation for the broad application of csia to groundwater systems sherwood lollar recognized that the next critical requirement was to determine whether isotopic fractionation that is changes in the isotopic signature of a compound occurred during subsurface processes her group s initial papers demonstrated that there was negligible carbon isotopic fractionation of chlorinated solvents tce and toluene btex associated with dissolution dempster et al 1997 and volatilization slater et al 1999 slater et al 2000 followed this up demonstrating that the δ13c isotope signatures of tce and toluene were conserved during sorption these observations on non destructive processes have been borne out by numerous studies since except in the case of very low fraction remaining carbon isotope fractionation by these physical processes is negligible within analytical uncertainty in most cases hunkeler et al 2008 however exceptions have been emphasizing the need for careful evaluations for specific scenarios for example in the case of pure product evaporation in open systems inverse isotope fractionation i e enrichment of the heavy isotope in the vapour phase hinted at in slater et al 1999 can result in isotopic fractionation during open system evaporation from free product phases e g for chlorofluorocarbons due to vapor pressure effects horst et al 2016 concurrently with establishing that non destructive processes typically result in negligible isotope fractionation sherwood lollar et al 1999 was one of the handful of publications that initially demonstrated the most exciting potential of csia that transformation of organic solvent groundwater contaminants resulted in large carbon isotope fractionation of the residual contaminants a critical observation that has led to the ongoing application of csia in groundwater systems while some initial papers had used field and microcosm studies to demonstrate that stable isotope fractionation was associated with dechlorination of pce and its metabolites hunkeler et al 1999 and with biodegradation of hydrocarbons stehmeier et al 1999 sherwood lollar et al 1999 provided the first quantification in the literature of isotope fractionation effects involved in biotransformation of chlorinated ethenes e g tce and btex e g toluene using models from previous work involving nitrogen isotopes mariotti et al 1981 specifically sherwood lollar et al 1999 demonstrated that the anaerobic biodegradation of tce resulted in large isotope fractionations and further that these fractionations could be modelled using the rayleigh model the rayleigh model is a fractional distillation model that relates the fraction of remaining compound f to the isotopic ratio at any time t r and its initial value r0 via a constant fractionation factor α 2 r r 0 f α 1 the existence of a consistent fractionation factor α also sometimes expressed as an enrichment factor ε α 1 in indicated that the fractionation was characteristic of the bio transformation process indeed later research confirmed that the values of α and ε are related to the kinetic isotope effect kie defined as lk hk where α 1 kie e g elsner et al 2005 this was a truly exciting observation as it demonstrated that stable isotope fractionation not only could be used to identify the occurrence of contaminant in this case tce bio transformation independent of non degradative mechanisms of mass loss but also that there was a quantifiable relationship between the extent of isotope fractionation and the extent of bio transformation that had occurred using process specific α and ε resulting in the potential to use these parameters to distinguish different bio transformation processes this was a starting point in creating a database of α and ε values for various compounds and bio transformation reaction pathways to which the sherwood lollar group contributed e g aerobic and anaerobic biotransformation of toluene sherwood lollar et al 1999 ahad et al 2000 perchloroethylene pce slater et al 2001 tce slater et al 2001 cis dichloroethylene c dce slater et al 2001 vinyl chloride vc slater et al 2001 chartrand et al 2005 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca hirschorn et al 2004 hirschorn et al 2007 chloroform cf chan et al 2012 and mono di and tri chlorobenzenes mcb dcb and tcb liang et al 2011 2014 in some cases minimal 13c fractionation effects were observed such as during the aerobic biotransformation of toluene in sherwood lollar et al 1999 thus precluding the use of δ13c csia to identify bio transformation in this case however an important implication of this early work e g ahad et al 2000 sherwood lollar et al 1999 is that δ13c csia has the potential to be used with isotopically conservative processes for source differentiation the next step was to expand the isotope systems being investigated exploring elements other than carbon initially hydrogen δ2h demonstrated that other characteristic isotope effects may be occurring even when there was negligible carbon isotope fractionation for example anaerobic toluene biotransformation resulted in significant hydrogen isotope effects 5 analytical uncertainty which were otherwise small for carbon ahad et al 2000 ward et al 2000 these early developments of multi element csia demonstrated the potential to combine δ13c and δ2h csia to identify bio transformation of groundwater contaminants e g methyl tert butyl ether mtbe gray et al 2002 mckelvie et al 2009 and benzene mancini et al 2008 mancini et al 2003 and possibly distinguish between different reaction mechanisms mancini et al 2008 mckelvie et al 2009 facilitating the emergence of dual isotope analysis discussed in more detail in sections 5 and 6 beyond natural attenuation engineered attenuation e g via the introduction of reductants such as zero valent iron zvi was proven to be an effective means to drive reductive dechlorination of chlorinated solvents sherwood lollar s group showed that as was the case for biological transformation the extent of abiotic remediation can be monitored via csia applying the rayleigh model e g for tce dechlorination by zvi reaction slater et al 2002 vanstone et al 2004 and for 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1 1 2 2 teca and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca transformation by fe and cu fe metals elsner et al 2007 these laboratory studies by sherwood lollar and her group made foundational contributions to the establishment of key principles for the use of csia as a powerful tool to either identify contaminant sources or identify and quantify natural or engineered attenuation of groundwater contaminants 3 demonstrating the feasibility of applying csia to investigate bio transformation at contaminated sites one of the main advantages of csia in contaminant hydrogeology is its application to distinguish between non destructive e g sorption dilution dispersion and volatilization and bio transformation processes affecting contaminants at field sites without the need to identify bio transformation products this is because non destructive processes typically cause minimal isotope fractionation compared to bio transformation processes especially for carbon as discussed in section 2 sherwood lollar and her group were leaders in the demonstration of csia at field sites to investigate whether bio transformation is occurring and if at rates and extents such that contaminants will be sufficiently reduced to meet regulatory guidelines research from sherwood lollar and her team has applied csia to sites investigating a variety of remediation strategies detailed in table 1 including both natural processes e g by relying on the ability of intrinsic microbes to degrade contaminants intrinsic biotransformation and engineered processes e g by adding chemicals e g using zvi for abiotic transformation electron donors for biotransformation i e biostimulation or adding microbes to enhance biotransformation i e bioaugmentation early contributions also include developing criteria for the successful application of csia to demonstrate the occurrence of bio transformation in the field in sherwood lollar et al 1999 1 systematic changes in δhe values or fractionation must occur during bio transformation 2 the extent of fractionation must be greater than analytical uncertainty 3 under a given set of conditions isotope fractionation must be reproducible 4 the effects of isotope fractionation during a given bio transformation pathway must be readily discernable from isotopic effects associated with other subsurface processes of mass attenuation such as volatilization dissolution and sorption these criteria were adopted in the csia field guidance hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s research has demonstrated that these criteria are met for certain compounds and conditions but not for others for example fractionation was observed for anaerobic transformation of tce but not for aerobic bio transformation of toluene by sand from a contaminated aquifer sherwood lollar et al 1999 although further work showed aerobic toluene biotransformation can produce significant carbon isotope effects morasch et al 2002 vogt et al 2008 these early findings emphasized the importance of determining compound specific and condition specific enrichment factors shaping further research and application of csia to investigation of bio transformation at field sites 3 1 source differentiation the initial isotopic composition of a compound depends on two primary variables the isotopic composition of the source material e g petroleum feedstocks for chlorinated solvent production and any isotopic fractionation that occurs during production hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein thus variations in either of these two variables between manufacturers or production batches will be reflected by different initial isotopic signatures these variations can be used with csia to determine if multiple source zones of contaminants exist at a site successful application of csia for source differentiation benefits from knowledge of the isotopic compositions of various pure phase undegraded material to confirm the potential for source differentiation and establishing ranges of known pure phase values to compare to field data hunkeler et al 2008 professor sherwood lollar s laboratory has confirmed the potential for csia as a means for source differentiation in the field for priority contaminants including btex dempster et al 1997 hexachlorocyclohexane hch chartrand et al 2015 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs phillips et al 2020 and 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca chartrand et al 2007 furthermore carbon and hydrogen csia was used in conjunction with hydrogeology contaminant concentrations and site history to identify sources of benzene and chlorobenzene contamination at a complex field site mancini et al 2008 in this work homogenous δ13c and δ2h signatures of chlorobenzene indicated a single chlorobenzene source while variable isotope signatures of benzene that were inconsistent with the effects of biotransformation indicated two distinct benzene source areas mancini et al 2008 3 2 identifying and evaluating the extent of bio transformation the rayleigh equation is used to estimate the extent of contaminant bio transformation eq 2 mariotti et al 1981 the first step in assessing whether the rayleigh model is appropriate for the investigated field site is to plot a rayleigh correlation where contaminant isotope compositions are plotted against the natural logarithm of concentrations hunkeler et al 2008 if these data are well described by a linear relationship and vary in a manner consistent with bio transformation then the application of the rayleigh model is appropriate and contaminant bio transformation is a significant process controlling contaminant concentrations hunkeler et al 2008 variation consistent with bio transformation includes when concentrations decrease with isotopic compositions increasingly enriched in the heavy isotope i e normal isotope effect or enriched in the light isotope i e inverse isotope effect observed in rare cases e g heckel et al 2019 a poor correlation to the rayleigh model may indicate strong influence of physical processes on concentration however this does not automatically disqualify a site for applying csia to understand contaminant bio transformation hunkeler et al 2008 despite the multiplicity of both chemical e g bio transformation and physical processes non destructive e g volatilization sorption dispersion etc affecting contaminant concentrations in the subsurface sherwood lollar s team verified early on that the rayleigh model was appropriate at various sites sherwood lollar et al 2001 chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2005 vanstone et al 2005 demonstrating the validity of this approach csia can also indicate when intrinsic bio transformation is not occurring which can be particularly valuable when potential daughter products of bio transformation are present as primary contaminants mckelvie et al 2007a an early warning that intrinsic bio transformation is not occurring e g morrill et al 2005 mckelvie et al 2007a is critical in contaminant remediation planning and can contribute to substantial cost and time savings in scenarios with evidence that bio transformation is occurring the extent of bio transformation can be estimated using the rayleigh model for this enrichment factor s ε must be known for the most likely transformation process es acting on the contaminant of interest eq 3 i e the linearized form of the rayleigh equation can then be applied to calculate the fraction of original contaminant remaining f 3 ln δ h e 1 δ h e o 1 ε ln f where δhe is the isotopic composition of element e at a given location and δheo is the isotopic composition of the contaminant in the source zone which can be estimated using source values from the literature using the most negative value at the site or from a source well alternative approaches are described in hunkeler et al 2008 the extent of bio transformation eot can then be calculated using eq 4 4 eot 1 f this approach allows practitioners to estimate whether contaminant bio transformation is occurring at sufficient levels to bring contaminant concentrations within regulatory limits sherwood lollar s research has successfully demonstrated this approach to estimate the extent of intrinsic biotransformation sherwood lollar et al 2001 morrill et al 2009 gilevska et al 2019 phillips et al 2020 and to evaluate the success of biostimulation hirschorn et al 2007 mckelvie et al 2007b and bioaugmentation chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2005 3 3 calculating rates a powerful application of csia is to estimate contaminant bio transformation rates bio transformation rates are key parameters needed for design of remediation approaches however accurate rates are often difficult to determine using conventional data collection i e composition only as contaminant concentrations are affected by a variety of processes as discussed previously csia provides a unique advantage in calculating bio transformation specific rates first order rate constants λ bio transformation can be approximated according to eq 5 5 λ b i o t r a n s f o r m a t i o n δ δ h e ε t where t is the average travel time calculated between two sampling ports 1 and 2 with a difference in measured contaminant isotopic signatures δδhe hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s research has demonstrated the utility of using csia to estimate field derived first order rate constants for compounds such as cis dce morrill et al 2005 mtbe mckelvie mackay et al 2007 chlorinated benzenes and benzene gilevska et al 2019 importantly all isotopically derived rate constant estimates from morrill et al 2005 and gilevska et al 2019 agreed with concentration derived estimates within an order of magnitude however estimates calculated using isotope data are typically lower than those calculated solely using decreases in concentrations along a flow path this is because concentration decreases can result from various non destructive processes e g diffusion dispersion adsorption volatilization as well as bio transformation while isotope data provide more conservative estimates that reflect bio transformation rates only highlighting the utility of csia to calculate more accurate bio transformation rates sherwood lollar proposed to apply the concept of representative elementary volume rev zones for the calculation of bio transformation rates at the field scale gilevska et al 2019 the rev is the volume of sampling and measurement at which there is no change in the average value for a given parameter averaged over the entire rev this concept has been applied in hydrogeology to parameters such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity freeze and cherry 1979 in sediments the rates of chemical and biological reactions can vary on very small scales due to variations in microbial communities and the presence of nutrients and electron donors gilevska et al 2019 and references therein gilevska et al 2019 calculated rate constants using csia data in sediments within different depth profiles the authors used statistical evaluation of csia data to differentiate between rev zones with different rate constants of bio transformation in sediment profiles this approach demonstrated the presence of critical zones with maximum biotransformation rates in sediment profiles responsible for sediment detoxification 3 4 combining csia with numerical modelling as discussed in previous sections csia provides an advantage over concentration data alone in investigating biotransformation studies however as noted previously assessing whether bio transformation is a main process controlling contaminant concentrations must first be assessed using a rayleigh correlation even if non destructive processes are occurring isotope data can still be useful for estimating bio transformation rates and extents provided these non destructive processes are isotopically conservative however under complex field conditions applications of the rayleigh model as discussed so far may not be possible due to the occurrence of multiple non destructive and bio transformation processes contributing to the overall isotope change such as the case of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl dissolution hunkeler et al 2004 chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2009 volatilization thullner et al 2012 and sorption wanner et al 2017 halloran et al 2021 these situations require more process descriptive methods for interpreting csia data sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has developed and applied nuanced mathematical models for understanding how non destructive but isotopically sensitive processes affect csia data interpretation in complex field conditions for example xu et al 2016 2017 demonstrated that under certain spatial and temporal field sampling schemes diffusion related carbon isotope fractionation is often negligible providing guides for sampling design when using csia to evaluate bio transformation morrill et al 2009 presented an analytical model to understand how dnapl dissolution overprints the signature of bio transformation and demonstrated its implications for csia interpretation another limitation of the rayleigh model is that when interpreting csia data in a bio transformation chain when one or more contaminants are simultaneously produced and transformed the rate constants for these processes need to be known morrill et al 2006 höhener and atteia 2014 morrill et al 2006 proposed an improved method to estimate ε for intermediate compounds in a bio transformation chain more recent work from the sherwood lollar laboratory couples modeling with csia to focus on combining field collected concentration and csia data for investigating the fate and transport of mcb and benzene in contaminated sediments gilevska et al 2019 4 sample collection preservation and analysis for csia an essential step in csia is the development of sample collection preservation preparation and analysis protocols that preserve the original isotope signatures of the target compounds research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has led the path to the application of csia to unexplored environments for this technique such as contaminated sediments this research showed that passive equilibrium pore water samplers i e peepers are compatible with csia passeport et al 2014 and can be used to identify bio transformation of benzene and chlorinated benzenes passeport et al 2016 and even estimate rates of natural attenuation gilevska et al 2019 in experimental studies sherwood lollar and her team recognized the potential for increased uncertainty in calculating ε using traditional methods headspace analysis for both composition and isotope ratios for reactions where pressure increases occur over the course of a reaction due to daughter product formation in response to this a method was developed to monitor the extent of a reaction based on increases in headspace pressure due to the production of co2 in a decarboxylation reaction to calculate more accurate estimates of ε using the rayleigh model in reactions with non isobaric pressure in closed systems mundle et al 2013 using the technique proposed by mundle et al 2013 ε values can be calculated with higher correlation coefficients and lower confidence intervals for laboratory experiments with non isobaric pressure applications of csia to contaminated sites first focused on volatile organic compounds including btex chlorinated ethenes and chlorinated ethanes by letting such compounds equilibrate between the liquid and gaseous phases of a closed sample vial according to their henry s constants sufficient amounts of the compound relative to analytical detection limits can be found in the gas phase with negligible differences in stable carbon isotope composition between the liquid and vapour phases slater et al 1999 this has provided a clean i e minimal sample matrix and easy way to inject volatile compounds into a gc irms for csia even for multi contaminant sample mixtures and complex matrices lower detection limits can be obtained through simple sample freezing elsner et al 2006 and by further optimizing headspace extraction e g in the dynamic headspace method in which a larger portion of the headspace volume was collected and cryogenically trapped before thermal desorption in the gc irms morrill et al 2004 solvent extraction methods from single step liquid liquid extraction dempster et al 1997 to multiple step procedures chartrand et al 2015 were developed and carefully validated for specific compounds e g btex and for semi volatile organic compounds such as hchs to confirm that method induced isotope fractionation for δ13c csia was less than analytical uncertainty i e 0 5 novel methods were later developed for new classes of compounds exhibiting their own analytical challenges for example the broad gc peaks observed for cfc 11 and cfc 113 in traditional purge and trap extraction prevented δ13c csia at field relevant concentrations of these two chlorofluorocarbons this challenge was overcome using an isotopically conservative peak cutting and cryo refocusing approach that allowed δ13c csia of dissolved cfcs down to 190 cfc 11 and 270 µg l cfc 113 horst et al 2015 the new δ13c csia method was applied at a contaminated groundwater site and provided evidence for in situ biotransformation of cfc 11 and the lack of natural attenuation but the presence of multiple source zones for cfc 113 phillips et al 2020 sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has contributed to the development of δ2h csia for chlorinated hydrocarbons at typical field concentrations showing that a liquid n2 trap can efficiently remove undesirable hcl and result in reproducible and accurate δ2h measurements of 1 2 dichloroethane chartrand et al 2007 sherwood lollar and her team and colleagues at the helmholtz ufz later established criteria for chromium reactors for δ2h measurements of chlorinated volatile organic compounds vocs gilevska et al 2020 specifically gilevska et al 2020 demonstrated that the cr particle size range cr reactor position vertical vs horizontal oven temperature and cr packing length can influence the trapping efficiency of undesirable hcl by products during the conversion of chlorinated vocs this method was applied successfully to contaminated sediment porewaters where δ13c chlorine δ37cl and δ2h csia together identified the dominant pathways affecting the fate of chlorobenzene and benzene gilevska et al 2021 these analytical advances contributed to the widespread application of multi element csia to chlorinated compounds which is now a mainstream technique helping to constrain source zones and contaminant bio transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms 5 establishing best practices for adoption of csia in hydrogeology community consensus on best practices is a central tenet in stable isotope geochemistry e g brand and coplen 2001 brand and coplen 2012 hunkeler et al 2008 isotope ratios of international standards are established distributed and regulated by the international atomic energy agency iaea in vienna austria as a result all isotope laboratories are calibrated to the same set of international standards allowing for a direct comparison of the results from any isotope laboratory worldwide accordingly within the stable isotope community there is a strong emphasis on collaborative efforts to establish best practices within the discipline including instrument calibration estimating total uncertainties and calculations to interpret stable isotope data work from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has set a standard for adopting best practices in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology and produced significant contributions to establish best practices in the field 5 1 assessing total uncertainty in contaminant hydrogeology isotope data can be used to identify if bio transformation of a contaminant is occurring however variations in isotope signatures can be small relative to the analytical uncertainty of isotope ratio mass spectrometers thus variations in isotope signatures must be considered in the context of well constrained estimates of analytical uncertainty that span the entire range of instrumental parameters above detection limits notably the uncertainty should be assessed for the compound analyzed and the sample introduction technique e g purge trap to incorporate all uncertainty for the process e g kuder and philp 2013 isotope data is then used to calculate parameters such as ε applied to estimate rates and extents of bio transformation and λ applied to identify relevant bio transformation mechanisms at field sites parameters ε and λ are discussed in more detail in sections 2 and 6 respectively however uncertainty estimates for ε and λ must also be carefully considered including how to incorporate analytical uncertainties and any uncertainty that is introduced with the calculation referred to here as mathematical bias some of sherwood lollar s most prominent contributions to the field include investigations into analytical uncertainty sherwood lollar et al 2007 hunkeler et al 2008 and mathematical bias mundle et al 2013 ojeda et al 2019 ojeda et al 2021 resulting in best practice recommendations to reliably interpret isotope data 5 1 1 analytical uncertainty total analytical uncertainty incorporates both accuracy how close a measured value is to the true value and reproducibility or precision which is the ability to obtain the same value for repeated sample or standard measurements over the entire linear range of the instrument sherwood lollar et al 2007 hunkeler et al 2008 the concentration below which accuracy and reproducibility are compromised beyond an acceptable limit depending on what the data is used for and the target compound is defined as the operational detection limit hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s work includes a detailed description of how to assess total analytical uncertainty within the linear range of an instrument for certain elements and provides a detailed analysis for δ13c csia sherwood lollar et al 2007 based on this analysis total analytical uncertainty incorporating both accuracy and reproducibility was estimated to be 0 5 for carbon sherwood lollar et al 2007 and 5 for hydrogen gray et al 2002 this approach has been adopted in best practice guidelines and the estimate of total uncertainty for carbon isotope analysis has been used as the basis for the criterion for carbon isotope fractionation δδ13c 2 to positively identify contaminant bio transformation in the field hunkeler et al 2008 this criterion has been used throughout the literature applying csia to contaminant hydrogeology enabling more accurate interpretations of csia data 5 1 2 mathematical bias mathematical bias refers to uncertainty that is introduced into the estimates of parameters as an artefact of calculations that propagate the analytical uncertainty mathematical bias is an important factor in using estimates of parameters calculated using isotope data to reliably interpret rates extents and relevant mechanisms of bio transformation yet mathematical bias has received less attention in the literature than analytical uncertainty sherwood lollar s research has identified areas where consensus is lacking in commonly calculated and reported parameters ε and λ for more reliable interpretation of isotope data this includes the critical finding that calculations of ε are highly sensitive to errors in fraction remaining f values obtained from contaminant concentrations with increasing errors when concentrations decrease mundle et al 2013 based on these results mundle et al 2013 recommended that ε values be calculated using data points varying from 100 to 20 of remaining compound but not at 20 a recommendation that has been adopted in the csia literature more recently dual isotope analysis where the isotopic fractionation of two elements within a molecule undergoing a single bio transformation process are plotted against each other to gain insight into the bio transformation mechanism described in more detail in section 6 has become standard practice in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology dual isotope plots typically produce linear relationships with a slope λ that can be used to interpret the relevant reaction mechanisms to avoid non linear behavior that arises when one element fractionates much more than the other höhener and imfeld 2021 recommend plotting the natural logarithm ln of each element in a dual isotope plot practitioners using dual isotope analysis have traditionally used ordinary least squares regression to calculate the slope in dual isotope plots however it is well reported in other disciplines such as marine biology laws and archie 1981 clinical chemistry linnet 1999 anthropology smith 2009 and within the geological sciences wehr and saleska 2017 that ordinary least squares introduces uncertainty mathematical bias when significant errors are present in the x and y variables sherwood lollar s work demonstrated that the york regression method york 1966 york 1969 york et al 2004 is a more appropriate regression method for dual isotope plots producing more accurate estimates of λ and its uncertainty for more reliable interpretations of bio transformation reaction mechanisms ojeda et al 2019 ojeda et al 2021 5 2 technology transfer for industry adoption since the earliest applications of csia in the late 1990s industry interest and adoption of the technique has grown requiring best practice recommendations for industry to be established and communicated to meet this need the iaea and u s environmental protection agency epa jointly funded and managed the development of a guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar was a lead author on this guide which includes best practices for using csia in contaminant hydrogeology including sampling calibration isotope standards and data interpretation sherwood lollar has also contributed to best practices on using csia for environmental forensics mancini et al 2017 where csia is used as a tool usually to provide evidence to distinguish between groundwater contaminant sources in litigation matters mancini et al 2017 discusses the principles of csia what csia can contribute to investigations and what its limitations are within a legal context federal rule of evidence 702 sherwood lollar has been a driving force in industry adoption of csia through contributions to best practices within the scientific literature and documents that bridge the gap between its technical and logistical aspects 6 using csia to examine reaction mechanisms and kinetics robust interpretations using the rayleigh model require accurate estimates of ε values for a given contaminant and reaction pathway including an understanding of what can cause variations in the ε values if bio transformation is indeed occurring it is also important to determine the relevant transformation pathway the overall sequence of reactions from substrate to product s to assess whether the bio transformation process is producing less harmful daughter products than the original parent molecule itself all of which are required to demonstrate remediation for example reductive dechlorination of tce can result in accumulation of vc which is more toxic than tce in these instances bio transformation of tce is occurring but it is not considered remediation as it is producing more harmful products if vc is not further degraded to non toxic ethene insight into bio transformation pathways can also have important implications for optimizing remediation in the field for instance if aerobic bio transformation is identified biosparging can be used to enhance it reddy et al 1995 but this would inhibit anaerobic bio transformation processes pathway identification using daughter products alone can be limited if compounds are present as primary contaminants as well as products of transformation reactions since the early 2000s csia has been applied to investigate bio transformation pathways and rate limiting elementary reaction steps within an overall pathway these studies provide insights into what can cause ε values and in dual isotope studies λ values to vary for the same bio transformation reaction this information can be used to determine the ε and λ values or range of values to use at field sites hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein the sherwood lollar laboratory has contributed substantially to the literature to provide reference ε and λ values for bio transformation reactions and to explain the primary controls on these parameters 6 1 variability in enrichment factors ε an enrichment factor ε for a single reaction can vary for two primary reasons differences in reaction mechanisms or differences in the kinetics of elementary steps within an overall reaction pathway an example simplified enzymatic reaction pathway comprised of multiple elementary steps is shown in scheme 1 the latter is referred to as a masking effect which occurs if a step preceding the transformation step in a net reaction pathway is rate limiting or partially rate limiting e g steps shaded in red in scheme 1 evaluating how the ε value changes for different bio transformation pathways and constraining the range of ε values for a single pathway accounting for masking effects is important for accurately interpreting csia data at a contaminated field site for sound interpretations of bio transformation using the rayleigh model the range of ε values for a given bio transformation reaction should be well constrained in the literature and f estimates should be calculated using the minimum value maximum value and average value within the range as per best practice recommendations hunkeler et al 2008 this approach relies on robust estimates of ε values and understanding their sources of variation and whether masking effects are known to arise for a given compound and bio transformation reaction research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory includes key insights into ε value variations due to different reaction mechanisms and their links to bio transformation pathways hirschorn et al 2007 elsner et al 2008 vanstone et al 2008 liang et al 2011 liang et al 2014 mundle et al 2017 and masking effects mancini et al 2006 sherwood lollar et al 2010 findings from these studies are directly relevant to applying csia to interpret bio transformation in the field for example hirschorn et al 2004 found distinct ranges of ε values for 1 2 dca biotransformation with one mean centered at 3 9 0 6 corresponding to enzymatic aerobic oxidation and the other centered at 29 2 1 9 corresponding to enzymatic aerobic hydrolytic dehalogenation the distinct ranges of ε values for aerobic biotransformation mean that careful consideration of geochemical and biological parameters e g microbes present and known biochemical pathways must be considered to select the most appropriate estimate of ε value to use in the field similarly research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has shown distinct carbon ε values for anaerobic vs aerobic biotransformation of 1 2 4 tcb and mcb liang et al 2011 different anaerobic pathways for dcb isomers liang et al 2014 and different anaerobic pathways for chlorinated alkane transformation by zero valent zinc vanstone et al 2008 and zero valent iron elsner et al 2008 masking effects can also cause variations in ε values for the same compound and bio transformation pathway for a given substrate and bio transformation pathway the potential for masking effects their impact on the ε value and any variables or conditions that can influence the presence of masking effects should be considered to calculate accurate estimates of extents and rates of bio transformation using the rayleigh equation sherwood lollar and her team investigated the presence of masking effects and their influence on observed ε values for anaerobic biotransformation of chlorinated ethanes sherwood lollar et al 2010 and aerobic biotransformation of toluene mancini et al 2006 furthermore mancini et al 2006 assessed how external conditions such as trace element limitation influenced the presence of masking effects variability in observed ε values for a substrate undergoing bio transformation can occur if multiple processes i e multiple reactions with different ε values are simultaneously affecting the same substrate as was observed for biotransformation of cis dce and 1 2 tca by the same enzyme cytochrome p450 mundle et al 2017 for substrates and conditions where simultaneous pathways occur all pathways must be considered and where possible the dominant pathway should be assessed e g with daughter product characterization microbial genomics proteomics to prevent limiting the effectiveness of csia as cautioned by mundle et al 2017 isotopic compositions of daughter products may also be used to interpret simultaneous pathways for simultaneous hydrogenolysis and dichloroelimination of chlorinated ethenes via abiotic transformation using iron nanoparticles the isotopic composition of the daughter products shows distinct isotopic discrimination correlated to each pathway elsner et al 2008 these studies from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory illustrate the value of using csia to identify the occurrence of simultaneous bio transformation pathways at field sites 6 2 multi element isotope analysis in the last twenty years multi element csia has rapidly developed to assess transformation pathways of organic contaminants it consists of generating dual isotope plots to calculate λ discussed in section 5 these dual isotope plots have two major applications first they help overcome factors that complicate csia interpretations such as masking effects as any masking present should affect both elements equally as long as the masking effect does not cause isotopic fractionation itself second they give valuable information for the given reaction and in some cases the bio transformation pathway dual isotope analysis can be used in the field by comparing to reference λ values from laboratory experiments to identify the relevant bio transformation pathways giving valuable insight into how contaminants are being transformed with implications to potentially optimize these reactions in the field e g air sparging for aerobic biotransformation along with others in the field e g hunkeler et al 2001 sherwood lollar s research team contributed some of the earliest studies combining csia data from two elements within the same molecule such as δ13c and δ2h in mtbe gray et al 2002 and benzene mancini et al 2003 to interpret biotransformation reaction mechanisms based on both carbon and hydrogen ε further work by sherwood lollar s team and others in the field later combined carbon and hydrogen csia data into a dual isotope plot including for aerobic toluene biotransformation mancini et al 2006 anaerobic benzene biotransformation mancini et al 2008 abiotic transformation of mtbe elsner et al 2007b and aerobic mtbe biotransformation mckelvie et al 2009 early dual isotope studies lead to the observation that λ values could be correlated to reaction mechanisms and pathways a crucial finding that catalyzed the evolution of csia in contaminant hydrogeology to where it is today later analytical developments in chlorine isotope analysis recently reviewed by zimmermann et al 2020 allowed for further dual isotope studies including δ13c and δ37cl within the same molecule a recent review from sherwood lollar and her team on the use utility and limitations of using multi element isotope analysis ojeda et al 2020 includes a compilation of literature λ values and known causes for variation in λ values these studies investigate reaction mechanisms and pathways involved in the biotransformation of chlorinated organic compounds phillips et al 2022 chen et al 2018 lihl et al 2019 lihl et al 2019 7 csia of the deep subsurface in addition to shallow subsurface systems affected by anthropogenic contaminants sherwood lollar s group has also extensively applied csia in novel ways to document and decipher the range and rates of biogeochemical processes at work in deeper groundwater systems in the crust a significant focus of sherwood lollar s research has concentrated on precambrian crystalline rock settings and has recently demonstrated this to be a hitherto undocumented yet significant reservoir containing as much as 30 of the planet s groundwater warr et al 2018 ferguson et al 2021 in this global groundwater reservoir the hidden hydrogeosphere sherwood lollar and international collaborators have applied isotopic analyses of noble gases to reveal that these groundwaters can reside over extended timescales globally ranging ka ga i e from thousands to billions of years e g heard et al 2018 holland et al 2013 lippmann pipke et al 2011 warr et al 2018 research from sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has demonstrated how combining csia compositional and modelling based approaches can identify and quantify low temperature geochemical and water rock abiotic reactions in these hydrogeologic reservoirs these reactions can significantly modify the isotopic and elemental composition of these groundwaters e g li et al 2016 warr et al 2021 and generate significant quantities of methane higher hydrocarbons hydrogen as well as helium and other potential economic and energy resources e g sherwood lollar et al 1993 2002 sherwood lollar et al 2008 lin et al 2005 warr et al 2019 warr et al 2022 this isotopic and elemental driven approach has also been applied by sherwood lollar and collaborators to investigate cryptic long term radiolytic and water rock driven bio geochemical cycling of electron acceptors and donors involving compounds of hydrogen carbon sulfur and nitrogen with the potential for sustaining a deep biosphere in isolation of the surface photosphere e g li et al 2021 lin et al 2006 lollar et al 2019 sheik et

processes operating therein continues to provide unique insights towards long term large scale biogeochemical cycles and novel habitability models on earth and analogue settings beyond nasem 2019

development of csia to contaminant hydrogeology across many aspects as summarized in fig 1 the seminal work by sherwood lollar and her team on establishing csia as a quantitative tool to investigate contaminant fate and transport section 2 has paved the path for its application at contaminated field sites for common groundwater contaminants section 3 following these steps the stable isotope community has been rapidly producing ε and λ values for various compounds and experimental conditions though much more data is needed to cover the range of priority groundwater pollutants ojeda et al 2020 this growing database of key isotope parameters is critical to better characterize contaminant sources calculate biotransformation rates and extents and identify reaction mechanisms at field sites sherwood lollar s efforts to share best practices for accurate analysis of lab derived isotope data and reliable interpretation of field derived isotope data section 5 have helped maintain high quality standards in the field of environmental isotope chemistry these efforts have been key to support wider adoption of this tool by industry bouchard et al 2018 mundle et al 2012 ottosen et al 2021 palau et al 2016 phillips et al 2020 more field case studies would certainly help support an even wider adoption of csia as one of the advanced tools used for monitoring natural and engineered

preconcentration methods mogusu et al 2015 bakkour et al 2018 melsbach et al 2019 torrentó et al 2019 csia is now being applied to an increasing number of larger less volatile and more polar compounds such as pesticides e g atrazine isoproturon hch s metolachlor corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and pharmaceuticals and personal care products e g triclosan ibuprofen elsner and imfeld 2016 and references therein csia is also being used to track surface water relevant processes such as phototransformation ratti et al 2015 passeport et al 2018 drouin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 and surface water biotransformation alvarez zaldívar et al 2018 droz et al 2021 with some of the first papers on csia application to elements other than carbon sherwood lollar s work contributed to the development of multi element csia see reviews by nijenhuis et al 2016 ojeda et al 2020 vogt et al 2016 which is now the standard to positively identify and characterize bio transformation processes in the field section 6 many priority pollutants include cl atoms at reactive positions these are usually in lower number than c or h atoms resulting in less isotope dilution and therefore more potential for cl csia to identify bio transformation analytical methods for cl csia are being developed with various instruments such as gc qms gc irms and gc icp ms zimmermann et al 2020 with such a rapidly growing field and in line with sherwood lollar s major efforts to maintain the production of high quality data we urge the community to be cautious in the standardization of cl csia data recently emphasized by lihl et al 2019 and in the estimation of fractionation factors one of the underlying assumptions in the rayleigh model is that the element considered here cl has a dominant isotope this allows the simplification of the equations where f is approximated by the isotopic ratio of the most abundant element mariotti et al 1981 which leads to the final simple rayleigh model eq 2 however with natural abundances of 75 8 for 35cl and 24 2 for 37cl this assumption may no longer be valid although this aspect of chlorine isotope analysis has been recognized and justified elsner and hunkeler 2008 it is important to note that this approximation is true only for conditions where the difference between measured isotope ratios r and r0 is small as recently reviewed by zimmermann et al 2020 models other than the simple rayleigh equation exist to estimate contaminant bio transformation from cl csia incorporating the complexities specific to cl isotopes and those must be used to keep producing quality and reliable isotope data we are at an exciting stage in the field of csia with many new areas of application to explore in part building on the early work described here including adopting recent analytical advances in position specific isotope analysis eiler et al 2017 cesar et al 2019 gilbert et al 2019 which build on early work from sherwood lollar and her team that was integral in showing the potential of position specific isotope analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy mckelvie et al 2010 further investigation to identify enzymatic mechanisms and their relationship to protein structure phillips et al 2022 evaluating pesticide transfer and bio transformation in agricultural watersheds reviewed by imfeld et al 2021 characterizing contaminant fate in soil plant systems liu et al 2020 and potentially distinguishing between sorption and biodegradation of taste and odour products in drinking water treatment plants yuan et al 2022 likewise recent csia application in deeper hydrogeologic settings continue to reveal much on the long term global bio geochemical processes shaping the history habitability and evolution of earth and beyond nasem 2019

2661,here we review the contributions of professor barbara sherwood lollar to compound specific isotope analysis csia in contaminant hydrogeology and environmental chemistry we first discuss the seminal work by professor sherwood lollar s lab on establishing csia as a quantitative tool for contaminant bio transformation at contaminated groundwater sites we describe the critical research by her lab in the development and validation of sample collection techniques single and multi element csia and isotope data evaluation for reliable interpretations we highlight the contributions of professor sherwood lollar s lab towards the development of best practices for the successful application of csia by industry to demonstrate the occurrence of bio transformation identify bio transformation mechanisms quantify the extent and rate of degradation and differentiate among potential contaminant sources we then explore professor sherwood lollar s applications of csia to hydrogeology of the deep subsurface and the fast widening of the field to new environments e g sediments contaminants e g chlorofluorocarbons pesticides and systems e g plant enzymes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction legacy contaminants in groundwater are contaminants with a long history of industrial use that have been regulated or banned due to findings on their adverse effects on human and or environmental health however these contaminants persist in the environment due to past improper storage handling or disposal practices this includes classes of contaminants such as chlorinated solvents which began to receive awareness in the 1970s tackling this problem not only requires strategies to remediate contaminated groundwater sites but reliable monitoring tools to make robust interpretations on the success of these strategies compound specific isotope analysis csia was developed as a result of this crucial need leading to its evolution to an established tool for monitoring the fate of legacy contaminants in groundwater today professor barbara sherwood lollar s research team has pioneered the approach of csia to investigate contaminant fate and the success of remediation strategies at field sites the research from sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has been crucial in establishing the principles of csia and its application for differentiating contaminant sources detecting the occurrence of degradation identifying the degradation mechanisms and quantifying degradation efficiency i e extents and rates in the subsurface in this review we refer to both biotic and abiotic contaminant transformation as bio transformation the path toward the development of csia began in the mid to late 1990s at that time there was great interest in the potential of the recently commercially available gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc irms systems to elucidate the behavior of organic contaminants in groundwater systems using δ13c analysis sessions 2006 however no publications had yet demonstrated that δ13c analysis of dissolved groundwater contaminants by gc irms could be achieved at concentrations relevant to field applications nor that such analysis would yield insights into the fate and transport of these compounds in this review we summarize the current state of csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology highlighting the contributions of sherwood lollar and her team and how they have shaped the field we conclude by summarizing how we can continue to build on the foundation sherwood lollar has established by identifying important future areas of research in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology 2 establishing csia as a potential quantitative tool for investigating contaminant fate and transport compound specific isotope analysis relies on the natural abundance of a light l and heavy h stable isotope of an element e in a compound which is represented by the isotope signature or delta value δhe 1 δ h e r sample r standard 1 where rsample and rstandard are the he le ratios in a sample and an international standard respectively δhe is commonly expressed in permil which is equivalent to milliurey mur or parts per thousand brand et al 2014 today csia is a widely accepted tool for in situ monitoring of natural and engineered attenuation of solvents and other organic contaminants in groundwater as illustrated by the epa publication a guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia that was co authored by sherwood lollar hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar recognized that the first requirement to achieve the application of csia to groundwater systems was to develop sampling and sample preparation approaches that were demonstrated to preserve the isotopic signature of the dissolved organics of interest her group publications demonstrated that pentane extraction dempster et al 1997 and headspace analysis slater et al 1999 conserved the δ13c signature of petroleum hydrocarbons such as toluene and chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce while achieving field relevant concentrations this laid the foundation for the broad application of csia to groundwater systems sherwood lollar recognized that the next critical requirement was to determine whether isotopic fractionation that is changes in the isotopic signature of a compound occurred during subsurface processes her group s initial papers demonstrated that there was negligible carbon isotopic fractionation of chlorinated solvents tce and toluene btex associated with dissolution dempster et al 1997 and volatilization slater et al 1999 slater et al 2000 followed this up demonstrating that the δ13c isotope signatures of tce and toluene were conserved during sorption these observations on non destructive processes have been borne out by numerous studies since except in the case of very low fraction remaining carbon isotope fractionation by these physical processes is negligible within analytical uncertainty in most cases hunkeler et al 2008 however exceptions have been emphasizing the need for careful evaluations for specific scenarios for example in the case of pure product evaporation in open systems inverse isotope fractionation i e enrichment of the heavy isotope in the vapour phase hinted at in slater et al 1999 can result in isotopic fractionation during open system evaporation from free product phases e g for chlorofluorocarbons due to vapor pressure effects horst et al 2016 concurrently with establishing that non destructive processes typically result in negligible isotope fractionation sherwood lollar et al 1999 was one of the handful of publications that initially demonstrated the most exciting potential of csia that transformation of organic solvent groundwater contaminants resulted in large carbon isotope fractionation of the residual contaminants a critical observation that has led to the ongoing application of csia in groundwater systems while some initial papers had used field and microcosm studies to demonstrate that stable isotope fractionation was associated with dechlorination of pce and its metabolites hunkeler et al 1999 and with biodegradation of hydrocarbons stehmeier et al 1999 sherwood lollar et al 1999 provided the first quantification in the literature of isotope fractionation effects involved in biotransformation of chlorinated ethenes e g tce and btex e g toluene using models from previous work involving nitrogen isotopes mariotti et al 1981 specifically sherwood lollar et al 1999 demonstrated that the anaerobic biodegradation of tce resulted in large isotope fractionations and further that these fractionations could be modelled using the rayleigh model the rayleigh model is a fractional distillation model that relates the fraction of remaining compound f to the isotopic ratio at any time t r and its initial value r0 via a constant fractionation factor α 2 r r 0 f α 1 the existence of a consistent fractionation factor α also sometimes expressed as an enrichment factor ε α 1 in indicated that the fractionation was characteristic of the bio transformation process indeed later research confirmed that the values of α and ε are related to the kinetic isotope effect kie defined as lk hk where α 1 kie e g elsner et al 2005 this was a truly exciting observation as it demonstrated that stable isotope fractionation not only could be used to identify the occurrence of contaminant in this case tce bio transformation independent of non degradative mechanisms of mass loss but also that there was a quantifiable relationship between the extent of isotope fractionation and the extent of bio transformation that had occurred using process specific α and ε resulting in the potential to use these parameters to distinguish different bio transformation processes this was a starting point in creating a database of α and ε values for various compounds and bio transformation reaction pathways to which the sherwood lollar group contributed e g aerobic and anaerobic biotransformation of toluene sherwood lollar et al 1999 ahad et al 2000 perchloroethylene pce slater et al 2001 tce slater et al 2001 cis dichloroethylene c dce slater et al 2001 vinyl chloride vc slater et al 2001 chartrand et al 2005 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca hirschorn et al 2004 hirschorn et al 2007 chloroform cf chan et al 2012 and mono di and tri chlorobenzenes mcb dcb and tcb liang et al 2011 2014 in some cases minimal 13c fractionation effects were observed such as during the aerobic biotransformation of toluene in sherwood lollar et al 1999 thus precluding the use of δ13c csia to identify bio transformation in this case however an important implication of this early work e g ahad et al 2000 sherwood lollar et al 1999 is that δ13c csia has the potential to be used with isotopically conservative processes for source differentiation the next step was to expand the isotope systems being investigated exploring elements other than carbon initially hydrogen δ2h demonstrated that other characteristic isotope effects may be occurring even when there was negligible carbon isotope fractionation for example anaerobic toluene biotransformation resulted in significant hydrogen isotope effects 5 analytical uncertainty which were otherwise small for carbon ahad et al 2000 ward et al 2000 these early developments of multi element csia demonstrated the potential to combine δ13c and δ2h csia to identify bio transformation of groundwater contaminants e g methyl tert butyl ether mtbe gray et al 2002 mckelvie et al 2009 and benzene mancini et al 2008 mancini et al 2003 and possibly distinguish between different reaction mechanisms mancini et al 2008 mckelvie et al 2009 facilitating the emergence of dual isotope analysis discussed in more detail in sections 5 and 6 beyond natural attenuation engineered attenuation e g via the introduction of reductants such as zero valent iron zvi was proven to be an effective means to drive reductive dechlorination of chlorinated solvents sherwood lollar s group showed that as was the case for biological transformation the extent of abiotic remediation can be monitored via csia applying the rayleigh model e g for tce dechlorination by zvi reaction slater et al 2002 vanstone et al 2004 and for 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1 1 2 2 teca and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca transformation by fe and cu fe metals elsner et al 2007 these laboratory studies by sherwood lollar and her group made foundational contributions to the establishment of key principles for the use of csia as a powerful tool to either identify contaminant sources or identify and quantify natural or engineered attenuation of groundwater contaminants 3 demonstrating the feasibility of applying csia to investigate bio transformation at contaminated sites one of the main advantages of csia in contaminant hydrogeology is its application to distinguish between non destructive e g sorption dilution dispersion and volatilization and bio transformation processes affecting contaminants at field sites without the need to identify bio transformation products this is because non destructive processes typically cause minimal isotope fractionation compared to bio transformation processes especially for carbon as discussed in section 2 sherwood lollar and her group were leaders in the demonstration of csia at field sites to investigate whether bio transformation is occurring and if at rates and extents such that contaminants will be sufficiently reduced to meet regulatory guidelines research from sherwood lollar and her team has applied csia to sites investigating a variety of remediation strategies detailed in table 1 including both natural processes e g by relying on the ability of intrinsic microbes to degrade contaminants intrinsic biotransformation and engineered processes e g by adding chemicals e g using zvi for abiotic transformation electron donors for biotransformation i e biostimulation or adding microbes to enhance biotransformation i e bioaugmentation early contributions also include developing criteria for the successful application of csia to demonstrate the occurrence of bio transformation in the field in sherwood lollar et al 1999 1 systematic changes in δhe values or fractionation must occur during bio transformation 2 the extent of fractionation must be greater than analytical uncertainty 3 under a given set of conditions isotope fractionation must be reproducible 4 the effects of isotope fractionation during a given bio transformation pathway must be readily discernable from isotopic effects associated with other subsurface processes of mass attenuation such as volatilization dissolution and sorption these criteria were adopted in the csia field guidance hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s research has demonstrated that these criteria are met for certain compounds and conditions but not for others for example fractionation was observed for anaerobic transformation of tce but not for aerobic bio transformation of toluene by sand from a contaminated aquifer sherwood lollar et al 1999 although further work showed aerobic toluene biotransformation can produce significant carbon isotope effects morasch et al 2002 vogt et al 2008 these early findings emphasized the importance of determining compound specific and condition specific enrichment factors shaping further research and application of csia to investigation of bio transformation at field sites 3 1 source differentiation the initial isotopic composition of a compound depends on two primary variables the isotopic composition of the source material e g petroleum feedstocks for chlorinated solvent production and any isotopic fractionation that occurs during production hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein thus variations in either of these two variables between manufacturers or production batches will be reflected by different initial isotopic signatures these variations can be used with csia to determine if multiple source zones of contaminants exist at a site successful application of csia for source differentiation benefits from knowledge of the isotopic compositions of various pure phase undegraded material to confirm the potential for source differentiation and establishing ranges of known pure phase values to compare to field data hunkeler et al 2008 professor sherwood lollar s laboratory has confirmed the potential for csia as a means for source differentiation in the field for priority contaminants including btex dempster et al 1997 hexachlorocyclohexane hch chartrand et al 2015 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs phillips et al 2020 and 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca chartrand et al 2007 furthermore carbon and hydrogen csia was used in conjunction with hydrogeology contaminant concentrations and site history to identify sources of benzene and chlorobenzene contamination at a complex field site mancini et al 2008 in this work homogenous δ13c and δ2h signatures of chlorobenzene indicated a single chlorobenzene source while variable isotope signatures of benzene that were inconsistent with the effects of biotransformation indicated two distinct benzene source areas mancini et al 2008 3 2 identifying and evaluating the extent of bio transformation the rayleigh equation is used to estimate the extent of contaminant bio transformation eq 2 mariotti et al 1981 the first step in assessing whether the rayleigh model is appropriate for the investigated field site is to plot a rayleigh correlation where contaminant isotope compositions are plotted against the natural logarithm of concentrations hunkeler et al 2008 if these data are well described by a linear relationship and vary in a manner consistent with bio transformation then the application of the rayleigh model is appropriate and contaminant bio transformation is a significant process controlling contaminant concentrations hunkeler et al 2008 variation consistent with bio transformation includes when concentrations decrease with isotopic compositions increasingly enriched in the heavy isotope i e normal isotope effect or enriched in the light isotope i e inverse isotope effect observed in rare cases e g heckel et al 2019 a poor correlation to the rayleigh model may indicate strong influence of physical processes on concentration however this does not automatically disqualify a site for applying csia to understand contaminant bio transformation hunkeler et al 2008 despite the multiplicity of both chemical e g bio transformation and physical processes non destructive e g volatilization sorption dispersion etc affecting contaminant concentrations in the subsurface sherwood lollar s team verified early on that the rayleigh model was appropriate at various sites sherwood lollar et al 2001 chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2005 vanstone et al 2005 demonstrating the validity of this approach csia can also indicate when intrinsic bio transformation is not occurring which can be particularly valuable when potential daughter products of bio transformation are present as primary contaminants mckelvie et al 2007a an early warning that intrinsic bio transformation is not occurring e g morrill et al 2005 mckelvie et al 2007a is critical in contaminant remediation planning and can contribute to substantial cost and time savings in scenarios with evidence that bio transformation is occurring the extent of bio transformation can be estimated using the rayleigh model for this enrichment factor s ε must be known for the most likely transformation process es acting on the contaminant of interest eq 3 i e the linearized form of the rayleigh equation can then be applied to calculate the fraction of original contaminant remaining f 3 ln δ h e 1 δ h e o 1 ε ln f where δhe is the isotopic composition of element e at a given location and δheo is the isotopic composition of the contaminant in the source zone which can be estimated using source values from the literature using the most negative value at the site or from a source well alternative approaches are described in hunkeler et al 2008 the extent of bio transformation eot can then be calculated using eq 4 4 eot 1 f this approach allows practitioners to estimate whether contaminant bio transformation is occurring at sufficient levels to bring contaminant concentrations within regulatory limits sherwood lollar s research has successfully demonstrated this approach to estimate the extent of intrinsic biotransformation sherwood lollar et al 2001 morrill et al 2009 gilevska et al 2019 phillips et al 2020 and to evaluate the success of biostimulation hirschorn et al 2007 mckelvie et al 2007b and bioaugmentation chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2005 3 3 calculating rates a powerful application of csia is to estimate contaminant bio transformation rates bio transformation rates are key parameters needed for design of remediation approaches however accurate rates are often difficult to determine using conventional data collection i e composition only as contaminant concentrations are affected by a variety of processes as discussed previously csia provides a unique advantage in calculating bio transformation specific rates first order rate constants λ bio transformation can be approximated according to eq 5 5 λ b i o t r a n s f o r m a t i o n δ δ h e ε t where t is the average travel time calculated between two sampling ports 1 and 2 with a difference in measured contaminant isotopic signatures δδhe hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s research has demonstrated the utility of using csia to estimate field derived first order rate constants for compounds such as cis dce morrill et al 2005 mtbe mckelvie mackay et al 2007 chlorinated benzenes and benzene gilevska et al 2019 importantly all isotopically derived rate constant estimates from morrill et al 2005 and gilevska et al 2019 agreed with concentration derived estimates within an order of magnitude however estimates calculated using isotope data are typically lower than those calculated solely using decreases in concentrations along a flow path this is because concentration decreases can result from various non destructive processes e g diffusion dispersion adsorption volatilization as well as bio transformation while isotope data provide more conservative estimates that reflect bio transformation rates only highlighting the utility of csia to calculate more accurate bio transformation rates sherwood lollar proposed to apply the concept of representative elementary volume rev zones for the calculation of bio transformation rates at the field scale gilevska et al 2019 the rev is the volume of sampling and measurement at which there is no change in the average value for a given parameter averaged over the entire rev this concept has been applied in hydrogeology to parameters such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity freeze and cherry 1979 in sediments the rates of chemical and biological reactions can vary on very small scales due to variations in microbial communities and the presence of nutrients and electron donors gilevska et al 2019 and references therein gilevska et al 2019 calculated rate constants using csia data in sediments within different depth profiles the authors used statistical evaluation of csia data to differentiate between rev zones with different rate constants of bio transformation in sediment profiles this approach demonstrated the presence of critical zones with maximum biotransformation rates in sediment profiles responsible for sediment detoxification 3 4 combining csia with numerical modelling as discussed in previous sections csia provides an advantage over concentration data alone in investigating biotransformation studies however as noted previously assessing whether bio transformation is a main process controlling contaminant concentrations must first be assessed using a rayleigh correlation even if non destructive processes are occurring isotope data can still be useful for estimating bio transformation rates and extents provided these non destructive processes are isotopically conservative however under complex field conditions applications of the rayleigh model as discussed so far may not be possible due to the occurrence of multiple non destructive and bio transformation processes contributing to the overall isotope change such as the case of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl dissolution hunkeler et al 2004 chartrand et al 2005 morrill et al 2009 volatilization thullner et al 2012 and sorption wanner et al 2017 halloran et al 2021 these situations require more process descriptive methods for interpreting csia data sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has developed and applied nuanced mathematical models for understanding how non destructive but isotopically sensitive processes affect csia data interpretation in complex field conditions for example xu et al 2016 2017 demonstrated that under certain spatial and temporal field sampling schemes diffusion related carbon isotope fractionation is often negligible providing guides for sampling design when using csia to evaluate bio transformation morrill et al 2009 presented an analytical model to understand how dnapl dissolution overprints the signature of bio transformation and demonstrated its implications for csia interpretation another limitation of the rayleigh model is that when interpreting csia data in a bio transformation chain when one or more contaminants are simultaneously produced and transformed the rate constants for these processes need to be known morrill et al 2006 höhener and atteia 2014 morrill et al 2006 proposed an improved method to estimate ε for intermediate compounds in a bio transformation chain more recent work from the sherwood lollar laboratory couples modeling with csia to focus on combining field collected concentration and csia data for investigating the fate and transport of mcb and benzene in contaminated sediments gilevska et al 2019 4 sample collection preservation and analysis for csia an essential step in csia is the development of sample collection preservation preparation and analysis protocols that preserve the original isotope signatures of the target compounds research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has led the path to the application of csia to unexplored environments for this technique such as contaminated sediments this research showed that passive equilibrium pore water samplers i e peepers are compatible with csia passeport et al 2014 and can be used to identify bio transformation of benzene and chlorinated benzenes passeport et al 2016 and even estimate rates of natural attenuation gilevska et al 2019 in experimental studies sherwood lollar and her team recognized the potential for increased uncertainty in calculating ε using traditional methods headspace analysis for both composition and isotope ratios for reactions where pressure increases occur over the course of a reaction due to daughter product formation in response to this a method was developed to monitor the extent of a reaction based on increases in headspace pressure due to the production of co2 in a decarboxylation reaction to calculate more accurate estimates of ε using the rayleigh model in reactions with non isobaric pressure in closed systems mundle et al 2013 using the technique proposed by mundle et al 2013 ε values can be calculated with higher correlation coefficients and lower confidence intervals for laboratory experiments with non isobaric pressure applications of csia to contaminated sites first focused on volatile organic compounds including btex chlorinated ethenes and chlorinated ethanes by letting such compounds equilibrate between the liquid and gaseous phases of a closed sample vial according to their henry s constants sufficient amounts of the compound relative to analytical detection limits can be found in the gas phase with negligible differences in stable carbon isotope composition between the liquid and vapour phases slater et al 1999 this has provided a clean i e minimal sample matrix and easy way to inject volatile compounds into a gc irms for csia even for multi contaminant sample mixtures and complex matrices lower detection limits can be obtained through simple sample freezing elsner et al 2006 and by further optimizing headspace extraction e g in the dynamic headspace method in which a larger portion of the headspace volume was collected and cryogenically trapped before thermal desorption in the gc irms morrill et al 2004 solvent extraction methods from single step liquid liquid extraction dempster et al 1997 to multiple step procedures chartrand et al 2015 were developed and carefully validated for specific compounds e g btex and for semi volatile organic compounds such as hchs to confirm that method induced isotope fractionation for δ13c csia was less than analytical uncertainty i e 0 5 novel methods were later developed for new classes of compounds exhibiting their own analytical challenges for example the broad gc peaks observed for cfc 11 and cfc 113 in traditional purge and trap extraction prevented δ13c csia at field relevant concentrations of these two chlorofluorocarbons this challenge was overcome using an isotopically conservative peak cutting and cryo refocusing approach that allowed δ13c csia of dissolved cfcs down to 190 cfc 11 and 270 µg l cfc 113 horst et al 2015 the new δ13c csia method was applied at a contaminated groundwater site and provided evidence for in situ biotransformation of cfc 11 and the lack of natural attenuation but the presence of multiple source zones for cfc 113 phillips et al 2020 sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has contributed to the development of δ2h csia for chlorinated hydrocarbons at typical field concentrations showing that a liquid n2 trap can efficiently remove undesirable hcl and result in reproducible and accurate δ2h measurements of 1 2 dichloroethane chartrand et al 2007 sherwood lollar and her team and colleagues at the helmholtz ufz later established criteria for chromium reactors for δ2h measurements of chlorinated volatile organic compounds vocs gilevska et al 2020 specifically gilevska et al 2020 demonstrated that the cr particle size range cr reactor position vertical vs horizontal oven temperature and cr packing length can influence the trapping efficiency of undesirable hcl by products during the conversion of chlorinated vocs this method was applied successfully to contaminated sediment porewaters where δ13c chlorine δ37cl and δ2h csia together identified the dominant pathways affecting the fate of chlorobenzene and benzene gilevska et al 2021 these analytical advances contributed to the widespread application of multi element csia to chlorinated compounds which is now a mainstream technique helping to constrain source zones and contaminant bio transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms 5 establishing best practices for adoption of csia in hydrogeology community consensus on best practices is a central tenet in stable isotope geochemistry e g brand and coplen 2001 brand and coplen 2012 hunkeler et al 2008 isotope ratios of international standards are established distributed and regulated by the international atomic energy agency iaea in vienna austria as a result all isotope laboratories are calibrated to the same set of international standards allowing for a direct comparison of the results from any isotope laboratory worldwide accordingly within the stable isotope community there is a strong emphasis on collaborative efforts to establish best practices within the discipline including instrument calibration estimating total uncertainties and calculations to interpret stable isotope data work from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has set a standard for adopting best practices in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology and produced significant contributions to establish best practices in the field 5 1 assessing total uncertainty in contaminant hydrogeology isotope data can be used to identify if bio transformation of a contaminant is occurring however variations in isotope signatures can be small relative to the analytical uncertainty of isotope ratio mass spectrometers thus variations in isotope signatures must be considered in the context of well constrained estimates of analytical uncertainty that span the entire range of instrumental parameters above detection limits notably the uncertainty should be assessed for the compound analyzed and the sample introduction technique e g purge trap to incorporate all uncertainty for the process e g kuder and philp 2013 isotope data is then used to calculate parameters such as ε applied to estimate rates and extents of bio transformation and λ applied to identify relevant bio transformation mechanisms at field sites parameters ε and λ are discussed in more detail in sections 2 and 6 respectively however uncertainty estimates for ε and λ must also be carefully considered including how to incorporate analytical uncertainties and any uncertainty that is introduced with the calculation referred to here as mathematical bias some of sherwood lollar s most prominent contributions to the field include investigations into analytical uncertainty sherwood lollar et al 2007 hunkeler et al 2008 and mathematical bias mundle et al 2013 ojeda et al 2019 ojeda et al 2021 resulting in best practice recommendations to reliably interpret isotope data 5 1 1 analytical uncertainty total analytical uncertainty incorporates both accuracy how close a measured value is to the true value and reproducibility or precision which is the ability to obtain the same value for repeated sample or standard measurements over the entire linear range of the instrument sherwood lollar et al 2007 hunkeler et al 2008 the concentration below which accuracy and reproducibility are compromised beyond an acceptable limit depending on what the data is used for and the target compound is defined as the operational detection limit hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar s work includes a detailed description of how to assess total analytical uncertainty within the linear range of an instrument for certain elements and provides a detailed analysis for δ13c csia sherwood lollar et al 2007 based on this analysis total analytical uncertainty incorporating both accuracy and reproducibility was estimated to be 0 5 for carbon sherwood lollar et al 2007 and 5 for hydrogen gray et al 2002 this approach has been adopted in best practice guidelines and the estimate of total uncertainty for carbon isotope analysis has been used as the basis for the criterion for carbon isotope fractionation δδ13c 2 to positively identify contaminant bio transformation in the field hunkeler et al 2008 this criterion has been used throughout the literature applying csia to contaminant hydrogeology enabling more accurate interpretations of csia data 5 1 2 mathematical bias mathematical bias refers to uncertainty that is introduced into the estimates of parameters as an artefact of calculations that propagate the analytical uncertainty mathematical bias is an important factor in using estimates of parameters calculated using isotope data to reliably interpret rates extents and relevant mechanisms of bio transformation yet mathematical bias has received less attention in the literature than analytical uncertainty sherwood lollar s research has identified areas where consensus is lacking in commonly calculated and reported parameters ε and λ for more reliable interpretation of isotope data this includes the critical finding that calculations of ε are highly sensitive to errors in fraction remaining f values obtained from contaminant concentrations with increasing errors when concentrations decrease mundle et al 2013 based on these results mundle et al 2013 recommended that ε values be calculated using data points varying from 100 to 20 of remaining compound but not at 20 a recommendation that has been adopted in the csia literature more recently dual isotope analysis where the isotopic fractionation of two elements within a molecule undergoing a single bio transformation process are plotted against each other to gain insight into the bio transformation mechanism described in more detail in section 6 has become standard practice in csia applied to contaminant hydrogeology dual isotope plots typically produce linear relationships with a slope λ that can be used to interpret the relevant reaction mechanisms to avoid non linear behavior that arises when one element fractionates much more than the other höhener and imfeld 2021 recommend plotting the natural logarithm ln of each element in a dual isotope plot practitioners using dual isotope analysis have traditionally used ordinary least squares regression to calculate the slope in dual isotope plots however it is well reported in other disciplines such as marine biology laws and archie 1981 clinical chemistry linnet 1999 anthropology smith 2009 and within the geological sciences wehr and saleska 2017 that ordinary least squares introduces uncertainty mathematical bias when significant errors are present in the x and y variables sherwood lollar s work demonstrated that the york regression method york 1966 york 1969 york et al 2004 is a more appropriate regression method for dual isotope plots producing more accurate estimates of λ and its uncertainty for more reliable interpretations of bio transformation reaction mechanisms ojeda et al 2019 ojeda et al 2021 5 2 technology transfer for industry adoption since the earliest applications of csia in the late 1990s industry interest and adoption of the technique has grown requiring best practice recommendations for industry to be established and communicated to meet this need the iaea and u s environmental protection agency epa jointly funded and managed the development of a guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar was a lead author on this guide which includes best practices for using csia in contaminant hydrogeology including sampling calibration isotope standards and data interpretation sherwood lollar has also contributed to best practices on using csia for environmental forensics mancini et al 2017 where csia is used as a tool usually to provide evidence to distinguish between groundwater contaminant sources in litigation matters mancini et al 2017 discusses the principles of csia what csia can contribute to investigations and what its limitations are within a legal context federal rule of evidence 702 sherwood lollar has been a driving force in industry adoption of csia through contributions to best practices within the scientific literature and documents that bridge the gap between its technical and logistical aspects 6 using csia to examine reaction mechanisms and kinetics robust interpretations using the rayleigh model require accurate estimates of ε values for a given contaminant and reaction pathway including an understanding of what can cause variations in the ε values if bio transformation is indeed occurring it is also important to determine the relevant transformation pathway the overall sequence of reactions from substrate to product s to assess whether the bio transformation process is producing less harmful daughter products than the original parent molecule itself all of which are required to demonstrate remediation for example reductive dechlorination of tce can result in accumulation of vc which is more toxic than tce in these instances bio transformation of tce is occurring but it is not considered remediation as it is producing more harmful products if vc is not further degraded to non toxic ethene insight into bio transformation pathways can also have important implications for optimizing remediation in the field for instance if aerobic bio transformation is identified biosparging can be used to enhance it reddy et al 1995 but this would inhibit anaerobic bio transformation processes pathway identification using daughter products alone can be limited if compounds are present as primary contaminants as well as products of transformation reactions since the early 2000s csia has been applied to investigate bio transformation pathways and rate limiting elementary reaction steps within an overall pathway these studies provide insights into what can cause ε values and in dual isotope studies λ values to vary for the same bio transformation reaction this information can be used to determine the ε and λ values or range of values to use at field sites hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein the sherwood lollar laboratory has contributed substantially to the literature to provide reference ε and λ values for bio transformation reactions and to explain the primary controls on these parameters 6 1 variability in enrichment factors ε an enrichment factor ε for a single reaction can vary for two primary reasons differences in reaction mechanisms or differences in the kinetics of elementary steps within an overall reaction pathway an example simplified enzymatic reaction pathway comprised of multiple elementary steps is shown in scheme 1 the latter is referred to as a masking effect which occurs if a step preceding the transformation step in a net reaction pathway is rate limiting or partially rate limiting e g steps shaded in red in scheme 1 evaluating how the ε value changes for different bio transformation pathways and constraining the range of ε values for a single pathway accounting for masking effects is important for accurately interpreting csia data at a contaminated field site for sound interpretations of bio transformation using the rayleigh model the range of ε values for a given bio transformation reaction should be well constrained in the literature and f estimates should be calculated using the minimum value maximum value and average value within the range as per best practice recommendations hunkeler et al 2008 this approach relies on robust estimates of ε values and understanding their sources of variation and whether masking effects are known to arise for a given compound and bio transformation reaction research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory includes key insights into ε value variations due to different reaction mechanisms and their links to bio transformation pathways hirschorn et al 2007 elsner et al 2008 vanstone et al 2008 liang et al 2011 liang et al 2014 mundle et al 2017 and masking effects mancini et al 2006 sherwood lollar et al 2010 findings from these studies are directly relevant to applying csia to interpret bio transformation in the field for example hirschorn et al 2004 found distinct ranges of ε values for 1 2 dca biotransformation with one mean centered at 3 9 0 6 corresponding to enzymatic aerobic oxidation and the other centered at 29 2 1 9 corresponding to enzymatic aerobic hydrolytic dehalogenation the distinct ranges of ε values for aerobic biotransformation mean that careful consideration of geochemical and biological parameters e g microbes present and known biochemical pathways must be considered to select the most appropriate estimate of ε value to use in the field similarly research from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has shown distinct carbon ε values for anaerobic vs aerobic biotransformation of 1 2 4 tcb and mcb liang et al 2011 different anaerobic pathways for dcb isomers liang et al 2014 and different anaerobic pathways for chlorinated alkane transformation by zero valent zinc vanstone et al 2008 and zero valent iron elsner et al 2008 masking effects can also cause variations in ε values for the same compound and bio transformation pathway for a given substrate and bio transformation pathway the potential for masking effects their impact on the ε value and any variables or conditions that can influence the presence of masking effects should be considered to calculate accurate estimates of extents and rates of bio transformation using the rayleigh equation sherwood lollar and her team investigated the presence of masking effects and their influence on observed ε values for anaerobic biotransformation of chlorinated ethanes sherwood lollar et al 2010 and aerobic biotransformation of toluene mancini et al 2006 furthermore mancini et al 2006 assessed how external conditions such as trace element limitation influenced the presence of masking effects variability in observed ε values for a substrate undergoing bio transformation can occur if multiple processes i e multiple reactions with different ε values are simultaneously affecting the same substrate as was observed for biotransformation of cis dce and 1 2 tca by the same enzyme cytochrome p450 mundle et al 2017 for substrates and conditions where simultaneous pathways occur all pathways must be considered and where possible the dominant pathway should be assessed e g with daughter product characterization microbial genomics proteomics to prevent limiting the effectiveness of csia as cautioned by mundle et al 2017 isotopic compositions of daughter products may also be used to interpret simultaneous pathways for simultaneous hydrogenolysis and dichloroelimination of chlorinated ethenes via abiotic transformation using iron nanoparticles the isotopic composition of the daughter products shows distinct isotopic discrimination correlated to each pathway elsner et al 2008 these studies from the sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory illustrate the value of using csia to identify the occurrence of simultaneous bio transformation pathways at field sites 6 2 multi element isotope analysis in the last twenty years multi element csia has rapidly developed to assess transformation pathways of organic contaminants it consists of generating dual isotope plots to calculate λ discussed in section 5 these dual isotope plots have two major applications first they help overcome factors that complicate csia interpretations such as masking effects as any masking present should affect both elements equally as long as the masking effect does not cause isotopic fractionation itself second they give valuable information for the given reaction and in some cases the bio transformation pathway dual isotope analysis can be used in the field by comparing to reference λ values from laboratory experiments to identify the relevant bio transformation pathways giving valuable insight into how contaminants are being transformed with implications to potentially optimize these reactions in the field e g air sparging for aerobic biotransformation along with others in the field e g hunkeler et al 2001 sherwood lollar s research team contributed some of the earliest studies combining csia data from two elements within the same molecule such as δ13c and δ2h in mtbe gray et al 2002 and benzene mancini et al 2003 to interpret biotransformation reaction mechanisms based on both carbon and hydrogen ε further work by sherwood lollar s team and others in the field later combined carbon and hydrogen csia data into a dual isotope plot including for aerobic toluene biotransformation mancini et al 2006 anaerobic benzene biotransformation mancini et al 2008 abiotic transformation of mtbe elsner et al 2007b and aerobic mtbe biotransformation mckelvie et al 2009 early dual isotope studies lead to the observation that λ values could be correlated to reaction mechanisms and pathways a crucial finding that catalyzed the evolution of csia in contaminant hydrogeology to where it is today later analytical developments in chlorine isotope analysis recently reviewed by zimmermann et al 2020 allowed for further dual isotope studies including δ13c and δ37cl within the same molecule a recent review from sherwood lollar and her team on the use utility and limitations of using multi element isotope analysis ojeda et al 2020 includes a compilation of literature λ values and known causes for variation in λ values these studies investigate reaction mechanisms and pathways involved in the biotransformation of chlorinated organic compounds phillips et al 2022 chen et al 2018 lihl et al 2019 lihl et al 2019 7 csia of the deep subsurface in addition to shallow subsurface systems affected by anthropogenic contaminants sherwood lollar s group has also extensively applied csia in novel ways to document and decipher the range and rates of biogeochemical processes at work in deeper groundwater systems in the crust a significant focus of sherwood lollar s research has concentrated on precambrian crystalline rock settings and has recently demonstrated this to be a hitherto undocumented yet significant reservoir containing as much as 30 of the planet s groundwater warr et al 2018 ferguson et al 2021 in this global groundwater reservoir the hidden hydrogeosphere sherwood lollar and international collaborators have applied isotopic analyses of noble gases to reveal that these groundwaters can reside over extended timescales globally ranging ka ga i e from thousands to billions of years e g heard et al 2018 holland et al 2013 lippmann pipke et al 2011 warr et al 2018 research from sherwood lollar s stable isotope laboratory has demonstrated how combining csia compositional and modelling based approaches can identify and quantify low temperature geochemical and water rock abiotic reactions in these hydrogeologic reservoirs these reactions can significantly modify the isotopic and elemental composition of these groundwaters e g li et al 2016 warr et al 2021 and generate significant quantities of methane higher hydrocarbons hydrogen as well as helium and other potential economic and energy resources e g sherwood lollar et al 1993 2002 sherwood lollar et al 2008 lin et al 2005 warr et al 2019 warr et al 2022 this isotopic and elemental driven approach has also been applied by sherwood lollar and collaborators to investigate cryptic long term radiolytic and water rock driven bio geochemical cycling of electron acceptors and donors involving compounds of hydrogen carbon sulfur and nitrogen with the potential for sustaining a deep biosphere in isolation of the surface photosphere e g li et al 2021 lin et al 2006 lollar et al 2019 sheik et

processes operating therein continues to provide unique insights towards long term large scale biogeochemical cycles and novel habitability models on earth and analogue settings beyond nasem 2019 onstott et al 2006 sherwood lollar et al 2007 smith et al 2021 tarnas et al 2021 tarnas et al 2018 8 looking ahead research from professor sherwood lollar and her team has contributed to the development of csia to contaminant hydrogeology across many aspects as summarized in fig 1 the seminal work by sherwood lollar and her team on establishing csia as a quantitative tool to investigate contaminant fate and transport section 2 has paved the path for its application at contaminated field sites for common groundwater contaminants section 3 following these steps the stable isotope community has been rapidly producing ε and λ values for various compounds and experimental conditions though much more data is needed to cover the range of priority groundwater pollutants ojeda et al 2020 this growing database of key isotope parameters is critical to better characterize contaminant sources calculate biotransformation rates and extents and identify reaction mechanisms at field sites sherwood lollar s efforts to share best practices for accurate analysis of lab derived isotope data and reliable interpretation of field derived isotope data section 5 have helped maintain high quality standards in the field of environmental isotope chemistry these efforts have been key to support wider adoption of this tool by industry bouchard et al 2018 mundle et al 2012 ottosen et al 2021 palau et al 2016 phillips et al 2020 more field case studies would certainly help support an even wider adoption of csia as one of the advanced tools used for monitoring natural and engineered

preconcentration methods mogusu et al 2015 bakkour et al 2018 melsbach et al 2019 torrentó et al 2019 csia is now being applied to an increasing number of larger less volatile and more polar compounds such as pesticides e g atrazine isoproturon hch s metolachlor corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and pharmaceuticals and personal care products e g triclosan ibuprofen elsner and imfeld 2016 and references therein csia is also being used to track surface water relevant processes such as phototransformation ratti et al 2015 passeport et al 2018 drouin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 and surface water biotransformation alvarez zaldívar et al 2018 droz et al 2021 with some of the first papers on csia application to elements other than carbon sherwood lollar s work contributed to the development of multi element csia see reviews by nijenhuis et al 2016 ojeda et al 2020 vogt et al 2016 which is now the standard to positively identify and characterize bio transformation processes in the field section 6 many priority pollutants include cl atoms at reactive positions these are usually in lower number than c or h atoms resulting in less isotope dilution and therefore more potential for cl csia to identify bio transformation analytical methods for cl csia are being developed with various instruments such as gc qms gc irms and gc icp ms zimmermann et al 2020 with such a rapidly growing field and in line with sherwood lollar s major efforts to maintain the production of high quality data we urge the community to be cautious in the standardization of cl csia data recently emphasized by lihl et al 2019 and in the estimation of fractionation factors one of the underlying assumptions in the rayleigh model is that the element considered here cl has a dominant isotope this allows the simplification of the equations where f is approximated by the isotopic ratio of the most abundant element mariotti et al 1981 which leads to the final simple rayleigh model eq 2 however with natural abundances of 75 8 for 35cl and 24 2 for 37cl this assumption may no longer be valid although this aspect of chlorine isotope analysis has been recognized and justified elsner and hunkeler 2008 it is important to note that this approximation is true only for conditions where the difference between measured isotope ratios r and r0 is small as recently reviewed by zimmermann et al 2020 models other than the simple rayleigh equation exist to estimate contaminant bio transformation from cl csia incorporating the complexities specific to cl isotopes and those must be used to keep producing quality and reliable isotope data we are at an exciting stage in the field of csia with many new areas of application to explore in part building on the early work described here including adopting recent analytical advances in position specific isotope analysis eiler et al 2017 cesar et al 2019 gilbert et al 2019 which build on early work from sherwood lollar and her team that was integral in showing the potential of position specific isotope analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy mckelvie et al 2010 further investigation to identify enzymatic mechanisms and their relationship to protein structure phillips et al 2022 evaluating pesticide transfer and bio transformation in agricultural watersheds reviewed by imfeld et al 2021 characterizing contaminant fate in soil plant systems liu et al 2020 and potentially distinguishing between sorption and biodegradation of taste and odour products in drinking water treatment plants yuan et al 2022 likewise recent csia application in deeper hydrogeologic settings continue to reveal much on the long term global bio geochemical processes shaping the history habitability and evolution of earth and beyond nasem 2019

2662,each year structures installed in rivers and valleys e g bank protections bridges and sabo dams are damaged by debris flows therefore it is necessary to predict the flow characteristics of debris flows accurately to design river and valley structures that are robust against such debris flows in recent years several two dimensional models have been developed to simulate debris flow however the basic equations in the numerical simulation models are in the cartesian coordinate system and the shape of each numerical analysis grid is square or rectangular it is impossible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley structures such as bank protections and sabo dams when employing square or rectangular grids this makes it difficult to calculate the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures in this study the basic equations of debris flow are provided in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow designed using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys is developed numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley are conducted using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two results is discussed further numerical simulations of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 are performed using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed the numerical simulation results of debris flow in a periodical meandering channel suggest a slow propagation of debris flow when equations in the cartesian coordinate system are used this is attributed to the rough boundaries of debris flow when a square grid is used which causes numerical energy dissipation that does not exist physically the inundation areas and land surface deformation of debris flow in kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow in kinryu river basin was stopped in the upstream mild slope area while the second flowed into the residential area reproducing the flow depth velocity and discharge could be improved by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system as compared with those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system when the cartesian coordinate system was used the volume of the debris flow was evaluated to be small and the travel distance of the debris flow was evaluated to be short thus the debris flow does not arrive at the residential area and the risk of debris flows is underestimated keywords debris flow river regulation work numerical simulation generalized curvilinear coordinate system river engineering data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction each year debris flows damage structures installed in rivers and valleys such as bank protections bridges and sabo dams because debris flow is transported in steep river channels at high speed another factor that increases the damage to river structures is the deep flow depth which is caused by the increase in the discharge with the erosion of the riverbed thus it is important to predict the flow characteristics of debris flows accurately considering the development process of debris flows for designing river and valley structures robust against debris flows the estimation of external forces acting on structures is essential in the design of structures therefore for the design of structures in debris flow valleys the first and most important step is to improve the estimation of external forces acting on structures it is essential to reproduce debris flow phenomena via numerical simulation to understand the flow characteristics of debris flows in detail in recent years several models have been developed to simulate debris flow luna et al 2012 wang et al 2016 suzuki et al 2019 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 han et al 2015 kelfoun and druitt 2005 for example luna et al 2012 developed a one dimensional model of debris flow this model can reproduce the transportation and deposition processes of a debris flow in a short computational time however it is difficult to evaluate sediment production due to bank erosion and the discharge is underestimated in addition it is difficult to estimate the horizontal shape of the inundation area on the alluvial fan because it is affected by the horizontal land geometry certain models use particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics wang et al 2016 and moving particle semi implicit suzuki et al 2019 three dimensional flow can be reproduced using these models when the information on the volume of debris flow is obtained through field surveys the models can output a considerable amount of information for evaluating the safety of the river and valley regulation works however it is difficult for particle methods to reproduce the development process of debris flow since the number of particles increases significantly thus it is difficult for particle methods to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in the volume of debris flow the entrainment of sediment and water from the bed can be neglected when the unstable sediment cover on the base rock is thin and the land slope is mild pastor et al 2002 pirulli and marco 2010 vagnon et al 2019 however the spatiotemporal change in entrainment should be considered when the unstable sediment cover on the base rock is thick and the land slope is steep further a particle method requires a longer computational time compared to one and two dimensional models a two dimensional model can reproduce the fluid force along the outer bank of curvature and the force is important information for evaluating the safety of bank protection egashira and itoh 2004 kelfoun and druitt 2005 wang et al 2008 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 pirulli and pastor 2012 han et al 2015 vagnon et al 2019 takebayashi and fujita 2020 sediment production due to bank erosions can be reproduced and the spatial change of discharge can be estimated better egashira and itoh 2004 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 pirulli and pastor 2012 han

than the bed resistance is the erosion depth many bed erosion rate equations have been proposed accordingly takahashi 1978 egashira and itoh 2004 mcdougall and hungr 2005 wang et al 2008 christen et al 2010 wu et al 2013 han et al 2015 takebayashi and fujita 2020 a two dimensional model can also reproduce the horizontal shape of the inundation area on the alluvial fan further the computational time is shorter than that of the particle methods however the basic equations in the two dimensional numerical simulation models of debris flows described above are in the cartesian coordinate system and the shape of each numerical analysis grid is square or rectangular although the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system are simple and easy to use the horizontal shape of a debris flow valley is not straight it is usually meandered or curved therefore it is impossible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley when using square or rectangular grids which makes it difficult to calculate the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures hosoda et al 2001 and takebayashi 2017 developed two dimensional bed deformation analyses of bed material load in which the basic equations are written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system those studies did not compare the results of calculations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system with those in the cartesian coordinate system however as shown in fig 1 it is considered that basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system can reduce numerical energy dissipation at the side edge of the flow in a curved channel because numerical grid lines can be fitted along river and valley banks it is possible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley when using basic equations written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system which makes it possible to calculate the fluid forces acting on river banks hence the debris flow analysis can calculate the fluid forces acting on river and valley structure if basic equations of debris flow analysis written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system are used the use of basic equations written in the cartesian coordinates can lead to underestimations of the damage to river and valley structures because of the underestimation of the inundation area and discharge of debris flows further numerical energy dissipations that occur at the side edges of the debris flow affect the numerical analysis results when the numerical grid lines are not fitted along river and valley banks it is considered that basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system can reduce numerical energy dissipation at the side edge of the debris flow in meandering channels because numerical grid lines can be fitted along river and valley banks in this study the basic equations of debris flow are written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow was developed using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley were conducted using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed field observation of debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 was performed and damages to bank protections erosion control dams and houses were confirmed further the models using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems are applied to the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed 2 governing equations of the numerical simulation of debris flow in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system fig 2 shows the relationship between the cartesian coordinate system and the generalized curvilinear coordinate system this relationship is expressed as takebayashi 2017 1 j 1 x ξ y η x η y ξ 2 ξ x j y η 3 η x j y ξ 4 ξ y j x η 5 η y j x ξ in eqs 1 5 ξ and η represent coordinates along

respectively these velocities are defined as 7 u ξ x u ξ y v 8 v η x u η y v where u and v represent the depth averaged flow velocities above the bed along the x and y coordinates respectively the term on the right hand side of eq 6 indicates the sink and source of the mass and expresses the development and decrescence of a debris flow caused by the exchange of the mixture of water and sediment between the bed surface and debris flow where c denotes the concentration of the sediment in the static deposition layer bed layer and e represents the erosion rate of the bed when the cohesive characteristics of the bed layer on the bedrock can be neglected and the equilibrium bed condition wherein the bed erosion rate is the same as the sediment deposition rate the bed erosion rate can be

denote the bed slope in the x direction and bed slope in the y direction respectively a laminar flow layer is dominant when the sediment size is large therefore the flow becomes a debris flow when the sediment size is small a turbulent flow layer is formed on the laminar flow layer near the bed and this becomes a mud flow considering the formation of both laminar and turbulent flows and referring to the averaged depth and sediment concentration c the equilibrium bed slope θ e in the flow direction can be obtained as takebayashi and fujita 2020 11 tan θ e σ ρ 1 c σ ρ 1 c 1 h s h tan ϕ s where ϕ

flow and τ m represents the nondimensional shear stress of the mean diameter eq 11 indicates that the equilibrium bed slope is small when the laminar flow layer is thin consequently the debris flow

equation is 25 t z b j e c j both direct erosions using eq 25 and riverbank failure were considered for bank erosion riverbank failure is considered to occur when the riverbank slope exceeds the angle of repose the local bed slope was reset to the angle of repose 34 at the calculation points where the slope was steeper than the angle of repose and bed rock is not exposed debris flows are a phenomenon in which sediments are deposited in a mild slope fan and flowing in a steep valley resulting in the formation of a mixed flow of subcritical and supercritical flows therefore the mass and momentum conservation laws are discretized using the tvd maccormack scheme which is a shock capturing method with second order accuracy causon 1989 wet and dry at each numerical grid is judged all numerical grids are dry as the initial condition except for the numerical grids of surface failure when flow depth becomes deeper than 1 cm the numerical grid is designated as wet when flow depth becomes shallower than 1 cm the numerical grid is designated as dry note that calculations were also performed using the 1 mm flow depth to judge whether the numerical grids are wet or dry but the results were unaffected the developed numerical analysis model was installed in the free public domain river analysis interface iric nelson et al 2016 which was developed by a research group including the first author the numerical analysis model was named morpho2dh 3 numerical simulation of debris flow in periodical meandering channel 3 1 hydraulic conditions to present the differences in the calculation results of debris flow between two coordinate systems the numerical simulation of debris flow for the synthetic periodical meandering channel was performed fig 3 a and b show the horizontal view of the numerical grids and bed elevation of meandering channels for the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and the cartesian coordinate systems respectively a meandering rectangular open channel with a constant channel slope was used as the calculation domain the channel width was 100 m channel length 1500 m average numerical grid size 10 m 10 m initial bed slope along the channel centerline 0 3 17 meandering angle 40 and the mean diameters of the sediment were 6 mm the base rock is considered below the bed and the maximum erosion depth is assumed to be 1 m the debris flow originated from a slope failure in other words there is no inflow discharge from upstream end the slope failure was set near the upstream end the width of the slope failure was the same as the width of the channel the longitudinal length and depth of the slope failure were 30 m and 1 m respectively 3 2 results and discussion figs 4 and 5 show the temporal change in the flow depth after 20 40 and 80 s using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and the cartesian coordinate system respectively when the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system were used the debris flow had already arrived at the end of the channel at 80 s the transportation time of the debris flow from the slope failure to the downstream end was 77 s meanwhile as shown in fig 5 the debris flow did not arrive at the end of the channel by 80 s when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used the transportation time of the debris flow from the slope failure to the downstream end was 88 s the flow depth based on the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system was shallower than that in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system due to the smaller discharge fig 6 shows the horizontal distribution of elevation changes at 300 s a deep sediment deposition area was formed along both bank lines when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used these sediment depositions reduce the discharge via two effects first the sedimentation along banks directly reduces the mass of the debris flow second the sedimentation reduces the erosion area of the channel bed and suppresses the development of debris flows on the other hand a sediment deposition area was not formed along banks when the basic equations in the general curvilinear coordinate system were used notably many of the characteristics of bed deformations caused by bed material loads in mild slope meandering channels do not apply to bed deformations due to debris flows in steep slope meandering valleys the apparent viscosity of the debris flow is much greater than that of the water flow owing to the yield stress in eq 22 therefore secondary flows that cause sedimentation along the inner bank are less developed in debris flows compared to that in water flows in addition owing to the insufficient sediment in the bed in mountain valleys the upstream sediment supply due to slope failures is smaller than the amount of sediment in a debris flow therefore in many valleys most of the sediment in the channel above the bed rock is eroded resulting in a lack of lateral variations fig 7 shows the horizontal distribution of the magnitude of the depth averaged flow velocity at 71 s and 80 s in the generalized and cartesian coordinate systems respectively the flow velocity using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system is higher than that using the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system this can be attributed to the side boundaries of the debris flow not being smooth when a square grid is used which causes the occurrence of numerical energy dissipation that does not exist physically the differences in the calculation results of debris flow between two coordinate systems are relatively large this should be well studied before discussing the detailed calculation accuracy for reproducing debris flow phenomena 4 debris flow disaster in kinryu river basin in saga city japan 4 1 outline of debris flow disaster in the early morning of august 28 2019 heavy rainfall brought about by the autumn rain front caused debris flows in the kinryu river basin located in the northern part of saga city japan a large amount of sediment flowed into the residential area in the downstream basin at 6 20 a m on august 28 a resident of the downstream area saw the debris flow this flow caused damage to several river structures and houses agricultural lands were also buried by the inundated sediment fig 8 shows the location of the kinryu river basin and the slope angle of the kinryu river the kinryu river runs southward in the northern part of saga city and a highway is located near the southern limit of the area flooded with debris flow the flow distance of the debris flow was approximately 2 4 km after slope failures the debris flows moved straight south for approximately 500 m then southwest for approximately 300 m and finally southeast down to a residential area a part of the flooded debris flow collided with and accumulated around the highway another part went south through the box culvert japan ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2019 sites where slope failures occurred were steep and the angle was approximately 35 the bed slope is gentle at approximately 6 in the section 300 800 m downstream of the slope failures further downstream the bed slope becomes steep again and the angle is approximately 10 4 2 geology fig 9 shows a geological map of the kinryu river basin national institute of advanced industrial science and technology the kinryu river basin is located in a granite area recently many debris flows have occurred in the granite areas in japan for example several debris flows occurred in marumori town miyagi prefecture japan in october 2019 in which several residents were killed and or injured further hiroshima city had many debris flows in july 2018 the degree of weathering of the granite in kinryu river basin is similar to marumori town and hiroshima city many well weathered granite soils with a particle size of approximately 1 mm fig 10 flowed out as debris flows in addition spherical weathered core stones with a diameter of several meters to several tens of centimeters fig 11 were produced 4 3 rainfall fig 12 shows the temporal variation in rainfall intensity around slopes where slope failures occur the rainfall intensity is obtained using a c band and x band mixed radar cx radar the spatiotemporal resolution of the cx radar observation is 250 m in space and 1 min in time the rainfall is intermittent from noon on august 25 to noon on august 28 2019 with some periods of almost no rain such as the afternoon of august 26 and 21 00 24 00 on august 27 according to the results of the numerical simulation described later the time from the occurrence of the slope failure the occurrence of the debris flow to the arrival of the debris flow at the residential area was approximately 500 s the occurrence of slope failure was considered to be around 6 12 a m on august 28 according to the cx radar rainfall data a high intensity rainfall of 100 mm h or more was recorded between 6 07 and 6 09 and the rainfall intensity fell rapidly to less than 20 mm h at 6 13 that is it is highly likely that the intense rainfall between 6 07 and 6 09 triggered slope failure had the rain ended several minutes earlier there is a possibility that the slope failures would not have occurred and debris flow would not have flowed into the residential area the total rainfall from noon on august 25 to the occurrence of debris flow was 557 mm which is an extremely large value for a first debris flow fig 13 shows the temporal variation of rainfall intensity obtained by the cx radar at the location where debris flows occurred in marumori miyagi prefecture during typhoon hagibis in october 2019 and kumano hiroshima prefecture during the heavy rainfall in western japan in july 2018 in the case of marumori the first debris flow occurred with a total rainfall of 309 mm while for hiroshima the first debris flow occurred with a total rainfall of 153 mm which indicates a large difference in the total rainfall at the time of slope failure compared to that at kinryu river one reason for this difference is that the kinryu river had frequent periods of no or light rainfall which allowed the water in the soil to flow out and prevented the increase in the moisture content of the slope surface another reason is that one of the two slope failures may have already occurred during the high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 if debris flow occurred at 17 30 the total precipitation after the no rain period on august 26 would be approximately 301 mm which is close to the total precipitation during the debris flow at marumori the possibility that the slope already collapsed during the high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 will be reexamined later based on the results of the numerical simulation of debris flow 4 4 field observation fig 14 b and c shows the slope failures near the mountain peak and the steep slope area upstream of the kinryu river respectively two slope failures occurred across the ridge near the top of the mountain and they were the sources of the two debris flows shown in fig 14 c the green square in fig 14 a shows the wide channel area approximately 400 m downstream from the slope failure location in this area the relatively fresh unstable sediment was eroded which indicates that the sediment may have been deposited in the recent past by small scale debris flows fig 14 d shows the damage to the road and the sediment deposition upstream of the road caused by the debris flow from the east valley a box culvert is installed on the road embankment as indicated by the red circle in fig 14 d the box culvert would have to drain away only rainwater however it was blocked by sediment because of the sudden inflow of a large amount of sediment thus the road acts as a sabo dam a large amount of sediment is deposited upstream of the road and the amount of sediment flowing out is suppressed by the road however some sediment still flowed over the road and the guardrails on the road were completely destroyed fig 15 a shows the blocked river channel located approximately 750 m downstream from the slope failures the bed slope is mild and the river width is narrow therefore the river channel is blocked by a large amount of driftwood and sediment with core stones that have a diameter of approximately 2 m further the road on the left bank of the river channel road on the right of fig 15 a was inundated with a large amount of sediment caused by the blockage and the maximum depth of the sedimentation on the road was approximately 2 m the guardrail is destroyed because of the blockage of the river however the damage on the surface of the road is small since the inundated sediment was fine fig 15 b shows the situation approximately 50 m downstream from the location of the channel blockage as indicated in fig 15 a the bed and outer bank of the curved channel are heavily eroded because the bed slope is steep from this location to the downstream area the banks are composed of sand and granite which are sediments from past debris flows and can be easily eroded fig 15 c shows the damage to the old erosion control dam installed in the downstream erosion area the erosion control dam was built using unreinforced concrete several decades ago and could be destroyed easily by the debris flows several erosion control dams such as those shown in fig 15 c were constructed downstream of the damaged dam fig 15 d shows the damage to the bank and the road 1500 m from the location of the slope failures the left bank collapses because of bed erosion and the road on the bank is also damaged fig 16 a shows the area upstream of the residential area the river was filled with sediment and a large amount of sediment is inundated most inundated sediments are fine materials although granite of several tens of centimeters in size can be seen some houses were damaged by inundated sediments and cars were severely destroyed fig 16 b shows the farmlands located further downstream the farmland was inundated with fine sediment and driftwood fig 16 c shows the trace of debris flow in the box culvert on a highway the flow depth was shallower than 1 m the damage to the guardrail and road is almost negligible fig 16 d shows sediment deposition downstream of the highway 5 numerical simulation of debris flow in kinryu river basin in saga city japan 5 1 hydraulic conditions for numerical analysis fig 17 a shows the computational grid for the equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the average grid width is 2 m and the total number of grids is 167 767 1321 in the longitudinal direction and 127 in the transverse direction when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system are used with a square grid average grid width 2 m as shown in fig 17 b a total of 395 997 grids are required 1211 in the downstream direction and 327 in the transverse direction to cover the flow domain of the debris flow a large number of numerical grids requires large pc memories and increase the calculation time fig 18 shows the polygons of houses and buildings considered in the analysis each polygon has height information houses and buildings are treated as non erodible objects in this analysis the two slope failures shown in fig 14 b are considered the volume for each slope failure is 1000 m3 as shown in fig 14 d the deposited sediment around the exit of the box culvert of the road which is from the east side valley was eroded by the debris flow from the west side valley hence in the analysis the slope failure in the east side valley is assumed to occur first and the slope failure in the west side valley is assumed to occur later based on the temporal change in rain intensity the first debris flow is assumed to have occurred during high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 hence the time between the occurrence of the two debris flows is longer than 12 h it means that the second debris occurred after the stop of the first debris flow in the analysis 300 s was set between the occurrence of the two debris flows because the first debris flow was stopped within 300 s 5 2 results and discussion fig 19 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow obtained using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system fig 20 shows the spatial distribution of the land surface deformation the first debris flow occurred on the eastern slope as shown in fig 19 a the debris flow deposited a large amount of sediment in the upstream area of the road that crosses the east valley as indicated by a brown circle in fig 20 b and some debris flowed over the road and flowed downstream of the road as shown in fig 19 c the debris flows from the east valley did not approach the residential area and it stopped 800 m from the location of the slope failure as shown in fig 19 d and e as shown in fig 14 a the channel width varies from 400 to 750 m from the location of the slope failure in addition as shown in fig 8 the bed slope is too mild for a debris flow to be developed hence the first debris flow stopped before it developed well however the second debris flow that occurred on the west slope reached the residential area downstream as shown in fig 19 i and j the debris flow eroded the bed and banks as it flowed downstream as shown in fig 20 c taking the eroded sediment and water into itself and increasing its size as shown in fig 19 h and i the size of the second debris flow developed for about 800 m before the flow direction changed to the southeast as shown in fig 19 f and g despite the nondevelopment of the first debris flow during the past several decades debris flow has not reached residential areas however many debris flows e g in 2016 were recorded in the kinryu river basin which indicates that the kinryu river has a natural sediment reservoir in the upper reaches past debris flows were deposited in the upstream area and the natural sediment reservoir was filled with the sediment year by year finally the reservoir became full by the first debris flow in 2019 the second debris flow flowed into the downstream area as shown in fig 20 b there are many sediment deposition areas in the upstream area bed erosion is dominant from the location where the flow direction changes to the southeast of the residential area as explained before sediment deposition is dominant again in the residential area and in the area around the highway as shown in fig 20 a the blue and yellow circles indicate the sediment deposition in fig 16 a and b respectively a part of the flooded debris flow went through the box culvert as shown in fig 20 c a pink circle indicates sediment deposition south of the highway as shown in fig 16 d the inundation areas and land surface deformation of debris flow in kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were also reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow was stopped in the upstream mild slope area and the second one flowed into the residential area as shown in fig 19 the travel time of the debris flow from the west slope to the house where the resident observed the debris flow was approximately 500 s therefore given that the debris flow was observed in the residential area at approximately 06 20 on august 28 the slope failure for the second debris flow was considered to have occurred at around 06 12 as explained in section 4 3 the average velocity of a debris flow in the kinryu river is 4 6 m s the average velocity of debris flows at marumori miyagi prefecture and kumano hiroshima prefecture japan is about 10 m s compared to the other two debris flows the velocity of the debris flow in the kinryu river is slow this is because the land slope is mild in the upper reaches fig 21 shows the spatial distribution of flow velocity of debris flow approaching the uppermost house the highest velocity near the debris flow front is 9 7 m s the second debris flow develops with time from the location where the flow direction changes to the southeast and the velocity increases as a result a significant number of river regulation works and houses are damaged fig 22 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow obtained using the basic equations in the cartesian coordinates fig 23 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow around the upstream sediment deposition area from 425 s to 600 s the second debris flow stopped approximately 800 m downstream from the slope failure location and did not reach the residential area downstream as shown in fig 22 f g and h when the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used further compared with the results using the basic equation in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system shown in fig 19 and fig 23 the travel speed of the debris flow is slower this is because the longitudinal shapes of the channel banks do not match the shape of the numerical analysis grids and the edge of the debris flow on both the left and right bank sides is not smooth as in the analysis of debris flows in periodical meandering channels and therefore the velocity of the debris flow is slowed by the numerical energy dissipation caused by the shape of the numerical analysis grid further the slow velocity of the debris flow and small erosion rate of the bed are evaluated to suppress the development of debris flow therefore the second debris flow stopped at the mild slope area it is considered that the flow depth velocity and discharge could be reproduced better by the developed model comparing those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system therefore the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures can be evaluated better by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system to analyze the stresses acting on river structures with higher accuracy a more detailed investigation into reproducibility as well as calibration validation of the proposed model is necessary in future for the calculations of both the synthetic periodic meandering channel and kinryu river the numerical simulations were performed using a computer with intel r xeon r cpu 2 30 ghz and 48 gb ram the operating system used was windows server 2012 standard the computational time of the analysis was 72 h 22 min for the 1200 s calculation when the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system however 150 h was required when the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used the main reason for this longer computation time is an increase in the number of numerical grids when the cartesian coordinate system is used in addition the time step used in this calculation was 0 025 s for both cases however the calculation was possible even with 0 05 s for the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system thus the calculation time can be accelerated by the quad when the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system are used 6 conclusions the basic equations of debris flow were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys was developed numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley were conducted using the basic equations written in a generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two simulation results was discussed field observations of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 were performed and the damage to bank protections erosion control dams and houses was confirmed further a numerical simulation of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin was conducted using the basic equations described in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two simulation results was discussed the obtained results can be summarized as follows 1 the numerical simulations of debris flow in a periodical meandering channel showed that the propagation of the debris flow was slow when the equations written in the cartesian coordinate system were used further deep sediment deposition areas were formed along both bank lines when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used these were attributed to the side boundaries of the debris flow not being smooth when a square grid is used and thus numerical energy dissipation which does not physically exist occurred 2 the inundation areas and land surface deformation of the debris flow in the kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were also reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow was stopped in the upstream mild slope area and the second one flowed into the residential area the flow depth velocity and discharge could be reproduced better by the developed model as compared with those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system therefore the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures can be evaluated better by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system 3 the computational time of the analysis with the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system is shorter than that with the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used the main reason for this longer computation time is an increase in the number of numerical grids when the cartesian coordinate system is used 4 many rivers have sediment deposition areas in the upper or middle river even if a debris flow occurs in the upstream area it will not flow downstream and a large amount of sediment may be stored in the upstream area without being identified to evaluate the occurrence or nonoccurrence of debris flows that flow to residential areas for these river basins periodical monitoring of sediment deposition in the upstream or middle of the valley must be needed credit authorship contribution

2662,each year structures installed in rivers and valleys e g bank protections bridges and sabo dams are damaged by debris flows therefore it is necessary to predict the flow characteristics of debris flows accurately to design river and valley structures that are robust against such debris flows in recent years several two dimensional models have been developed to simulate debris flow however the basic equations in the numerical simulation models are in the cartesian coordinate system and the shape of each numerical analysis grid is square or rectangular it is impossible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley structures such as bank protections and sabo dams when employing square or rectangular grids this makes it difficult to calculate the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures in this study the basic equations of debris flow are provided in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow designed using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys is developed numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley are conducted using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two results is discussed further numerical simulations of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 are performed using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed the numerical simulation results of debris flow in a periodical meandering channel suggest a slow propagation of debris flow when equations in the cartesian coordinate system are used this is attributed to the rough boundaries of debris flow when a square grid is used which causes numerical energy dissipation that does not exist physically the inundation areas and land surface deformation of debris flow in kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow in kinryu river basin was stopped in the upstream mild slope area while the second flowed into the residential area reproducing the flow depth velocity and discharge could be improved by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system as compared with those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system when the cartesian coordinate system was used the volume of the debris flow was evaluated to be small and the travel distance of the debris flow was evaluated to be short thus the debris flow does not arrive at the residential area and the risk of debris flows is underestimated keywords debris flow river regulation work numerical simulation generalized curvilinear coordinate system river engineering data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction each year debris flows damage structures installed in rivers and valleys such as bank protections bridges and sabo dams because debris flow is transported in steep river channels at high speed another factor that increases the damage to river structures is the deep flow depth which is caused by the increase in the discharge with the erosion of the riverbed thus it is important to predict the flow characteristics of debris flows accurately considering the development process of debris flows for designing river and valley structures robust against debris flows the estimation of external forces acting on structures is essential in the design of structures therefore for the design of structures in debris flow valleys the first and most important step is to improve the estimation of external forces acting on structures it is essential to reproduce debris flow phenomena via numerical simulation to understand the flow characteristics of debris flows in detail in recent years several models have been developed to simulate debris flow luna et al 2012 wang et al 2016 suzuki et al 2019 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 han et al 2015 kelfoun and druitt 2005 for example luna et al 2012 developed a one dimensional model of debris flow this model can reproduce the transportation and deposition processes of a debris flow in a short computational time however it is difficult to evaluate sediment production due to bank erosion and the discharge is underestimated in addition it is difficult to estimate the horizontal shape of the inundation area on the alluvial fan because it is affected by the horizontal land geometry certain models use particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics wang et al 2016 and moving particle semi implicit suzuki et al 2019 three dimensional flow can be reproduced using these models when the information on the volume of debris flow is obtained through field surveys the models can output a considerable amount of information for evaluating the safety of the river and valley regulation works however it is difficult for particle methods to reproduce the development process of debris flow since the number of particles increases significantly thus it is difficult for particle methods to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in the volume of debris flow the entrainment of sediment and water from the bed can be neglected when the unstable sediment cover on the base rock is thin and the land slope is mild pastor et al 2002 pirulli and marco 2010 vagnon et al 2019 however the spatiotemporal change in entrainment should be considered when the unstable sediment cover on the base rock is thick and the land slope is steep further a particle method requires a longer computational time compared to one and two dimensional models a two dimensional model can reproduce the fluid force along the outer bank of curvature and the force is important information for evaluating the safety of bank protection egashira and itoh 2004 kelfoun and druitt 2005 wang et al 2008 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 pirulli and pastor 2012 han et al 2015 vagnon et al 2019 takebayashi and fujita 2020 sediment production due to bank erosions can be reproduced and the spatial change of discharge can be estimated better egashira and itoh 2004 armanini et al 2009 beguería et al 2009 crosta et al 2009 pirulli and pastor 2012 han et al 2015 vagnon et al 2019 takebayashi and fujita 2020 some studies sovilla et al 2006 iverson 2012 consider the idea that the thickness of the bed surface layer where the bed shear stress is larger than the bed resistance is the erosion depth many bed erosion rate equations have been proposed accordingly takahashi 1978 egashira and itoh 2004 mcdougall and hungr 2005 wang et al 2008 christen et al 2010 wu et al 2013 han et al 2015 takebayashi and fujita 2020 a two dimensional model can also reproduce the horizontal shape of the inundation area on the alluvial fan further the computational time is shorter than that of the particle methods however the basic equations in the two dimensional numerical simulation models of debris flows described above are in the cartesian coordinate system and the shape of each numerical analysis grid is square or rectangular although the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system are simple and easy to use the horizontal shape of a debris flow valley is not straight it is usually meandered or curved therefore it is impossible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley when using square or rectangular grids which makes it difficult to calculate the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures hosoda et al 2001 and takebayashi 2017 developed two dimensional bed deformation analyses of bed material load in which the basic equations are written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system those studies did not compare the results of calculations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system with those in the cartesian coordinate system however as shown in fig 1 it is considered that basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system can reduce numerical energy dissipation at the side edge of the flow in a curved channel because numerical grid lines can be fitted along river and valley banks it is possible to use numerical grids that match the horizontal shape of the river or valley when using basic equations written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system which makes it possible to calculate the fluid forces acting on river banks hence the debris flow analysis can calculate the fluid forces acting on river and valley structure if basic equations of debris flow analysis written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system are used the use of basic equations written in the cartesian coordinates can lead to underestimations of the damage to river and valley structures because of the underestimation of the inundation area and discharge of debris flows further numerical energy dissipations that occur at the side edges of the debris flow affect the numerical analysis results when the numerical grid lines are not fitted along river and valley banks it is considered that basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system can reduce numerical energy dissipation at the side edge of the debris flow in meandering channels because numerical grid lines can be fitted along river and valley banks in this study the basic equations of debris flow are written in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow was developed using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley were conducted using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed field observation of debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 was performed and damages to bank protections erosion control dams and houses were confirmed further the models using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems are applied to the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin and the difference between the two simulation results is discussed 2 governing equations of the numerical simulation of debris flow in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system fig 2 shows the relationship between the cartesian coordinate system and the generalized

denote the bed slope in the x direction and bed slope in the y direction respectively a laminar flow layer is dominant when the sediment size is large therefore the flow becomes a debris flow when the sediment size is small a turbulent flow layer is formed on the laminar flow layer near the bed and this becomes a mud flow considering the formation of both laminar and turbulent flows and referring to the averaged depth and sediment concentration c the equilibrium bed slope θ e in the flow direction can be obtained as takebayashi and fujita 2020 11 tan θ e σ ρ 1 c σ ρ 1 c 1 h s h tan ϕ s where ϕ

flow and τ m represents the nondimensional shear stress of the mean diameter eq 11 indicates that the equilibrium bed slope is small when the laminar flow layer is thin consequently the debris flow

equation is 25 t z b j e c j both direct erosions using eq 25 and riverbank failure were considered for bank erosion riverbank failure is considered to occur when the riverbank slope exceeds the angle of repose the local bed slope was reset to the angle of repose 34 at the calculation points where the slope was steeper than the angle of repose and bed rock is not exposed debris flows are a phenomenon in which sediments are deposited in a mild slope fan and flowing in a steep valley resulting in the formation of a mixed flow of subcritical and supercritical flows therefore the mass and momentum conservation laws are discretized using the tvd maccormack scheme which is a shock capturing method with second order accuracy causon 1989 wet and dry at each numerical grid is judged all numerical grids are dry as the initial condition except for the numerical grids of surface failure when flow depth becomes deeper than 1 cm the numerical grid is designated as wet when flow depth becomes shallower than 1 cm the numerical grid is designated as dry note that calculations were also performed using the 1 mm flow depth to judge whether the numerical grids are wet or dry but the results were unaffected the developed numerical analysis model was installed in the free public domain river analysis interface iric nelson et al 2016 which was developed by a research group including the first author the numerical analysis model was named morpho2dh 3 numerical simulation of debris flow in periodical meandering channel 3 1 hydraulic conditions to present the differences in the calculation results of debris flow between two coordinate systems the numerical simulation of debris flow for the synthetic periodical meandering channel was performed fig 3 a and b show the horizontal view of the numerical grids and bed elevation of meandering channels for the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear and the cartesian coordinate systems respectively a meandering rectangular open channel with a constant channel slope was used as the calculation domain the channel width was 100 m channel length 1500 m average numerical grid size 10 m 10 m initial bed slope along the channel centerline 0 3 17 meandering angle 40 and the mean diameters of the sediment were 6 mm the base rock is considered below the bed and the maximum erosion depth is assumed to be 1 m the debris flow originated from a slope failure in other words there is no inflow discharge from upstream end the slope failure was set near the upstream end the width of the slope failure was the same as the width of the channel the longitudinal length and depth of the slope failure were 30 m and 1 m respectively 3 2 results and discussion figs 4 and 5 show the temporal change in the flow depth after 20 40 and 80 s using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and the cartesian coordinate system respectively when the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system were used the debris flow had already arrived at the end of the channel at 80 s the transportation time of the debris flow from the slope failure to the downstream end was 77 s meanwhile as shown in fig 5 the debris flow did not arrive at the end of the channel by 80 s when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used the transportation time of the debris flow from the slope failure to the downstream end was 88 s the flow depth based on the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system was shallower than that in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system due to the smaller discharge fig 6 shows the horizontal distribution of elevation changes at 300 s a deep sediment deposition area was formed along both bank lines when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used these sediment depositions reduce the discharge via two effects first the sedimentation along banks directly reduces the mass of the debris flow second the sedimentation reduces the erosion area of the channel bed and suppresses the development of debris flows on the other hand a sediment deposition area was not formed along banks when the basic equations in the general curvilinear coordinate system were used notably many of the characteristics of bed deformations caused by bed material loads in mild slope meandering channels do not apply to bed deformations due to debris flows in steep slope meandering valleys the apparent viscosity of the debris flow is much greater than that of the water flow owing to the yield stress in eq 22 therefore secondary flows that cause sedimentation along the inner bank are less developed in debris flows compared to that in water flows in addition owing to the insufficient sediment in the bed in mountain valleys the upstream sediment supply due to slope failures is smaller than the amount of sediment in a debris flow therefore in many valleys most of the sediment in the channel above the bed rock is eroded resulting in a lack of lateral variations fig 7 shows the horizontal distribution of the magnitude of the depth averaged flow velocity at 71 s and 80 s in the generalized and cartesian coordinate systems respectively the flow velocity using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system is higher than that using the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system this can be attributed to the side boundaries of the debris flow not being smooth when a square grid is used which causes the occurrence of numerical energy dissipation that does not exist physically the differences in the calculation results of debris flow between two coordinate systems are relatively large this should be well studied before discussing the detailed calculation accuracy for reproducing debris flow phenomena 4 debris flow disaster in kinryu river basin in saga city japan 4 1 outline of debris flow disaster in the early morning of august 28 2019 heavy rainfall brought about by the autumn rain front caused debris flows in the kinryu river basin located in the northern part of saga city japan a large amount of sediment flowed into the residential area in the downstream basin at 6 20 a m on august 28 a resident of the downstream area saw the debris flow this flow caused damage to several river structures and houses agricultural lands were also buried by the inundated sediment fig 8 shows the location of the kinryu river basin and the slope angle of the kinryu river the kinryu river runs southward in the northern part of saga city and a highway is located near the southern limit of the area flooded with debris flow the flow distance of the debris flow was approximately 2 4 km after slope failures the debris flows moved straight south for approximately 500 m then southwest for approximately 300 m and finally southeast down to a residential area a part of the flooded debris flow collided with and accumulated around the highway another part went south through the box culvert japan ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2019 sites where slope failures occurred were steep and the angle was approximately 35 the bed slope is gentle at approximately 6 in the section 300 800 m downstream of the slope failures further downstream the bed slope becomes steep again and the angle is approximately 10 4 2 geology fig 9 shows a geological map of the kinryu river basin national institute of advanced industrial science and technology the kinryu river basin is located in a granite area recently many debris flows have occurred in the granite areas in japan for example several debris flows occurred in marumori town miyagi prefecture japan in october 2019 in which several residents were killed and or injured further hiroshima city had many debris flows in july 2018 the degree of weathering of the granite in kinryu river basin is similar to marumori town and hiroshima city many well weathered granite soils with a particle size of approximately 1 mm fig 10 flowed out as debris flows in addition spherical weathered core stones with a diameter of several meters to several tens of centimeters fig 11 were produced 4 3 rainfall fig 12 shows the temporal variation in rainfall intensity around slopes where slope failures occur the rainfall intensity is obtained using a c band and x band mixed radar cx radar the spatiotemporal resolution of the cx radar observation is 250 m in space and 1 min in time the rainfall is intermittent from noon on august 25 to noon on august 28 2019 with some periods of almost no rain such as the afternoon of august 26 and 21 00 24 00 on august 27 according to the results of the numerical simulation described later the time from the occurrence of the slope failure the occurrence of the debris flow to the arrival of the debris flow at the residential area was approximately 500 s the occurrence of slope failure was considered to be around 6 12 a m on august 28 according to the cx radar rainfall data a high intensity rainfall of 100 mm h or more was recorded between 6 07 and 6 09 and the rainfall intensity fell rapidly to less than 20 mm h at 6 13 that is it is highly likely that the intense rainfall between 6 07 and 6 09 triggered slope failure had the rain ended several minutes earlier there is a possibility that the slope failures would not have occurred and debris flow would not have flowed into the residential area the total rainfall from noon on august 25 to the occurrence of debris flow was 557 mm which is an extremely large value for a first debris flow fig 13 shows the temporal variation of rainfall intensity obtained by the cx radar at the location where debris flows occurred in marumori miyagi prefecture during typhoon hagibis in october 2019 and kumano hiroshima prefecture during the heavy rainfall in western japan in july 2018 in the case of marumori the first debris flow occurred with a total rainfall of 309 mm while for hiroshima the first debris flow occurred with a total rainfall of 153 mm which indicates a large difference in the total rainfall at the time of slope failure compared to that at kinryu river one reason for this difference is that the kinryu river had frequent periods of no or light rainfall which allowed the water in the soil to flow out and prevented the increase in the moisture content of the slope surface another reason is that one of the two slope failures may have already occurred during the high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 if debris flow occurred at 17 30 the total precipitation after the no rain period on august 26 would be approximately 301 mm which is close to the total precipitation during the debris flow at marumori the possibility that the slope already collapsed during the high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 will be reexamined later based on the results of the numerical simulation of debris flow 4 4 field observation fig 14 b and c shows the slope failures near the mountain peak and the steep slope area upstream of the kinryu river respectively two slope failures occurred across the ridge near the top of the mountain and they were the sources of the two debris flows shown in fig 14 c the green square in fig 14 a shows the wide channel area approximately 400 m downstream from the slope failure location in this area the relatively fresh unstable sediment was eroded which indicates that the sediment may have been deposited in the recent past by small scale debris flows fig 14 d shows the damage to the road and the sediment deposition upstream of the road caused by the debris flow from the east valley a box culvert is installed on the road embankment as indicated by the red circle in fig 14 d the box culvert would have to drain away only rainwater however it was blocked by sediment because of the sudden inflow of a large amount of sediment thus the road acts as a sabo dam a large amount of sediment is deposited upstream of the road and the amount of sediment flowing out is suppressed by the road however some sediment still flowed over the road and the guardrails on the road were completely destroyed fig 15 a shows the blocked river channel located approximately 750 m downstream from the slope failures the bed slope is mild and the river width is narrow therefore the river channel is blocked by a large amount of driftwood and sediment with core stones that have a diameter of approximately 2 m further the road on the left bank of the river channel road on the right of fig 15 a was inundated with a large amount of sediment caused by the blockage and the maximum depth of the sedimentation on the road was approximately 2 m the guardrail is destroyed because of the blockage of the river however the damage on the surface of the road is small since the inundated sediment was fine fig 15 b shows the situation approximately 50 m downstream from the location of the channel blockage as indicated in fig 15 a the bed and outer bank of the curved channel are heavily eroded because the bed slope is steep from this location to the downstream area the banks are composed of sand and granite which are sediments from past debris flows and can be easily eroded fig 15 c shows the damage to the old erosion control dam installed in the downstream erosion area the erosion control dam was built using unreinforced concrete several decades ago and could be destroyed easily by the debris flows several erosion control dams such as those shown in fig 15 c were constructed downstream of the damaged dam fig 15 d shows the damage to the bank and the road 1500 m from the location of the slope failures the left bank collapses because of bed erosion and the road on the bank is also damaged fig 16 a shows the area upstream of the residential area the river was filled with sediment and a large amount of sediment is inundated most inundated sediments are fine materials although granite of several tens of centimeters in size can be seen some houses were damaged by inundated sediments and cars were severely destroyed fig 16 b shows the farmlands located further downstream the farmland was inundated with fine sediment and driftwood fig 16 c shows the trace of debris flow in the box culvert on a highway the flow depth was shallower than 1 m the damage to the guardrail and road is almost negligible fig 16 d shows sediment deposition downstream of the highway 5 numerical simulation of debris flow in kinryu river basin in saga city japan 5 1 hydraulic conditions for numerical analysis fig 17 a shows the computational grid for the equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the average grid width is 2 m and the total number of grids is 167 767 1321 in the longitudinal direction and 127 in the transverse direction when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system are used with a square grid average grid width 2 m as shown in fig 17 b a total of 395 997 grids are required 1211 in the downstream direction and 327 in the transverse direction to cover the flow domain of the debris flow a large number of numerical grids requires large pc memories and increase the calculation time fig 18 shows the polygons of houses and buildings considered in the analysis each polygon has height information houses and buildings are treated as non erodible objects in this analysis the two slope failures shown in fig 14 b are considered the volume for each slope failure is 1000 m3 as shown in fig 14 d the deposited sediment around the exit of the box culvert of the road which is from the east side valley was eroded by the debris flow from the west side valley hence in the analysis the slope failure in the east side valley is assumed to occur first and the slope failure in the west side valley is assumed to occur later based on the temporal change in rain intensity the first debris flow is assumed to have occurred during high intensity rainfall around 17 30 on august 27 hence the time between the occurrence of the two debris flows is longer than 12 h it means that the second debris occurred after the stop of the first debris flow in the analysis 300 s was set between the occurrence of the two debris flows because the first debris flow was stopped within 300 s 5 2 results and discussion fig 19 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow obtained using the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system fig 20 shows the spatial distribution of the land surface deformation the first debris flow occurred on the eastern slope as shown in fig 19 a the debris flow deposited a large amount of sediment in the upstream area of the road that crosses the east valley as indicated by a brown circle in fig 20 b and some debris flowed over the road and flowed downstream of the road as shown in fig 19 c the debris flows from the east valley did not approach the residential area and it stopped 800 m from the location of the slope failure as shown in fig 19 d and e as shown in fig 14 a the channel width varies from 400 to 750 m from the location of the slope failure in addition as shown in fig 8 the bed slope is too mild for a debris flow to be developed hence the first debris flow stopped before it developed well however the second debris flow that occurred on the west slope reached the residential area downstream as shown in fig 19 i and j the debris flow eroded the bed and banks as it flowed downstream as shown in fig 20 c taking the eroded sediment and water into itself and increasing its size as shown in fig 19 h and i the size of the second debris flow developed for about 800 m before the flow direction changed to the southeast as shown in fig 19 f and g despite the nondevelopment of the first debris flow during the past several decades debris flow has not reached residential areas however many debris flows e g in 2016 were recorded in the kinryu river basin which indicates that the kinryu river has a natural sediment reservoir in the upper reaches past debris flows were deposited in the upstream area and the natural sediment reservoir was filled with the sediment year by year finally the reservoir became full by the first debris flow in 2019 the second debris flow flowed into the downstream area as shown in fig 20 b there are many sediment deposition areas in the upstream area bed erosion is dominant from the location where the flow direction changes to the southeast of the residential area as explained before sediment deposition is dominant again in the residential area and in the area around the highway as shown in fig 20 a the blue and yellow circles indicate the sediment deposition in fig 16 a and b respectively a part of the flooded debris flow went through the box culvert as shown in fig 20 c a pink circle indicates sediment deposition south of the highway as shown in fig 16 d the inundation areas and land surface deformation of debris flow in kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were also reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow was stopped in the upstream mild slope area and the second one flowed into the residential area as shown in fig 19 the travel time of the debris flow from the west slope to the house where the resident observed the debris flow was approximately 500 s therefore given that the debris flow was observed in the residential area at approximately 06 20 on august 28 the slope failure for the second debris flow was considered to have occurred at around 06 12 as explained in section 4 3 the average velocity of a debris flow in the kinryu river is 4 6 m s the average velocity of debris flows at marumori miyagi prefecture and kumano hiroshima prefecture japan is about 10 m s compared to the other two debris flows the velocity of the debris flow in the kinryu river is slow this is because the land slope is mild in the upper reaches fig 21 shows the spatial distribution of flow velocity of debris flow approaching the uppermost house the highest velocity near the debris flow front is 9 7 m s the second debris flow develops with time from the location where the flow direction changes to the southeast and the velocity increases as a result a significant number of river regulation works and houses are damaged fig 22 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow obtained using the basic equations in the cartesian coordinates fig 23 shows the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of the flow depth of the debris flow around the upstream sediment deposition area from 425 s to 600 s the second debris flow stopped approximately 800 m downstream from the slope failure location and did not reach the residential area downstream as shown in fig 22 f g and h when the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used further compared with the results using the basic equation in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system shown in fig 19 and fig 23 the travel speed of the debris flow is slower this is because the longitudinal shapes of the channel banks do not match the shape of the numerical analysis grids and the edge of the debris flow on both the left and right bank sides is not smooth as in the analysis of debris flows in periodical meandering channels and therefore the velocity of the debris flow is slowed by the numerical energy dissipation caused by the shape of the numerical analysis grid further the slow velocity of the debris flow and small erosion rate of the bed are evaluated to suppress the development of debris flow therefore the second debris flow stopped at the mild slope area it is considered that the flow depth velocity and discharge could be reproduced better by the developed model comparing those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system therefore the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures can be evaluated better by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system to analyze the stresses acting on river structures with higher accuracy a more detailed investigation into reproducibility as well as calibration validation of the proposed model is necessary in future for the calculations of both the synthetic periodic meandering channel and kinryu river the numerical simulations were performed using a computer with intel r xeon r cpu 2 30 ghz and 48 gb ram the operating system used was windows server 2012 standard the computational time of the analysis was 72 h 22 min for the 1200 s calculation when the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system however 150 h was required when the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used the main reason for this longer computation time is an increase in the number of numerical grids when the cartesian coordinate system is used in addition the time step used in this calculation was 0 025 s for both cases however the calculation was possible even with 0 05 s for the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system thus the calculation time can be accelerated by the quad when the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system are used 6 conclusions the basic equations of debris flow were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system and a numerical simulation model of debris flow using an orthogonal curved grid along the horizontal shape of rivers and valleys was developed numerical simulations of a periodical meandering valley were conducted using the basic equations written in a generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two simulation results was discussed field observations of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin in saga city japan in 2019 were performed and the damage to bank protections erosion control dams and houses was confirmed further a numerical simulation of the debris flow that occurred in the kinryu river basin was conducted using the basic equations described in the generalized curvilinear and cartesian coordinate systems the difference between the two simulation results was discussed the obtained results can be summarized as follows 1 the numerical simulations of debris flow in a periodical meandering channel showed that the propagation of the debris flow was slow when the equations written in the cartesian coordinate system were used further deep sediment deposition areas were formed along both bank lines when the basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system were used these were attributed to the side boundaries of the debris flow not being smooth when a square grid is used and thus numerical energy dissipation which does not physically exist occurred 2 the inundation areas and land surface deformation of the debris flow in the kinryu river basin were reproduced well by the developed numerical analysis model the basic equations were written in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system the development and decrescence of debris flows were also reproduced using the developed model the first debris flow was stopped in the upstream mild slope area and the second one flowed into the residential area the flow depth velocity and discharge could be reproduced better by the developed model as compared with those reproduced using basic equations in the cartesian coordinate system therefore the fluid forces acting on river or valley structures can be evaluated better by the model using basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system 3 the computational time of the analysis with the basic equations in the generalized curvilinear coordinate system is shorter than that with the basic equation using the cartesian coordinate system was used the main reason for this longer computation time is an increase in the number of numerical grids when the cartesian coordinate system is used 4 many rivers have sediment deposition areas in the upper or middle river even if a debris flow occurs in the upstream area it will not flow downstream and a large amount of sediment may be stored in the upstream area without being identified to evaluate the occurrence or nonoccurrence of debris flows that flow to residential areas for these river basins periodical monitoring of sediment deposition in the upstream or middle of the valley must be needed credit authorship contribution

2663,river hydrology and geomorphology are largely influenced by human activities the operation of the three gorges dam tgd which is the largest global hydropower project has caused widespread concern because of its substantial influences on downstream water and sediment fluxes this study assesses the influences of the three gorges reservoir tgr impoundment on sediment sorting and spatial temporal characteristics of downstream transport the results indicate that the reservoir prevented the transport of 76 of the sediments from the upstream basin to the downstream area of the dam and the discharge of fine d 0 125 mm and coarse particles d 0 125 mm was lower than 25 24 and 12 respectively the recovery of total and fine sediments along the lower reaches of the tgd since 2003 was lower than the respective average values before impoundment 1990 2002 the total volume and discharge ratio of coarse and fine sediments decreased owing to the increase in water level and discharge in the reservoir area when the inflow was higher than 30 000 m3 s during the flooding season may october the discharge ratio of fine and coarse sediments increased and remained stable respectively after the tgr operation commenced the sediment reduction within 954 4 km downstream of the dam resulted in a long distance cumulative scouring however coarse sediments were not considerably recovered owing to the gradual coarsening of the riverbed the results of this study help clarify the influences of large dams on the sediment transport in alluvial river systems this study provides an understanding of the effects of human activities in the evolution of the water sediment geomorphology system in rivers keywords sediment sorting transport characteristics sediment discharge ratio three gorges dam yangtze river data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reservoirs dams and other engineering infrastructures constructed to control the dynamic state of a river s course restrict sediment transport from the river basin to its estuary and delta li et al 2022 manh et al 2014 yang et al 2011 and they can obstruct the continuous material transport to the ocean li et al 2020a b liu and shan 2022 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2018a this decreases the proportion of sediment volumes transported to estuaries kondolf et al 2014 luo et al 2012 in recent decades climate change li et al 2021a and human activities dethier et al 2022 schmitt et al 2019 have considerably affected the yangtze river its runoff process sediment volume and channel morphology allison et al 2012 li et al 2021a milliman and farnsworth 2011 guo et al 2018 2019 after the implementation of large scale water conservancy projects along the yangtze river research on riverbed evolution and fluvial geomorphology has mainly focused on water and sediment conditions and riverbed restoration along the reaches downstream of the tgd the tgd the largest hydropower project worldwide commenced operations in june 2003 zhou et al 2021 as sediments are retained in the reservoir there is a substantial reduction in the proportion of sediment outflow zheng 2016 into the yangtze river middle lower reaches dai et al 2008 dai et al 2009 li et al 2019 lyu et al 2020 yan et al 2021 yang et al 2018b and consequently into the estuary milliman and farnsworth 2011 tang et al 2021 moreover the construction of cascade hydropower stations for water storage and utilization downstream of the jinsha river which is located at the yangtze river upper reaches further disrupts the inflow outflow sediment proportion of the tgr thereby significantly reducing the sediment proportion downstream of the dam dai et al 2018 dong et al 2019 li et al 2018a wang et al 2016b yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 from 1987 to 2019 the median particle size of suspended sediments in the yangtze river upper and middle lower reaches decreased from 20 to 10 μm and increased from 10 to 15 μm respectively dai et al 2008 yang et al 2022 this further intensified sediment flocculation and silting in the reservoir area zhang et al 2022 prior to the tgr operation the riverbed downstream of the dam was predicted to be scoured after the reservoir impoundment the volume of different particle sizes during restoration was not expected to exceed the average volume recorded prior to reservoir impoundment wang et al 2016b these predictions were verified through surveys conducted in 2003 2009 chen et al 2010 li et al 2003 the long distance scouring of the riverbed downstream of the tgd in 2003 2007 was mainly attributed to the non sufficient supply of riverbed sediments especially fine particles li et al 2003 moreover although the sediment volume of fine particles d 0 125 mm in the yangtze river middle reaches gradually increased from 2003 to 2011 it was still lower than the average volume recorded before impoundment in contrast the sediment volume of coarse particles d 0 125 mm within 200 km downstream of the dam increased fast guo et al 2014 2020 chen et al 2022 furthermore the riverbed in the yangtze river middle lower reaches has been coarsening since 2003 li et al 2018b yao et al 2022 especially within 0 200 km near the dam he et al 2022 yang et al 2016 2017a zhang et al 2017 approximately 90 9 of the total area scoured in the yichang datong reach in 2003 2018 was accountable to fine particles of which the yichang luoshan reach experienced both fine and coarse particle scouring in the luoshan datong reach fine particles were scoured but coarse particles were silted in 2003 2012 han et al 2018 yang et al 2016 when the sandy riverbed of the jingjiang reach near the dam was scoured and coarsened suspended matter was majorly transported 81 87 in contrast the bedload supplied the sediments 8 12 when the riverbed was silted and refined xu et al 2021 the bedload volume at the luoshan and hankou stations in 2009 2015 was 137 104 and 152 104 t y respectively yao et al 2017 and the restoration coefficient during the flood season was greater than that during the dry season li et al 2021b 2021c the increasing water levels in the tgr further modified the flow process downstream of the dam including changes in flow redistribution between the flood and dry seasons yan et al 2021 yang et al 2017a zheng 2016 and in the duration of flood flow yan et al 2021 zheng 2016 the changes in the flow process affected the characteristics of various sediment particles owing to the long term water storage in the tgr the sediment composition of the riverbed downstream of the dam has also constantly changed owing to the long term water storage and the exchange of coarse fine particles has restricted the supply of suspended sediments from the bedload moreover the changes in the flow process have affected the capacity of the bedload to supply suspended sediments this study aims to investigate the impacts of the tgr operations on the sorting of coarse and fine particles and the relationship between the relevant factors affecting water and sediment volumes in 1960 2021 at different hydrological stations along the main stream of the yangtze river in addition the restoration ratio of coarse and fine particles and the spatio temporal variations along 954 4 km downstream of the tgd from yichang to hukou reach were analyzed to further clarify the impacts of the tgr operations on the sorting of coarse and fine particles the tgr was also analyzed to further clarify the impacts of its operations on the sorting and transport processes of sediment particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and it flows across 11 provinces in china and extends 6397 km eastward to the east

stations were analyzed to investigate the yichang hukou reach and the yichang hukou reach which is located downstream of the tgd fig 1c the dongting lake on the yangtze river south bank was monitored by the chenglingji hydrological station the lake is fed by songzikou taipingkou and ouchikou outlets which are located at decreasing altitudes and commonly referred to as the three outlets after water cycling in the lake area the water flow joins the yangtze river main stream after passing through the qilishan or chenglingji hydrological station the xiantao hydrological station is located in wuhan city at the confluence of the hanjiang river on the yangtze river north bank and the yangtze river finally the hukou hydrological station is located where the water of poyang lake located on the yangtze river south bank enters the yangtze river 2 2 data sources and quality data on the inflow sediment volumes to the tgr from the wulong cuntan and beibei hydrological stations in 1960 2021 and outflow sediment volumes from the reservoir to the huanglingmiao hydrological station during 2003 2021 were collected to analyze the impact of the tgr on silt blocking the impacts of reservoir operations on the sediment volumes of fine and coarse particles in 2003 2021 were analyzed using data on silt blocking and storage and sediment discharge from the inbound and outbound hydrological stations of the tgr among them d 0 125 mm is used as the critical particle size of suspended matter and bed material load in the water body this is consistent with the classification standard in the existing research yang et al 2017b before 2002 the sieving method was used for sediment particle size measurement while after 2002 the laser particle size method was used and the consistency of the data was checked moreover sediment conditions were analyzed using the flow and sediment data acquired from the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations during 1960 2021 further the impact of the confluent divergent relationship between tributaries and riverine lakes on sediment flow in the yangtze river main stream was assessed based on the flow and sediment volume data for 1960 2021 spatiotemporal variations in sediment flow were collected from the three outlets of the dongting lake and the chenglingji xiantao along the hanjiang river and hukou poyang lake hydrological stations spatiotemporal variations in the transport of fine and coarse sediment particles were analyzed using sediment gradation data acquired from the yichang hydrological station moreover bedload sediment data of the yichang hukou reach for october 2002 2012 and 2021 were collected to analyze the impact of the sediments on the on way restoration of the fine the annual topographic data scale 1 10 000 1 2000 near water facilities of the yichang hukou reach for october 1981 2002 and 2021 were used to analyze the impact of sediments on the on way restoration of fine and coarse particles lastly the annual topographic data scale 1 10 000 1 2000 near water facilities of the yichang hukou reach in october 1981 and 2002 were used to analyze the impacts of riverbed erosion and thalweg changes on the on way restoration of the two particle groups the types and sources of data used in this study are summarized in table 1 data was obtained from the hydrology bureau of changjiang water resources commission changjiang waterway planning design and research institute changjiang waterway survey center and changjiang waterway bureau 2 3 calculation of sediment volumes in the reservoir area the amounts of sediment scouring silting in the tgr area sreservoir 108 t y were determined based on the difference between the sediment inflow from the upstream rivershed to the reservoir sinflow 108 t y and the sediment outflow released from the dam soutflow 108 t y the difference between the sediment inflow sinflow 108 t y and outflow soutflow 108 t y was determined positive and negative values indicated siltation and scouring in the reservoir area respectively the total sediment in the reservoir sreservoir was calculated as 1 s reservoir s inflow s outflow three inflow sediment control stations namely cuntan szhutuo 108 t y beibei sbeibei 108 t y and wulong swulong 108 t y were located in the yangtze river upper reaches before the sediments reached the tgr

station in 2002 was used as a reference for this study riverbeds below the water line along the yichang hukou reach corresponding to a 30 000 m3 s and 50 000 m3 s flow rate at the yichang hydrological station represented the bankfull and flood channels the river reach was divided into several near equidistant sections at decreasing altitudes the sectional areas were calculated using the trapezoidal method as follows fig 2 5 a j h i j h i 1 j h i j h i 1 j b i 3 i 0 1 2 3 m j 0 1 2 3 n where a j is the area of cross section j unit m2 h i j and hi 1 j are the elevations of the i th and i 1 th

1 variations in characteristic flow process of the three gorges reservoir and downstream of the dam the operation of the tgr has significantly changed the flow process from the upper reaches of the yangtze river to its middle and lower reaches fig 3 a the upstream peak flow in flood season was effectively reduced and the maximum flow was reduced by 31 000 m3 s taking the yichang hankou and hankou hydrological stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as the observation objects during 1990 2002 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 the numbers of days with flow below 50 000 m3 s at yichang station below 10 000 m3 s at hankou station and below 10 000 m3 s at datong station were significantly reduced and the numbers of days of flood flow were significantly decreased fig 3b c and d in these three time periods the numbers of days when the flow rate at yichang station was 40 000 m3 s were 11 7 and 4 d respectively and the numbers of days when the flow rate at hankou station was 50 000 m3 s were 21 8 and 8 d respectively and the numbers of days when the flow rate at datong station was 60 000 m3 s were 26 4 and 12 d respectively fig 3b c and d 3 2 characteristics of sediment inflow to and outflow from the tgr from 1960 to 2002 the amount of sediment coming from the upper reaches of the yangtze river had decreased whereas the change during 1960 to 1980 was smaller the decreasing trend from 1980 to 2002 was mainly related to soil and water conservation and the construction of small reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river yang et al 2018b the difference between the sediment inflow volume entering the tgr area from the yangtze river upper reaches and the sediment outflow from the reservoir decreased by 68 from 4 42 108 t y in 1980 2002 to 1 42 108 t y in 2003 2021 fig 4 in 2003 2021 the inflow and outflow sediment volumes were 26 90 108 and 6 37 108 t respectively therefore the cumulative siltation in the reservoir area was 19 89 108 t which indicates that the tgr blocked 76 of the sediment inflow from the upstream rivershed fig 4 3 3 sediment sorting by the tgr the difference between the inflow and outflow of fine and coarse particles initially decreased but then increased fig 5 a in particular coarse particles exhibited greater variability with a decrease in the magnitude of change in 2013 2021 a change in the outflow volume in 2003 2006 and a marginal magnitude of change in 2007 2021 fig 5b in 2003 2021 the sediment inflow of fine and coarse particles into the tgr area was 25 4 108 and 1 39 108 t whereas the sediment outflow was 6 17 108 and 0 16 108 t and the sediment discharge ratios were 24 and 12 respectively fig 5 the xiluodu dam in the upper main stream of the yangtze river was completed in 2013 the annual volumes of coarse sediments entering the tgr in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were 1090 30 104 and 332 22 104 t respectively which represented a reduction of 73 table 2 the annual volumes of fine sediments were 17 917 20 104 and 8328 89 104 t which represented a reduction of 54 the annual volumes of coarse sediment entering the middle reaches of the yangtze river via the tgr in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were 143 27 104 and 21 11 104 t respectively which represented a reduction of 85 whereas the annual volumes of fine sediments were 4498 20 104 and 1853 33 104 t a reduction of 63 the coarse and fine sediments entering the reservoir area from the upper reaches of the yangtze river are sorted by the tgd in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 the percentages of coarse sediments stored by the reservoir were 87 and 94 and the percentages of stored fine sediments were 75 and 78 respectively 3 4 variations in water and sediment fluxes downstream of the tgd the sediment volumes in the various hydrological stations in the yangtze river middle lower reaches decreased in phases during 1960 2021 tlabe 3 the sediment volumes at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations in 1960 2002 were 4 86 108 4 92 108 4 34 108 3 77 108 4 13 108 3 98 108 and 4 19 108 t y and in 2003 2021 they were 0 34 108 0 41 108 0 50 108 0 67 108 0 83 108 0 95 108 and 1 32 108 t y respectively this corresponded to reductions of 93 92 88 82 80 76 and 69 respectively table 3 regarding the sediment transport relationship between siltation and compensation between yichang and datong in all years between 1960 and 2002 siltation occurred along the route in 88 of the years fig 6 a without considering the influence of the sediment volume of dongting lake poyang lake and hanjiang river between yichang and datong the sediment volume at each station along the route did not change much from 1960 to 1969 the sediment volume along the route from yichang to luoshan station did not change much during 1970 1979 and 1980 1989 whereas that from luoshan to datong station decreased from 1990 to 2002 the sediment volume from yichang to datong station decreased and then increased during 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 fig 6b from 2003 to 2021 sediment transport between yichang and datong was a compensation relationship along the route with a proportion of 100 sediments in the yichang to datong reaches during the 43 year before the completion of the three gorges project were in a siltation state after the completion of three gorges project they were in a compensation state with a weakening trend of compensation 3 5 transport characteristics of coarse and fine sediments in the yangtze river downstream of the tgd the volumes of fine sediments at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations were lower in 2003 2021 than in 1990 2002 fig 7 a the volume of on way fine sediments transported from the yichang to the datong hydrological station increased in 2003 2012 62 and 2013 2021 23 with a lower increase in the latter period this was consistent with the variations in the low volumes recorded downstream moreover the volumes of coarse sediments at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were all lower than those in 1990 2002 fig 7b the volume of coarse sediments from the yichang to the datong station fluctuated in 1990 2002 with initial increasing trends in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 followed by decreasing trends the volumes at the jianli station in 2003 2009 and the hankou hydrological station in 2003 2007 were cumulatively higher than those at both stations in 1990 2002 therefore an average sediment replenishment ratio was observed during these two periods prior to reservoir impoundment the sediment replenishment ratios of fine particles at the hydrological stations were lower in 2003 2021 than in 1990 2002 prior to the tgr operation 4 discussion 4 1 impact of hydrodynamics on sediment sorting after reservoir operation during the flood seasons in 2003 2021 as the water level in the tgr increased the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles in 2003 2006 decreased fig 8 a b from 36 and 33 to 20 and 3 respectively in 2007 2008 the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles in 2009 2021 were 20 and 4 respectively with continuous tgr operations the increasing water levels during the flood season decreased the sediment discharge ratios of both particle groups the tgr inflow exceeded 30 000 m3 s for a maximum of 28 d in 2003 2006 fig 8c d 24 d in 2007 16 d in 2008 and 39 d in 2020 the maximum sediment discharge ratio of fine and coarse particles was 43 in 2006 and 75 in 2003 which rapidly declined to 9 24 and 0 84 5 30 in 2007 2008 followed by an increase to 26 and 7 in 2009 2020 respectively these findings indicate that the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles decreased in response to rising water levels in the tgr the number of days when the tg inflow exceeded 30 000 m3 s showed different impacts on the sediment discharge ratios of the two particle groups particularly for inflow 30 000 m3 s the discharge ratio of fine particles was considerably more than that of coarse particles 4 2 impact of riverbed recharge and exchange on sediment sorting all bankfull channels from yichang to zhicheng reach yzr fig 9 a along the upper jingjiang reach ujr fig 9b along the lower jingjiang reach ljr fig 9c from chenglingji to hankou reach chr fig 9d from and hankou to hukou reach hhr fig 9e experienced cumulative scouring in 2002 2021 with accumulated riverbed scouring of 1 67 108 7 38 108 5 28 108 5 02 108 and 6 90 108 t respectively the reaches from yichang to zhicheng and along the upper jingjiang reach were scoured in 1981 2002 whereas those along the lower jingjiang reach from chenglingji to hankou and from hankou to hukou experienced siltation fig 9f in 2003 2012 the scouring intensity of the reaches from yichang to zhicheng along the upper and lower jingjiang reach significantly increased moreover riverbed scouring owing to the tgr operation was concentrated in the yichang hankou reach the downstream replenishment of coarse sediments in the yichang jianli reach majorly restored the volume to the average value recorded prior to the tgr operations in 2003 2009 in 1981 2002 before the completion of the three gorges project the yichang jianli reach and the upper jingjiang reach underwent scouring whereas the lower jingjiang reach chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches were silting in 2003 2021 all reaches from yichang to hukou were scouring the scouring intensities of the yichang zhicheng reach and upper jingjiang reach in 2012 2021 were significantly lower and higher than those in 2003 2012 respectively moreover the scouring intensities of the chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches in 2012 2021 were significantly lower and higher than those in 2003 2012 respectively whereas the scouring intensity of the lower jingjiang reach in 2012 2021 was similar to that observed in 2003 2012 furthermore the scouring intensities of the chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches in 2012 2021 were significantly higher than those in 2003 2012 table 4 in 2003 2012 the scouring intensity of the bankfull channel in the yichang zhicheng reach composed of sandy cobbles declined significantly thereby reducing the replenishment intensity of coarse sediments consequently the restoration ratio of coarse particles along this reach until the jianli hydrological station was lower in 2012 2021 than in 2003 2012 table 4 in addition although riverbed scouring in the yichang hukou reach replenished and restored fine particles as suspended sediments the overall trend continued to decrease and the average value was lower than that recorded for many years before reservoir impoundment the granular sediment was recovered along the yichang jianli reach and the recovery intensity was closely related to the scouring and siltation amount in the river bed it was also noted that the phenomenon of river bank collapse was more obvious after the operation of the tgp commenced the cumulative length of bank collapse from 2003 to 2021 was 730 km but the scouring in the high beach area was 4 44 13 45 of the scouring of the flood channel the sediment supplied by the riverbed still originated from the area downstream of the bankfull channel the bedload sediments in the yichang shashi reach approximately 152 km were coarser in october 2021 than in october 2002 and 2012 whereas the degree of bedload coarsening in the reach beyond shashi decreased fig 10 a b the replenishment of suspended sediments by bedload sediments decreased owing to riverbed scouring and coarsening therefore the restoration ratio in the yichang jianli reach was lower in 2013 2021 than in 2002 2012 historically a large volume of sediments has been deposited in shoals in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river owing to the decrease in sediment volume from the three gorges dam shoals have undergone scouring decreasing their area by 25 yang et al 2022 the column sampling of the beach soil showed that the thickness of the sandy layer in the upper part of shoals near the dam was limited and the lower part consists of sand and pebble beds field sampling of bed sediments indicated that there was a significant colluvial layer in the sand pebble section and that the volume of movable fine sediments in the pebble bed was minimal fig 10c d and e this indicates that it is difficult for water to scour the bed to compensate the volume of suspended sand 4 3 impact of flow conditions on sediment sorting the monthly mean sediments of sizes d 0 125 mm and d 0 125 mm at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli lushan hankou and datong stations downstream of the tgd were closely related to flow fig 11 confidence interval p 0 05 flow has shown less influence on the recovery of d 0 125 mm and d 0 125 mm sediment as the riverbed gradually coarsened in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the replenishment intensity of d 0 125 mm sediment by riverbed scouring at the yichang to jianli section has decreased after the completion of the three gorges and upstream cascade reservoirs the impact of runoff was preferential but it significantly altered intra annual flow processes gao et al 2014 mei et al 2015 sun et al 2021 moreover the main changes in flow processes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river were the increase in the low water flow decrease in its duration extension of the mid to low water flow duration and decrease in flow during the flood period yang et al 2017a in the meantime the relationships of fine grained medium grained and coarse grained sediment with flow showed a hysteresis effect in the absence of upstream sediment supply the river bed scouring significantly coarsened surface sediments wang et al 2021 in 2003 2021 the three gorges project reduced the upstream flood peak during the flood period with a maximum flow reduction exceeding 31 000 m3 s the reduction in the flow downstream of the dam reduced the bed making effect of floods so the replenishment of coarse sediments by riverbed scour was insufficient and the replenishment of fine sediments also decreased because of the decrease in the evolution time of shoals 4 4 sediment transport trends along the main stream of the yangtze river river basins and the associated physical and ecological processes are under stress worldwide owing to the increasing erosion attributed to land use change sediment interception by dam construction and cascading hydrologic and sedimentation effects of climate change best 2019 the characteristics of sediment transport after damming vary significantly according to local characteristics such as river composition riverbed geology and intensity of human activities significant changes in the water flux and sediment flux of large rivers worldwide have occurred in 24 and 40 of them respectively and the most significant downward trends have been observed in large asian rivers li et al 2020a b the suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes in 414 major rivers based on satellite remote sensing have been investigated dethier et al 2022 the estimations indicate that sediment retention by dams in the northern hemisphere as a direct result of human activities over the past half century has led to a global decrease in sediment flux to 49 of pre dam levels in the southern hemisphere where erosion has been exacerbated by intensive land use change the concentration of suspended sediments in rivers has increased by an average of 41 7 in major asian rivers ob river enisey river selenga river kolyma amur river and others the reduction in sediment transport after damming ranges from 19 to 86 chalov et al 2018 since the 21st century a series of reservoirs such as the tgd xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde have been built in the upper yangtze river basin with a cumulative storage capacity of 1455 108 m3 fig 12 a and fig 12b as the capacity of reservoirs in the upper yangtze river has increased the sediment volume entering the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river through yichang station has decreased with a good correlation fig 12c from 2014 to 2016 the large reservoirs such as xiluodu 2014 storage capacity 115 108 m3 and xiangjiaba 2012 storage capacity 51 63 108 m3 were in operation and a large amount of upstream sediment was trapped in the reservoir area and silted up during 2017 2021 the operation of the wudongde 2021 storage capacity 76 108 m3 and baihetan 2021 storage capacity 206 27 108 m3 hydropower stations reduced the amount of fine grained sediment d 0 125 mm entering the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoir areas at the same time the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoirs caused part of the fine grained sediment deposited to enter the tgr area through dispatching therefore when the sources of upstream fine grained sediment in wudongde and baihetan decreased during 2017 2021 owing to the influence of the dispatching processes of xiluodu and xiangjiaba the amount of fine grained sediment entering the three gorges reservoir area in 2017 2021 was higher than that in 2014 2016 in the future the sediment volume retained by the reservoirs is expected to increase with the operation of more upstream cascade reservoirs and hydroelectric hubs therefore the sediment volume entering the tgr area and downstream areas is expected to decrease whereas the sediment transport volume in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river should recover owing to the compensation capacity of the riverbed nevertheless the degree of recovery is expected to be lower than the average value before the completion of the three gorges project the high regulating capacity of large reservoirs can change the composition of coarse and fine grained sediments transported downstream of reservoirs upstream coarse sediments entering reservoirs especially sand pebbles and gravel are mostly deposited in the reservoirs because of insufficient water flow li et al 2020a b although fine grained sediments can be suspended in water the high capacity of reservoirs allows flocculation and accumulation of fine grained sediment which decreases the amount of fine grained sediments moving to downstream areas of dams this has occurred in the mississippi river blum and roberts 2014 nittrouer and viparelli 2014 yellow river chen et al 2002 cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2017 hnajiang river lu et al 2012 qian et al 2016 rhine river frings et al 2014 shire river mzuza et al 2017 nile river balthazar et al 2013 shaltout et al 2011 and amazon river latrubesse et al 2017 owing to differences in river hydrogeographical environments and reservoirs ability to regulate water and sediments there are differences in the sediment transport conditions downstream of dams the temporal and spatial characteristics of the variation in fine grained and coarse grained sediments along the route are also different basically following the increasing trend of replenishing fine grained sediment along the route besides the compensation intensity and distance of coarse grained sediment vary greatly in reaches downstream of dams near clear water discharge increases the probability of the initiation of fine grained sediment in the riverbed thereby creating a long distance compensation relationship that increases the volume of fine sediments along the reach whereas the compensation relationship is weakened owing to the riverbed coarsening the compensation distance of coarse sediments is significantly smaller than that of fine sediments frings et al 2014 zhu et al 2008 owing to the adjustment effect of reservoirs on flow processes the duration of high flow days is significantly reduced and the compensation capacity of coarse sediment which reduces replenishment along the course in the yangtze river and large alluvial rivers a large number of sandy layers were stored in the riverbed in historical periods cao et al 2012 mei et al 2021 providing abundant sediment sources for riverbed scouring the operation of large reservoirs in the basin changed the flow process and the amount of sediment transport making it difficult for the adjustment of the riverbed downstream of the dam to reach equilibrium in a short period of time the exchange of coarse suspended sediments in the water flow with the surface sediments of the riverbed will not stop the effect of which gradually transmits further downstream and into the estuary area 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of sediment inflow to and outflow from the tgd in 1960 2021 and the characteristics of sediments in the yangtze river middle reaches were analyzed the study primarily aimed to clarify the impact of the tgr on the sorting of fine and coarse sediments and the main conclusions were as follows i the tgr retained 76 of the sediments originating from the yangtze river upper reaches the sediment volumes in the lower reaches of the tgd were restored on way but the total fine and coarse sediment volume were lower than the respective average volumes recorded prior to the construction of the reservoir ii with increasing water levels in the tgr the total sediment volume and the volumes of the two particle groups decreased in 2012 2021 during the flood season of the experimental water storage period may to october the number of days with tgd inflow higher than 30 000 m3 s showed varying effects on the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles particularly the sediment discharge ratio of fine particles was higher than that of coarse particles iii after the tgr became operational the sharp decrease in the sediment volumes downstream of the dam resulted in the long distance cumulative scouring of the riverbed which influenced the sediment restoration ratio of on way fine particles at the initial stages of tgr impoundment the sediment replenishment of coarse particles near the dam was adequate during experimental impoundment channel scouring led to riverbed coarsening which lead the sediment restoration ratios to be lower in 2013 2021 than in 2003 2012 the findings of this study provide an in depth understanding of the effects of infrastructures such as large dams on the sediment geomorphology system

2663,river hydrology and geomorphology are largely influenced by human activities the operation of the three gorges dam tgd which is the largest global hydropower project has caused widespread concern because of its substantial influences on downstream water and sediment fluxes this study assesses the influences of the three gorges reservoir tgr impoundment on sediment sorting and spatial temporal characteristics of downstream transport the results indicate that the reservoir prevented the transport of 76 of the sediments from the upstream basin to the downstream area of the dam and the discharge of fine d 0 125 mm and coarse particles d 0 125 mm was lower than 25 24 and 12 respectively the recovery of total and fine sediments along the lower reaches of the tgd since 2003 was lower than the respective average values before impoundment 1990 2002 the total volume and discharge ratio of coarse and fine sediments decreased owing to the increase in water level and discharge in the reservoir area when the inflow was higher than 30 000 m3 s during the flooding season may october the discharge ratio of fine and coarse sediments increased and remained stable respectively after the tgr operation commenced the sediment reduction within 954 4 km downstream of the dam resulted in a long distance cumulative scouring however coarse sediments were not considerably recovered owing to the gradual coarsening of the riverbed the results of this study help clarify the influences of large dams on the sediment transport in alluvial river systems this study provides an understanding of the effects of human activities in the evolution of the water sediment geomorphology system in rivers keywords sediment sorting transport characteristics sediment discharge ratio three gorges dam yangtze river data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reservoirs dams and other engineering infrastructures constructed to control the dynamic state of a

ocean li et al 2020a b liu and shan 2022 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2018a this decreases the proportion of sediment volumes transported to estuaries kondolf et al 2014 luo et al 2012 in recent decades climate change li et al 2021a and human activities dethier et al 2022 schmitt et al 2019 have considerably affected the yangtze river its runoff process sediment volume and channel morphology allison et al 2012 li et al 2021a milliman and farnsworth 2011 guo et al 2018 2019 after the implementation of large scale water conservancy projects along the yangtze river research on riverbed evolution and fluvial geomorphology has mainly focused on water and sediment conditions and riverbed restoration along the reaches downstream of the tgd the tgd the largest hydropower project worldwide commenced operations in june 2003 zhou et al 2021 as sediments are retained in the reservoir there is a substantial reduction in the proportion of sediment outflow zheng 2016 into the yangtze river middle lower reaches dai et al 2008 dai et al 2009 li et al 2019 lyu et al 2020 yan et al 2021 yang et al 2018b and consequently into the estuary milliman and farnsworth 2011 tang et al 2021 moreover the construction of cascade hydropower stations for water storage and utilization downstream of the jinsha river which is located at the yangtze river upper reaches further disrupts the inflow outflow sediment proportion of the tgr thereby significantly reducing the sediment proportion downstream of the dam dai et al 2018 dong et al 2019 li et al 2018a wang et al 2016b yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 from 1987 to 2019 the median particle size of suspended sediments in the yangtze river upper and middle lower reaches decreased from 20 to 10 μm and increased from 10 to 15 μm respectively dai et al 2008 yang et al 2022 this further intensified sediment flocculation and silting in the reservoir area zhang et al 2022 prior to the tgr operation the riverbed downstream of the dam was predicted to be scoured after the reservoir impoundment the volume of different particle sizes during restoration was not expected to exceed the average volume recorded prior to reservoir impoundment wang et al 2016b these predictions were verified through surveys conducted in 2003 2009 chen et al 2010 li et al 2003 the long distance scouring of the riverbed downstream of the tgd in 2003 2007 was mainly attributed to the non sufficient supply of riverbed sediments especially fine particles li et al 2003 moreover although the sediment volume of fine particles d 0 125 mm in the yangtze river middle reaches gradually increased from 2003 to 2011 it was still lower than the average volume recorded before impoundment in contrast the sediment volume of coarse particles d 0 125 mm within 200 km downstream of the dam increased fast guo et al 2014 2020 chen et al 2022 furthermore the riverbed in the yangtze river middle lower reaches has been coarsening since 2003 li et al 2018b yao et al 2022 especially within 0 200 km near the dam he et al 2022 yang et al 2016 2017a zhang et al 2017 approximately 90 9 of the total area scoured in the yichang datong reach in 2003 2018 was accountable to fine particles of which the yichang luoshan reach experienced both fine and coarse particle scouring in the luoshan datong reach fine particles were scoured but coarse particles were silted in 2003 2012 han et al 2018 yang et al 2016 when the sandy riverbed of the jingjiang reach near the dam was scoured and coarsened suspended matter was majorly transported 81 87 in contrast the bedload supplied the sediments 8 12 when the riverbed was silted and refined xu et al 2021 the bedload volume at the luoshan and hankou stations in 2009 2015 was 137 104 and 152 104 t y respectively yao et al 2017 and the restoration coefficient during the flood season was greater than that during the dry season li et al 2021b 2021c the increasing water levels in the tgr further modified the flow process downstream of the dam including changes in flow redistribution between the flood and dry seasons yan et al 2021 yang et al 2017a zheng 2016 and in the duration of flood flow yan et al 2021 zheng 2016 the changes in the flow process affected the characteristics of various sediment particles owing to the long term water storage in the tgr the sediment composition of the riverbed downstream of the dam has also constantly changed owing to the long term water storage and the exchange of coarse fine particles has restricted the supply of suspended sediments from the bedload moreover the changes in the flow process have affected the capacity of the bedload to supply suspended sediments this study aims to investigate the impacts of the tgr operations on the sorting of coarse and fine particles and the relationship between the relevant factors affecting water and sediment volumes in 1960 2021 at different hydrological stations along the main stream of the yangtze river in addition the restoration ratio of coarse and fine particles and the spatio temporal variations along 954 4 km downstream of the tgd from yichang to hukou reach were analyzed to further clarify the impacts of the tgr operations on the sorting of coarse and fine particles the tgr was also analyzed to further clarify the impacts of its operations on the sorting and transport processes of sediment particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau and it flows across 11 provinces in china and extends 6397 km eastward to the east

stations were analyzed to investigate the yichang hukou reach and the yichang hukou reach which is located downstream of the tgd fig 1c the dongting lake on the yangtze river south bank was monitored by the chenglingji hydrological station the lake is fed by songzikou taipingkou and ouchikou outlets which are located at decreasing altitudes and commonly referred to as the three outlets after water cycling in the lake area the water flow joins the yangtze river main stream after passing through the qilishan or chenglingji hydrological station the xiantao hydrological station is located in wuhan city at the confluence of the hanjiang river on the yangtze river north bank and the yangtze river finally the hukou hydrological station is located where the water of poyang lake located on the

outflow sediment volumes from the reservoir to the huanglingmiao hydrological station during 2003 2021 were collected to analyze the impact of the tgr on silt blocking the impacts of reservoir operations on the sediment volumes of fine and coarse particles in 2003 2021 were analyzed using data on silt blocking and storage and sediment discharge from the inbound and outbound hydrological stations of the tgr among them d 0 125 mm is used as the critical particle size of suspended matter and bed material load in the water body this is consistent with the classification standard in the existing research yang et al 2017b before 2002 the sieving method was used for sediment particle size measurement while after 2002 the laser particle size method was used and the consistency of the data was checked moreover sediment conditions were analyzed using the flow and sediment data acquired from the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations during 1960 2021 further the impact of the confluent divergent relationship between tributaries and riverine lakes on sediment flow in the yangtze river main stream was assessed based on the flow and sediment volume data for 1960 2021 spatiotemporal variations in sediment flow were collected from the three outlets of the dongting lake and the chenglingji xiantao along the hanjiang river and hukou poyang lake hydrological stations spatiotemporal variations in the transport of fine and coarse sediment particles were analyzed using sediment gradation data acquired from the yichang hydrological station moreover bedload sediment data of the yichang hukou reach for october 2002 2012 and 2021 were collected to analyze the impact of the sediments on the on way restoration of the fine the annual

in the reservoir area the amounts of sediment scouring silting in the tgr area sreservoir 108 t y were determined based on the difference between the sediment inflow from the upstream rivershed to the reservoir sinflow 108 t y and the sediment outflow released from the dam soutflow 108 t y the difference between the sediment inflow sinflow 108 t y and outflow soutflow 108 t y was determined positive and negative values indicated siltation and scouring in the reservoir area respectively the total sediment in the reservoir sreservoir was calculated as 1 s reservoir s inflow s outflow three inflow sediment control stations namely cuntan szhutuo 108 t y beibei sbeibei 108 t y and wulong swulong 108 t y were located in the yangtze river upper reaches before the sediments reached the tgr

station in 2002 was used as a reference for this study riverbeds below the water line along the yichang hukou reach corresponding to a 30 000 m3 s and 50 000 m3 s flow rate at the yichang hydrological station represented the bankfull and flood channels the river reach was divided into several near equidistant sections at decreasing altitudes the sectional areas were calculated using the trapezoidal method as follows fig 2 5 a j h i j h i 1 j h i j h i 1 j b i 3 i 0 1 2 3 m j 0 1 2 3 n where a j is the area of cross section j unit m2 h i j and hi 1 j are the elevations of the i th and i 1 th

1 variations in characteristic flow process of the three gorges reservoir and downstream of the dam the operation of the tgr has significantly changed the flow process from the upper reaches of the yangtze river to its middle and lower reaches fig 3 a the upstream peak flow in flood season was effectively reduced and the maximum flow was reduced by 31 000 m3 s taking the yichang hankou and hankou hydrological stations in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as the observation objects during 1990 2002 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 the numbers of days with flow below 50 000 m3 s at yichang station below 10 000 m3 s at hankou station and below 10 000 m3 s at datong station were significantly reduced and the numbers of days of flood flow were significantly decreased fig 3b c and d in these three time periods the numbers of days when the flow rate at yichang station was 40 000 m3 s were 11 7 and 4 d respectively and the numbers of days when the flow rate at hankou station was 50 000 m3 s were 21 8 and 8 d respectively and the numbers of days when the flow rate at datong station was 60 000 m3 s were 26 4 and 12 d respectively fig 3b c and d 3 2 characteristics of sediment inflow to and outflow from the tgr from 1960 to 2002 the amount of sediment coming from the upper reaches of the yangtze river had decreased whereas the change during 1960 to 1980 was smaller the decreasing trend from 1980 to 2002 was mainly related to soil and water conservation and the construction of small reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river yang et al 2018b the difference between the sediment inflow volume entering the tgr area from the yangtze river upper reaches and the sediment outflow from the reservoir decreased by 68 from 4 42 108 t y in 1980 2002 to 1 42 108 t y in 2003 2021 fig 4 in 2003 2021 the inflow and outflow sediment volumes were 26 90 108 and 6 37 108 t respectively therefore the cumulative siltation in the reservoir area was 19 89 108 t which indicates that the tgr blocked 76 of the sediment inflow from the upstream rivershed fig 4 3 3 sediment sorting by the tgr the difference between the inflow and outflow of fine and coarse particles initially decreased but then increased fig 5 a in particular coarse particles exhibited greater variability with a decrease in the magnitude of change in 2013 2021 a change in the outflow volume in 2003 2006 and a marginal magnitude of change in 2007 2021 fig 5b in 2003 2021 the sediment inflow of fine and coarse particles into the tgr area was 25 4 108 and 1 39 108 t whereas the sediment outflow was 6 17 108 and 0 16 108 t and the sediment discharge ratios were 24 and 12 respectively fig 5 the xiluodu dam in the upper main stream of the yangtze river was completed in 2013 the annual volumes of coarse sediments entering the tgr in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were 1090 30 104 and 332 22 104 t respectively which represented a reduction of 73 table 2 the annual volumes of fine sediments were 17 917 20 104 and 8328 89 104 t which represented a reduction of 54 the annual volumes of coarse sediment entering the middle reaches of the yangtze river via the tgr in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were 143 27 104 and 21 11 104 t respectively which represented a reduction of 85 whereas the annual volumes of fine sediments were 4498 20 104 and 1853 33 104 t a reduction of 63 the coarse and fine sediments entering the reservoir area from the upper reaches of the yangtze river are sorted by the tgd in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 the percentages of coarse sediments stored by the reservoir were 87 and 94 and the percentages of stored fine sediments were 75 and 78 respectively 3 4 variations in water and sediment fluxes downstream of the tgd the sediment volumes in the various hydrological stations in the yangtze river middle lower reaches decreased in phases during 1960 2021 tlabe 3 the sediment volumes at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations in 1960 2002 were 4 86 108 4 92 108 4 34 108 3 77 108 4 13 108 3 98 108 and 4 19 108 t y and in 2003 2021 they were 0 34 108 0 41 108 0 50 108 0 67 108 0 83 108 0 95 108 and 1 32 108 t y respectively this corresponded to reductions of 93 92 88 82 80 76 and 69 respectively table 3 regarding the sediment transport relationship between siltation and compensation between yichang and datong in all years between 1960 and 2002 siltation occurred along the route in 88 of the years fig 6 a without considering the influence of the sediment volume of dongting lake poyang lake and hanjiang river between yichang and datong the sediment volume at each station along the route did not change much from 1960 to 1969 the sediment volume along the route from yichang to luoshan station did not change much during 1970 1979 and 1980 1989 whereas that from luoshan to datong station decreased from 1990 to 2002 the sediment volume from yichang to datong station decreased and then increased during 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 fig 6b from 2003 to 2021 sediment transport between yichang and datong was a compensation relationship along the route with a proportion of 100 sediments in the yichang to datong reaches during the 43 year before the completion of the three gorges project were in a siltation state after the completion of three gorges project they were in a compensation state with a weakening trend of compensation 3 5 transport characteristics of coarse and fine sediments in the yangtze river downstream of the tgd the volumes of fine sediments at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations were lower in 2003 2021 than in 1990 2002 fig 7 a the volume of on way fine sediments transported from the yichang to the datong hydrological station increased in 2003 2012 62 and 2013 2021 23 with a lower increase in the latter period this was consistent with the variations in the low volumes recorded downstream moreover the volumes of coarse sediments at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli luoshan hankou and datong hydrological stations in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 were all lower than those in 1990 2002 fig 7b the volume of coarse sediments from the yichang to the datong station fluctuated in 1990 2002 with initial increasing trends in 2003 2012 and 2013 2021 followed by decreasing trends the volumes at the jianli station in 2003 2009 and the hankou hydrological station in 2003 2007 were cumulatively higher than those at both stations in 1990 2002 therefore an average sediment replenishment ratio was observed during these two periods prior to reservoir impoundment the sediment replenishment ratios of fine particles at the hydrological stations were lower in 2003 2021 than in 1990 2002 prior to the tgr operation 4 discussion 4 1 impact of hydrodynamics on sediment sorting after reservoir operation during the flood seasons in 2003 2021 as the water level in the tgr increased the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles in 2003 2006 decreased fig 8 a b from 36 and 33 to 20 and 3 respectively in 2007 2008 the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles in 2009 2021 were 20 and 4 respectively with continuous tgr operations the increasing water levels during the flood season decreased the sediment discharge ratios of both particle groups the tgr inflow exceeded 30 000 m3 s for a maximum of 28 d in 2003 2006 fig 8c d 24 d in 2007 16 d in 2008 and 39 d in 2020 the maximum sediment discharge ratio of fine and coarse particles was 43 in 2006 and 75 in 2003 which rapidly declined to 9 24 and 0 84 5 30 in 2007 2008 followed by an increase to 26 and 7 in 2009 2020 respectively these findings indicate that the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles decreased in response to rising water levels in the tgr the number of days when the tg inflow exceeded 30 000 m3 s showed different impacts on the sediment discharge ratios of the two particle groups particularly for inflow 30 000 m3 s the discharge ratio of fine particles was considerably more than that of coarse particles 4 2 impact of riverbed recharge and exchange on sediment sorting all bankfull channels from yichang to zhicheng reach yzr fig 9 a along the upper jingjiang reach ujr fig 9b along the lower jingjiang reach ljr fig 9c from chenglingji to hankou reach chr fig 9d from and hankou to hukou reach hhr fig 9e experienced cumulative scouring in 2002 2021 with accumulated riverbed scouring of 1 67 108 7 38 108 5 28 108 5 02 108 and 6 90 108 t respectively the reaches from yichang to zhicheng and along the upper jingjiang reach were scoured in 1981 2002 whereas those along the lower jingjiang reach from chenglingji to hankou and from hankou to hukou experienced siltation fig 9f in 2003 2012 the scouring intensity of the reaches from yichang to zhicheng along the upper and lower jingjiang reach significantly increased moreover riverbed scouring owing to the tgr operation was concentrated in the yichang hankou reach the downstream replenishment of coarse sediments in the yichang jianli reach majorly restored the volume to the average value recorded prior to the tgr operations in 2003 2009 in 1981 2002 before the completion of the three gorges project the yichang jianli reach and the upper jingjiang reach underwent scouring whereas the lower jingjiang reach chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches were silting in 2003 2021 all reaches from yichang to hukou were scouring the scouring intensities of the yichang zhicheng reach and upper jingjiang reach in 2012 2021 were significantly lower and higher than those in 2003 2012 respectively moreover the scouring intensities of the chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches in 2012 2021 were significantly lower and higher than those in 2003 2012 respectively whereas the scouring intensity of the lower jingjiang reach in 2012 2021 was similar to that observed in 2003 2012 furthermore the scouring intensities of the chenglingji hankou and hankou hukou reaches in 2012 2021 were significantly higher than those in 2003 2012 table 4 in 2003 2012 the scouring intensity of the bankfull channel in the yichang zhicheng reach composed of sandy cobbles declined significantly thereby reducing the replenishment intensity of coarse sediments consequently the restoration ratio of coarse particles along this reach until the jianli hydrological station was lower in 2012 2021 than in 2003 2012 table 4 in addition although riverbed scouring in the yichang hukou reach replenished and restored fine particles as suspended sediments the overall trend continued to decrease and the average value was lower than that recorded for many years before reservoir impoundment the granular sediment was recovered along the yichang jianli reach and the recovery intensity was closely related to the scouring and siltation amount in the river bed it was also noted that the phenomenon of river bank collapse was more obvious after the operation of the tgp commenced the cumulative length of bank collapse from 2003 to 2021 was 730 km but the scouring in the high beach area was 4 44 13 45 of the scouring of the flood channel the sediment supplied by the riverbed still originated from the area downstream of the bankfull channel the bedload sediments in the yichang shashi reach approximately 152 km were coarser in october 2021 than in october 2002 and 2012 whereas the degree of bedload coarsening in the reach beyond shashi decreased fig 10 a b the replenishment of suspended sediments by bedload sediments decreased owing to riverbed scouring and coarsening therefore the restoration ratio in the yichang jianli reach was lower in 2013 2021 than in 2002 2012 historically a large volume of sediments has been deposited in shoals in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river owing to the decrease in sediment volume from the three gorges dam shoals have undergone scouring decreasing their area by 25 yang et al 2022 the column sampling of the beach soil showed that the thickness of the sandy layer in the upper part of shoals near the dam was limited and the lower part consists of sand and pebble beds field sampling of bed sediments indicated that there was a significant colluvial layer in the sand pebble section and that the volume of movable fine sediments in the pebble bed was minimal fig 10c d and e this indicates that it is difficult for water to scour the bed to compensate the volume of suspended sand 4 3 impact of flow conditions on sediment sorting the monthly mean sediments of sizes d 0 125 mm and d 0 125 mm at the yichang zhicheng shashi jianli lushan hankou and datong stations downstream of the tgd were closely related to flow fig 11 confidence interval p 0 05 flow has shown less influence on the recovery of d 0 125 mm and d 0 125 mm sediment as the riverbed gradually coarsened in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the replenishment intensity of d 0 125 mm sediment by riverbed scouring at the yichang to jianli section has decreased after the completion of the three gorges and upstream cascade reservoirs the impact of runoff was preferential but it significantly altered intra annual flow processes gao et al 2014 mei et al 2015 sun et al 2021 moreover the main changes in flow processes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river were the increase in the low water flow decrease in its duration extension of the mid to low water flow duration and decrease in flow during the flood period yang et al 2017a in the meantime the relationships of fine grained medium grained and coarse grained sediment with flow showed a hysteresis effect in the absence of upstream sediment supply the river bed scouring significantly coarsened surface sediments wang et al 2021 in 2003 2021 the three gorges project reduced the upstream flood peak during the flood period with a maximum flow reduction exceeding 31 000 m3 s the reduction in the flow downstream of the dam reduced the bed making effect of floods so the replenishment of coarse sediments by riverbed scour was insufficient and the replenishment of fine sediments also decreased because of the decrease in the evolution time of shoals 4 4 sediment transport trends along the main stream of the yangtze river river basins and the associated physical and ecological processes are under stress worldwide owing to the increasing erosion attributed to land use change sediment interception by dam construction and cascading hydrologic and sedimentation effects of climate change best 2019 the characteristics of sediment transport after damming vary significantly according to local characteristics such as river composition riverbed geology and intensity of human activities significant changes in the water flux and sediment flux of large rivers worldwide have occurred in 24 and 40 of them respectively and the most significant downward trends have been observed in large asian rivers li et al 2020a b the suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes in 414 major rivers based on satellite remote sensing have been investigated dethier et al 2022 the estimations indicate that sediment retention by dams in the northern hemisphere as a direct result of human activities over the past half century has led to a global decrease in sediment flux to 49 of pre dam levels in the southern hemisphere where erosion has been exacerbated by intensive land use change the concentration of suspended sediments in rivers has increased by an average of 41 7 in major asian rivers ob river enisey river selenga river kolyma amur river and others the reduction in sediment transport after damming ranges from 19 to 86 chalov et al 2018 since the 21st century a series of reservoirs such as the tgd xiangjiaba xiluodu baihetan and wudongde have been built in the upper yangtze river basin with a cumulative storage capacity of 1455 108 m3 fig 12 a and fig 12b as the capacity of reservoirs in the upper yangtze river has increased the sediment volume entering the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river through yichang station has decreased with a good correlation fig 12c from 2014 to 2016 the large reservoirs such as xiluodu 2014 storage capacity 115 108 m3 and xiangjiaba 2012 storage capacity 51 63 108 m3 were in operation and a large amount of upstream sediment was trapped in the reservoir area and silted up during 2017 2021 the operation of the wudongde 2021 storage capacity 76 108 m3 and baihetan 2021 storage capacity 206 27 108 m3 hydropower stations reduced the amount of fine grained sediment d 0 125 mm entering the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoir areas at the same time the xiluodu and xiangjiaba reservoirs caused part of the fine grained sediment deposited to enter the tgr area through dispatching therefore when the sources of upstream fine grained sediment in wudongde and baihetan decreased during 2017 2021 owing to the influence of the dispatching processes of xiluodu and xiangjiaba the amount of fine grained sediment entering the three gorges reservoir area in 2017 2021 was higher than that in 2014 2016 in the future the sediment volume retained by the reservoirs is expected to increase with the operation of more upstream cascade reservoirs and hydroelectric hubs therefore the sediment volume entering the tgr area and downstream areas is expected to decrease whereas the sediment transport volume in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river should recover owing to the compensation capacity of the riverbed nevertheless the degree of recovery is expected to be lower than the average value before the completion of the three gorges project the high regulating capacity of large reservoirs can change the composition of coarse and fine grained sediments transported downstream of reservoirs upstream coarse sediments entering reservoirs especially sand pebbles and gravel are mostly deposited in the reservoirs because of insufficient water flow li et al 2020a b although fine grained sediments can be suspended in water the high capacity of reservoirs allows flocculation and accumulation of fine grained sediment which decreases the amount of fine grained sediments moving to downstream areas of dams this has occurred in the mississippi river blum and roberts 2014 nittrouer and viparelli 2014 yellow river chen et al 2002 cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2017 hnajiang river lu et al 2012 qian et al 2016 rhine river frings et al 2014 shire river mzuza et al 2017 nile river balthazar et al 2013 shaltout et al 2011 and amazon river latrubesse et al 2017 owing to differences in river hydrogeographical environments and reservoirs ability to regulate water and sediments there are differences in the sediment transport conditions downstream of dams the temporal and spatial characteristics of the variation in fine grained and coarse grained sediments along the route are also different basically following the increasing trend of replenishing fine grained sediment along the route besides the compensation intensity and distance of coarse grained sediment vary greatly in reaches downstream of dams near clear water discharge increases the probability of the initiation of fine grained sediment in the riverbed thereby creating a long distance compensation relationship that increases the volume of fine sediments along the reach whereas the compensation relationship is weakened owing to the riverbed coarsening the compensation distance of coarse sediments is significantly smaller than that of fine sediments frings et al 2014 zhu et al 2008 owing to the adjustment effect of reservoirs on flow processes the duration of high flow days is significantly reduced and the compensation capacity of coarse sediment which reduces replenishment along the course in the yangtze river and large alluvial rivers a large number of sandy layers were stored in the riverbed in historical periods cao et al 2012 mei et al 2021 providing abundant sediment sources for riverbed scouring the operation of large reservoirs in the basin changed the flow process and the amount of sediment transport making it difficult for the adjustment of the riverbed downstream of the dam to reach equilibrium in a short period of time the exchange of coarse suspended sediments in the water flow with the surface sediments of the riverbed will not stop the effect of which gradually transmits further downstream and into the estuary area 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of sediment inflow to and outflow from the tgd in 1960 2021 and the characteristics of sediments in the yangtze river middle reaches were analyzed the study primarily aimed to clarify the impact of the tgr on the sorting of fine and coarse sediments and the main conclusions were as follows i the tgr retained 76 of the sediments originating from the yangtze river upper reaches the sediment volumes in the lower reaches of the tgd were restored on way but the total fine and coarse sediment volume were lower than the respective average volumes recorded prior to the construction of the reservoir ii with increasing water levels in the tgr the total sediment volume and the volumes of the two particle groups decreased in 2012 2021 during the flood season of the experimental water storage period may to october the number of days with tgd inflow higher than 30 000 m3 s showed varying effects on the sediment discharge ratios of fine and coarse particles particularly the sediment discharge ratio of fine particles was higher than that of coarse particles iii after the tgr became operational the sharp decrease in the sediment volumes downstream of the dam resulted in the long distance cumulative scouring of the riverbed which influenced the sediment restoration ratio of on way fine particles at the initial stages of tgr impoundment the sediment replenishment of coarse particles near the dam was adequate during experimental impoundment channel scouring led to riverbed coarsening which lead the sediment restoration ratios to be lower in 2013 2021 than in 2003 2012 the findings of this study provide an in depth understanding of the effects of infrastructures such as large dams on the sediment geomorphology system

2664,determination of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the water retention curve θ h is of paramount importance to characterize the hydraulic behavior of the vadose zone given the van genuchten hydraulic model defined by the residual θr and saturated θs volumetric water content and the α and n parameters this work presents a new laboratory procedure to estimate ks θs n and α for a drainage process αdr from the inverse analysis of successive drainage steady states curves generated by a tension gradient between the surface and the base of a soil column to this end a double disc system one connected a bubbling tower and placed at the soil surface and the second one placed under the soil core was employed the second disc was connected to an air vacuum system the experiment presented two parts a first 1d downward infiltration at saturation on a dry soil column followed by successive drainage steps during the drainage process the tension of the upper and lower discs varied between 0 and 5 cm and from 5 to 100 cm respectively the soil sorptivity s and θs were calculated from the 1d transient infiltration measure ks was calculated by darcy s law αdr and n were optimized from the inverse analysis of the steady state curves under tension gradient and α for a wetting process αw was calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n once ks estimated αdr and n were optimized by minimizing the q h b h n objective function where hb and hn are the experimental and calculated tensions at the base of the soil core given a αdr value the optimimum n was computed as the value that provides a minimum q by repeating this process for a sequence of αdr different q isolines were obtained one for each hb value which crossing point corresponded to the actual αdr and n values the method was tested on 2 5 cm high columns of four different synthetic soils next it was applied on an experimental sand column of 5 cm height and on 2 5 cm high columns filled with sieved loam clay loam and clay soil the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured in the same soils with the pressure plate technique and αw was contrasted with the corresponding value calculated with an empirical hysteresis model the method which was fast from 1 to 2 h and easy to implement for small scale experiments was successfully applied to soil samples 2 5 cm high and allowed to explore a range of soil tensions from 0 to 100 cm overall accurate estimates of θs ks αdr and n were obtained in both synthetic and experimental soils a significant relationship was also obtained between αw estimated from s and the corresponding value calculated from the hysteresis model keywords water retention curve hydraulic properties inverse analysis hydraulic conductivity upward infiltration constant head method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate determination of soil hydraulic properties is of paramount importance for correct simulation of soil water flow in the vadose zone the soil hydraulic properties are defined by the water retention and the hydraulic conductivity functions the soil water retention curve θ h expresses the relationship between the volumetric water content θ l3 l 3 and the matric potential h l under static conditions the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ability of the fluid to pass through the pores of the material newby et al 2009 its value decreases with the soil water content as the soil moisture decreases the total number of water conductive pathways along which fluid can travel reduces and hence the k h value accordingly the k h is a measure of the increased impedance to water flow with decreasing moisture content mccartney et al 2007 these functions are characteristic for different types of soil van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 described one of the most employed models to characterize θ h and k h in this case θ h is defined by the saturated θs and residual θr volumetric water contents the empirical α and n factors and the m parameter commonly defined as m 1 1 n θr expresses the water content for which dθ dh becomes zero excluding the region near θs which also has a zero gradient n which is related to pore size distribution defines the slope of θ h and α l 1 is a scale factor that describes the shape of θ h near θs k h can be defined as a function of α n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks defined this last one as the soil ability to transmit water at saturation conditions the soil water retention function is subject to the hysteresis phenomenon manifested as a difference between equilibrium curves of soil wetting and drying hysteresis loop e g hillel 1998 this means that water content in the drying or drainage branch of water potential is larger than water content in the wetting branch for the same value of water potential the causes of hysteresis can be the variation in contact angle at different wetting and drying cycles entrapped air in a newly wetted soil temperature swelling and shrinking and ink bottle effect due to nonuniformity in shape and sizes of both individual pores and interconnected pore networks bachmann and van der ploeg 2002 maqsoud et al 2004 laboratory methods to determine the soil hysteresis are both time consuming and complicated to overcome this limitation different physical and empirical models for predicting one branch of the water retention relation have been developed pham et al 2003 gebrenegus and ghzzehei 2011 to date two families of methods to characterize the soil hydraulic properties under laboratory conditions are available those based on direct measures and those founded on the inverse numerical analysis of richard s water flows the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be directly measured with either the constant head or the falling head methods klute and dirksen 1986 among the direct techniques to measure the water retention curve the pressure membrane apparatus richards 1941 which is considered as the reference laboratory method determines θ h from measured θ and h pairs although this technique has been progressively improved by introducing different ways to estimate θ jones et al 2005 moret fernández et al 2012 the long time required to complete a measurement together with errors of apparatus in fine textured soils solone et al 2012 may limit its use another direct procedure is the evaporation method wind 1968 wendroth et al 1993 among others where the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data are obtained through monitoring of the water content evaporation and matric potential dynamics at various heights of a soil sample exposed to evaporation although this method can extend the range of pressures up close to the wilting point schindler et al 2010 it is time consuming it has to use relatively long soil cores 6 11 cm and results inaccurate at near saturation conditions sarkar et al 2019 to overcome this last limitation the evaporation method is commonly complemented with the double disc or quasi unit gradient percolation procedure which currently is the most straightforward way to measure unsaturated hydraulic conductivity near saturation dirksen 1999 in this case water is supplied at the top of a soil column and drained at the bottom by suction this requires the pressure head at the bottom to be adjusted to a value corresponding to the pressure head measured in the soil near the top sarkar et al 2019 however although this method allows estimating the hydraulic conductivity at near saturation conditions it is time consuming and the applied tension is limited to from 0 to 10 cm sarkar et al 2019 currently four different 1d transient methods can be used to estimate soil hydraulic properties by inverse analysis evaporation and horizontal downward and upward infiltration processes the main advantage of these techniques is the simultaneous estimate of θ h and k h moret fernández et al 2016 in the horizontal infiltration method shao and horton 1998 ks is measured by darcy s law and α and n parameters are estimated with an integral method that simulates the problem of water absorption into a horizontal soil column to this end a 20 cm length transparent cylinder should be used the 1d downward infiltration method based on the inverse analysis of a single transient cumulative infiltration at saturated conditions allows determining the soil sorptivity s and ks lassabatere et al 2009 latorre et al 2015 moret fernández et al 2021b but not the β parameter latorre et al 2018 defined haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b s which is defined as a measure of the capacity of a medium to absorb or desorb liquid by capillarity philip 1957 can be expressed as function of the initial θi and saturated θs water content ks and the α and n parameters of the van genuchten 1980 water retention model moret fernández et al 2017 β is an integral shape parameter which can be expressed as function of θi θs and the shape n parameter of the van genuchten 1980 water retention model moret fernández and latorre 2017 however given the inverse analysis of a 1d transient infiltration allows only estimating two s and ks of the three parameters of the haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model latorre et al 2018 α and n cannot be estimated from s and thus from a transient infiltration curve simunek and van genuchten 1996 among the wide variety of existing procedures to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters from the inverse analysis of an upward infiltration curves hudson et al 1996 young et al 2002 moret fernández et al 2016 peña sancho et al 2017 the most complete one is that presented by latorre and moret fernández 2019 and moret fernández et al 2021a which allows determining four of the five van genuchten 1980 parameters from the inverse analysis of a single infiltration curve however although this method is accurate can work with short 5 cm high cores and run with disturbed and undisturbed soils the inverse analysis is time consuming from 2 to 20 days and requires high performance computing on the other hand since the inverse analysis of transient infiltrations measured in stratified soils profile leads to erroneous estimates of soil hydraulic parameters moret fernández et al 2021b the inverse analysis of a 1d upward infiltration should be limited to homogeneous soil profiles however soil heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception under field conditions abou najm et al 2019 for example the application of the sequential inverse analysis sia moret fernández et al 2021b method on 20 infiltration experiments showed that in 85 of the soils analyzed the thickness of the homogeneous topsoil layer was less than 3 cm this problem associated with soil layering could be minimized for instance by using shorter soil columns or analyzing steady state infiltration curves in summary although there is a large variety of laboratory methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties most of them presents some of the following constraints i long measurement or analysis time ii limitations in the applied tension iii high computing requirements iv poor behavior in stratified soils or v use of long soil columns the objective of this work is to present a new laboratory method and a numerical procedure to estimate the soil hydraulic properties s ks θs α and n attenuating most of the above mentioned limitations in the proposed method the soil hydraulic properties for a drainage process are estimated from the inverse analysis of successive steady states drainage curves generated by applying a tension gradient between the surface and the base of a soil cylinder based on the quasi unit gradient percolation procedure the method employs a double disc system one placed at the surface and the other one at the base of the soil column where tensions in the upper and lower discs range between 0 5 and 5 100 cm respectively this procedure generates a first downward infiltration on an initially dry soil column followed by successive steady state drainages curves of increasing rates in this case s and θs are measured from the 1d transient infiltration curve at saturation conditions ks is measured by darcy s law when tensions at the surface and bottom of the soil column are equal to 0 cm and n and α for a drainage process αdr are estimated form the inverse analysis of the drainage curves finally α for a wetting process αw is calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n the method was first validated on four different synthetic soils columns of 2 5 cm high the successive steady state drainage experiment was also employed to check how quickly the infiltration curve stabilizes after the suction at the bottom increases making use of a new design of double disc plus air vacuum system the method was applied on four sieved soils columns with different textures from sand to clay and the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured with the pressure plate method the estimated αw was compared to the corresponding value calculated from αdr using an empirical hysteresis model 2 theory 2 1 soil hydraulic functions and cumulative infiltration model the governing flow equation for one dimensional isothermal darcian flow in a variably saturated rigid porous medium is given by the modified form of the richards equation 1 d θ dt d dz k dh dz k where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is the soil water pressure head l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 z is a vertical coordinate l positive upward and t is time t under steady state conditions eq 1 simplifies to 2 q d dz k dh dz k where q is the water flux density l t 1 for saturated soils condition eq 2 reduces to the darcy s law lichtner et al 1996 3 q k s dz dh where and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and h h z is the total head the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be described with the van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 models according to 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m 5 k h k s 1 α h n 1 1 α h n m 2 1 α h n m 2 where θs and θr are the saturated and residual volumetric water content l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 and n are a scale and shape parameter respectively and m 1 1 n according to van genuchten 1980 θr is defined as the water content for which the gradient dθ dh becomes zero the soil water retention function is subject to a hysteresis phenomenon manifested as a difference between equilibrium curves of soil wetting and drying hysteresis loop e g hillel 1998 given that the soil hysteresis affects only the α value haverkamp et al 2002 a scale parameter for wetting αw and drainage αdr processes should be defined the αw parameter can be predicted from drying water retention data using the ih index gebrenegus and ghezzehei 2011 6 i h r n 1 r n n 1 2 n 1 1 1 n 1 r n 1 r n r n 2 2 n 1 1 n 1 where r αdr αw in the absence of measured wetting and drying water retention data ih is calculated as ih 0 378 ln n 7 the 1d cumulative infiltration i 1 d under saturation conditions can be described by the haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model

2009 however because β has a negligible influence on 1d infiltration latorre et al 2018 a constant β is commonly considered angulo jaramillo et al 2019 given the complexity to solve the implicit eq 8

material and methods the proposed 1d laboratory method consists of a downward 1d infiltration at saturation followed by a sequence of drainage curves obtained these last ones by applying increasing tension gradients between the surface and the base of the soil core this compound measure allows obtaining a transient infiltration curve followed by successive steady state flows with increasing slopes fig 1 in order to distinguish between the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from the transient cumulative infiltration to that calculated from the steady state from now on this term will be defined as khk and ks respectively 3 1 estimation of khk s and θs from the 1d cumulative infiltration curve s and khk were calculated by applying the sequential infiltration analysis sia moret fernández et al 2021b to the 1d transient cumulative infiltration curve which runs from t 0 to t at which free drainage begins fig 1 the sia method estimates s and khk of the upper soil layer by fitting 4 t eq 9 to increasing time series and computes the rmse as a function of the number of samples the optimal infiltration time to is defined by the minimum rmse and the actual s and khk are the corresponding values calculated for an infiltration curve of time to the levenberg marquardt more 1978 optimization algorithm was incorporated in the inverse analysis a total of 50 increasing times ranged from 50 to 100 s to the whole available infiltration data were considered the thickness of the soil surface layer was defined as the position of the wetting front advance wfa at time to which was calculated as lassabatere et al 2009 11 wfa i 1 d t 0 θ s θ i where i1d t0 was calculated by applying the previously optimized ks s and β 0 6 to 12 i 1 d t 0 s t 0 1 2 2 β 3 k s t 0 k s 2 9 s β 2

soil column and if denotes total infiltration at the time when the wetting front reaches the bottom of the soil column and the steady state begins fig 1 3 2 estimation of αdr n and ks from the succssive steady states curves as above mentioned the drainage process consisted of applying successive tension gradients between the soil surface ht and the base hb of the soil core to this end the following procedure was used 1 the first pair of tensions defined by atmospheric conditions at the top and bottom ht hb 0 cm of the soil column allowed calculating ks according to eq 3 for this specific case dz dh ks q where q corresponded to the slope of the correspondig steady state curve fig 1 2 next to allow a partial desaturation of the soil surface and thus facilitate the entry of air to favor the drainage of the lower soil layers sarkar et al 2019 a second set of tension of ht hb 5 cm was applied from this time incresing hb values keeping ht 5 cm were selected this process allows obtaining a seccuence of straight lines of increasing slope which are related to the incresing hb values fig 1 in this case the q value calculated for each pair of ht hb values correspondeded to the slope of the respective drainage sections given this analysis corresponds to a drainage process the estimated α will be correspond to αdr 3 once ks and corresponding q were obtained the optimal n and αdr values were calculated as follows firstly a numerical procedure to estimate the bottom tension of the soil column hn was developed given a soil column of height l and assuming ks q ht αdr and n as known values hn can be iteratively calculated from eq 2 as h 2 h t d l k s q 1 k h 2 k s 1 α h 2 n 1 1 α h 2 n m 2 1 α h 2 n m 2 z 2 0 d l h 3 h 1 d l k h 2 q 1 k h 3 z 3 z 2 d l h n h n 1 d l k h n 1 q 1 k h 3 z n z n 1 d l where zn l next taken ks q and ht as known values the q h b h n objetive function was defined where hn is the bottom soil tension caclulated for different combinations of αdr and n given a αdr value the optimimum n was computed as the n value that gives a minimum value of q this optimization which was carried out using the levenberg marquardt algorithm was repeated for 1000 different αdr values ranged from 0 001 to 1 cm 1 this analysis generated different q isolines one for each hb where each line contains the αdr and the corresponding n that results a minimum q value the actual αdr and n values corresponded to the crossing point of the different q isolines once obtained the optimum αdr and n values the soil tension profiles were calulated from the ht h1 hn and 0 z2 zn relationships the water content profiles were esitmated by applying the van genuchten function eq 4 to the corresponding soil tension profile 3 3 numerically generated data this new method was first tested on infiltration steady state curves generated in synthetic soils to this end the theoretical θ s ks α and n values of loamy sand ls loam l and clay cl soils carsel and parrish 1988 were compared to the corresponing optimized ones the infiltration curves were simulated with the hydrus 1d software šimunek et al 1999 the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 models for water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions were used table 1 where no hysteresis phenomenon was considered homogeneous soil columns of 2 5 cm height discretized in a 1 d mesh of 500 cells were employed previous numerical analysis demonstrated that under this discretization the solution was grid independent no evaporation rate was considered the synthetic infiltration steady state experiment was divided in two parts the first one corresponded to a 1d infiltration with saturation conditions at the soil surface and free drainage at the bottom the initial soil tension of the soil matrix was 107 cm and the experiment lasted until water started to drain by the bottom and steady state curve stabilized this first experiment allowed calculating θs s and khk see section 3 1 the second experiment consisted of generating successive drainage curves by applying increasing tension gradients between the top and bottom of the soil in this case an initial tension of zero cm was defined in the soil matrix the first and second pairs of tensions were ht hb 0 and ht hb 5 cm respectively these values are basad in tension ranges previously evaluated keeping ht 5 cm the remaining hb values were 8 10 15 20 25 30 for ls and 10 20 40 60 80 and 120 cm for cl and l soils respectively on the basis of previous synthetic experiments the time intervals defined for each hb were 200 s for ls and 1000 s for cl and l the q values were calculated from the central part of each steady state section ensuring that the water flow was stabilized ks which was directly calculated by darcy s law eq 3 from the steady state corresponding to free drainage was compared to khk αdr and n were estimated from the crossing point of the different q isolines obtained from the different combination of ht and hb see section 3 2 taken θi as measurable data in our cases θi θr α for a wetting process here denoted as αw was calculated by applying ks and n obtained from the drainage process and the corresponding θs and s calculated from the 1d infiltration curve analysis to eq 10 the synthetic steady state experiment was also used to check the time needed by a soil to stabilize the water flux curve when a change in hb occurs to this end a ht 5 cm and an initial soil matrix tension of 10 cm were selected the experiment was performed on a cl soil with the lowest ks where hb changed from 60 cm to 80 cm the time for steady state stabilization was determined as the time after which the difference between the slopes of the steady state and infiltration curve were less than 5 3 4 experimental data 3 4 1 double disc tension gradients system the device used in this new methodology is based on the same principles as the unit gradient experiment sarkar et al 2019 where the soil core is placed between two tension disc infiltrometers one located on the soil surface and the second under the core base three different parts can be distinguished i a base disc ii an air vacuum system and iii a surface disc infiltrometer fig 2 the base disc consists of a perforated base 5 cm internal diameter i d and 0 7 cm high contained in an aluminum receptacle of 10 cm diameter fig 2 the surface of the perforated base is covered with a dry nylon mesh of 10 μm pore size which is hermetically closed against the aluminum receptacle after testing different nylon meshes from 10 to 44 μm pore size we concluded that the 10 μm mesh presented the best ks hmaximum relationship with ks 0 0564 cm s 1 and hmaximum 100 cm except for very high permeable sand this mesh was conductive enough to determine the hydraulic properties of most of the soils for the particular case of high permeable sand the unit gradient method could perfectly be applied a 2 5 cm high soil column consisting of a dry soil sample contained on a stainless steel cylinder 5 cm i d is placed on the nylon mesh a thin air pathway 1 mm thinness is left between the external wall of the stainless steel cylinder and the aluminum ring this path will allow the nylon mesh to be saturated by adding water if necessary the bottom of the aluminum receptacle which has a draining hole of 10 mm diameter is hermetically attached to a vacuum chamber that will receive the water drained from the wetted soil column this vacuum chamber is connected to a water column manometer 0 100 cm tension and a vacuum system that generates a suction on the base of the soil core once the soil has been saturated two open closed valves are placed between the vacuum chamber and vacuum system a first one valve 1 in fig 2 to connect the two systems and a second one valve 2 to allow for atmospheric conditions at the base of the soil column when necessary previous experiments showed that once the nylon mesh was saturated the tension on the mesh surface was the same as that inside the vacuum chamber the vacuum system consists of bubbler tower connected to a large and closed water tank located at 2 m on the ground a long pipe the end of which is 2 m below the water tank allows water to flow from inside to the outside of the tank the water falling through the pipe valve 3 in fig 2 which is regulated by a flow valve generates a suction inside the tank the air inlet into the tank which allows the water to escape comes from the 110 cm long bubbling tower which is connected to the vacuum chamber the bubbling tower has a movable air inlet pipe that allows the exact tension to be applied to the vacuum chamber when valve 3 is open fig 2 the fall of water outside of the tank generates a suction inside the vacuum chamber and bubbling tower the suction in the vacuum system is set by the movable air inlet pipe of the bubbler tower and the suction force is regulated by valve 3 the more valve 3 is open more bubbling intensity there will be inside the bubbling tower infiltration water through the soil surface comes from a tension disc infiltrometer of 4 7 cm diameter which connected to a 15 cm long bubbler tower allows infiltrations at tensions ranging between 0 and 10 cm the disc of the infiltrometer is covered by a nylon mesh of 44 μm of pore size the water reservoir of the disc infiltrometer is 30 cm high and 2 0 cm i d compared to the 5 cm i d stain steel cylinder the slightly smaller diameter of the upper disc leaves part of the soil surface open ensuring soil ventilation a crucial point of the double membrane method is ventilation of the soil because without air access the soil water content cannot change with variable suction sarkar et al 2019 although the ventilation of soil in cores could be provided by lateral holes in the cylinders this would induce some additional difficulties in the handling of the cores and would exclude saturated percolation sarkar et al 2019 a 0 5 psi differential pressure transducer pt microswitch honeywell connected to a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientist inc is installed at the bottom of the disc infiltrometer water supply reservoir casey and derby 2002 the time evolution of the water level drop inside the infiltrometer reservoir was visible at real time through the screen of a laptop connected to the datalogger this makes it possible to detect when the steady state has been reached 3 4 2 setup of double disc tension gradient system before starting any measurements the stainless steel cylinder was primary filled with sieved and air dried soil the soil core which was covered with a removable plastic lid was weighted to obtain the initial gravimetric water content wi which for our particular case corresponded with the residual gravimetric water content w r to setup the system the nylon mesh of the base disc must be initially dry this allows air to escape from the soil matrix as infiltration progresses placing the soil core plus lid in an inverted position with the lid in contact with the ground the bottom disc plus the vacuum chamber set also in an inverted position was placed and fixed on the soil cylinder once the soil was in contact with the nylon mesh the set was again inverted leaving the lid on the top this process allows the soil core to be placed on the bottom disc without loss of material the top lid was then removed and the soil sample was ready to be wetted at this time valve 2 was opened fig 2 to allow atmospheric conditions at the base of the soil core next the disc infiltrometer set at 0 cm tension was placed on the surface of the soil core and infiltration at saturation conditions started the infiltration lasted until free drainage through the base of the core began and a steady state curve could be visible on the laptop screen fig 1 at this moment valves 1 and 2 opened and closed respectively and a 5 cm tension was applied to the bubbler towers of the disc infiltrometer and the vacuum system respectively to generate a suction inside the tank of the vacuum system and hence on the vacuum chamber valve 3 opened and the water started to flow down through the 2 m pipe the bubbling frequency inside the vacuum system was regulated with valve 3 this new pair of tensions lasted during 5 10 min until a steady state line was also visible on the laptop screen in principle the infiltration process at saturation should be enough to saturate the nylon mesh needed to generate a vacuum inside the vacuum chamber however in some cases the no uniform advance of the wetting front may produce an irregular nylon mesh saturation which prevents creating a complete vacuum inside the vacuum chamber once the soil core has been saturated this problem can be solved by adding some water between the external wall of the cylinder and the aluminum ring this process which allows saturating the nylon mesh activates the vacuum process without altering the infiltration curve keeping constant the tension in the disc infiltrometer ht 5 cm increasing hb were next applied on the vacuum chamber by submerging the mobile tube of the vacuum system bubbler tower at the end of the experiment an 1d cumulative infiltration curve followed by a sequence of drainage steady state lines were obtained fig 1 once finished the last stead state measure the soil sample was again saturated by opening valve 2 and leaving ht 0 cm next the infiltrometer was removed from the soil surface and the soil sample was poured into a jar to this end valves 1 and 2 were closed and the vacuum chamber disconnected for the vacuum system following a jar with higher diameter than the soil core was placed upside down on the soil sample and the pot plus vacuum chamber aluminum receptacle and cylinder set were turned over so that the soil fell down by gravity into the pot because of valves 1 and 2 are closed the vacuum inside the vacuum chamber prevents the water inside it falls down on the soil core when the system is inverted this procedure allowed retrieving the saturated soil sample which was subsequently weighted dried at 105 c during 24 h and weighted again to obtain the gravimetric saturated water content ws the soil bulk density ρb was calculated as the quotient between the core volume and the dry weight of the soil the volumetric saturated water content obtained gravimetrically θs w and θr were calculated as the product between ρb and the corresponding ws and w r 3 4 3 experimental soils the method was applied of four sieved soils of different texture sand loam clay loam and clay table 2 while loam and clay loam soils were sieved at 2 mm a 0 25 mm sieving was applied to the clay a 2 5 cm high soil column was employed in loam clay loam and clay soils this short soil column was selected in order to increase the homogeneity of the core however because the high permeability of the sand a 5 cm length cylinder was applied to this material the pair of ht hb employed in the experimental soils are summarized in table 2 the soil organic carbon content was measured with an improved chromic acid digestion and spectrophotometric procedure heanes 1984 and the electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract was measured using a standard method rhoades 1982 as described in synthetic soils section 3 3 θs s and khk were calculated from the inverse analysis of the 1d cumulative infiltration curve ks from the steady state at free drainage αdr and n from the crossing point of the different q isolines obtained from the different combination of ht and hb see section 3 2 and αw by applying ks n θs θi θr and s to eq 8 the measured ks was compared to khk and the optimized αdr and n were compared with those values calculated with a pressure cell method pc moret fernández et al 2012 the volumetric water content in pc was measured at air dried soil conditions at saturation and at pressure heads of 5 15 30 100 and 500 cm more detalis of the pc experiment can be found in moret fernández et al 2012 finally the estimated αw was compared to the corresponding value calculated by applying the estimated n and αdr to the ih index eqs 6 and 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic soils the experiment carried out on the synthetic clay soil to check the time required to stabilize the water flow after changing hb from 60 to 80 cm showed that the steady state was reached after about 150 s fig 3 this short stabilization time could be explained because of the short column used in the experiment the high tensions applied at the base of the soil core which accelerate the draining process and probably also because only a small part of the soil profile takes part in the drainage process taking into account that time stabilization decreases with increasing the soil permeability these results suggest that the presented method is relatively fast to implement from several minutes in sand to several hours for clay fig 4 shows that after excluding the extremes within the different steady states between black dotted lines the q values calculated from the drainage curve contained between the solid and dashed blue lines correspond to a zone of straight lines within each steady state although a good relationship was obtained between theoretical table 1 and optimized s obtained from the analysis of the 1d cumulative infiltration curve fig 5 b the differences between khk and ks increased in soils of finer textures fig 5a these differences should be attributed to the constant β 0 6 employed in the inverse analysis whose value does not correspond to those of fine textured soils as reported by lassabatere et al 2009 the β value increases in soils with finer texture however the small influence of β on the 1d cumulative infiltration latorre et al 2018 prevents this parameter from being optimized from 1d experiments in summary given β is an unknown parameter the inverse analysis of a 1d infiltration curve allows only an approximation of k a significant relationship with p less than 0 1 and slope close to one was obtained between the theoretical θ s table 1 and the corresponding value estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve fig 5c these results indicate that while khk should not be used to optimize α and n from a multiple tension drainage process the consistent estimations of s and θ s allows these parameters to be employed to approach αw fig 6 shows the q isolines estimated for ls l and cl soils each of the points of each q isoline is the value of n that minimizes the objective function q within each α value in this case the 1000 values of α swept within the 0 001 1 cm 1 interval used in each q isoline covers all α range for soils it can observe that in the three analyzed synthetic soils all q isolines cross in a single point dotted grey lines that corresponds to the theoretical αdr and n values red cross this crossover point was calculated as the point with the smallest standard deviation between the optimized n values for each α and the different applied tensions overall a robust relationship between theoretical and optimized αdr and n was found fig 7 an also consistent relationship was obtained between theoretical ks and the corresponding one estimated by darcy s law fig 7 the α and n relationship calculated by applying to eq 8 the measured θi and calculated θs s and ks shows a kind of exponential line dashed red line in fig 6 that crosses on the optimum n and α values because of the synthetic soils were defined without any hysteresis phenomenon αw αdr fig 8 shows an example of the soil tension and water content profiles simulated in a loam soil during the drainage process in this case it can observe that water content and soil tension decrease in depth and with increasing hb however while important differences in θ and h profiles between two successive hb is observed at low values of hb these differences decrease with increasing values of hb this behavior may suggest that at high hb the method can lose effectivity in determining hb and therefore in estimating n and α thus these results indicate that depending on the soils there is a maximum hb threshold low for sand and higher for clay textures above which the method begins to loss effectiveness 4 2 experimental soils the experimental design developed to measure the soil hydraulic properties from a tension gradient percolation process resulted to be accurate simple inexpensive fast and easy to implement accurate because the tension is directly measured with a water column manometer simple and inexpensive because the vacuum system does not employ any electronic mechanism and only a datalogger attached to a single pressure transducer is needed and quick and easy to implement because the complete experiment including 8 10 tensions takes no more than two hours and the soil sample is not touched or moved at any time on the other hand compared to other methods the initially dry soil samples employed in the experiment allows obtaining additional information about the wetting processes and therefore to potentially characterize the soil hysteresis phenomenon furthermore compared to the sarkar et al 2019 method where the suction is generated by a water column drop the employed air vacuum system removes the head losses caused by the water flow through the 2 m length column and also eliminates the negative effect of the possible entry of air bubbles inside the pipe finally this design is perfectly compatible with the quasi unit gradient percolation method fig 9 shows the experimental infiltration steady state curves obtained for the four sieved soils note that the greater drainage of water observed in sand should be attributed to the double length column used in this subtract the highest n value commonly observed in sand made that only up to 30 cm of tension could be applied table 2 on the other hand the percolation curve with a greater slope at higher tensions observed in clay could be attributed as will be seen later to the lower α values of these kind of soils which makes almost all the soil pores remain filled with water at high tensions under these conditions the slope of the drainage curve becomes proportional to the applied soil tension eq 3 however as the soil core base pores empty due to high suction i e loam and clay loam soils with higher α values k h decreases and thus the slope of the drainage curve the selected experimental soils were no saline and the corresponding bulk density varied from 1 18 to 1 51 g cm 3 for clay and sand respectively table 3 a significant relationship fig 10 was obtained between the θs and θs w where on average θs w was 2 smaller than the corresponding obtained from the cumulative infiltration curve although both parameters gave comparable results given the ease of estimating θs which does not require any soil handling from now on αw will be calculate using θs except for clay and loam soil columns the wfa values estimated for the sand and clay loam soils were close to the actual cylinder lengths table 3 these results suggest that the analyzed sand and clay loam soil columns were overall homogeneous for the particular case of the loam soil column the short wfa value should be attributed to a heterogeneity in the soil column probably due to a soil compaction during the water infiltration experiment due to the disc infiltrometer weight this made that ks was one order of magnitude lower than khk table 3 in contrast the poorer estimates of wfa observed in clay could be attributed to the fact that haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model does not work well in clay soils lassabatere et al 2009 this caused eq 7 did not fit well with the experimental curve forcing the sia procedure to stop before the wetting front reached the soil base although a significant relationship between ks and khk was found fig 11 a on average khk 0 011 cm s 1 was one order of magnitude higher than ks 0 0029 cm s 1 again these large differences should be attributed to the high khk obtained in loam and clay table 3 soils although ks for sand was three times lower than khk both values were within the same order of magnitude these differences could be attributed to the high permeability of the sand which together with the short column probably prevented the infiltration time from being long enough for a more accurate estimate of khk the s values estimated for the different soils were within the same order de magnitude of the corresponding values measured for the same soils using an upward infiltration method moret fernández and latorre 2017 in summary these results showed that although haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model allows good approaches of k the dependence of khk on the β parameter and on the soil homogeneity suggests that this parameter should not be employed in the inverse analysis of the drainage curves in contrast the robustness of the sia procedure to estimate wfa and s indicates that the measured 1d infiltration curve provides interesting information to check the homogeneity of the soil column and valuable data about the soil wetting process respectively given that ks is directly estimated by darcy s law only αdr and n need to be optimized similarly to what was observed in synthetic soils the q isolines analysis showed in all the experimental soils a single crossing point whose optimum αdr n values dotted grey line in fig 12 varied with the type of soils the lowest and highest αdr n values corresponded to clay and sand respectively table 3 fig 13 intermedium values were obtained for loam and clay loam soils these results agree with data reported by carsel and parrish 1988 however unlike what is observed in synthetic soils the α n relationship obtained by applying the measured ks θs θs n and s to eq 10 did not intercept the crossing point of the different q isoline given that in synthetic soils ks θs θs n are not hysteresis dependent and s corresponds to a wetting process this difference regarding to synthetic soils should be attributed to the soil hysteresis phenomenon that makes αw to be higher than that for a draining process αdr haverkamp et al 2002 gebrenegus and ghezzehei 2011 graphically αw can be visualized dotted vertical red line in fig 12 as the crossing point between the n value corresponding to a draining process and the s line dashed green line in fig 12 in all cases αw αdr table 3 if the sand point is removed from the analysis a significant relationship fig 14 was observed between αw estimated from s and the corresponding value calculated from αdr and ih index eqs 6 and 7 the great dispersion promoted by the sand could be due the employed empirical hysteresis model does not work well in this kind of porous medium however to contrast this hypothesis further analysis would be needed thus results showed that the proposed double disc method allows satisfactory estimates of αw while a significant relationship with slope close to one found between n optimized from the drainage curves and the corresponding values measured with pc method fig 11c the relationship significantly worsened for αdr fig 11b for this last case for instance a deviation of one order of magnitude was observed between αdr measured for clay with pc 0 052 cm 1 and the corresponding value estimated from the drainage curves table 3 these differences could be attributed to limitations of the pressure plate apparatus when applied to fine textured soils solone et al 2012 argument that is supported by the good agreement between the optimized αdr for clay and to those values reported by carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 the higher stability of n could be associated to the fact that n is more related to the soil textural characteristics jirku et al 2013 in contrast the parameter α which is more related to the soil structure could be affected by the different wetting processes used in both methods which have an important influence in sieved soils with weak structure moret fernández et al 2008 thus the faster wetting process of the infiltration method could have broken down the more unstable aggregates collapsing the large soil pores and thus lowering the corresponding αdr value another factor that may affect the αdr value could be the negative influence of the infiltrometer weight in these soils with fragile structure which under saturated conditions may collapse their more unstable macropore network moret and arrúe 2005 which may also result in a decrease of the αdr value however despite these limitations in weak structured soils overall results show that the presented method allows satisfactory estimates of αdr and n 5 5 conclusions this work presents a new laboratory method and a numerical procedure to estimate soil hydraulic properties of the soils from the inverse analysis of a 1d downward infiltration curve measuerd at saturation conditions followed by a drainage with increasing tension gradients between the surface and the base of the soil column to this end a laboratory double disc system one placed at the surface and the other one at the base of a 2 5 cm high soil core associated to an air vacuum system was developed while the soil tension on the upper disc varied between 0 and 5 cm increasing suctions from 5 to 100 cm were applied to the bottom disc s and θs were calculated from the 1d transient infiltration curve ks was measured by darcy s law αdr and n were optimized form the inverse analysis of the steady state drainage curves and αw was calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n the method was successfully validated on synthetic soils columns of 2 5 cm height and next applied on four sieved soils with textures ranged from sand to clay soils the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured in the same experimental soils with the pressure plate method the method applied to both synthetic and experimental soils allowed accurate estimates of ks αdr and n and also a good approximation of αw in the experimental soils comparted to other existing methods the presented procedure which is suitable for small scale experiments alleviates some limitations such as i this method allows relatively fast laboratory experiments between 1 and 2 h and numerical analysis several minutes ii it allows exploring a wide range of tensions and working at relative high suctions up to 100 cm ii it can works with short soil cores i e 2 5 cm length which allows exploring more homogeneous soil samples iv the method works with steady state flows which eliminates the problem of transient flows analysis applied on stratified soils and v estimation of αdr and n are independent on θs and θr on the other hand the double disc device associated to an air vacuum system was accurate inexpensive fast and easy to implement although this procedure is limited to a maximum soil tension of approximately 100 cm it could be supplemented with the temple cell method in the event that higher soil tensions were required in summary this method could be useful in those studies where small scale experiments were requires however despite all these advantages more research should be done to explore for example the applicability of this method in undisturbed soils or how the combination of the different soil tensions allows obtaining additional information finally it would also be necessary to explore how the use of longer soil cylinders or meshes with smaller pore sizes to allow higher suctions may affect the accuracy of the method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2664,determination of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the water retention curve θ h is of paramount importance to characterize the hydraulic behavior of the vadose zone given the van genuchten hydraulic model defined by the residual θr and saturated θs volumetric water content and the α and n parameters this work presents a new laboratory procedure to estimate ks θs n and α for a drainage process αdr from the inverse analysis of successive drainage steady states curves generated by a tension gradient between the surface and the base of a soil column to this end a double disc system one connected a bubbling tower and placed at the soil surface and the second one placed under the soil core was employed the second disc was connected to an air vacuum system the experiment presented two parts a first 1d downward infiltration at saturation on a dry soil column followed by successive drainage steps during the drainage process the tension of the upper and lower discs varied between 0 and 5 cm and from 5 to 100 cm respectively the soil sorptivity s and θs were calculated from the 1d transient infiltration measure ks was calculated by darcy s law αdr and n were optimized from the inverse analysis of the steady state curves under tension gradient and α for a wetting process αw was calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n once ks estimated αdr and n were optimized by minimizing the q h b h n objective function where hb and hn are the experimental and calculated tensions at the base of the soil core given a αdr value the optimimum n was computed as the value that provides a minimum q by repeating this process for a sequence of αdr different q isolines were obtained one for each hb value which crossing point corresponded to the actual αdr and n values the method was tested on 2 5 cm high columns of four different synthetic soils next it was applied on an experimental sand column of 5 cm height and on 2 5 cm high columns filled with sieved loam clay loam and clay soil the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured in the same soils with the pressure plate technique and αw was contrasted with the corresponding value calculated with an empirical hysteresis model the method which was fast from 1 to 2 h and easy to implement for small scale experiments was successfully applied to soil samples 2 5 cm high and allowed to explore a range of soil tensions from 0 to 100 cm overall accurate estimates of θs ks αdr and n were obtained in both synthetic and experimental soils a significant relationship was also obtained between αw estimated from s and the corresponding value calculated from the hysteresis model keywords water retention curve hydraulic properties inverse analysis hydraulic conductivity upward

simulation of soil water flow in the vadose zone the soil hydraulic properties are defined by the water retention and the hydraulic conductivity functions the soil water retention curve θ h expresses the relationship between the volumetric water content θ l3 l 3 and the matric potential h l under static conditions the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ability of the fluid to pass through the pores of the material newby et al 2009 its value decreases with the soil water content as the soil moisture decreases the total number of water conductive pathways along which fluid can travel reduces and hence the k h value accordingly the k h is a measure of the increased impedance to water flow with decreasing moisture content mccartney et al 2007 these functions are characteristic for different types of soil van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 described one of the most employed models to characterize θ h and k h in this case θ h is defined by the saturated θs and residual θr volumetric water contents the empirical α and n factors and the m parameter commonly defined as m 1 1 n θr expresses the water content for which dθ dh becomes zero excluding the region near θs which also has a zero gradient n which is related to pore size distribution defines the slope of θ h and α l 1 is a scale factor that describes the shape of θ h near θs k h can be defined as a function of α n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks defined this last one as the soil ability to transmit water at saturation conditions the soil water retention function is subject to the hysteresis phenomenon manifested as a difference between equilibrium curves of soil wetting and drying hysteresis loop e g hillel 1998 this means that water content in the drying or drainage branch of water potential is larger than water content in the wetting branch for the same value of water potential the causes of hysteresis can be the variation in contact angle at different wetting and drying cycles entrapped air in a newly wetted soil temperature swelling and shrinking and ink bottle effect due to nonuniformity in shape and sizes of both individual pores and interconnected pore networks bachmann and van der ploeg 2002 maqsoud et al 2004 laboratory methods to determine the soil hysteresis are both time consuming and complicated to overcome this limitation different physical and empirical models for predicting one branch of the water retention relation have been developed pham et al 2003 gebrenegus and ghzzehei 2011 to date two families of methods to characterize the soil hydraulic properties under laboratory conditions are available those based on direct measures and those founded on the inverse numerical analysis of richard s water flows the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks can be directly measured with either the constant head or the falling head methods klute and dirksen 1986 among the direct techniques to measure the water retention curve the pressure membrane apparatus richards 1941 which is considered as the reference laboratory method determines θ h from measured θ and h pairs although this technique has been progressively improved by introducing different ways to estimate θ jones et al 2005 moret fernández et al 2012 the long time required to complete a measurement together with errors of apparatus in fine textured soils solone et al 2012 may limit its use another direct procedure is the evaporation method wind 1968 wendroth et al 1993 among others where the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data are obtained through monitoring of the water content evaporation and matric potential dynamics at various heights of a soil sample exposed to evaporation although this method can extend the range of pressures up close to the wilting point schindler et al 2010 it is time consuming it has to use relatively long soil cores 6 11 cm and results inaccurate at near saturation conditions sarkar et al 2019 to overcome this last limitation the evaporation method is commonly complemented with the double disc or quasi unit gradient percolation procedure which currently is the most straightforward way to measure unsaturated hydraulic conductivity near saturation dirksen 1999 in this case water is supplied at the top of a soil column and drained at the bottom by suction this requires the pressure head at the bottom to be adjusted to a value corresponding to the pressure head measured in the soil near the top sarkar et al 2019 however although this method allows estimating the hydraulic conductivity at near saturation conditions it is time consuming and the applied tension is limited to from 0 to 10 cm sarkar et al 2019 currently four different 1d transient methods can be used to estimate soil hydraulic properties by inverse analysis evaporation and horizontal downward and upward infiltration processes the main advantage of these techniques is the simultaneous estimate of θ h and k h moret fernández et al 2016 in the horizontal infiltration method shao and horton 1998 ks is measured by darcy s law and α and n parameters are estimated with an integral method that simulates the problem of water absorption into a horizontal soil column to this end a 20 cm length transparent cylinder should be used the 1d downward infiltration method based on the inverse analysis of a single transient cumulative infiltration at saturated conditions allows determining the soil sorptivity s and ks lassabatere et al 2009 latorre et al 2015 moret fernández et al 2021b but not the β parameter latorre et al 2018 defined haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b s which is defined as a measure of the capacity of a medium to absorb or desorb liquid by capillarity philip 1957 can be expressed as function of the initial θi and saturated θs water content ks and the α and n parameters of the van genuchten 1980 water retention model moret fernández et al 2017 β is an integral shape parameter which can be expressed as function of θi θs and the shape n parameter of the van genuchten 1980 water retention model moret fernández and latorre 2017 however given the inverse analysis of a 1d transient infiltration allows only estimating two s and ks of the three parameters of the haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model latorre et al 2018 α and n cannot be estimated from s and thus from a transient infiltration curve simunek and van genuchten 1996 among the wide variety of existing procedures to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters from the inverse analysis of an upward infiltration curves hudson et al 1996 young et al 2002 moret fernández et al 2016 peña sancho et al 2017 the most complete one is that presented by latorre and moret fernández 2019 and moret fernández et al 2021a which allows determining four of the five van genuchten 1980 parameters from the inverse analysis of a single infiltration curve however although this method is accurate can work with short 5 cm high cores and run with disturbed and undisturbed soils the inverse analysis is time consuming from 2 to 20 days and requires high performance computing on the other hand since the inverse analysis of transient infiltrations measured in stratified soils profile leads to erroneous estimates of soil hydraulic parameters moret fernández et al 2021b the inverse analysis of a 1d upward infiltration should be limited to homogeneous soil profiles however soil heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception under field conditions abou najm et al 2019 for example the application of the sequential inverse analysis sia moret fernández et al 2021b method on 20 infiltration experiments showed that in 85 of the soils analyzed the thickness of the homogeneous topsoil layer was less than 3 cm this problem associated with soil layering could be minimized for instance by using shorter soil columns or analyzing steady state infiltration curves in summary although there is a large variety of laboratory methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties most of them presents some of the following constraints i long measurement or analysis time ii limitations in the applied tension iii high computing requirements iv poor behavior in stratified soils or v use of long soil columns the objective of this work is to present a new laboratory method and a numerical procedure to estimate the soil hydraulic properties s ks θs α and n attenuating most of the above mentioned limitations in the proposed method the soil hydraulic properties for a drainage process are estimated from the inverse analysis of successive steady states drainage curves generated by applying a tension gradient between the surface and the base of a soil cylinder based on the quasi unit gradient percolation procedure the method employs a double disc system one placed at the surface and the other one at the base of the soil column where tensions in the upper and lower discs range between 0 5 and 5 100 cm respectively this procedure generates a first downward infiltration on an initially dry soil column followed by successive steady state drainages curves of increasing rates in this case s and θs are measured from the 1d transient infiltration curve at saturation conditions ks is measured by darcy s law when tensions at the surface and bottom of the soil column are equal to 0 cm and n and α for a drainage process αdr are estimated form the inverse analysis of the drainage curves finally α for a wetting process αw is calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n the method was first validated on four different synthetic soils columns of 2 5 cm high the successive steady state drainage experiment was also employed to check how quickly the infiltration curve stabilizes after the suction at the bottom increases making use of a new design of double disc plus air vacuum system the method was applied on four sieved soils columns with different textures from sand to clay and the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured with the pressure plate method the estimated αw was compared to the corresponding value calculated from αdr using an empirical hysteresis model 2 theory 2 1 soil hydraulic functions and cumulative infiltration model the governing flow equation for one dimensional isothermal darcian flow in a variably saturated rigid porous medium is given by the modified form of the richards equation 1 d θ dt d dz k dh dz k where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h is the soil water pressure head l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 z is a vertical coordinate l positive upward and t is time t under steady state conditions eq 1 simplifies to 2 q d dz k dh dz k where q is the water flux density l t 1 for saturated soils condition eq 2 reduces to the darcy s law lichtner et al 1996 3 q k s dz dh where and ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and h h z is the total head the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be described with the van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 models according to 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m 5 k h k s 1 α h n 1 1 α h n m 2 1 α h n m 2 where θs and θr are the saturated and residual volumetric water content l3 l 3 respectively α l 1 and n are a scale and shape parameter respectively and m 1 1 n according to van genuchten 1980 θr is defined as the water content for which the gradient dθ dh becomes zero the soil water retention function is subject to a hysteresis phenomenon manifested as a difference between equilibrium curves of soil wetting and drying hysteresis loop e g hillel 1998 given that the soil hysteresis affects only the α value haverkamp et al 2002 a scale parameter for wetting αw and drainage αdr processes should be defined the αw parameter can be predicted from drying water retention data using the ih index gebrenegus and ghezzehei 2011 6 i h r n 1 r n n 1 2 n 1 1 1 n 1 r n 1 r n r n 2 2 n 1 1 n 1 where r αdr αw in the absence of measured wetting and drying water retention data ih is calculated as ih 0 378 ln n 7 the 1d cumulative infiltration i 1 d under saturation conditions can be described by the haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model

is the hydraulic conductivity value corresponding to the initial θi volumetric water contents l3 l 3 and β is an integral shape parameter the β parameter varies between 0 6 and 1 7 lassabatere et al 2009 however because β has a negligible influence on 1d infiltration latorre et al 2018 a constant β is commonly considered angulo jaramillo et al 2019 given the complexity to solve the implicit eq 8 the cumulative 1d infiltration for saturated soil conditions and negligible initial hydraulic conductivity can be approximated by the explicit 4 terms 4 t expansion moret fernández et al 2020 9 i 1 d

material and methods the proposed 1d laboratory method consists of a downward 1d infiltration at saturation followed by a sequence of drainage curves obtained these last ones by applying increasing tension gradients between the surface and the base of the soil core this compound measure allows obtaining a transient infiltration curve followed by successive steady state flows with increasing slopes fig 1 in order to distinguish between the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from the transient cumulative infiltration to that calculated from the steady state from now on this term will be defined as khk and ks respectively 3 1 estimation of khk s and θs from the 1d cumulative infiltration curve s and khk were calculated by applying the sequential infiltration analysis sia moret fernández et al 2021b to the 1d transient cumulative infiltration curve which runs from t 0 to t at which free drainage begins fig 1 the sia method estimates s and khk of the upper soil layer by fitting 4 t eq 9 to increasing time series and computes the rmse as a function of the number of samples the optimal infiltration time to is defined by the minimum rmse and the actual s and khk are the corresponding values calculated for an infiltration curve of time to the levenberg marquardt more 1978 optimization algorithm was incorporated in the inverse analysis a total of 50 increasing times ranged from 50 to 100 s to the whole available infiltration data were considered the thickness of the soil surface layer was defined as the position of the wetting front advance wfa at time to which was calculated as lassabatere et al 2009 11 wfa i 1 d t 0 θ s θ i where i1d t0 was calculated by applying the previously optimized ks s and β 0 6 to 12 i 1 d t 0 s t 0 1 2 2 β 3 k s t 0 k s 2 9 s β 2 β 1 t 0 3 2 2 β 2 β 1 1 2 β 135 k s 3 s 2 t 0 2 more details about the sia procedure can be found in moret fernández et al 2021b the θs was calculated as 13 θ s i f l θ r where l is the length of the soil column and if denotes total infiltration at the time when the wetting front reaches the bottom of the soil column and the steady state begins fig 1 3 2 estimation of αdr n and ks from the succssive steady states curves as above mentioned the drainage process consisted of applying successive tension gradients between the soil surface ht and the base hb of the soil core to this end the following procedure was used 1 the first pair of tensions defined by atmospheric conditions at the top and bottom ht hb 0 cm of the soil column allowed calculating ks according to eq 3 for this specific case dz dh ks q where q corresponded to the slope of the correspondig steady state curve fig 1 2 next to allow a partial desaturation of the soil surface and thus facilitate the entry of air to favor the drainage of the lower soil layers sarkar et al 2019 a second set of tension of ht hb 5 cm was applied from this time incresing hb values keeping ht 5 cm were selected this process allows obtaining a seccuence of straight lines of increasing slope which are related to the incresing hb values fig 1 in this case the q value calculated for each pair of ht hb values correspondeded to the slope of the respective drainage sections given this analysis corresponds to a drainage process the estimated α will be correspond to αdr 3 once ks and corresponding q were obtained the optimal n and αdr values were calculated as follows firstly a numerical procedure to estimate the bottom tension of the soil column hn was developed given a soil column of height l and assuming ks q ht αdr and n as known values hn can be iteratively calculated from eq 2 as h 2 h t d l k s q 1 k h 2 k s 1 α h 2 n 1 1 α h 2 n m 2 1 α h 2 n m 2 z 2 0 d l h 3 h 1 d l k h 2 q 1 k h 3 z 3 z 2 d l h n h n 1 d l k h n 1 q 1 k h 3 z n z n 1 d l where zn l next taken ks q and ht as known values the q h b h n objetive function was defined where hn is the bottom soil tension caclulated for different combinations of αdr and n given a αdr value the optimimum n was computed as the n value that gives a minimum value of q this optimization which was carried out using the levenberg marquardt algorithm was repeated for 1000 different αdr values ranged from 0 001 to 1 cm 1 this analysis generated different q isolines one for each hb where each line contains the αdr and the corresponding n that results a minimum q value the actual αdr and n values corresponded to the crossing point of the different q isolines once obtained the optimum αdr and n values the soil tension profiles were calulated from the ht h1 hn and 0 z2 zn relationships the water content profiles were esitmated by applying the van genuchten function eq 4 to the corresponding soil tension profile 3 3 numerically generated data this new method was first tested on infiltration steady state curves generated in synthetic soils to this end the theoretical θ s ks α and n values of loamy sand ls loam l and clay cl soils carsel and parrish 1988 were compared to the corresponing optimized ones the infiltration curves were simulated with the hydrus 1d software šimunek et al 1999 the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 models for water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions were used table 1 where no hysteresis phenomenon was considered homogeneous soil columns of 2 5 cm height discretized in a 1 d mesh of 500 cells were employed previous numerical analysis demonstrated that under this discretization the solution was grid independent no evaporation rate was considered the synthetic infiltration steady state experiment was divided in two parts the first one corresponded to a 1d infiltration with saturation conditions at the soil surface and free drainage at the bottom the initial soil tension of the soil matrix was 107 cm and the experiment lasted until water started to drain by the bottom and steady state curve stabilized this first experiment allowed calculating θs s and khk see section 3 1 the second experiment consisted of generating successive drainage curves by applying increasing tension gradients between the top and bottom of the soil in this case an initial tension of zero cm was defined in the soil matrix the first and second pairs of tensions were ht hb 0 and ht hb 5 cm respectively these values are basad in tension ranges previously evaluated keeping ht 5 cm the remaining hb values were 8 10 15 20 25 30 for ls and 10 20 40 60 80 and 120 cm for cl and l soils respectively on the basis of previous synthetic experiments the time intervals defined for each hb were 200 s for ls and 1000 s for cl and l the q values were calculated from the central part of each steady state section ensuring that the water flow was stabilized ks which was directly calculated by darcy s law eq 3 from the steady state corresponding to free drainage was compared to khk αdr and n were estimated from the crossing point of the different q isolines obtained from the different combination of ht and hb see section 3 2 taken θi as measurable data in our cases θi θr α for a wetting process here denoted as αw was calculated by applying ks and n obtained from the drainage process and the corresponding θs and s calculated from the 1d infiltration curve analysis to eq 10 the synthetic steady state experiment was also used to check the time needed by a soil to stabilize the water flux curve when a change in hb occurs to this end a ht 5 cm and an initial soil matrix tension of 10 cm were selected the experiment was performed on a cl soil with the lowest ks where hb changed from 60 cm to 80 cm the time for steady state stabilization was determined as the time after which the difference between the slopes of the steady state and infiltration curve were less than 5 3 4 experimental data 3 4 1 double disc tension gradients system the device used in this new methodology is based on the same principles as the unit gradient experiment sarkar et al 2019 where the soil core is placed between two tension disc infiltrometers one located on the soil surface and the second under the core base three different parts can be distinguished i a base disc ii an air vacuum system and iii a surface disc infiltrometer fig 2 the base disc consists of a perforated base 5 cm internal diameter i d and 0 7 cm high contained in an aluminum receptacle of 10 cm diameter fig 2 the surface of the perforated base is covered with a dry nylon mesh of 10 μm pore size which is hermetically closed against the aluminum receptacle after testing different nylon meshes from 10 to 44 μm pore size we concluded that the 10 μm mesh presented the best ks hmaximum relationship with ks 0 0564 cm s 1 and hmaximum 100 cm except for very high permeable sand this mesh was conductive enough to determine the hydraulic properties of most of the soils for the particular case of high permeable sand the unit gradient method could perfectly be applied a 2 5 cm high soil column consisting of a dry soil sample contained on a stainless steel cylinder 5 cm i d is placed on the nylon mesh a thin air pathway 1 mm thinness is left between the external wall of the stainless steel cylinder and the aluminum ring this path will allow the nylon mesh to be saturated by adding water if necessary the bottom of the aluminum receptacle which has a draining hole of 10 mm diameter is hermetically attached to a vacuum chamber that will receive the water drained from the wetted soil column this vacuum chamber is connected to a water column manometer 0 100 cm tension and a vacuum system that generates a suction on the base of the soil core once the soil has been saturated two open closed valves are placed between the vacuum chamber and vacuum system a first one valve 1 in fig 2 to connect the two systems and a second one valve 2 to allow for atmospheric conditions at the base of the soil column when necessary previous experiments showed that once the nylon mesh was saturated the tension on the mesh surface was the same as that inside the vacuum chamber the vacuum system consists of bubbler tower connected to a large and closed water tank located at 2 m on the ground a long pipe the end of which is 2 m below the water tank allows water to flow from inside to the outside of the tank the water falling through the pipe valve 3 in fig 2 which is regulated by a flow valve generates a suction inside the tank the air inlet into the tank which allows the water to escape comes from the 110 cm long bubbling tower which is connected to the vacuum chamber the bubbling tower has a movable air inlet pipe that allows the exact tension to be applied to the vacuum chamber when valve 3 is open fig 2 the fall of water outside of the tank generates a suction inside the vacuum chamber and bubbling tower the suction in the vacuum system is set by the movable air inlet pipe of the bubbler tower and the suction force is regulated by valve 3 the more valve 3 is open more bubbling intensity there will be inside the bubbling tower infiltration water through the soil surface comes from a tension disc infiltrometer of 4 7 cm diameter which connected to a 15 cm long bubbler tower allows infiltrations at tensions ranging between 0 and 10 cm the disc of the infiltrometer is covered by a nylon mesh of 44 μm of pore size the water reservoir of the disc infiltrometer is 30 cm high and 2 0 cm i d compared to the 5 cm i d stain steel cylinder the slightly smaller diameter of the upper disc leaves part of the soil surface open ensuring soil ventilation a crucial point of the double membrane method is ventilation of the soil because without air access the soil water content cannot change with variable suction sarkar et al 2019 although the ventilation of soil in cores could be provided by lateral holes in the cylinders this would induce some additional difficulties in the handling of the cores and would exclude saturated percolation sarkar et al 2019 a 0 5 psi differential pressure transducer pt microswitch honeywell connected to a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientist inc is installed at the bottom of the disc infiltrometer water supply reservoir casey and derby 2002 the time evolution of the water level drop inside the infiltrometer reservoir was visible at real time through the screen of a laptop connected to the datalogger this makes it possible to detect when the steady state has been reached 3 4 2 setup of double disc tension gradient system before starting any measurements the stainless steel cylinder was primary filled with sieved and air dried soil the soil core which was covered with a removable plastic lid was weighted to obtain the initial gravimetric water content wi which for our particular case corresponded with the residual gravimetric water content w r to setup the system the nylon mesh of the base disc must be initially dry this allows air to escape from the soil matrix as infiltration progresses placing the soil core plus lid in an inverted position with the lid in contact with the ground the bottom disc plus the vacuum chamber set also in an inverted position was placed and fixed on the soil cylinder once the soil was in contact with the nylon mesh the set was again inverted leaving the lid on the top this process allows the soil core to be placed on the bottom disc without loss of material the top lid was then removed and the soil sample was ready to be wetted at this time valve 2 was opened fig 2 to allow atmospheric conditions at the base of the soil core next the disc infiltrometer set at 0 cm tension was placed on the surface of the soil core and infiltration at saturation conditions started the infiltration lasted until free drainage through the base of the core began and a steady state curve could be visible on the laptop screen fig 1 at this moment valves 1 and 2 opened and closed respectively and a 5 cm tension was applied to the bubbler towers of the disc infiltrometer and the vacuum system respectively to generate a suction inside the tank of the vacuum system and hence on the vacuum chamber valve 3 opened and the water started to flow down through the 2 m pipe the bubbling frequency inside the vacuum system was regulated with valve 3 this new pair of tensions lasted during 5 10 min until a steady state line was also visible on the laptop screen in principle the infiltration process at saturation should be enough to saturate the nylon mesh needed to generate a vacuum inside the vacuum chamber however in some cases the no uniform advance of the wetting front may produce an irregular nylon mesh saturation which prevents creating a complete vacuum inside the vacuum chamber once the soil core has been saturated this problem can be solved by adding some water between the external wall of the cylinder and the aluminum ring this process which allows saturating the nylon mesh activates the vacuum process without altering the infiltration curve keeping constant the tension in the disc infiltrometer ht 5 cm increasing hb were next applied on the vacuum chamber by submerging the mobile tube of the vacuum system bubbler tower at the end of the experiment an 1d cumulative infiltration curve followed by a sequence of drainage steady state lines were obtained fig 1 once finished the last stead state measure the soil sample was again saturated by opening valve 2 and leaving ht 0 cm next the infiltrometer was removed from the soil surface and the soil sample was poured into a jar to this end valves 1 and 2 were closed and the vacuum chamber disconnected for the vacuum system following a jar with higher diameter than the soil core was placed upside down on the soil sample and the pot plus vacuum chamber aluminum receptacle and cylinder set were turned over so that the soil fell down by gravity into the pot because of valves 1 and 2 are closed the vacuum inside the vacuum chamber prevents the water inside it falls down on the soil core when the system is inverted this procedure allowed retrieving the saturated soil sample which was subsequently weighted dried at 105 c during 24 h and weighted again to obtain the gravimetric saturated water content ws the soil bulk density ρb was calculated as the quotient between the core volume and the dry weight of the soil the volumetric saturated water content obtained gravimetrically θs w and θr were calculated as the product between ρb and the corresponding ws and w r 3 4 3 experimental soils the method was applied of four sieved soils of different texture sand loam clay loam and clay table 2 while loam and clay loam soils were sieved at 2 mm a 0 25 mm sieving was applied to the clay a 2 5 cm high soil column was employed in loam clay loam and clay soils this short soil column was selected in order to increase the homogeneity of the core however because the high permeability of the sand a 5 cm length cylinder was applied to this material the pair of ht hb employed in the experimental soils are summarized in table 2 the soil organic carbon content was measured with an improved chromic acid digestion and spectrophotometric procedure heanes 1984 and the electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract was measured using a standard method rhoades 1982 as described in synthetic soils section 3 3 θs s and khk were calculated from the inverse analysis of the 1d cumulative infiltration curve ks from the steady state at free drainage αdr and n from the crossing point of the different q isolines obtained from the different combination of ht and hb see section 3 2 and αw by applying ks n θs θi θr and s to eq 8 the measured ks was compared to khk and the optimized αdr and n were compared with those values calculated with a pressure cell method pc moret fernández et al 2012 the volumetric water content in pc was measured at air dried soil conditions at saturation and at pressure heads of 5 15 30 100 and 500 cm more detalis of the pc experiment can be found in moret fernández et al 2012 finally the estimated αw was compared to the corresponding value calculated by applying the estimated n and αdr to the ih index eqs 6 and 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic soils the experiment carried out on the synthetic clay soil to check the time required to stabilize the water flow after changing hb from 60 to 80 cm showed that the steady state was reached after about 150 s fig 3 this short stabilization time could be explained because of the short column used in the experiment the high tensions applied at the base of the soil core which accelerate the draining process and probably also because only a small part of the soil profile takes part in the drainage process taking into account that time stabilization decreases with increasing the soil permeability these results suggest that the presented method is relatively fast to implement from several minutes in sand to several hours for clay fig 4 shows that after excluding the extremes within the different steady states between black dotted lines the q values calculated from the drainage curve contained between the solid and dashed blue lines correspond to a zone of straight lines within each steady state although a good relationship was obtained between theoretical table 1 and optimized s obtained from the analysis of the 1d cumulative infiltration curve fig 5 b the differences between khk and ks increased in soils of finer textures fig 5a these differences should be attributed to the constant β 0 6 employed in the inverse analysis whose value does not correspond to those of fine textured soils as reported by lassabatere et al 2009 the β value increases in soils with finer texture however the small influence of β on the 1d cumulative infiltration latorre et al 2018 prevents this parameter from being optimized from 1d experiments in summary given β is an unknown parameter the inverse analysis of a 1d infiltration curve allows only an approximation of k a significant relationship with p less than 0 1 and slope close to one was obtained between the theoretical θ s table 1 and the corresponding value estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve fig 5c these results indicate that while khk should not be used to optimize α and n from a multiple tension drainage process the consistent estimations of s and θ s allows these parameters to be employed to approach αw fig 6 shows the q isolines estimated for ls l and cl soils each of the points of each q isoline is the value of n that minimizes the objective function q within each α value in this case the 1000 values of α swept within the 0 001 1 cm 1 interval used in each q isoline covers all α range for soils it can observe that in the three analyzed synthetic soils all q isolines cross in a single point dotted grey lines that corresponds to the theoretical αdr and n values red cross this crossover point was calculated as the point with the smallest standard deviation between the optimized n values for each α and the different applied tensions overall a robust relationship between theoretical and optimized αdr and n was found fig 7 an also consistent relationship was obtained between theoretical ks and the corresponding one estimated by darcy s law fig 7 the α and n relationship calculated by applying to eq 8 the measured θi and calculated θs s and ks shows a kind of exponential line dashed red line in fig 6 that crosses on the optimum n and α values because of the synthetic soils were defined without any hysteresis phenomenon αw αdr fig 8 shows an example of the soil tension and water content profiles simulated in a loam soil during the drainage process in this case it can observe that water content and soil tension decrease in depth and with increasing hb however while important differences in θ and h profiles between two successive hb is observed at low values of hb these differences decrease with increasing values of hb this behavior may suggest that at high hb the method can lose effectivity in determining hb and therefore in estimating n and α thus these results indicate that depending on the soils there is a maximum hb threshold low for sand and higher for clay textures above which the method begins to loss effectiveness 4 2 experimental soils the experimental design developed to measure the soil hydraulic properties from a tension gradient percolation process resulted to be accurate simple inexpensive fast and easy to implement accurate because the tension is directly measured with a water column manometer simple and inexpensive because the vacuum system does not employ any electronic mechanism and only a datalogger attached to a single pressure transducer is needed and quick and easy to implement because the complete experiment including 8 10 tensions takes no more than two hours and the soil sample is not touched or moved at any time on the other hand compared to other methods the initially dry soil samples employed in the experiment allows obtaining additional information about the wetting processes and therefore to potentially characterize the soil hysteresis phenomenon furthermore compared to the sarkar et al 2019 method where the suction is generated by a water column drop the employed air vacuum system removes the head losses caused by the water flow through the 2 m length column and also eliminates the negative effect of the possible entry of air bubbles inside the pipe finally this design is perfectly compatible with the quasi unit gradient percolation method fig 9 shows the experimental infiltration steady state curves obtained for the four sieved soils note that the greater drainage of water observed in sand should be attributed to the double length column used in this subtract the highest n value commonly observed in sand made that only up to 30 cm of tension could be applied table 2 on the other hand the percolation curve with a greater slope at higher tensions observed in clay could be attributed as will be seen later to the lower α values of these kind of soils which makes almost all the soil pores remain filled with water at high tensions under these conditions the slope of the drainage curve becomes proportional to the applied soil tension eq 3 however as the soil core base pores empty due to high suction i e loam and clay loam soils with higher α values k h decreases and thus the slope of the drainage curve the selected experimental soils were no saline and the corresponding bulk density varied from 1 18 to 1 51 g cm 3 for clay and sand respectively table 3 a significant relationship fig 10 was obtained between the θs and θs w where on average θs w was 2 smaller than the corresponding obtained from the cumulative infiltration curve although both parameters gave comparable results given the ease of estimating θs which does not require any soil handling from now on αw will be calculate using θs except for clay and loam soil columns the wfa values estimated for the sand and clay loam soils were close to the actual cylinder lengths table 3 these results suggest that the analyzed sand and clay loam soil columns were overall homogeneous for the particular case of the loam soil column the short wfa value should be attributed to a heterogeneity in the soil column probably due to a soil compaction during the water infiltration experiment due to the disc infiltrometer weight this made that ks was one order of magnitude lower than khk table 3 in contrast the poorer estimates of wfa observed in clay could be attributed to the fact that haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model does not work well in clay soils lassabatere et al 2009 this caused eq 7 did not fit well with the experimental curve forcing the sia procedure to stop before the wetting front reached the soil base although a significant relationship between ks and khk was found fig 11 a on average khk 0 011 cm s 1 was one order of magnitude higher than ks 0 0029 cm s 1 again these large differences should be attributed to the high khk obtained in loam and clay table 3 soils although ks for sand was three times lower than khk both values were within the same order of magnitude these differences could be attributed to the high permeability of the sand which together with the short column probably prevented the infiltration time from being long enough for a more accurate estimate of khk the s values estimated for the different soils were within the same order de magnitude of the corresponding values measured for the same soils using an upward infiltration method moret fernández and latorre 2017 in summary these results showed that although haverkamp et al 1994a 1994b model allows good approaches of k the dependence of khk on the β parameter and on the soil homogeneity suggests that this parameter should not be employed in the inverse analysis of the drainage curves in contrast the robustness of the sia procedure to estimate wfa and s indicates that the measured 1d infiltration curve provides interesting information to check the homogeneity of the soil column and valuable data about the soil wetting process respectively given that ks is directly estimated by darcy s law only αdr and n need to be optimized similarly to what was observed in synthetic soils the q isolines analysis showed in all the experimental soils a single crossing point whose optimum αdr n values dotted grey line in fig 12 varied with the type of soils the lowest and highest αdr n values corresponded to clay and sand respectively table 3 fig 13 intermedium values were obtained for loam and clay loam soils these results agree with data reported by carsel and parrish 1988 however unlike what is observed in synthetic soils the α n relationship obtained by applying the measured ks θs θs n and s to eq 10 did not intercept the crossing point of the different q isoline given that in synthetic soils ks θs θs n are not hysteresis dependent and s corresponds to a wetting process this difference regarding to synthetic soils should be attributed to the soil hysteresis phenomenon that makes αw to be higher than that for a draining process αdr haverkamp et al 2002 gebrenegus and ghezzehei 2011 graphically αw can be visualized dotted vertical red line in fig 12 as the crossing point between the n value corresponding to a draining process and the s line dashed green line in fig 12 in all cases αw αdr table 3 if the sand point is removed from the analysis a significant relationship fig 14 was observed between αw estimated from s and the corresponding value calculated from αdr and ih index eqs 6 and 7 the great dispersion promoted by the sand could be due the employed empirical hysteresis model does not work well in this kind of porous medium however to contrast this hypothesis further analysis would be needed thus results showed that the proposed double disc method allows satisfactory estimates of αw while a significant relationship with slope close to one found between n optimized from the drainage curves and the corresponding values measured with pc method fig 11c the relationship significantly worsened for αdr fig 11b for this last case for instance a deviation of one order of magnitude was observed between αdr measured for clay with pc 0 052 cm 1 and the corresponding value estimated from the drainage curves table 3 these differences could be attributed to limitations of the pressure plate apparatus when applied to fine textured soils solone et al 2012 argument that is supported by the good agreement between the optimized αdr for clay and to those values reported by carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 the higher stability of n could be associated to the fact that n is more related to the soil textural characteristics jirku et al 2013 in contrast the parameter α which is more related to the soil structure could be affected by the different wetting processes used in both methods which have an important influence in sieved soils with weak structure moret fernández et al 2008 thus the faster wetting process of the infiltration method could have broken down the more unstable aggregates collapsing the large soil pores and thus lowering the corresponding αdr value another factor that may affect the αdr value could be the negative influence of the infiltrometer weight in these soils with fragile structure which under saturated conditions may collapse their more unstable macropore network moret and arrúe 2005 which may also result in a decrease of the αdr value however despite these limitations in weak structured soils overall results show that the presented method allows satisfactory estimates of αdr and n 5 5 conclusions this work presents a new laboratory method and a numerical procedure to estimate soil hydraulic properties of the soils from the inverse analysis of a 1d downward infiltration curve measuerd at saturation conditions followed by a drainage with increasing tension gradients between the surface and the base of the soil column to this end a laboratory double disc system one placed at the surface and the other one at the base of a 2 5 cm high soil core associated to an air vacuum system was developed while the soil tension on the upper disc varied between 0 and 5 cm increasing suctions from 5 to 100 cm were applied to the bottom disc s and θs were calculated from the 1d transient infiltration curve ks was measured by darcy s law αdr and n were optimized form the inverse analysis of the steady state drainage curves and αw was calculated from previously obtained s θs ks and n the method was successfully validated on synthetic soils columns of 2 5 cm height and next applied on four sieved soils with textures ranged from sand to clay soils the estimated αdr and n were compared with corresponding values measured in the same experimental soils with the pressure plate method the method applied to both synthetic and experimental soils allowed accurate estimates of ks αdr and n and also a good approximation of αw in the experimental soils comparted to other existing methods the presented procedure which is suitable for small scale experiments alleviates some limitations such as i this method allows relatively fast laboratory experiments between 1 and 2 h and numerical analysis several minutes ii it allows exploring a wide range of tensions and working at relative high suctions up to 100 cm ii it can works with short soil cores i e 2 5 cm length which allows exploring more homogeneous soil samples iv the method works with steady state flows which eliminates the problem of transient flows analysis applied on stratified soils and v estimation of αdr and n are independent on θs and θr on the other hand the double disc device associated to an air vacuum system was accurate inexpensive fast and easy to implement although this procedure is limited to a maximum soil tension of approximately 100 cm it could be supplemented with the temple cell method in the event that higher soil tensions were required in summary this method could be useful in those studies where small scale experiments were requires however despite all these advantages more research should be done to explore for example the applicability of this method in undisturbed soils or how the combination of the different soil tensions allows obtaining additional information finally it would also be necessary to explore how the use of longer soil cylinders or meshes with smaller pore sizes to allow higher suctions may affect the accuracy of the method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
