15635,the framework model and methods of nürnberg were applied and evaluated in lough neagh and 19 other lakes in order to establish inflow phosphorus concentrations that support target lake values supporting concentrations in the absence of an internal load were derived and the effect of uncertainty in the model retention coefficient was relatively small 11 20 in lough neagh and an average n 17 of 9 7 in the other lakes there was further support for the model and methods from an independent estimate of the net internal load in lough neagh 13 difference and from another model in the other lakes supporting concentrations which should be lower were by an average of 11 mg p m 3 in the framework steady state with the phosphorus load is assumed but based on a generic lake model is not likely if the hydraulic residence time 0 5 0 8 yr and should lead to a decrease in phosphorus retention which was found during three periods in lough neagh based on a compilation of internal load recovery times from 23 lakes in the literature it could take between 8 and 20 years for lakes with an internal load to approach their targets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus internal load models inflow concentration non steady state nitrogen data for reference data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake nutrient models especially for phosphorus have been a major and sustained research topic in limnology a lake phosphorus model was an important element in the structure that linked nutrient sources in the catchment to the biological quality of the lake proposed early in the field by dillon and rigler 1975 a framework that this still valid today useful water quality models also allow managers to assess how a lake should respond to actions in the catchment and help stakeholders recognize this relationship manno et al 2008 while research on this topic has generally focussed on model concepts complexity and accuracy prairie 1989 arhonditsis and brett 2004 brett and benjamin 2008 khorasani and zhu 2021 the main practical application has been to estimate the nutrient load or concentration usually of phosphorus in the inflow s that supports a target lake concentration and biological condition directed management of catchment activities to reduce the export of phosphorus nitrogen or both should ideally lead to a high quality lake within the paradigm of the condensed box continuously stirred tank reactor lake model which has a large literature the publications of prairie 1989 brett and benjamin 2008 and khorasani and zhu 2021 cite most of the models an important issue that needs to be considered when applying one to a lake that has a high phosphorus concentration where the target is to reduce it is the internal phosphorus load generally this load is high in such lakes but should decrease as the external load is reduced albeit slowly jeppesen et al 2005 where the internal load is not explicitly incorporated into the model its effect is assumed to contribute via the range of lakes used to calibrate the model nürnberg 2009 lakes with a high phosphorus concentration often have considerable internal loads and vice versa so the varying contribution of internal load to the lake concentration is incorporated through the range of lakes used to calibrate the model nürnberg 2009 noted the uncertainty with the contribution of internal load when calibrating a lake phosphorus model and the lack of control of it and went on to formally separate the contributions of external and internal phosphorus load to the lake concentration nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 that model predicts the steady state concentration from the external and internal loads and she suggested three methods to estimate the internal load depending on the type of results available and whether the lake thermally stratifies this approach can also be used to derive inflow phosphorus concentrations that support a target lake concentration and our aim was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods in lough neagh and 19 other smaller lakes the model as with others used in the field assumes steady state and so in addition we assessed the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state knowing the limitations of a model helps when using it for lake management purposes as the model is a static one the time it takes to reach steady state with the inflow s depends only on the lake hydraulic residence time however if the lake has an internal load then while the model explicitly incorporates the internal load how long it would take for that load to reduce needs to be derived separately the time for reduction of the internal load has been estimated using lake models e g katsev et al 2006 observations on lakes e g jeppesen et al 2005 and through a model of the diagenesis and burial of labile phosphorus in sediment e g rippey et al 2021 there is some consistency in these estimates with an overall indication of one to three decades but to provide some more direct evidence we collated results from lakes that had their external loads reduced and for which sufficient monitoring results were available therefore the aim of the research was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods of nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 in order to derive an inflow phosphorus concentration that supports a target lake concentration in lough neagh and 19 other smaller lakes including establishing the uncertainties in estimating the lake concentration from the external and internal loads we also estimated the time it should take to reach the target lake concentrations there were two supporting objectives to identify the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state collate results to provide direct evidence of the time it takes for the internal phosphorus load to reduce 2 material and methods the symbols and definitions used here are given in table 1 with rpred we use the original definition net retention in oxic lakes that have no or a naturally low net internal load nürnberg 1998 before the change to gross sedimentation only nürnberg 2009 2 1 lough neagh and its phosphorus budget lough neagh a long term ecological research site in northern ireland is a large 383 km2 relatively shallow z 8 9 m lake which only rarely stratifies wood and smith 1993 it has a long history of eutrophication wood and smith 1993 up to the 1960s as a result of an increasing external phosphorus load foy et al 2003 since then by phosphorus and nitrogen bunting et al 2007 since the mid 1990s a reduction in external nitrogen load and lake concentration have resulted in a decrease in the chlorophyll a concentration mcelarney et al 2021 elliott et al 2016 the six main river catchments upper bann blackwater ballinderry moyola main and sixmilewater and two smaller catchments crumlin and glenavy have been gauged and monitored since the 1970s along with the outflow lower bann discharge is measured continuously 15 min internals and water samples taken weekly from the eight inflows and outflow the annual mean input and output total phosphorus loads are calculated using method 5 in johnes 2007 i e sum of total loads over sampling days multiplied by the annual mean discharge as a proportion of the total discharge over the sampling days as the monitored catchments comprise 86 of the whole catchment the whole catchment load was estimated as load from the monitored catchments divided by 0 86 if more than 4 of flow results for a catchment were missing the load was not estimated there were no outflow results for 2007 and no results for the upper bann in 1995 sixmilewater in 2010 and moyola in 1983 and 2010 11 so no catchment phosphorus loads were estimated for 1983 1995 2007 and 2010 2011 an integrated water sample was taken at a mid lake station in 10 m depth weekly up to 1992 fortnightly thereafter and the mean total phosphorus concentration calculated there were no lake results for 2009 the limit of quantitation for the total phosphorus determination is 10 mg p m 3 rmeas was calculated as input output input and annual obs c as the arithmetic mean of typically 30 3 results in each year minimum 15 and maximum 52 2 2 other lakes samples were retrieved at least monthly from the shores of 19 other lakes from 1999 2004 or 2008 onwards the limit of quantitation of the total phosphorus determination is 10 mg p m 3 the theoretical τw values were estimated using the measured catchment area lake area and mean depth along with rainfall and potential evapotranspiration estimates made by interpolation using long term 1971 2000 data sets of annual mean rainfall and potential evapotranspiration for sites throughout northern ireland 2 3 lake phosphorus models the main use of the models was to estimate the inflow phosphorus concentration cext that supports a target lake concentration section 2 6 and the lake phosphorus framework model and methods of nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 were used while there is choice of whether to use the gross internal load or the net after any sedimentation we used the net for lough neagh as it could be estimated using the phosphorus mass balance budget net cint 2 method section 2 5 and therefore the model nürnberg 2009 is 1 predicted c cext 1 rpred netcint 2 where rpred 15 18 qs and net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas we assumed that a lake of high quality at or better than the good moderate quevauviller et al 2008 boundary section 2 6 would have little or no net internal load so net cint 2 in eq 1 would be zero rpred estimated using the r7 model of nürnberg 1984 is therefore key in eq 1 that statistical model was developed and calibrated using oxic lakes n 54 and so there is some uncertainty in the predicted value for a specific lake based on fig 1 a in nürnberg 1984 it applies over a qs range up to 80 m yr 1 with an uncertainty of 0 05 up to a qs value of 20 m yr 1 0 1 at higher values an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 was used when applying eq 1 and when calculating net cint 2 section 2 5 even incorporating this uncertainty into the model predictions some additional evidence to support the rpred value or the accuracy of the lake concentrations based on eq 1 with little or no internal load is desirable nürnberg 2009 for this we used the predictions of another lake phosphorus model model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 it was selected after comparing the behaviour of three general lake models and r7 nürnberg 1984 section 1 supplementary materials and establishing its accuracy in 14 irish lakes section 2 supplementary materials model 28 of khorasani zhu and eq 9 of prairie performed best in these 14 lakes which have some and variable internal load the mean and median errors observed predicted are 6 2 and 2 3 mg p m 3 for prairie and 2 3 and 0 8 mg p m 3 for khorasani zhu model 28 the error is larger in some lakes but both models are most accurate at predicted c 50 mg p m 3 based on this assessment we used model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 to provide some support for the cext value derived using eq 1 in the other 19 lakes as the data set n 738 used to calibrate this model contains lakes with unknown and variable internal loads the supporting cext concentrations should be lower than those from eq 1 with a net cint 2 of zero which applies to lakes with no or naturally low internal phosphorus loads model 28 of khursani and zhu 2021 2 predicted c cf x 1 1 4 0 095 t w 0 489 c e x t 0 333 1 z 0 288 0 5 2 t w 0 489 c e x t 0 333 z 0 288 where cf the correction factor sprugel 1983 is 1 159 2 4 steady state of lake phosphorus models we investigated the conditions under which a lake is in steady state with its inflow phosphorus and internal phosphorus cycling mainly the internal load in a cstr model loss through the outflow is described by ρ or τw and permanent loss to the sediment by the sedimentation coefficient σ chapra 1997 lecture 3 a time to 90 of the steady state concentration t90 was used as most of the change has occurred by then with progressively slower change to 95 or 99 of the steady state value thereafter t90 for loss only through the outflow is 2 303τw as the residence time for sedimentation τsts is σ 1 t90 for loss only through sedimentation is 2 303τs the t90 times for τw values of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 yr and σ values between 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 to represent smaller eutrophic lakes were first calculated separately and then combined the σ range was selected based on the following for populations of lakes khorasani and zhu 2021 derived a value of 0 786 yr 1 jones and bachman 1976 0 65 and brett and benjamin 2008 0 45 in a hierarchical framework cheng et al 2010 estimated values for all lakes and for categories of z and τw 0 45 yr 1 for all lakes but 0 73 for lakes with z 10 3 m and 0 32 for 10 3 m and 1 01 for lakes with τw 2 6 yr and 0 33 for 2 6 yr in summary σ values for most lakes vary between 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 the overall residence time for 90 of the combined loss through the outflow and by sedimentation t90 combined was calculated using the addition of residence times lerman 1979 pp 5 t combined 1 ρ σ with t 90 combined 2 303 τ combined 2 5 internal phosphorus load the annual internal phosphorus load for lough neagh was estimated using the phosphorus mass balance method of nürnberg 2009 1998 and expressed as a concentration net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas to provide some support for these values and to estimate the internal load in the other 19 lakes the in situ p increase method of nürnberg 2009 1998 was used and the value expressed as a concentration cint 1 this method uses the increase of concentration during the summer and the load lies between the gross and net value 2 6 target lake total phosphorus concentration the target lake total phosphorus concentrations were derived using the wfd uktag 2016 methodology and was taken to be at the good moderate boundary with this approach the site specific reference concentration is derived using statistical models based on altitude alkalinity and depth from which the boundary values between five quality classes high good moderate poor and bad are calculated the high good and good moderate class boundaries are calculated using the reference concentration and an ecological quality ratio value derived from linear regression based on alkalinity and depth the other class boundaries use fixed intervals from the good moderate concentration there are models for two region and for coloured water lakes in northern ireland and some overriding rules the statistical models were derived by cardoso et al 2007 using results from 567 lakes distributed throughout europe and considered to be at reference condition only slightly impacted the reference annual geometric mean concentration is 13 mg p m 3 if lough neagh is considered a clear water lake and 26 if coloured 2 7 time to reduce the internal phosphorus load to provide additional information on how long it takes the internal load to reduce to a low or natural amount we collated results from the literature from lakes that had their external loads reduced and had been monitored for at least 5 years the following results were collated from tables or digitized from charts τw qs the time period of monitoring after reduction in external load and cext at the start and end of the monitoring from this information an estimate of the time for the internal load to decrease was made errors may have been introduced during digitizing the charts in the valuable compilation of jeppesen et al 2005 no results for cext were directly presented however cext was estimated from the predicted c values in their fig 1 a by applying the lake model in their eq 1 3 results 3 1 steady state of lake phosphorus models as the cstr model used assumes steady state the conditions under which this applies were assessed the t90 times for loss only through the outflow represented by τw of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 yr are 1 15 2 30 and 3 45 yr respectively loss only through sedimentation represented by σ of 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 are 7 68 and 2 30 yr respectively and the variation of t90 combined for the combined losses is shown in fig 1 for t90 combined to be 1 yr or less τw needs to be less than 0 5 to 0 8 yr for a lake to be at steady state with σ 1 yr 1 this should apply to a relatively large change in cext at the start of a year and it is possible this criterion could be relaxed for smaller changes in cext changes in cext later in the year may only produce steady state the following year this is a simple framework with generic τw and σ values and phosphorus sedimentation in smaller rapidly flushed lakes is best described using the retention coefficient prairie 1989 however it suggests that only relatively rapidly flushed lakes would be at steady state with a changing phosphorus load while there are implications for the estimation of σ in lakes that are not at steady state the effect on the more empirically based rmeas is relevant here in a lake at steady state loss through the outflow and to the sediment are at equilibrium with the input therefore as the retained load is in equilibrium with the input load rmeas is accurate retained load input load in a lake not at steady state if input is increasing then loss through the outflow or to the sediment or both would not be complete and so the retained load would be smaller than that at steady state while rmeas is retained input a smaller retained load should lead to a smaller rmeas further the phosphorus that is in excess of the steady state concentration would be carried over to the following year contributing to a smaller rmeas in that year as well the same outcome a depression in rmeas also applies to a decreasing input load when a lake is not at steady state based on this assessment a lake is not likely to be in steady state if τw 0 5 0 8 yr and this may lead to a decrease in rmeas for one or more years compared to the steady state value 3 2 lough neagh phosphorus budget the lough neagh phosphorus model eq 1 uses annual values for cext τw qs input and output total phosphorus load from which rpred and rmeas are calculated and then net cint 2 and predicted c the variation of τw input load output load and retained load over 1984 2018 is shown in section 3 supplementary materials with changes in the key properties rpred rmeas and cext presented in fig 2 and obs c cext 1 rpred and net cint 2 in fig 3 rpred varied little being influenced only by relatively small changes in qs τw while rmeas was quite variable it tended to be smaller from 2003 onwards with an average of 0 357 0 0298 between 1984 and 1994 0 330 0 0427 between 1995 2002 and 0 191 0 0274 between 2003 and 2018 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials the reasons for this change are investigated in the discussion in relation to the budget described fully in section 3 supplementary materials some features can be noted first the variations in input load are mainly determined by changes in the annual inflow volume second it follows that the input and output loads decrease as τw increases although there is always substantial variability at a given τw value finally even with the variability in input output and retained loads there were three periods during which input load cext obs c rpred rmeas net cint 2 and τw were different but relatively constant 1984 1994 1995 2002 and 2003 2018 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials as the model is predicted c cext 1 rpred net cint 2 eq 1 fig 3 shows how the relative contributions of the net external and net internal loads to the lake water concentration vary both contribute with external load more important up to 1999 generally equal afterwards there were rapid year to year variations in both contributions particularly between 1991 and 1994 1998 2003 and 2014 2017 and especially with internal load the variations in internal load were mainly caused by changes in rmeas fig 2 as net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas with rpred relatively constant and cext intermediate fig 2 the reason for these rapid changes in net cint 2 and rmeas 1991 1994 1998 2003 2014 2017 is likely due to the lake not being at steady state with changing input phosphorus load first the overall average τw is 1 30 yr section 3 supplementary materials larger than the criterion of 0 6 0 8 yr suggested for steady state second a detailed analysis of the changes in rmeas and input phosphorus load section 4 supplementary materials shows that the reductions in rmeas coincide with a rapid change in the input load eight out of ten times during these three periods 3 3 lough neagh phosphorus model and supporting cext the relationship between obs c and predicted c 1984 2018 is shown in fig 4 the correlation coefficient is 0 616 p 0 001 with a mean and median error obs c predicted c of 2 3 and 0 28 mg p m 3 while there is almost no bias over the 30 years of predictions the error is relatively large 20 mg p m 3 in 1992 1994 2000 and 2018 the first three years fall within two of the periods of rapid changes in rmeas and net cint 2 1991 1994 1998 2003 and the fourth is close to the third period 2014 2017 in 2018 the predicted c 92 2 mg p m 3 and cext 1 rpred 48 3 mg p m 3 were the lowest in the monitoring period while obs c was not unusual fig 3 leading to the large error omitting these four years the correlation coefficient becomes 0 860 p 0 001 and the mean and median errors 0 21 and 2 2 mg p m 3 the main evidence available to support this model is another estimate of the internal load the in situ p increase cint 1 method was applied and the value compared to the results from the phosphorus mass balance method net cint 2 fig 3 gibson et al 2001 in a description and analysis of the internal phosphorus load in lough neagh 1974 1997 presented the variation of monthly mean obs c values for 1995 during the summer obs c increased from 70 mg p m 3 in june to 200 in september an increase of 130 mg p m 3 this in situ p increase should lie between the gross and net concentration but if it is taken to be gross then net cint 1 1 rpred gross cint 1 the inflow was missing for one catchment in 1995 so no qs value is available but the mean of 1994 and 1996 was used for rpred 0 604 giving a net cint 1 of 51 5 mg p m 3 a net cint 2 value is missing for 1995 and the values fluctuate between 28 6 1993 83 4 1994 65 9 1996 and 54 8 1997 but the mean 58 2 mg p m 3 is close to the net cint 1 value of 51 5 a 13 difference this relatively small difference allows us to take the cint 1 value in lough neagh to be an estimate of the gross internal load similar analysis of other years would provide additional evidence on the nature of the internal load derived by the in situ p increase method in lough neagh with this support for the phosphorus model for lough neagh it can be used to derive the cext value that supports the geometric mean total phosphorus concentration at the good moderate g m boundary with no or a naturally low net internal phosphorus load lough neagh is on the boundary between a clear water and a coloured lake so the g m boundary could be 24 or 44 mg p m 3 respectively based on eq 1 with net cint 2 of zero and the mean rpred for 2003 2018 of 0 597 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials uncertainty 0 05 the supporting cext concentrations are 60 6 6 11 and 109 0 22 1 20 mg p m 3 a lake at the boundary between two classes always needs further assessment but lough neagh on the boundary between a clear and coloured water lake has a large effect on the targets for the lake and inflow as the value of rpred is central to the model eq 1 we used an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 fig 2 to indicate its influence on the estimates of the net external and net internal loads fig 3 the uncertainties are not large compared to the values of the properties and the magnitude of the changes when the errors are combined in the model as lough neagh has a substantial internal load in its current state the uncertainty is larger fig 4 3 4 the other lakes these 19 lakes do not have phosphorus budgets so the monitoring results were used to describe the long term change in annual obs c and the long term annual cycle of monthly obs c the full results are presented in section 5 supplementary materials with two representative examples shown in figs 5 and 6 for each lake the g m total phosphorous boundary was derived depending on whether it is clear or coloured water and the cext value that supports it was calculated using two models eq 1 with a net cint of zero and an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 and eq 2 there was little change in the annual obs c in stoneyford although a suggestion of an increases from 2017 fig 5 but the long term 2004 2018 average concentration mean of the annual obs c is 85 9 mg p m 3 there is clear evidence of a summer increase in concentration due to an internal load from which a cint 1 value of 95 0 mgp m 3 can be estimated it is a coloured water lake with a g m boundary of 21 mg p m 3 and the supporting cext value is 42 4 3 mg m 3 with eq 1 and 29 mg p m 3 with eq 2 the was no change in the annual obs c in lough ross giving a long term average concentration of 63 6 mg p m 3 and there is no evidence for a summer increase in concentration fig 6 it is a coloured water lake with a g m boundary of 37 mg p m 3 and the supporting cint is 45 2 7 mg m 3 with both eqn 1 and eq 2 unlike stoneyford the two models give identical supporting cext values but this is may be due to the lake s short τw time 0 08 yr compared to 0 44 in stoneyford increasing the predicted c in the khorasani zhu model section 1 supplementary materials and consequently producing a larger cext value table 2 summarize the results for the 19 lakes note two sites are used for lower lough erne eleven lakes have no internal load cint 1 eight have varying from 8 3 mg p m 3 in lough island reavy to 327 5 in portmore but typically 20 60 mg p m 3 the g m boundary concentration varies from 15 mg p m 3 in island reavy to 65 in gullion with a mean of 37 3 mg p m 3 median 36 five lakes have g m values greater than 50 mg p m 3 they are coloured water shallow z 2 4 m lakes with alkalinities greater than 1 2 meq l 1 all of which increase the reference concentration wfd uktag 2016 lough beg is a widening of the lower river bann outlet of lough neagh and is omitted from further analysis there are two other linked lake systems upper lough macnean g m boundary 37 mg p m 3 flows into lower lough macnean g m boundary 53 mg p m 3 and so achieving the quality target in the upper lough should lead to that in the lower lough as well similarly upper lough erne 51 mg p m 3 flows into lower lough erne a and b 36 mg p m 3 but as the lower lake is deeper its g m boundary concentration is lower the cext values that support the g m boundary concentrations in the absence of an internal load vary from 28 2 1 to 80 10 2 mg p m 3 except for clea lakes 148 21 1 gullion 336 93 2 and portmore 134 14 5 they all have boundary values greater than 50 mg p m 3 and higher 0 536 0 807 than the average rpred value 0 494 both of which increase the supporting cext concentration the effect of the uncertainty in the rpred value is relatively small in most of the lakes only over 20 in two gullion 28 rpred 0 807 and island reavy 21 0 748 both have high rpred values which lead to low 1 rpred values where the influence of a fixed uncertainty on the cext is greatest ignoring these two lakes the mean n 17 error is 9 7 median 9 3 minimum 6 0 maximum 14 the only support for the model rpred value in these lakes was the predictions of another model model 28 khorasani and zhu 2021 as it contains some and unknown contributions from internal load the supporting cext values should be lower the difference eq 1 with net cint 2 of zero minus khorasani zhu is over 50 mg p m 3 in three lakes clea lakes 65 gullion 226 portmore 64 which have high g m boundary concentrations omitting these the mean difference n 16 is 12 mg p m 3 median 14 minimum 9 lower lough erne maximum 35 fea there is little basis to determine if these differences are sufficient to support the rpred values but they are not large for most of the lakes 3 5 time to reduce the internal phosphorus load the detailed results collated are provided in section 6 supplementary materials with a summary in table 3 it illustrates the uncertainty of the estimates e g more than 5 8 years over 10 years etc and there was no relationship between the time and either start cext end cext or the change the estimates are relatively imprecise as factors such as how quickly and by how much the external load was reduced the frequency and length of the monitoring length of the initial eutrophication of the lake size of the internal load etc could affect the time and will vary from lake to lake however there is a broad tendency to three values approximately 8 6 to 10 yr 14 yr 12 to 16 or 20 yr fig 7 the average n 21 is 12 2 yr 7 6 yr for those lakes n 11 with time 11 yr and 17 2 for those lakes n 10 with a time 12 yr or more 4 discussion the main aim of the research was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods of nürnberg in order to derive an inflow phosphorus concentrations that support target lake concentrations using lough neagh and 19 other smaller lake as examples in the evaluation the uncertainties in estimating the lake concentration from the external and internal loads were estimated we also identified the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state and collated results to provide direct evidence of the time it takes for the internal phosphorus load to reduce 4 1 nürnberg s framework model and methods the framework to separate the contributions of the external and internal loads to the lake phosphorus concentration was clear to understand the cstr lake model is well established and the methods used to estimate the internal load were easy to apply generally steady state conditions are assumed but we identified using a generic cstr lake model that it is not likely if τw 0 5 0 8 yr and should lead to a decrease in rmeas for one or more years compared to the steady state value section 3 1 we found this behaviour in lough neagh where there were rapid changes in rmeas during 1991 1994 1998 2003 and 2014 2017 when the lake was not at steady state with a changing input phosphorus load section 3 2 averaging results is recommended when applying these models nürnberg 2009 the value of rpred is key in the lake model eq 1 and so we included a fixed uncertainty fig 2 in estimating the net external and net internal loads fig 3 the uncertainty is small compared to the load values and their variation but a little larger when the external and internal loads are combined in the model fig 4 however as there are also uncertainties in estimating cext and rmeas when calculating the loads its influence may not be the most important we also provided some additional support for the model in lough neagh 4 1 1 and the other lakes 4 1 2 4 1 1 lough neagh the lough neagh phosphorus model reproduced the variation of annual mean obs c over 1984 2018 period well with mean and median errors of 2 3 and 0 28 mg p m 3 respectively section 3 3 while this is not an independent assessment of the model it does provide some evidence that it can be used to derive a cext that supports a target lake concentration there was additional evidence to support the lake model in the agreement between two estimates of the internal load 51 5 and 58 2 mg p m 3 section 3 3 the difference 13 is relatively small and provides support for the lake model foy et al 2003 reconstructed the phosphorus budget for lough neagh 1840 2000 using the diatom and chironomid record in sediment cores and a contemporary budget identified that sediment release began in the 1960s and estimated it to be at least 36 mg p m 3 if this is taken to be net release and that it would increase as eutrophication of the lake developed then this is some further support for the net cint 2 values in fig 3 4 1 2 the other lakes the water column monitoring results were used to establish long term trends and if there was an internal load which was estimated using the in situ p increase method cint 1 cext values that support the target concentrations were able to be derived table 2 the only support for the model in the other lakes was to use another lake model model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 to derive supporting cext values these should be lower as that model includes variable contributions from internal load for most of the lakes 16 out of 19 the values were an average of 12 mg p m 3 lower section 3 4 which lends general support to the rpred values used in eq 1 for these lakes 4 2 time to reduce the internal load and reach steady state concentration the model is a steady state one and only indicates the time it would take the lake adjust to it external load based on the hydraulic residence time if there is an internal load which is common in lakes needing remediation the time it takes for it to reduce is also involved based on observational evidence there is a general tendency for it to be either approximately 8 6 to 10 yr 14 yr 12 to 16 or 20 yr fig 7 these values are similar to the one to three decades summarized by rippey et al 2021 from a compilation of evidence from models and observations a better basis to choose a time for internal load reduction in a lake is desirable but in the absence of a direct estimate 8 to 20 yr can be suggested if there is no or little internal load then the time to the new steady state concentration would be determined by τw with t90 2 303τw these two rules were used to select the time to steady state in the 19 lakes table 2 4 2 1 lough neagh the t90 value for the internal phosphorus load to reduce in lough neagh has been estimated by applying the lewis penn model to five sediment cores rippey et al 2021 varying from 15 to 23 yr mean 20 6 as the mean τw is 1 30 yr the time to reach the target lake concentration of 24 or 44 mg p m 3 should be determined mainly by the reduction in internal load so around 21 years fig 8 shows the modelled change in lake phosphorus concentration to reductions in the inflow concentration for three values of net internal load as the current value reduces to a half and one tenth over 21 years as advised nürnberg 2009 average values were used to apply the model eq 1 the 2003 2018 mean rpred is 0 597 net cint 2 63 3 mg p m 3 and cext 159 mg p m 3 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 was applied the model indicates that the internal load needs to be reduced considerably approaching one tenth of the current value to be able to achieve either g m boundary concentration the main uncertainty is how the internal load reduces as cext obs c or net phosphorus sedimentation decreases as a result of reductions in cext katsev et al 2006 found unstable predictions of the long term efflux of phosphorus from sediment in their diagenetic model when return of phosphorus from the water was included more understanding of this link is desirable but we can note that there is some consistency in the time for the internal load to reduce in the 21 lakes in fig 7 even though there is great variety in their eutrophication history size depth how much and how quickly the external load was reduced etc 4 2 2 other lakes the t90 times for the lakes given in table 2 were selected using the two criteria established in section 4 2 eight of the lakes have internal loads beg cam clea lakes gullion island reavy mourne portmore stoneyford and without direct information on the rate of reduction of internal load in them there is uncertainty in their response time at present this is given as 8 20 years except for lough island reavy that lake has a small internal load of 8 3 mg p m 3 and a long τw value 3 82 yr so the 2 303τw criterion was applied the remaining lakes should respond according to the 2 303τw values 4 3 recovery of lough neagh the modelled recovery of lough neagh fig 8 indicates the response of the lake concentration to reductions in the inflow concentration and net internal load in addition to the uncertainty about how the internal load responds to reduction in inflow lake concentration there are two further considerations for the recovery of the lake change in the lake phosphorus cycle from 2003 and the influence of phosphorus and nitrogen on chlorophyll a 4 3 1 change in the lake phosphorus cycle the reduction in rmeas from 0 330 during 1995 2002 to 0 191 in 2003 2018 section 3 2 represents a considerable change in the lake phosphorus cycle and the evidence suggests that it was a consequence of the earlier depletion of total oxidized nitrogen ton nitrate nitrite in the water column mcelarney et al 2021 once the sequence of mineralization of organic matter in the sediment moved from ton after its depletion in the water column to mn iv then fe iii etc froelich et al 1979 wersin et al 1991 the release of phosphorus sorbed to iron oxyhydroxide from the sediment began earlier there is no direct evidence for this sequence in the lough neagh sediment but there is for other lakes wersin et al 1991 park and jaffe 1999 hemond and lin 2010 smith et al 2011 further movement of highly soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations towards the sediment surface has been observed in lake okeechobee moore et al 1998 and increases of soluble reactive phosphorus concentration along with soluble iron and especially manganese have been observed in the upper sediment layers of lake vallentunasjon lofgren and bostrom 1989 there is however indirect evidence to support this release mechanism in lough neagh first the redox potential at four sediment depths from march to october 1979 shows a sudden decrease in mid july even at 10 mm indicating that release of phosphorus was likely rippey and jewson 1982 gibson et al 2001 measured a release of 80 tonnes p in july 1979 the results for 1983 show similar behaviour with a decrease in july even temporarily at the sediment surface section 9 supplementary materials the release was 140 tonnes p in july 1983 gibson et al 2001 second the seasonal cycle of iron manganese and soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column of lough neagh 1983 section 7 supplementary materials is similar to that described by mayer et al 1982 in the hypolimnion of hypereutrophic lake sebasticook as mineralization proceeds to produce first soluble mn and then fe the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus increases more closely associated with mn than fe the increase of fe in lough neagh is not as great as that observed in sebasticook probably as there is still a thin oxic layer in the sediment compared to full anoxia in the hypolimnion of sebasticook 4 3 2 influence of phosphorus and nitrogen on chlorophyll a whether achieving the target inflow and lake phosphorus concentrations alone will lead to a desired chlorophyll a concentration needs consideration of the relative influence of nitrogen and phosphorus on biological productivity lewis jr et al 2011 schindler et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the chlorophyll concentration has been reducing lough neagh since the mid 1990s as a result of a lower nitrogen input load and lake concentration mcelarney et al 2021 elliott et al 2015 this is a result of catchment based nutrient management measures under the northern ireland nitrates action plan this outlines seasonal and mass controls on fertilisers in addition to restrictions on land types that can receive fertilisers and failure to comply with such measures can result in financial penalties if the trend continues further decreases in chlorophyll would be expected action to reduce nitrogen inputs has been successful whereas it is more difficult to reduce phosphorus inputs from the large catchment and there is also the considerable influence of the internal phosphorus load on the lake concentration whether further action to reduce nitrogen or phosphorus inputs or both depends on the reduction in chlorophyll expected and the relative ease of reducing the inputs a reduction in lake phosphorus concentration is however needed to reduce the internal load some indication of the response of chlorophyll to combinations of lake total phosphorus and ton concentrations can be provided by using chlorophyll nutrient models table 4 as no correction factors are available for the models a typical value of 1 15 was used or the untransformed values could be considered geometric means table 4 was generated using the following values observed 2003 2018 mean total phosphorus concentration of 135 mg p m 3 72 in the absence of an internal load 44 and 24 the target values for a colored and clear water lake observed 2003 2018 mean ton concentration of 294 mg n m 3 and 100 which could be produced if the current reductions continue the observed 2003 2018 mean chlorophyll a concentration is 43 4 mg m 3 model 1 does not reproduce the chlorophyll concentration the other models are better predictors with values of 29 40 mg m 3 compared to the observed 43 4 and model 4 the closest a decrease of chlorophyll to 14 15 and 8 9 mg m 3 as phosphorus is reduced to 44 and 24 mg p m 3 is predicted reducing ton to 100 mg n m 3 is predicted to not affect the chlorophyll at the current total phosphorus concentration and only reduce it a little even if it decreases 18 31 and 15 26 mg m 3 for total phosphorus of 100 and 80 mg p m 3 for all of the nitrogen and phosphorus combinations except total phosphorus of 24 mg p m 3 the n p mass ratio still indicates nitrogen deficiency based on phosphorus deficiency above 23 and nitrogen deficiency below 9 guildford and hecky 2000 even at the lowest phosphorus concentration there is still no phosphorus deficiency with both nutrients influencing the chlorophyll concentration further assessment is required to determine the influence of nitrogen and phosphorus on chlorophyll and other biological properties and the catchment actions needed to reduce the nutrient input loads the predictions of these empirical models are most accurate for lakes with typical relative concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus lough neagh however has an unusual relationship as the 2003 2018 averages 135 mg p m 3 for total phosphorus 294 mg n m 3 for total oxidized nitrogen and 43 4 mg m 3 for chlorophyll a place it well outside the scatter plot of european lakes poikane et al 2022 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15635,the framework model and methods of nürnberg were applied and evaluated in lough neagh and 19 other lakes in order to establish inflow phosphorus concentrations that support target lake values supporting concentrations in the absence of an internal load were derived and the effect of uncertainty in the model retention coefficient was relatively small 11 20 in lough neagh and an average n 17 of 9 7 in the other lakes there was further support for the model and methods from an independent estimate of the net internal load in lough neagh 13 difference and from another model in the other lakes supporting concentrations which should be lower were by an average of 11 mg p m 3 in the framework steady state with the phosphorus load is assumed but based on a generic lake model is not likely if the hydraulic residence time 0 5 0 8 yr and should lead to a decrease in phosphorus retention which was found during three periods in lough neagh based on a compilation of internal load recovery times from 23 lakes in the literature it could take between 8 and 20 years for lakes with an internal load to approach their targets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus internal load models inflow concentration non steady state nitrogen data for reference data will be made available on request 1 introduction lake nutrient models especially for phosphorus have been a major and sustained research topic in limnology a lake phosphorus model was an important element in the structure that linked nutrient sources in the catchment to the biological quality of the lake proposed early in the field by dillon and rigler 1975 a framework that this still valid today useful water quality models also allow managers to assess how a lake should respond to actions in the catchment and help stakeholders recognize this relationship manno et al 2008 while research on this topic has generally focussed on model concepts complexity and accuracy prairie 1989 arhonditsis and brett 2004 brett and benjamin 2008 khorasani and zhu 2021 the main practical application has been to estimate the nutrient load or concentration usually of phosphorus in the inflow s that supports a target lake concentration and biological condition directed management of catchment activities to reduce the export of phosphorus nitrogen or both should ideally lead to a high quality lake within the paradigm of the condensed box continuously stirred tank reactor lake model which has a large literature the publications of prairie 1989 brett and benjamin 2008 and khorasani and zhu 2021 cite most of the models an important issue that needs to be considered when applying one to a lake that has a high phosphorus concentration where the target is to reduce it is the internal phosphorus load generally this load is high in such lakes but should decrease as the external load is reduced albeit slowly jeppesen et al 2005 where the internal load is not explicitly incorporated into the model its effect is assumed to contribute via the range of lakes used to calibrate the model nürnberg 2009 lakes with a high phosphorus concentration often have considerable internal loads and vice versa so the varying contribution of internal load to the lake concentration is incorporated through the range of lakes used to calibrate the model nürnberg 2009 noted the uncertainty with the contribution of internal load when calibrating a lake phosphorus model and the lack of control of it and went on to formally separate the contributions of external and internal phosphorus load to the lake concentration nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 that model predicts the steady state concentration from the external and internal loads and she suggested three methods to estimate the internal load depending on the type of results available and whether the lake thermally stratifies this approach can also be used to derive inflow phosphorus concentrations that support a target lake concentration and our aim was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods in lough neagh and 19 other smaller lakes the model as with others used in the field assumes steady state and so in addition we assessed the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state knowing the limitations of a model helps when using it for lake management purposes as the model is a static one the time it takes to reach steady state with the inflow s depends only on the lake hydraulic residence time however if the lake has an internal load then while the model explicitly incorporates the internal load how long it would take for that load to reduce needs to be derived separately the time for reduction of the internal load has been estimated using lake models e g katsev et al 2006 observations on lakes e g jeppesen et al 2005 and through a model of the diagenesis and burial of labile phosphorus in sediment e g rippey et al 2021 there is some consistency in these estimates with an overall indication of one to three decades but to provide some more direct evidence we collated results from lakes that had their external loads reduced and for which sufficient monitoring results were available therefore the aim of the research was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods of nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 in order to derive an inflow phosphorus concentration that supports a target lake concentration in lough neagh and 19 other smaller lakes including establishing the uncertainties in estimating the lake concentration from the external and internal loads we also estimated the time it should take to reach the target lake concentrations there were two supporting objectives to identify the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state collate results to provide direct evidence of the time it takes for the internal phosphorus load to reduce 2 material and methods the symbols and definitions used here are given in table 1 with rpred we use the original definition net retention in oxic lakes that have no or a naturally low net internal load nürnberg 1998 before the change to gross sedimentation only nürnberg 2009 2 1 lough neagh and its phosphorus budget lough neagh a long term ecological research site in northern ireland is a large 383 km2 relatively shallow z 8 9 m lake which only rarely stratifies wood and smith 1993 it has a long history of eutrophication wood and smith 1993 up to the 1960s as a result of an increasing external phosphorus load foy et al 2003 since then by phosphorus and nitrogen bunting et al 2007 since the mid 1990s a reduction in external nitrogen load and lake concentration have resulted in a decrease in the chlorophyll a concentration mcelarney et al 2021 elliott et al 2016 the six main river catchments upper bann blackwater ballinderry moyola main and sixmilewater and two smaller catchments crumlin and glenavy have been gauged and monitored since the 1970s along with the outflow lower bann discharge is measured continuously 15 min internals and water samples taken weekly from the eight inflows and outflow the annual mean input and output total phosphorus loads are calculated using method 5 in johnes 2007 i e sum of total loads over sampling days multiplied by the annual mean discharge as a proportion of the total discharge over the sampling days as the monitored catchments comprise 86 of the whole catchment the whole catchment load was estimated as load from the monitored catchments divided by 0 86 if more than 4 of flow results for a catchment were missing the load was not estimated there were no outflow results for 2007 and no results for the upper bann in 1995 sixmilewater in 2010 and moyola in 1983 and 2010 11 so no catchment phosphorus loads were estimated for 1983 1995 2007 and 2010 2011 an integrated water sample was taken at a mid lake station in 10 m depth weekly up to 1992 fortnightly thereafter and the mean total phosphorus concentration calculated there were no lake results for 2009 the limit of quantitation for the total phosphorus determination is 10 mg p m 3 rmeas was calculated as input output input and annual obs c as the arithmetic mean of typically 30 3 results in each year minimum 15 and maximum 52 2 2 other lakes samples were retrieved at least monthly from the shores of 19 other lakes from 1999 2004 or 2008 onwards the limit of quantitation of the total phosphorus determination is 10 mg p m 3 the theoretical τw values were estimated using the measured catchment area lake area and mean depth along with rainfall and potential evapotranspiration estimates made by interpolation using long term 1971 2000 data sets of annual mean rainfall and potential evapotranspiration for sites throughout northern ireland 2 3 lake phosphorus models the main use of the models was to estimate the inflow phosphorus concentration cext that supports a target lake concentration section 2 6 and the lake phosphorus framework model and methods of nürnberg 1984 1998 2009 were used while there is choice of whether to use the gross internal load or the net after any sedimentation we used the net for lough neagh as it could be estimated using the phosphorus mass balance budget net cint 2 method section 2 5 and therefore the model nürnberg 2009 is 1 predicted c cext 1 rpred netcint 2 where rpred 15 18 qs and net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas we assumed that a lake of high quality at or better than the good moderate quevauviller et al 2008 boundary section 2 6 would have little or no net internal load so net cint 2 in eq 1 would be zero rpred estimated using the r7 model of nürnberg 1984 is therefore key in eq 1 that statistical model was developed and calibrated using oxic lakes n 54 and so there is some uncertainty in the predicted value for a specific lake based on fig 1 a in nürnberg 1984 it applies over a qs range up to 80 m yr 1 with an uncertainty of 0 05 up to a qs value of 20 m yr 1 0 1 at higher values an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 was used when applying eq 1 and when calculating net cint 2 section 2 5 even incorporating this uncertainty into the model predictions some additional evidence to support the rpred value or the accuracy of the lake concentrations based on eq 1 with little or no internal load is desirable nürnberg 2009 for this we used the predictions of another lake phosphorus model model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 it was selected after comparing the behaviour of three general lake models and r7 nürnberg 1984 section 1 supplementary materials and establishing its accuracy in 14 irish lakes section 2 supplementary materials model 28 of khorasani zhu and eq 9 of prairie performed best in these 14 lakes which have some and variable internal load the mean and median errors observed predicted are 6 2 and 2 3 mg p m 3 for prairie and 2 3 and 0 8 mg p m 3 for khorasani zhu model 28 the error is larger in some lakes but both models are most accurate at predicted c 50 mg p m 3 based on this assessment we used model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 to provide some support for the cext value derived using eq 1 in the other 19 lakes as the data set n 738 used to calibrate this model contains lakes with unknown and variable internal loads the supporting cext concentrations should be lower than those from eq 1 with a net cint 2 of zero which applies to lakes with no or naturally low internal phosphorus loads model 28 of khursani and zhu 2021 2 predicted c cf x 1 1 4 0 095 t w 0 489 c e x t 0 333 1 z 0 288 0 5 2 t w 0 489 c e x t 0 333 z 0 288 where cf the correction factor sprugel 1983 is 1 159 2 4 steady state of lake phosphorus models we investigated the conditions under which a lake is in steady state with its inflow phosphorus and internal phosphorus cycling mainly the internal load in a cstr model loss through the outflow is described by ρ or τw and permanent loss to the sediment by the sedimentation coefficient σ chapra 1997 lecture 3 a time to 90 of the steady state concentration t90 was used as most of the change has occurred by then with progressively slower change to 95 or 99 of the steady state value thereafter t90 for loss only through the outflow is 2 303τw as the residence time for sedimentation τsts is σ 1 t90 for loss only through sedimentation is 2 303τs the t90 times for τw values of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 yr and σ values between 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 to represent smaller eutrophic lakes were first calculated separately and then combined the σ range was selected based on the following for populations of lakes khorasani and zhu 2021 derived a value of 0 786 yr 1 jones and bachman 1976 0 65 and brett and benjamin 2008 0 45 in a hierarchical framework cheng et al 2010 estimated values for all lakes and for categories of z and τw 0 45 yr 1 for all lakes but 0 73 for lakes with z 10 3 m and 0 32 for 10 3 m and 1 01 for lakes with τw 2 6 yr and 0 33 for 2 6 yr in summary σ values for most lakes vary between 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 the overall residence time for 90 of the combined loss through the outflow and by sedimentation t90 combined was calculated using the addition of residence times lerman 1979 pp 5 t combined 1 ρ σ with t 90 combined 2 303 τ combined 2 5 internal phosphorus load the annual internal phosphorus load for lough neagh was estimated using the phosphorus mass balance method of nürnberg 2009 1998 and expressed as a concentration net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas to provide some support for these values and to estimate the internal load in the other 19 lakes the in situ p increase method of nürnberg 2009 1998 was used and the value expressed as a concentration cint 1 this method uses the increase of concentration during the summer and the load lies between the gross and net value 2 6 target lake total phosphorus concentration the target lake total phosphorus concentrations were derived using the wfd uktag 2016 methodology and was taken to be at the good moderate boundary with this approach the site specific reference concentration is derived using statistical models based on altitude alkalinity and depth from which the boundary values between five quality classes high good moderate poor and bad are calculated the high good and good moderate class boundaries are calculated using the reference concentration and an ecological quality ratio value derived from linear regression based on alkalinity and depth the other class boundaries use fixed intervals from the good moderate concentration there are models for two region and for coloured water lakes in northern ireland and some overriding rules the statistical models were derived by cardoso et al 2007 using results from 567 lakes distributed throughout europe and considered to be at reference condition only slightly impacted the reference annual geometric mean concentration is 13 mg p m 3 if lough neagh is considered a clear water lake and 26 if coloured 2 7 time to reduce the internal phosphorus load to provide additional information on how long it takes the internal load to reduce to a low or natural amount we collated results from the literature from lakes that had their external loads reduced and had been monitored for at least 5 years the following results were collated from tables or digitized from charts τw qs the time period of monitoring after reduction in external load and cext at the start and end of the monitoring from this information an estimate of the time for the internal load to decrease was made errors may have been introduced during digitizing the charts in the valuable compilation of jeppesen et al 2005 no results for cext were directly presented however cext was estimated from the predicted c values in their fig 1 a by applying the lake model in their eq 1 3 results 3 1 steady state of lake phosphorus models as the cstr model used assumes steady state the conditions under which this applies were assessed the t90 times for loss only through the outflow represented by τw of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 yr are 1 15 2 30 and 3 45 yr respectively loss only through sedimentation represented by σ of 0 3 and 1 0 yr 1 are 7 68 and 2 30 yr respectively and the variation of t90 combined for the combined losses is shown in fig 1 for t90 combined to be 1 yr or less τw needs to be less than 0 5 to 0 8 yr for a lake to be at steady state with σ 1 yr 1 this should apply to a relatively large change in cext at the start of a year and it is possible this criterion could be relaxed for smaller changes in cext changes in cext later in the year may only produce steady state the following year this is a simple framework with generic τw and σ values and phosphorus sedimentation in smaller rapidly flushed lakes is best described using the retention coefficient prairie 1989 however it suggests that only relatively rapidly flushed lakes would be at steady state with a changing phosphorus load while there are implications for the estimation of σ in lakes that are not at steady state the effect on the more empirically based rmeas is relevant here in a lake at steady state loss through the outflow and to the sediment are at equilibrium with the input therefore as the retained load is in equilibrium with the input load rmeas is accurate retained load input load in a lake not at steady state if input is increasing then loss through the outflow or to the sediment or both would not be complete and so the retained load would be smaller than that at steady state while rmeas is retained input a smaller retained load should lead to a smaller rmeas further the phosphorus that is in excess of the steady state concentration would be carried over to the following year contributing to a smaller rmeas in that year as well the same outcome a depression in rmeas also applies to a decreasing input load when a lake is not at steady state based on this assessment a lake is not likely to be in steady state if τw 0 5 0 8 yr and this may lead to a decrease in rmeas for one or more years compared to the steady state value 3 2 lough neagh phosphorus budget the lough neagh phosphorus model eq 1 uses annual values for cext τw qs input and output total phosphorus load from which rpred and rmeas are calculated and then net cint 2 and predicted c the variation of τw input load output load and retained load over 1984 2018 is shown in section 3 supplementary materials with changes in the key properties rpred rmeas and cext presented in fig 2 and obs c cext 1 rpred and net cint 2 in fig 3 rpred varied little being influenced only by relatively small changes in qs τw while rmeas was quite variable it tended to be smaller from 2003 onwards with an average of 0 357 0 0298 between 1984 and 1994 0 330 0 0427 between 1995 2002 and 0 191 0 0274 between 2003 and 2018 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials the reasons for this change are investigated in the discussion in relation to the budget described fully in section 3 supplementary materials some features can be noted first the variations in input load are mainly determined by changes in the annual inflow volume second it follows that the input and output loads decrease as τw increases although there is always substantial variability at a given τw value finally even with the variability in input output and retained loads there were three periods during which input load cext obs c rpred rmeas net cint 2 and τw were different but relatively constant 1984 1994 1995 2002 and 2003 2018 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials as the model is predicted c cext 1 rpred net cint 2 eq 1 fig 3 shows how the relative contributions of the net external and net internal loads to the lake water concentration vary both contribute with external load more important up to 1999 generally equal afterwards there were rapid year to year variations in both contributions particularly between 1991 and 1994 1998 2003 and 2014 2017 and especially with internal load the variations in internal load were mainly caused by changes in rmeas fig 2 as net cint 2 cext rpred rmeas with rpred relatively constant and cext intermediate fig 2 the reason for these rapid changes in net cint 2 and rmeas 1991 1994 1998 2003 2014 2017 is likely due to the lake not being at steady state with changing input phosphorus load first the overall average τw is 1 30 yr section 3 supplementary materials larger than the criterion of 0 6 0 8 yr suggested for steady state second a detailed analysis of the changes in rmeas and input phosphorus load section 4 supplementary materials shows that the reductions in rmeas coincide with a rapid change in the input load eight out of ten times during these three periods 3 3 lough neagh phosphorus model and supporting cext the relationship between obs c and predicted c 1984 2018 is shown in fig 4 the correlation coefficient is 0 616 p 0 001 with a mean and median error obs c predicted c of 2 3 and 0 28 mg p m 3 while there is almost no bias over the 30 years of predictions the error is relatively large 20 mg p m 3 in 1992 1994 2000 and 2018 the first three years fall within two of the periods of rapid changes in rmeas and net cint 2 1991 1994 1998 2003 and the fourth is close to the third period 2014 2017 in 2018 the predicted c 92 2 mg p m 3 and cext 1 rpred 48 3 mg p m 3 were the lowest in the monitoring period while obs c was not unusual fig 3 leading to the large error omitting these four years the correlation coefficient becomes 0 860 p 0 001 and the mean and median errors 0 21 and 2 2 mg p m 3 the main evidence available to support this model is another estimate of the internal load the in situ p increase cint 1 method was applied and the value compared to the results from the phosphorus mass balance method net cint 2 fig 3 gibson et al 2001 in a description and analysis of the internal phosphorus load in lough neagh 1974 1997 presented the variation of monthly mean obs c values for 1995 during the summer obs c increased from 70 mg p m 3 in june to 200 in september an increase of 130 mg p m 3 this in situ p increase should lie between the gross and net concentration but if it is taken to be gross then net cint 1 1 rpred gross cint 1 the inflow was missing for one catchment in 1995 so no qs value is available but the mean of 1994 and 1996 was used for rpred 0 604 giving a net cint 1 of 51 5 mg p m 3 a net cint 2 value is missing for 1995 and the values fluctuate between 28 6 1993 83 4 1994 65 9 1996 and 54 8 1997 but the mean 58 2 mg p m 3 is close to the net cint 1 value of 51 5 a 13 difference this relatively small difference allows us to take the cint 1 value in lough neagh to be an estimate of the gross internal load similar analysis of other years would provide additional evidence on the nature of the internal load derived by the in situ p increase method in lough neagh with this support for the phosphorus model for lough neagh it can be used to derive the cext value that supports the geometric mean total phosphorus concentration at the good moderate g m boundary with no or a naturally low net internal phosphorus load lough neagh is on the boundary between a clear water and a coloured lake so the g m boundary could be 24 or 44 mg p m 3 respectively based on eq 1 with net cint 2 of zero and the mean rpred for 2003 2018 of 0 597 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials uncertainty 0 05 the supporting cext concentrations are 60 6 6 11 and 109 0 22 1 20 mg p m 3 a lake at the boundary between two classes always needs further assessment but lough neagh on the boundary between a clear and coloured water lake has a large effect on the targets for the lake and inflow as the value of rpred is central to the model eq 1 we used an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 fig 2 to indicate its influence on the estimates of the net external and net internal loads fig 3 the uncertainties are not large compared to the values of the properties and the magnitude of the changes when the errors are combined in the model as lough neagh has a substantial internal load in its current state the uncertainty is larger fig 4 3 4 the other lakes these 19 lakes do not have phosphorus budgets so the monitoring results were used to describe the long term change in annual obs c and the long term annual cycle of monthly obs c the full results are presented in section 5 supplementary materials with two representative examples shown in figs 5 and 6 for each lake the g m total phosphorous boundary was derived depending on whether it is clear or coloured water and the cext value that supports it was calculated using two models eq 1 with a net cint of zero and an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 and eq 2 there was little change in the annual obs c in stoneyford although a suggestion of an increases from 2017 fig 5 but the long term 2004 2018 average concentration mean of the annual obs c is 85 9 mg p m 3 there is clear evidence of a summer increase in concentration due to an internal load from which a cint 1 value of 95 0 mgp m 3 can be estimated it is a coloured water lake with a g m boundary of 21 mg p m 3 and the supporting cext value is 42 4 3 mg m 3 with eq 1 and 29 mg p m 3 with eq 2 the was no change in the annual obs c in lough ross giving a long term average concentration of 63 6 mg p m 3 and there is no evidence for a summer increase in concentration fig 6 it is a coloured water lake with a g m boundary of 37 mg p m 3 and the supporting cint is 45 2 7 mg m 3 with both eqn 1 and eq 2 unlike stoneyford the two models give identical supporting cext values but this is may be due to the lake s short τw time 0 08 yr compared to 0 44 in stoneyford increasing the predicted c in the khorasani zhu model section 1 supplementary materials and consequently producing a larger cext value table 2 summarize the results for the 19 lakes note two sites are used for lower lough erne eleven lakes have no internal load cint 1 eight have varying from 8 3 mg p m 3 in lough island reavy to 327 5 in portmore but typically 20 60 mg p m 3 the g m boundary concentration varies from 15 mg p m 3 in island reavy to 65 in gullion with a mean of 37 3 mg p m 3 median 36 five lakes have g m values greater than 50 mg p m 3 they are coloured water shallow z 2 4 m lakes with alkalinities greater than 1 2 meq l 1 all of which increase the reference concentration wfd uktag 2016 lough beg is a widening of the lower river bann outlet of lough neagh and is omitted from further analysis there are two other linked lake systems upper lough macnean g m boundary 37 mg p m 3 flows into lower lough macnean g m boundary 53 mg p m 3 and so achieving the quality target in the upper lough should lead to that in the lower lough as well similarly upper lough erne 51 mg p m 3 flows into lower lough erne a and b 36 mg p m 3 but as the lower lake is deeper its g m boundary concentration is lower the cext values that support the g m boundary concentrations in the absence of an internal load vary from 28 2 1 to 80 10 2 mg p m 3 except for clea lakes 148 21 1 gullion 336 93 2 and portmore 134 14 5 they all have boundary values greater than 50 mg p m 3 and higher 0 536 0 807 than the average rpred value 0 494 both of which increase the supporting cext concentration the effect of the uncertainty in the rpred value is relatively small in most of the lakes only over 20 in two gullion 28 rpred 0 807 and island reavy 21 0 748 both have high rpred values which lead to low 1 rpred values where the influence of a fixed uncertainty on the cext is greatest ignoring these two lakes the mean n 17 error is 9 7 median 9 3 minimum 6 0 maximum 14 the only support for the model rpred value in these lakes was the predictions of another model model 28 khorasani and zhu 2021 as it contains some and unknown contributions from internal load the supporting cext values should be lower the difference eq 1 with net cint 2 of zero minus khorasani zhu is over 50 mg p m 3 in three lakes clea lakes 65 gullion 226 portmore 64 which have high g m boundary concentrations omitting these the mean difference n 16 is 12 mg p m 3 median 14 minimum 9 lower lough erne maximum 35 fea there is little basis to determine if these differences are sufficient to support the rpred values but they are not large for most of the lakes 3 5 time to reduce the internal phosphorus load the detailed results collated are provided in section 6 supplementary materials with a summary in table 3 it illustrates the uncertainty of the estimates e g more than 5 8 years over 10 years etc and there was no relationship between the time and either start cext end cext or the change the estimates are relatively imprecise as factors such as how quickly and by how much the external load was reduced the frequency and length of the monitoring length of the initial eutrophication of the lake size of the internal load etc could affect the time and will vary from lake to lake however there is a broad tendency to three values approximately 8 6 to 10 yr 14 yr 12 to 16 or 20 yr fig 7 the average n 21 is 12 2 yr 7 6 yr for those lakes n 11 with time 11 yr and 17 2 for those lakes n 10 with a time 12 yr or more 4 discussion the main aim of the research was to apply and evaluate the framework model and methods of nürnberg in order to derive an inflow phosphorus concentrations that support target lake concentrations using lough neagh and 19 other smaller lake as examples in the evaluation the uncertainties in estimating the lake concentration from the external and internal loads were estimated we also identified the conditions under which a typical cstr model is at steady state and collated results to provide direct evidence of the time it takes for the internal phosphorus load to reduce 4 1 nürnberg s framework model and methods the framework to separate the contributions of the external and internal loads to the lake phosphorus concentration was clear to understand the cstr lake model is well established and the methods used to estimate the internal load were easy to apply generally steady state conditions are assumed but we identified using a generic cstr lake model that it is not likely if τw 0 5 0 8 yr and should lead to a decrease in rmeas for one or more years compared to the steady state value section 3 1 we found this behaviour in lough neagh where there were rapid changes in rmeas during 1991 1994 1998 2003 and 2014 2017 when the lake was not at steady state with a changing input phosphorus load section 3 2 averaging results is recommended when applying these models nürnberg 2009 the value of rpred is key in the lake model eq 1 and so we included a fixed uncertainty fig 2 in estimating the net external and net internal loads fig 3 the uncertainty is small compared to the load values and their variation but a little larger when the external and internal loads are combined in the model fig 4 however as there are also uncertainties in estimating cext and rmeas when calculating the loads its influence may not be the most important we also provided some additional support for the model in lough neagh 4 1 1 and the other lakes 4 1 2 4 1 1 lough neagh the lough neagh phosphorus model reproduced the variation of annual mean obs c over 1984 2018 period well with mean and median errors of 2 3 and 0 28 mg p m 3 respectively section 3 3 while this is not an independent assessment of the model it does provide some evidence that it can be used to derive a cext that supports a target lake concentration there was additional evidence to support the lake model in the agreement between two estimates of the internal load 51 5 and 58 2 mg p m 3 section 3 3 the difference 13 is relatively small and provides support for the lake model foy et al 2003 reconstructed the phosphorus budget for lough neagh 1840 2000 using the diatom and chironomid record in sediment cores and a contemporary budget identified that sediment release began in the 1960s and estimated it to be at least 36 mg p m 3 if this is taken to be net release and that it would increase as eutrophication of the lake developed then this is some further support for the net cint 2 values in fig 3 4 1 2 the other lakes the water column monitoring results were used to establish long term trends and if there was an internal load which was estimated using the in situ p increase method cint 1 cext values that support the target concentrations were able to be derived table 2 the only support for the model in the other lakes was to use another lake model model 28 of khorasani and zhu 2021 to derive supporting cext values these should be lower as that model includes variable contributions from internal load for most of the lakes 16 out of 19 the values were an average of 12 mg p m 3 lower section 3 4 which lends general support to the rpred values used in eq 1 for these lakes 4 2 time to reduce the internal load and reach steady state concentration the model is a steady state one and only indicates the time it would take the lake adjust to it external load based on the hydraulic residence time if there is an internal load which is common in lakes needing remediation the time it takes for it to reduce is also involved based on observational evidence there is a general tendency for it to be either approximately 8 6 to 10 yr 14 yr 12 to 16 or 20 yr fig 7 these values are similar to the one to three decades summarized by rippey et al 2021 from a compilation of evidence from models and observations a better basis to choose a time for internal load reduction in a lake is desirable but in the absence of a direct estimate 8 to 20 yr can be suggested if there is no or little internal load then the time to the new steady state concentration would be determined by τw with t90 2 303τw these two rules were used to select the time to steady state in the 19 lakes table 2 4 2 1 lough neagh the t90 value for the internal phosphorus load to reduce in lough neagh has been estimated by applying the lewis penn model to five sediment cores rippey et al 2021 varying from 15 to 23 yr mean 20 6 as the mean τw is 1 30 yr the time to reach the target lake concentration of 24 or 44 mg p m 3 should be determined mainly by the reduction in internal load so around 21 years fig 8 shows the modelled change in lake phosphorus concentration to reductions in the inflow concentration for three values of net internal load as the current value reduces to a half and one tenth over 21 years as advised nürnberg 2009 average values were used to apply the model eq 1 the 2003 2018 mean rpred is 0 597 net cint 2 63 3 mg p m 3 and cext 159 mg p m 3 table 1 section 3 supplementary materials an uncertainty in rpred of 0 05 was applied the model indicates that the internal load needs to be reduced considerably approaching one tenth of the current value to be able to achieve either g m boundary concentration the main uncertainty is how the internal load reduces as cext obs c or net phosphorus sedimentation decreases as a result of reductions in cext katsev et al 2006 found unstable predictions of the long term efflux of phosphorus from sediment in their diagenetic model when return of phosphorus from the water was included more understanding of this link is desirable but we can note that there is some consistency in the time for the internal load to reduce in the 21 lakes in fig 7 even though there is great variety in their eutrophication history size depth how much and how quickly the external load was reduced etc 4 2 2 other lakes the t90 times for the lakes given in table 2 were selected using the two criteria established in section 4 2 eight of the lakes have internal loads beg cam clea lakes gullion island reavy mourne portmore stoneyford and without direct information on the rate of reduction of internal load in them there is uncertainty in their response time at present this is given as 8 20 years except for lough island reavy that lake has a small internal load of 8 3 mg p m 3 and a long τw value 3 82 yr so the 2 303τw criterion was applied the remaining lakes should respond according to the 2 303τw values 4 3 recovery of lough neagh the modelled recovery of lough neagh fig 8 indicates the response of the lake concentration to reductions in the inflow concentration and net internal load in addition to the uncertainty about how the internal load responds to reduction in inflow lake concentration there are two further considerations for the recovery of the lake change in the lake phosphorus cycle from 2003 and the influence of phosphorus and nitrogen on chlorophyll a 4 3 1 change in the lake phosphorus cycle the reduction in rmeas from 0 330 during 1995 2002 to 0 191 in 2003 2018 section 3 2 represents a considerable change in the lake phosphorus cycle and the evidence suggests that it was a consequence of the earlier depletion of total oxidized nitrogen ton nitrate nitrite in the water column mcelarney et al 2021 once the sequence of mineralization of organic matter in the sediment moved from ton after its depletion in the water column to mn iv then fe iii etc froelich et al 1979 wersin et al 1991 the release of phosphorus sorbed to iron oxyhydroxide from the sediment began earlier there is no direct evidence for this sequence in the lough neagh sediment but there is for other lakes wersin et al 1991 park and jaffe 1999 hemond and lin 2010 smith et al 2011 further movement of highly soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations towards the sediment surface has been observed in lake okeechobee moore et al 1998 and increases of soluble reactive phosphorus concentration along with soluble iron and especially manganese have been observed in the upper sediment layers of lake vallentunasjon lofgren and bostrom 1989 there is however indirect evidence to support this release mechanism in lough neagh first the redox potential at four sediment depths from march to october 1979 shows a sudden decrease in mid july even at 10 mm indicating that release of phosphorus was likely rippey and jewson 1982 gibson et al 2001 measured a release of 80 tonnes p in july 1979 the results for 1983 show similar behaviour with a decrease in july even temporarily at the sediment surface section 9 supplementary materials the release was 140 tonnes p in july 1983 gibson et al 2001 second the seasonal cycle of iron manganese and soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column of lough neagh 1983 section 7 supplementary materials is similar to that described by mayer et al 1982 in the hypolimnion of hypereutrophic lake sebasticook as mineralization proceeds to produce first soluble mn and then fe the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus increases more closely associated with mn than fe the increase of fe in lough neagh is not as great as that observed in sebasticook probably as there is still a thin oxic layer in the sediment compared to full anoxia in the hypolimnion of sebasticook 4 3 2 influence of phosphorus and nitrogen on chlorophyll a whether achieving the target inflow and lake phosphorus concentrations alone will lead to a desired chlorophyll a concentration needs consideration of the relative influence of nitrogen and phosphorus on biological productivity lewis jr et al 2011 schindler et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the chlorophyll concentration has been reducing lough neagh since the mid 1990s as a result of a lower nitrogen input load and lake concentration mcelarney et al 2021 elliott et al 2015 this is a result of catchment based nutrient management measures under the northern ireland nitrates action plan this outlines seasonal and mass controls on fertilisers in addition to restrictions on land types that can receive fertilisers and failure to comply with such measures can result in financial penalties if the trend continues further decreases in chlorophyll would be expected action to reduce nitrogen inputs has been successful whereas it is more difficult to reduce phosphorus inputs from the large catchment and there is also the considerable influence of the internal phosphorus load on the lake concentration whether further action to reduce nitrogen or phosphorus inputs or both depends on the reduction in chlorophyll expected and the relative ease of reducing the inputs a reduction in lake phosphorus concentration is however needed to reduce the internal load some indication of the response of chlorophyll to combinations of lake total phosphorus and ton concentrations can be provided by using chlorophyll nutrient models table 4 as no correction factors are available for the models a typical value of 1 15 was used or the untransformed values could be considered geometric means table 4 was generated using the following values observed 2003 2018 mean total phosphorus concentration of 135 mg p m 3 72 in the absence of an internal load 44 and 24 the target values for a colored and clear water lake observed 2003 2018 mean ton concentration of 294 mg n m 3 and 100 which could be produced if the current reductions continue the observed 2003 2018 mean chlorophyll a concentration is 43 4 mg m 3 model 1 does not reproduce the chlorophyll concentration the other models are better predictors with values of 29 40 mg m 3 compared to the observed 43 4 and model 4 the closest a decrease of chlorophyll to 14 15 and 8 9 mg m 3 as phosphorus is reduced to 44 and 24 mg p m 3 is predicted reducing ton to 100 mg n m 3 is predicted to not affect the chlorophyll at the current total phosphorus concentration and only reduce it a little even if it decreases 18 31 and 15 26 mg m 3 for total phosphorus of 100 and 80 mg p m 3 for all of the nitrogen and phosphorus combinations except total phosphorus of 24 mg p m 3 the n p mass ratio still indicates nitrogen deficiency based on phosphorus deficiency above 23 and nitrogen deficiency below 9 guildford and hecky 2000 even at the lowest phosphorus concentration there is still no phosphorus deficiency with both nutrients influencing the chlorophyll concentration further assessment is required to determine the influence of nitrogen and phosphorus on chlorophyll and other biological properties and the catchment actions needed to reduce the nutrient input loads the predictions of these empirical models are most accurate for lakes with typical relative concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus lough neagh however has an unusual relationship as the 2003 2018 averages 135 mg p m 3 for total phosphorus 294 mg n m 3 for total oxidized nitrogen and 43 4 mg m 3 for chlorophyll a place it well outside the scatter plot of european lakes poikane et al 2022 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15636,manganese mn containing composite metal adsorbents are very effective at removing arsenite as iii from contaminated water however the low removal speed and oxidation efficiency have limited their further application in this study a nonhomogeneous catalytic oxidation adsorption system was constructed by coupling iron manganese composite oxide femnox with sulfite s iv to enhance the recovery of oxidative capacity and accelerate the removal of as iii experimental results showed that the femnox s iv system decreased the as iii concentration from 1079 to 10 µg l within 10 min and almost completely oxidized as iii to as v in contrast femnox alone removed only 82 4 of as iii within 30 min and 60 0 of the adsorbed as iii was not oxidized meanwhile the adsorption capacity of femnox s iv system for as iii was considerably higher than that of the only femnox system 76 5 46 3 mg g the efficient and fast as iii removal was attributed to the so5 radical generated by s iv acting as the driving force for the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv several environmental factors e g solution ph and inorganic anions and the reusability and practicality of femnox were systematically investigated and the results further confirmed the superiority of the femnox s iv system in as iii removal in particular the proposed femnox nanocellulose aerogel effectively purified arsenic contaminated groundwater using a fixed bed column thus femnox s iv coupling is very promising for the purification of arsenic contaminated water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenite iron manganese composite oxide sulfite oxidation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction adsorption is considered a promising method for arsenic as removal because of its easy operation and low cost siddiqui et al 2019 various nanometallic adsorbents e g α fooh nzvi and γal2o3 have been developed for removing as from contaminated water patra et al 2012 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2020 however compared with the negatively charged arsenate as v the nonionic arsenite as iii often has a lower affinity toward nanometallic adsorbents and is not easily adsorbed wen et al 2020 in addition compared with as v as iii has order of magnitude higher mobility and toxicity bahrami et al 2020 therefore the oxidation of as iii to as v prior to adsorption is critical for improving the sorbent removal efficiency and reducing the toxicity however the currently available numerous as iii oxidation methods e g methods involving chloramine ozone permanganate uv h2o2 and fenton reaction are limited owing to drawbacks such as the generation of toxic byproducts high removal costs and the need for special reaction devices jiang et al 2020 sharma and sohn 2009 wei et al 2019a composite nanometallic adsorbents that have both oxidation and adsorption capabilities have attracted attention owing to their applicability for oxidizing as iii in particular iron manganese femn type adsorbents have been developed that take advantage of the low cost easy preparation and high adsorption capacity of fe based materials ke et al 2021 luo et al 2021 siddiqui et al 2019 this composite adsorbent not only maintains the advantages of the parent nanometal oxide but also the synergistic effect of the adsorption process facilitates the removal of as iii zheng et al 2020 however the adsorbents obtained by compounding mn oxides with other materials exhibit some defects regarding the oxidative removal of as iii that need to be addressed the problem is that the method of directly imparting the oxidative function of the adsorbent by adding mn is essentially oxidizing first and then adsorbing zhang et al 2012 2007b 2018b therefore the removal rate of this as iii is usually relatively slow and it is difficult to achieve the rapid removal of arsenic pollutants from water furthermore because the main reaction step limiting the rapid removal of as iii is redox higher mn content may enhance the removal kinetics however excess mn in the same mass of adsorbent may considerably decrease the total amount of as removed because of the poor adsorption capacity of mn oxides for as iii meanwhile mn oxides mno2 are prone to release mn ii ions during the oxidation of as iii and cause their own reductive dissolution which will gradually diminish the oxidation capacity of the original adsorbent fang et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge most of the previous studies on as removal using mn containing composite adsorbents have focused on improving the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cui et al 2014 shan and tong 2013 yan et al 2020 while few have focused on improving the oxidation performance of the adsorbent thus how to improve the oxidation capacity and stability of mn in the composite adsorbent to enhance the as iii removal performance requires further exploration zhang et al 2018a reported adding sulfite s iv to a fe ii mn ii ionic mixture and its activation via fe ii the so5 radicals generated in the solution effectively oxidized mn ii to intermediate mn iii in situ and they were able to achieve the rapid degradation of atrazine atz s iv is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly food additive whose final product of so4 2 does not cause secondary contamination liu et al 2017 meanwhile s iv can be rapidly activated by various transition metals e g fe co and cu to generate oxygen sulfur radicals sox of which the representative product so4 has an oxidation capacity as high as that of oh ding et al 2021a zou et al 2019 thus we speculate that s iv can be uesd to address the challenges faced by mn containing composite adsorbents for as iii removal this is because the production rate of the highly oxidative intermediate mn iii is considered the main reason limiting the rapid oxidation and as iii removal by mn containing composite adsorbents which is similar to the rate limiting step of organic pollutant degradation wu et al 2021 simultaneously the conversion of mn ii into intermediate mn iii plays a crucial role in constructing the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv and maintaining the cycle stability the addition of s iv not only enhances the reactivity of mn oxides to improve the oxidative removal kinetics of as iii but the generated so4 may also an effective oxide species for as iii ding et al 2021b huang et al 2018 inspired by the abovementioned research we hypothesized that the constructed nonhomogeneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption system of iron manganese composite oxide femnox coupled with s iv would exhibit a higher as iii oxidation capacity and faster as iii removal than the conventional femn type adsorbents in this study our main objectives were i to verify the capability of the femnox s iv system for a rapid oxidative adsorption of as iii ii to evaluate the potential of the femnox s iv system for future applications by investigating different reaction conditions reusability and actual water treatment capacity iii to explore possible as iii oxidation and adsorption mechanisms as well as determine the activation pathways of s iv and iv to broaden the scope of the femnox s iv systems in water treatment applications by loading femnox on nanocellulose to form aerogels in conclusion the study may contribute to the development of novel as removal processes for water bodies based on mn containing composite adsorbents 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of femnox femnox nano adsorbents were synthesized using a simple one step coprecipitation method briefly 0 03 mol of feso4 7h2o and 0 0075 mol of kmno4 were dissolved separately in 100 ml of deionized di water then the kmno4 solution was transferred to an oil bath and heated to 100 c under strong magnetic stirring the feso4 solution was dropped into the kmno4 solution at a rate of one drop every 2 s finally 17 ml of a 5 m naoh solution was dropped into the boiling mixture and the reaction was continued at 100 c for 1 h after the mixed solution was cooled to room temperature the precipitate was collected and washed with di water several times subsequently the solid precipitate was placed in a drying oven at 80 c and was dried for 12 h to obtain the final product 2 2 synthesis of femnox nanocellulose aerogel briefly 3 g cellulose 6 g urea 3 5 g naoh and 37 5 g di water were mixed and stirred for 5 min the mixture was then frozen at about 20 c for 1 h to dissolve the nanocellulose subsequently 2 g femnox nanoparticles was added to the nanocellulose solution and was dispersed by ultrasonication for 20 min the mixture was then stirred for 1 h after that 5 ml of an epichlorohydrin crosslinking agent was added and stirred for 30 min which was then poured into a cylindrical mold for rapid molding at 60 c the forming gel was taken out and placed into di water to soak for 24 h the di water was replaced several times during this period finally the colloid was placed in a vacuum freeze dryer at 50 c and was freeze dried for 24 h to obtain the final material femnox nanocellulose aerogel femnox nca the details regarding chemicals as iii removal experimental procedures and analytical characterization methods used in this study are provided in the supplementary information file 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of femnox the sem image fig 1 a indicated that femnox consists of sea urchin like particles with a size of about 500 nm with numerous nanorods growing radially from the core to the particle surface edx analysis fig 1b showed that femnox mainly comprised fe mn and o the fe mn atomic ratio was about 4 1 which matched the initial dose ratio the corresponding element mapping chart of femnox showed that mn fe and o were uniformly distributed in the material which was beneficial for the synergy between the components and improved the adsorption performance fig s1 the xrd pattern fig 1c revealed several clear diffraction peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase of α feooh jcpds 029 0713 thus the main component of femnox might be α feooh the n2 adsorption desorption curve and pore size distribution diagram of the femnox adsorbent fig 1d exhibited a type iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop which is a characteristic distribution of slit shaped mesopores sing 1985 the average pore size of bjh bjh pore volume and bet surface area of the femnox material were 6 67 nm 0 37 cm3 g and 244 3 m2 g respectively table s2 which indicates that a greater specific surface area may mean more adsorption sites the ph value of the femnox adsorbent at the point of zero charge was around 7 4 fig s2 3 2 kinetics and isotherms the kinetic curves for the removal of as iii by femnox at different s iv concentrations are illustrated in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of as iii was only 82 4 after 30 min with the femnox adsorbent alone in contrast adding 150 µm s iv increased the as iii removal efficiency to 99 4 after only 10 min and the residual as concentration was less than 10 µg l to verify the promoting effect of s iv we delayed the s iv addition time fig 2b shows that the residual as t concentration in the water sample decreased rapidly to 10 µg l within 6 min of s iv addition after the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min these results indicate that the addition of s iv does improve the as iii removal efficiency of femnox this enhanced removal performance may be attributed to the increased conversion of as iii to as v we fitted the kinetic data of as iii and as v adsorption to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 2c and table s3 the regression coefficients r2 of the two kinetic models show that the as adsorption process on the femnox adsorbent was more consistent with the pseudo second order kinetic model which indicates that the adsorption of as iii v may be chemisorption i e there is electron transfer between the adsorbent and the adsorbate shan and tong 2013 moreover the adsorption rate constant k 2 of the femnox s iv system for as iii v was much higher than that without s iv addition 0 38 vs 0 13 g mg min 0 66 vs 0 04 g mg min the k 2 value for as v adsorption by femnox alone was much smaller than that for as iii adsorption by femnox alone 0 13 vs 0 04 g mg min thus the femnox s iv system is more advantageous than the femnox adsorbent alone in the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of as iii in particular the addition of s iv also significantly enhanced the removal of as v by femnox the diffuse reflectance uv vis spectrum of s iv coupled femnox showed a significant redshift compared with femnox alone fig s3 which indicates that the surface properties were changed this change may have eventually exposed more new adsorption sites on the material surface which enhanced the as iii v adsorption wei et al 2019a to better evaluate the performance of femnox adsorbents for the removal of as iii and as v the experimental adsorption data were fitted to the nonlinear langmuir and freundlich isothermal models fig 2d the adsorption constants are presented in table s4 the regression coefficients showed that the freundlich model fitted the experimental data better this suggests that the adsorption was irreversible at the nonhomogeneous adsorption sites because the langmuir model assumes that adsorption reactions occur on the surface of homogeneous adsorbent materials while the freundlich model assumes that adsorption reactions occur on nonhomogeneous multimolecular layers with different adsorption capacities cai et al 2022 the maximum adsorption capacity of as v and as iii by the femnox s iv system 91 3 and 76 5 mg g respectively was greater than the maximum adsorptions of as v and as iii by femnox alone 32 6 and 46 3 mg g respectively therefore compared with the conventional femn type adsorbents shan and tong 2013 zhang et al 2009 2007b the addition of s iv may generate some reactive radicals that affect the ability of the adsorbent to remove as iii v and the surface properties which is consistent with the kinetic results compared with previously reported metal composite oxide adsorbents table s5 the femnox s iv system had a significantly better maximum as iii adsorption capacity and removal speed 3 3 effect of solution chemistry the effects of different ph values on as iii removal by the femnox s iv system are shown in fig 3 a in general the distribution of s iv species is ph dependent therefore the major s iv species under acidic conditions hso3 gradually changes to so3 2 as the ph of the solution increases ding et al 2019 compared with hso3 so3 2 has a lower redox potential e so3 so3 2 0 63 v vs e so3 hso3 0 84 v neta and huie 1985 and higher reaction rate constant for so5 production k so5 hso3 7 5 104 m 1 s 1 vs k so5 so3 2 9 0 106 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2019 thus when the ph was increased from 3 to 7 the redox reaction between s iv and femnox was promoted to generate more active species which enhanced the as iii removal efficiency on the other hand at higher ph conditions when fe as o underwent bonding protons initially bound to o on the femnox surface were released in other words deprotonation also enhanced the as iii adsorption wei et al 2019b this is because the major form of as iii under acidic conditions is h3aso3 and thus as iii was mainly removed via surface complexation mechanisms rather than simple electrostatic interactions however when the ph of the solution was increased from 7 to 11 as iii and oxidation formed as v existed mainly as anions h2aso3 and haso4 2 respectively while the zero charge point of femnox was at 7 4 as a result an electrostatic repulsive force was generated between the negatively charged femnox and as iii v which inhibited the as iii removal in addition except for the obvious leaching of mn ions at the initial ph 3 the leaching values of fe and mn ions in femnox at other initial ph conditions were almost all far below the maximum contaminant level fig s4 the lower ph value is unfavorable for the removal of as iii and may affect the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent thus in the process of removing as iii we set the optimum ph of femnox s iv system as 7 in general the adsorbent was highly sensitive to changes in the ionic strength of the solution this is because the increase in ionic strength affects adsorbents with an outer sphere complexation removal mechanism while adsorbents with complexation through the inner sphere are not inhibited by competition from weak anions for adsorption sites on their surfaces hu et al 2022 thus fig 3b demonstrates that as iii and its oxidized as v ions follow the chemisorption mechanism of the inner sphere complex on the femnox surface oxidation followed by adsorption adsorption only on the other hand adsorbents are often susceptible to the influence of some anions e g so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 and hpo4 2 and natural organic matter in natural water bodies during practical use therefore we performed batch experiments for as iii removal by the femnox s iv system under different anionic conditions as shown in fig 3c and 3d sio3 2 and hpo4 2 significantly inhibited as iii removal due to having similar chemical structures as that of as iii but the other anions and ha had almost no effect on the as iii removal 3 4 application of femnox s iv for as iii removal 3 4 1 practicality and reusability of femnox because natural water bodies have a more complex composition than di water we experimentally investigated the as iii removal by the femnox s iv system from different natural water bodies as shown in fig 4 a the femnox s iv system effectively and rapidly removed as from contaminated natural water bodies within 20 min and the residual as concentrations were all below the maximum contamination level mcl 10 µg l this indicates that the femnox s iv system has great potential for the treatment of natural as contaminated waters to verify that the femnox adsorbent can be regenerated after use five adsorption desorption cycles were performed using a naoh solution as shown in fig 4b the regenerated femnox retained good as iii removal capacity in the femnox s iv system the femnox adsorption efficiency only decreased by about 2 0 after the five cycles compared with the initial femnox furthermore the elution efficiency of femnox during regeneration only decreased from the initial 97 2 to 90 8 fig s5 thus the good regeneration capacity and high elution efficiency further demonstrate the potential of the femnox s iv system for as iii removal in actual water bodies 3 4 2 column tests femnox nanoparticles are difficult to separate from water after adsorption and prone to cause a large pressure drop when applied directly to fixed beds thus to broaden the scope of the femnox s iv system for engineering applications we loaded femnox on nanocellulose via a freeze drying technique to form femnox nca as shown in fig 5 femnox nca had a 3d network skeleton and a porous laminar stacking structure this effectively provided more loading area for femnox nanoparticles and a channel for rapid penetration of as ions inside the adsorbent zhang et al 2019 the fixed bed column test was used to evaluate the as iii and as v removal capacities of femnox nca note that neither the nanocellulose aerogel alone nor the nanocellulose aerogel with s iv had the ability to remove as iii and as ⅴ fig s6 fig 6 shows that the femnox nca s iv system treated about 2387 column volumes 124 l of as contaminated groundwater before the effluent as concentration exceeded the mcl the morphology of femnox nca remained intact without material fragmentation during continuous experiments lasting more than 30 days meanwhile the concentrations of fe and mn ions in the effluent did not exceed chinese national drinking water standards fig s7 these results indicate that the femnox nca s iv system is a feasible solution for as removal from contaminated water 3 5 mechanism study 3 5 1 as adsorption mechanism the ftir spectra fig s8 exhibited the information regarding the surface of the adsorbent before and after the reaction of the femnox s iv system with as iii v the absorption peaks at 3430 and 1633 cm 1 were attributed to the hydroxyl stretching vibrations of the crystalline water and adsorbed water in femnox respectively chen et al 2020 some researchers li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b have already reported that the peaks of metal hydroxyl groups m oh on the surface of fe mn composite oxide materials gradually decrease or even disappear after as adsorption therefore we observed that the hydroxyl group peak at 1050 cm 1 disappeared after the reactions of femnox with as iii v meanwhile the stretching vibration peaks of as v o fe or as v oh appeared at 820 cm 1 qiu et al 2020 the above results indicate that as iii was oxidized to as v when it was adsorbed by femnox the hydroxyl groups on the femnox surface were involved in the adsorptions of as iii v xps was used to determine the change in the elemental state on the surface of the femnox material after the adsorption of as iii v as illustrated in fig 7 a the as 3d spectrum deconvoluted into two overlapping peaks located at 45 3 and 44 1 ev which were attributed to as v and as iii respectively cai et al 2019 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in table s6 the femnox s iv system converted 89 8 of the adsorbed as iii to as v which was a much higher rate than the 40 0 converted by femnox alone the failure to achieve 100 conversion of as iii may be related to the adsorption speed of as iii is greater than its oxidation speed at the initial stage of the reaction cai et al 2022 the abovementioned results confirm the theory that the addition of s iv facilitates the oxidation of as iii by femnox generally the lattice oxygen o2 and surface metal hydroxyl groups m oh of metal oxide adsorbents play a key role in the adsorption of inorganic as li et al 2010 thus we deconvoluted the o 1s spectrum fig 7b into three overlapping peaks at 531 9 530 9 and 529 7 ev which were assigned to adsorbed water h2o hydroxyl oh and lattice oxygen o2 respectively wu et al 2021 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in table s7 the oh o2 ratio decreased from 1 57 to 0 96 and 1 18 after the adsorptions of as iii and as v respectively using femnox alone these results indicate that the femnox adsorbent adsorbed as mainly through the mechanism of bidentate complexes because previous studies have shown that the number of surface hydroxyl groups of as should increase when it forms monodentate complexes on a metal surface cheng et al 2009 manning and goldberg 1997 meanwhile the inner sphere as complexes formed in this bidentate manner have a more stable coordination structure arai et al 2001 in contrast the femnox s iv system exhibited the largest decrease in the oh o2 ratio 0 85 after as iii adsorption this indicates that the involvement of s iv significantly promoted the formation of more bidentate complexes between femnox and as iii obviously this phenomenon is what we expect the xps spectra of mn 2p and fe 2p are illustrated in fig 7c and 7d respectively the mn 2p spectra were deconvoluted into three overlapping peaks with binding energies at 642 9 641 9 and 640 8 ev which were assigned to mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively he et al 2019 similarly the fe 2p spectra were deconvoluted into two overlapping peaks with binding energies at 711 7 and 710 4 ev which were assigned to fe iii and fe ii respectively jin et al 2017 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in tables s8 and s9 respectively the distribution ratios of mn phases in the original femnox were 58 6 mn iv 26 4 mn iii and 15 0 mn ii and the distribution ratios of each phase changed only slightly after the reaction with as v however the distribution ratio of each phase changed significantly after the reaction with as iii especially when s iv was present in the reaction system the stoichiometric ratios of mn iv decreased from 58 6 to 29 7 and 25 1 with femnox alone and with the femnox s iv system respectively while those of mn ii increased from 15 0 to 40 5 and 20 1 respectively these results show that a redox reaction occurred between as iii and mn ii iii iv the largest decrease in the stoichiometric ratio of mn iv and largest increase in the intermediate mn iii 26 4 to 54 8 were observed when s iv was added which suggests that s iv may have introduced some intermediate active substance to accelerate the rate of redox cycling among mn ii iii iv and thus enhanced the as iii removal efficiency ke et al 2021 the intermediate mn iii may play a crucial role in the oxidation of as iii by contrast the fe component showed no substantial changes in the distribution ratio of each phase after the adsorption of as iii v by femnox except that the stoichiometric ratio of fe ii in the presence of s iv decreased from an initial value of 30 9 to 28 9 thus we deduced that the fe component in femnox may be only a trapping agent for as and an activator for s iv but not an oxidizer this is because fe ii has been shown to have a better catalytic ability than mn elements to activate s iv and generate the so5 active species guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a this may explain the enhanced redox cycling rate between mn ii iii iv 3 5 2 as iii oxidation mechanism to determine the mechanism of as iii oxidation by the femnox s iv system the change in valence of as iii during the reaction was studied fig 8 a when as v appeared in the solution the as iii concentration decreased rapidly and peaked within 2 min higher than the as iii concentration 124 81 µg l in addition as iii in solution was almost completely oxidized to as v within 4 min conversely in the absence of s iv femnox alone failed to achieve complete oxidation of as iii even within 30 min fig s9 these results suggest that the addition of s iv enhanced the conversion of as iii into as v and the adsorption speed of as iii was greater than its oxidation speed at the initial stage of the reaction several previous studies have demonstrated that when s iv is activated by transition metals some reactive intermediates may be produced in the system that accelerate the pollutant removal efficiency of the system ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a therefore we used dmpo as a free radical trapping agent to identify potentially active species by epr fig 8b clearly shows that the addition of s iv introduced so3 active species into the system without the addition of s iv we detected oh radicals in the pure femnox system which may be the radicals adsorbed on the femnox surface radicals adsorbed on transition metal surfaces are difficult to scavenge by quenchers tba and meoh fang et al 2020 lei et al 2015 thus different types of quenchers were added to the femnox s iv system before the epr experiments as shown in fig 8d we still observed the typical dmpo oh quadruple characteristic epr bop signal peak the results show that so3 and surface oh existing in the femnox s iv system may be important players in the oxidation of as iii to further determine and observe the contribution of radicals to as iii removal the initial as iii concentration was set as 10 mg l and different quenchers were added because surface oh was present in the reaction system in the presence or absence of s iv its effect on as iii oxidation was not considered methanol meoh was used as a quencher for so4 and oh because so3 can be further converted into so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen through a chain reaction ding et al 2019 tian et al 2022 simultaneously so4 can form oh by reacting with h2o oh liu et al 2017 tert butanol tba and formic acid fa were used as quenchers for oh as shown in fig 8c the addition of a quencher affected the as iii removal efficiency of the femnox s iv system however the removal efficiency of the system with the addition of a quencher was still better than that of the system without s iv this could be explained by the fact that the presence of so3 active species in femnox s iv as iii system could still be detected by epr fig 8b because the dmpo so3 signal peak of femnox s iv as iii system might not be detected by epr if the active radical was the main oxidizing species of as iii zhang et al 2018b furthermore the low concentration of the as iii solution 1109 µg l was almost unaffected by the quenching agents tba and meoh during the removal process fig s10 these results indicated that oh and so4 radicals were involved in the oxidation of as iii but were not the main oxidizing species in the reaction system at low as iii concentrations conventional femn type adsorbents are known to mainly convert as iii to as v through the redox between as iii and mn oxides mno2 zhang et al 2007b on the other hand except for the so5 radical the contributions of so4 and oh as the main oxide species in the femnox s iv system have been excluded meanwhile previous studies have reported that the so5 radicals generated by the activation of s iv can oxidize mn ii to the intermediate mn iii and it can act as a selective oxidant for target pollutants zhang et al 2018a thus we speculate that so5 and mn components in the femnox s iv system especially the intermediate mn iii are important players in as iii oxidation to test this hypothesis we added a pyrophosphate pp indicator to the reaction system as shown in fig 9 a the femnox s iv pp reacted solution showed a characteristic peak of mn iii pp complex at λ 259 nm sun et al 2019 in addition femnox s iv as iii pp produced stronger signal peaks than the system without s iv these results indicate that the addition of s iv enhanced the formation of the intermediate mn iii which may be the main reason for the rapid oxidation and removal of as iii to further verify this conclusion different pp concentrations were added to the femnox s iv system for as iii removal as shown in fig 9b the results were consistent with expectations and the as iii removal efficiency was almost completely suppressed as the pp concentration was increased notably pp did not inhibit the formation of mn iii fig 9a combined with the xps analysis of mn 2p presented in section 3 5 1 the abovementioned results indicate that the production and stabilization of the intermediate mn iii in the femnox s iv system were the main reasons for the rapid oxidation of as iii in other words the mn component is the main oxidizing species of as iii 3 5 3 pathway of s iv activation based on the abovementioned analysis we concluded that the activation pathway of s iv in the femnox s iv system may involve three redox cycle pairs i fe ii and fe iii ii oxygen sulfur radicals and iii mn iv mn iii and mn ii as shown in fig 10 fe ii in femnox activates s iv via reactions 1 4 to produce so3 guo et al 2013 so3 easily oxidizes to so5 so4 and oh through a chain reaction in the presence of o2 via reactions 5 8 guo et al 2013 the oh so4 and surface oh may oxidize part of as iii to as v meanwhile mn oxides alone may oxidize as iii to as v via reactions 9 11 zhang et al 2007a which is the main as iii oxidation step in the femnox s iv system at the same time the reductively dissolved mn ii ions may be transferred onto the femnox surface again to be oxidized to mn iv or mn iii by fresh so5 radicals through reactions 12 14 barnese et al 2008 berglund et al 1993 this is the driving force behind the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv owing to the enhanced stability of the intermediate mn iii not only the cyclic reaction rate between oxygen sulfur radicals is improved but also the redox cycle of mn ii iii iv is accelerated in addition the femnox s iv system showed poor as iii removal performance under anaerobic conditions suggesting that o2 may play a crucial role in the s iv activation pathway fig s11 in conclusion the ability of the femnox s iv system to rapidly remove as iii can be attributed to the multi pathway oxidation and chemisorption of as iii caused by certain synergistic interactions within the system 1 so3 2 h hso3 2 fe2 hso3 fehso3 3 4fehso3 o2 feso3 h 4 feso3 fe2 so3 5 o2 so3 so5 6 hso3 so5 h so4 2 so4 7 so4 hso3 so3 so4 2 h 8 so4 ho h2o oh so4 2 h 9 h3aso3 2mno2

system was successfully constructed for the rapid removal and efficient oxidation of as iii in water the experimental results showed that the reactive radicals so5 so4 and oh generated by the activation of s iv by fe ii in femnox are involved in the oxidation of as iii but are not the main oxidants the intermediate mn iii from the oxidation of mn ii by the so5 radicals drives the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv which is the main oxidation pathway of as iii the fe component of femnox efficiently captures as iii and oxidation generated as v in the form of a bidentate complex the femnox s iv system possesses a higher as iii oxidation efficiency and adsorption capacity 76 5 46 3 mg g than femnox alone furthermore the femnox s iv system not only possesses the ability to work in different aqueous matrices but also exhibits satisfactory regeneration performance in particular the femnox nca synthesized via the freezing technique endows femnox nanoparticles with the ability to separate from water and the femnox nca s iv system can effectively treat as contaminated groundwater rapidly in a fixed bed column therefore the femnox s iv or femnox nca s iv system in

15636,manganese mn containing composite metal adsorbents are very effective at removing arsenite as iii from contaminated water however the low removal speed and oxidation efficiency have limited their further application in this study a nonhomogeneous catalytic oxidation adsorption system was constructed by coupling iron manganese composite oxide femnox with sulfite s iv to enhance the recovery of oxidative capacity and accelerate the removal of as iii experimental results showed that the femnox s iv system decreased the as iii concentration from 1079 to 10 µg l within 10 min and almost completely oxidized as iii to as v in contrast femnox alone removed only 82 4 of as iii within 30 min and 60 0 of the adsorbed as iii was not oxidized meanwhile the adsorption capacity of femnox s iv system for as iii was considerably higher than that of the only femnox system 76 5 46 3 mg g the efficient and fast as iii removal was attributed to the so5 radical generated by s iv acting as the driving force for the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv several environmental factors e g solution ph and inorganic anions and the reusability and practicality of femnox were systematically investigated and the results further confirmed the superiority of the femnox s iv system in as iii removal in particular the proposed femnox nanocellulose aerogel effectively purified arsenic contaminated groundwater using a fixed bed column thus femnox s iv coupling is very promising for the purification of arsenic contaminated water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenite iron manganese composite oxide sulfite oxidation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction adsorption is considered a promising method for arsenic as removal because of its easy operation and low cost siddiqui et al 2019 various nanometallic adsorbents e g α fooh nzvi and γal2o3 have been developed for removing as from contaminated water patra et al 2012 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2020 however compared with the negatively charged arsenate as v the nonionic arsenite as iii often has a lower affinity toward nanometallic adsorbents and is not easily adsorbed wen et al 2020 in addition compared with as v as iii has order of magnitude higher mobility and toxicity bahrami et al 2020 therefore the oxidation of as iii to as v prior to adsorption is critical for improving the sorbent removal efficiency and reducing the toxicity however the currently available numerous as iii oxidation methods e g methods involving chloramine ozone permanganate uv h2o2 and fenton reaction are limited owing to drawbacks such as the generation of toxic byproducts high removal costs and the need for special reaction devices jiang et al 2020 sharma and sohn 2009 wei et al 2019a composite nanometallic adsorbents that have both oxidation and adsorption capabilities have attracted attention owing to their applicability for oxidizing as iii in particular iron manganese femn type adsorbents have been developed that take advantage of the low cost easy preparation and high adsorption capacity of fe based materials ke et al 2021 luo et al 2021 siddiqui et al 2019 this composite adsorbent not only maintains the advantages of the parent nanometal oxide but also the synergistic effect of the adsorption process facilitates the removal of as iii zheng et al 2020 however the adsorbents obtained by compounding mn oxides with other materials exhibit some defects regarding the oxidative removal of as iii that need to be addressed the problem is that the method of directly imparting the oxidative function of the adsorbent by adding mn is essentially oxidizing first and then adsorbing zhang et al 2012 2007b 2018b therefore the removal rate of this as iii is usually relatively slow and it is difficult to achieve the rapid removal of arsenic pollutants from water furthermore because the main reaction step limiting the rapid removal of as iii is redox higher mn content may enhance the removal kinetics however excess mn in the same mass of adsorbent may considerably decrease the total amount of as removed because of the poor adsorption capacity of mn oxides for as iii meanwhile mn oxides mno2 are prone to release mn ii ions during the oxidation of as iii and cause their own reductive dissolution which will gradually diminish the oxidation capacity of the original adsorbent fang et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge most of the previous studies on as removal using mn containing composite adsorbents have focused on improving the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cui et al 2014 shan and tong 2013 yan et al 2020 while few have focused on improving the oxidation performance of the adsorbent thus how to improve the oxidation capacity and stability of mn in the composite adsorbent to enhance the as iii removal performance requires further exploration zhang et al 2018a reported adding sulfite s iv to a fe ii mn ii ionic mixture and its activation via fe ii the so5 radicals generated in the solution effectively oxidized mn ii to intermediate mn iii in situ and they were able to achieve the rapid degradation of atrazine atz s iv is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly food additive whose final product of so4 2 does not cause secondary contamination liu et al 2017 meanwhile s iv can be rapidly activated by various transition metals e g fe co and cu to generate oxygen sulfur radicals sox of which the representative product so4 has an oxidation capacity as high as that of oh ding et al 2021a zou et al 2019 thus we speculate that s iv can be uesd to address the challenges faced by mn containing composite adsorbents for as iii removal this is because the production rate of the highly oxidative intermediate mn iii is considered the main reason limiting the rapid oxidation and as iii removal by mn containing composite adsorbents which is similar to the rate limiting step of organic pollutant degradation wu et al 2021 simultaneously the conversion of mn ii into intermediate mn iii plays a crucial role in constructing the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv and maintaining the cycle stability the addition of s iv not only enhances the reactivity of mn oxides to improve the oxidative removal kinetics of as iii but the generated so4 may also an effective oxide species for as iii ding et al 2021b huang et al 2018 inspired by the abovementioned research we hypothesized that the constructed nonhomogeneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption system of iron manganese composite oxide femnox coupled with s iv would exhibit a higher as iii oxidation capacity and faster as iii removal than the conventional femn type adsorbents in this study our main objectives were i to verify the capability of the femnox s iv system for a rapid oxidative adsorption of as iii ii to evaluate the potential of the femnox s iv system for future applications by investigating different reaction conditions reusability and actual water treatment capacity iii to explore possible as iii oxidation and adsorption mechanisms as well as determine the activation pathways of s iv and iv to broaden the scope of the femnox s iv systems in water treatment applications by loading femnox on nanocellulose to form aerogels in conclusion the study may contribute to the development of novel as removal processes for water bodies based on mn containing composite adsorbents 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of femnox femnox nano adsorbents were synthesized using a simple one step coprecipitation method briefly 0 03 mol of feso4 7h2o and 0 0075 mol of kmno4 were dissolved separately in 100 ml of deionized di water then the kmno4 solution was transferred to an oil bath and heated to 100 c under strong magnetic stirring the feso4 solution was dropped into the kmno4 solution at a rate of one drop every 2 s finally 17 ml of a 5 m naoh solution was dropped into the boiling mixture and the reaction was continued at 100 c for 1 h after the mixed solution was cooled to room temperature the precipitate was collected and washed with di water several times subsequently the solid precipitate was placed in a drying oven at 80 c and was dried for 12 h to obtain the final product 2 2 synthesis of femnox nanocellulose aerogel briefly 3 g cellulose 6 g urea 3 5 g naoh and 37 5 g di water were mixed and stirred for 5 min the mixture was then frozen at about 20 c for 1 h to dissolve the nanocellulose subsequently 2 g femnox nanoparticles was added to the nanocellulose solution and was dispersed by ultrasonication for 20 min the mixture was then stirred for 1 h after that 5 ml of an epichlorohydrin crosslinking agent was added and stirred for 30 min which was then poured into a cylindrical mold for rapid molding at 60 c the forming gel was taken out and placed into di water to soak for 24 h the di water was replaced several times during this period finally the colloid was placed in a vacuum freeze dryer at 50 c and was freeze dried for 24 h to obtain the final material femnox nanocellulose aerogel femnox nca the details regarding chemicals as iii removal experimental procedures and analytical characterization methods used in this study are provided in the supplementary information file 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of femnox the sem image fig 1 a indicated that femnox consists of sea urchin like particles with a size of about 500 nm with numerous nanorods growing radially from the core to the particle surface edx analysis fig 1b showed that femnox mainly comprised fe mn and o the fe mn atomic ratio was about 4 1 which matched the initial dose ratio the corresponding element mapping chart of femnox showed that mn fe and o were uniformly distributed in the material which was beneficial for the synergy between the components and improved the adsorption performance fig s1 the xrd pattern fig 1c revealed several clear diffraction peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase of α feooh jcpds 029 0713 thus the main component of femnox might be α feooh the n2 adsorption desorption curve and pore size distribution diagram of the femnox adsorbent fig 1d exhibited a type iv isotherm with an h3 hysteresis loop which is a characteristic distribution of slit shaped mesopores sing 1985 the average pore size of bjh bjh pore volume and bet surface area of the femnox material were 6 67 nm 0 37 cm3 g and 244 3 m2 g respectively table s2 which indicates that a greater specific surface area may mean more adsorption sites the ph value of the femnox adsorbent at the point of zero charge was around 7 4 fig s2 3 2 kinetics and isotherms the kinetic curves for the removal of as iii by femnox at different s iv concentrations are illustrated in fig 2 a the removal efficiency of as iii was only 82 4 after 30 min with the femnox adsorbent alone in contrast adding 150 µm s iv increased the as iii removal efficiency to 99 4 after only 10 min and the residual as concentration was less than 10 µg l to verify the promoting effect of s iv we delayed the s iv addition time fig 2b shows that the residual as t concentration in the water sample decreased rapidly to 10 µg l within 6 min of s iv addition after the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min these results indicate that the addition of s iv does improve the as iii removal efficiency of femnox this enhanced removal performance may be attributed to the increased conversion of as iii to as v we fitted the kinetic data of as iii and as v adsorption to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 2c and table s3 the regression coefficients r2 of the two kinetic models show that the as adsorption process on the femnox adsorbent was more consistent with the pseudo second order kinetic model which indicates that the adsorption of as iii v may be chemisorption i e there is electron transfer between the adsorbent and the adsorbate shan and tong 2013 moreover the adsorption rate constant k 2 of the femnox s iv system for as iii v was much higher than that without s iv addition 0 38 vs 0 13 g mg min 0 66 vs 0 04 g mg min the k 2 value for as v adsorption by femnox alone was much smaller than that for as iii adsorption by femnox alone 0 13 vs 0 04 g mg min thus the femnox s iv system is more advantageous than the femnox adsorbent alone in the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of as iii in particular the addition of s iv also significantly enhanced the removal of as v by femnox the diffuse reflectance uv vis spectrum of s iv coupled femnox showed a significant redshift compared with femnox alone fig s3 which indicates that the surface properties were changed this change may have eventually exposed more new adsorption sites on the material surface which enhanced the as iii v adsorption wei et al 2019a to better evaluate the performance of femnox adsorbents for the removal of as iii and as v the experimental adsorption data were fitted to the nonlinear langmuir and freundlich isothermal models fig 2d the adsorption constants are presented in table s4 the regression coefficients showed that the freundlich model fitted the experimental data better this suggests that the adsorption was irreversible at the nonhomogeneous adsorption sites because the langmuir model assumes that adsorption reactions occur on the surface of homogeneous adsorbent materials while the freundlich model assumes that adsorption reactions occur on nonhomogeneous multimolecular layers with different adsorption capacities cai et al 2022 the maximum adsorption capacity of as v and as iii by the femnox s iv system 91 3 and 76 5 mg g respectively was greater than the maximum adsorptions of as v and as iii by femnox alone 32 6 and 46 3 mg g respectively therefore compared with the conventional femn type adsorbents shan and tong 2013 zhang et al 2009 2007b the addition of s iv may generate some reactive radicals that affect the ability of the adsorbent to remove as iii v and the surface properties which is consistent with the kinetic results compared with previously reported metal composite oxide adsorbents table s5 the femnox s iv system had a significantly better maximum as iii adsorption capacity and removal speed 3 3 effect of solution chemistry the effects of different ph values on as iii removal by the femnox s iv system are shown in fig 3 a in general the distribution of s iv species is ph dependent therefore the major s iv species under acidic conditions hso3 gradually changes to so3 2 as the ph of the solution increases ding et al 2019 compared with hso3 so3 2 has a lower redox potential e so3 so3 2 0 63 v vs e so3 hso3 0 84 v neta and huie 1985 and higher reaction rate constant for so5 production k so5 hso3 7 5 104 m 1 s 1 vs k so5 so3 2 9 0 106 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2019 thus when the ph was increased from 3 to 7 the redox reaction between s iv and femnox was promoted to generate more active species which enhanced the as iii removal efficiency on the other hand at higher ph conditions when fe as o underwent bonding protons initially bound to o on the femnox surface were released in other words deprotonation also enhanced the as iii adsorption wei et al 2019b this is because the major form of as iii under acidic conditions is h3aso3 and thus as iii was mainly removed via surface complexation mechanisms rather than simple electrostatic interactions however when the ph of the solution was increased from 7 to 11 as iii and oxidation formed as v existed mainly as anions h2aso3 and haso4 2 respectively while the zero charge point of femnox was at 7 4 as a result an electrostatic repulsive force was generated between the negatively charged femnox and as iii v which inhibited the as iii removal in addition except for the obvious leaching of mn ions at the initial ph 3 the leaching values of fe and mn ions in femnox at other initial ph conditions were almost all far below the maximum contaminant level fig s4 the lower ph value is unfavorable for the removal of as iii and may affect the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent thus in the process of removing as iii we set the optimum ph of femnox s iv system as 7 in general the adsorbent was highly sensitive to changes in the ionic strength of the solution this is because the increase in ionic strength affects adsorbents with an outer sphere complexation removal mechanism while adsorbents with complexation through the inner sphere are not inhibited by competition from weak anions for adsorption sites on their surfaces hu et al 2022 thus fig 3b demonstrates that as iii and its oxidized as v ions follow the chemisorption mechanism of the inner sphere complex on the femnox surface oxidation followed by adsorption adsorption only on the other hand adsorbents are often susceptible to the influence of some anions e g so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 and hpo4 2 and natural organic matter in natural water bodies during practical use therefore we performed batch experiments for as iii removal by the femnox s iv system under different anionic conditions as shown in fig 3c and 3d sio3 2 and hpo4 2 significantly inhibited as iii removal due to having similar chemical structures as that of as iii but the other anions and ha had almost no effect on the as iii removal 3 4 application of femnox s iv for as iii removal 3 4 1 practicality and reusability of femnox because natural water bodies have a more complex composition than di water we experimentally investigated the as iii removal by the femnox s iv system from different natural water bodies as shown in fig 4 a the femnox s iv system effectively and rapidly removed as from contaminated natural water bodies within 20 min and the residual as concentrations were all below the maximum contamination level mcl 10 µg l this indicates that the femnox s iv system has great potential for the treatment of natural as contaminated waters to verify that the femnox adsorbent can be regenerated after use five adsorption desorption cycles were performed using a naoh solution as shown in fig 4b the regenerated femnox retained good as iii removal capacity in the femnox s iv system the femnox adsorption efficiency only decreased by about 2 0 after the five cycles compared with the initial femnox furthermore the elution efficiency of femnox during regeneration only decreased from the initial 97 2 to 90 8 fig s5 thus the good regeneration capacity and high elution efficiency further demonstrate the potential of the femnox s iv system for as iii removal in actual water bodies 3 4 2 column tests femnox nanoparticles are difficult to separate from water after adsorption and prone to cause a large pressure drop when applied directly to fixed beds thus to broaden the scope of the femnox s iv system for engineering applications we loaded femnox on nanocellulose via a freeze drying technique to form femnox nca as shown in fig 5 femnox nca had a 3d network skeleton and a porous laminar stacking structure this effectively provided more loading area for femnox nanoparticles and a channel for rapid penetration of as ions inside the adsorbent zhang et al 2019 the fixed bed column test was used to evaluate the as iii and as v removal capacities of femnox nca note that neither the nanocellulose aerogel alone nor the nanocellulose aerogel with s iv had the ability to remove as iii and as ⅴ fig s6 fig 6 shows that the femnox nca s iv system treated about 2387 column volumes 124 l of as contaminated groundwater before the effluent as concentration exceeded the mcl the morphology of femnox nca remained intact without material fragmentation during continuous experiments lasting more than 30 days meanwhile the concentrations of fe and mn ions in the effluent did not exceed chinese national drinking water standards fig s7 these results indicate that the femnox nca s iv system is a feasible solution for as removal from contaminated water 3 5 mechanism study 3 5 1 as adsorption mechanism the ftir spectra fig s8 exhibited the information regarding the surface of the adsorbent before and after the reaction of the femnox s iv system with as iii v the absorption peaks at 3430 and 1633 cm 1 were attributed to the hydroxyl stretching vibrations of the crystalline water and adsorbed water in femnox respectively chen et al 2020 some researchers li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018b have already reported that the peaks of metal hydroxyl groups m oh on the surface of fe mn composite oxide materials gradually decrease or even disappear after as adsorption therefore we observed that the hydroxyl group peak at 1050 cm 1 disappeared after the reactions of femnox with as iii v meanwhile the stretching vibration peaks of as v o fe or as v oh appeared at 820 cm 1 qiu et al 2020 the above results indicate that as iii was oxidized to as v when it was adsorbed by femnox the hydroxyl groups on the femnox surface were involved in the adsorptions of as iii v xps was used to determine the change in the elemental state on the surface of the femnox material after the adsorption of as iii v as illustrated in fig 7 a the as 3d spectrum deconvoluted into two overlapping peaks located at 45 3 and 44 1 ev which were attributed to as v and as iii respectively cai et al 2019 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in table s6 the femnox s iv system converted 89 8 of the adsorbed as iii to as v which was a much higher rate than the 40 0 converted by femnox alone the failure to achieve 100 conversion of as iii may be related to the adsorption speed of as iii is greater than its oxidation speed at the initial stage of the reaction cai et al 2022 the abovementioned results confirm the theory that the addition of s iv facilitates the oxidation of as iii by femnox generally the lattice oxygen o2 and surface metal hydroxyl groups m oh of metal oxide adsorbents play a key role in the adsorption of inorganic as li et al 2010 thus we deconvoluted the o 1s spectrum fig 7b into three overlapping peaks at 531 9 530 9 and 529 7 ev which were assigned to adsorbed water h2o hydroxyl oh and lattice oxygen o2 respectively wu et al 2021 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in table s7 the oh o2 ratio decreased from 1 57 to 0 96 and 1 18 after the adsorptions of as iii and as v respectively using femnox alone these results indicate that the femnox adsorbent adsorbed as mainly through the mechanism of bidentate complexes because previous studies have shown that the number of surface hydroxyl groups of as should increase when it forms monodentate complexes on a metal surface cheng et al 2009 manning and goldberg 1997 meanwhile the inner sphere as complexes formed in this bidentate manner have a more stable coordination structure arai et al 2001 in contrast the femnox s iv system exhibited the largest decrease in the oh o2 ratio 0 85 after as iii adsorption this indicates that the involvement of s iv significantly promoted the formation of more bidentate complexes between femnox and as iii obviously this phenomenon is what we expect the xps spectra of mn 2p and fe 2p are illustrated in fig 7c and 7d respectively the mn 2p spectra were deconvoluted into three overlapping peaks with binding energies at 642 9 641 9 and 640 8 ev which were assigned to mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively he et al 2019 similarly the fe 2p spectra were deconvoluted into two overlapping peaks with binding energies at 711 7 and 710 4 ev which were assigned to fe iii and fe ii respectively jin et al 2017 the relevant xps fitting data are presented in tables s8 and s9 respectively the distribution ratios of mn phases in the original femnox were 58 6 mn iv 26 4 mn iii and 15 0 mn ii and the distribution ratios of each phase changed only slightly after the reaction with as v however the distribution ratio of each phase changed significantly after the reaction with as iii especially when s iv was present in the reaction system the stoichiometric ratios of mn iv decreased from 58 6 to 29 7 and 25 1 with femnox alone and with the femnox s iv system respectively while those of mn ii increased from 15 0 to 40 5 and 20 1 respectively these results show that a redox reaction occurred between as iii and mn ii iii iv the largest decrease in the stoichiometric ratio of mn iv and largest increase in the intermediate mn iii 26 4 to 54 8 were observed when s iv was added which suggests that s iv may have introduced some intermediate active substance to accelerate the rate of redox cycling among mn ii iii iv and thus enhanced the as iii removal efficiency ke et al 2021 the intermediate mn iii may play a crucial role in the oxidation of as iii by contrast the fe component showed no substantial changes in the distribution ratio of each phase after the adsorption of as iii v by femnox except that the stoichiometric ratio of fe ii in the presence of s iv decreased from an initial value of 30 9 to 28 9 thus we deduced that the fe component in femnox may be only a trapping agent for as and an activator for s iv but not an oxidizer this is because fe ii has been shown to have a better catalytic ability than mn elements to activate s iv and generate the so5 active species guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a this may explain the enhanced redox cycling rate between mn ii iii iv 3 5 2 as iii oxidation mechanism to determine the mechanism of as iii oxidation by the femnox s iv system the change in valence of as iii during the reaction was studied fig 8 a when as v appeared in the solution the as iii concentration decreased rapidly and peaked within 2 min higher than the as iii concentration 124 81 µg l in addition as iii in solution was almost completely oxidized to as v within 4 min conversely in the absence of s iv femnox alone failed to achieve complete oxidation of as iii even within 30 min fig s9 these results suggest that the addition of s iv enhanced the conversion of as iii into as v and the adsorption speed of as iii was greater than its oxidation speed at the initial stage of the reaction several previous studies have demonstrated that when s iv is activated by transition metals some reactive intermediates may be produced in the system that accelerate the pollutant removal efficiency of the system ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a therefore we used dmpo as a free radical trapping agent to identify potentially active species by epr fig 8b clearly shows that the addition of s iv introduced so3 active species into the system without the addition of s iv we detected oh radicals in the pure femnox system which may be the radicals adsorbed on the femnox surface radicals adsorbed on transition metal surfaces are difficult to scavenge by quenchers tba and meoh fang et al 2020 lei et al 2015 thus different types of quenchers were added to the femnox s iv system before the epr experiments as shown in fig 8d we still observed the typical dmpo oh quadruple characteristic epr bop signal peak the results show that so3 and surface oh existing in the femnox s iv system may be important players in the oxidation of as iii to further determine and observe the contribution of radicals to as iii removal the initial as iii concentration was set as 10 mg l and different quenchers were added because surface oh was present in the reaction system in the presence or absence of s iv its effect on as iii oxidation was not considered methanol meoh was used as a quencher for so4 and oh because so3 can be further converted into so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen through a chain reaction ding et al 2019 tian et al 2022 simultaneously so4 can form oh by reacting with h2o oh liu et al 2017 tert butanol tba and formic acid fa were used as quenchers for oh as shown in fig 8c the addition of a quencher affected the as iii removal efficiency of the femnox s iv system however the removal efficiency of the system with the addition of a quencher was still better than that of the system without s iv this could be explained by the fact that the presence of so3 active species in femnox s iv as iii system could still be detected by epr fig 8b because the dmpo so3 signal peak of femnox s iv as iii system might not be detected by epr if the active radical was the main oxidizing species of as iii zhang et al 2018b furthermore the low concentration of the as iii solution 1109 µg l was almost unaffected by the quenching agents tba and meoh during the removal process fig s10 these results indicated that oh and so4 radicals were involved in the oxidation of as iii but were not the main oxidizing species in the reaction system at low as iii concentrations conventional femn type adsorbents are known to mainly convert as iii to as v through the redox between as iii and mn oxides mno2 zhang et al 2007b on the other hand except for the so5 radical the contributions of so4 and oh as the main oxide species in the femnox s iv system have been excluded meanwhile previous studies have reported that the so5 radicals generated by the activation of s iv can oxidize mn ii to the intermediate mn iii and it can act as a selective oxidant for target pollutants zhang et al 2018a thus we speculate that so5 and mn components in the femnox s iv system especially the intermediate mn iii are important players in as iii oxidation to test this hypothesis we added a pyrophosphate pp indicator to the reaction system as shown in fig 9 a the femnox s iv pp reacted solution showed a characteristic peak of mn iii pp complex at λ 259 nm sun et al 2019 in addition femnox s iv as iii pp produced stronger signal peaks than the system without s iv these results indicate that the addition of s iv enhanced the formation of the intermediate mn iii which may be the main reason for the rapid oxidation and removal of as iii to further verify this conclusion different pp concentrations were added to the femnox s iv system for as iii removal as shown in fig 9b the results were consistent with expectations and the as iii removal efficiency was almost completely suppressed as the pp concentration was increased notably pp did not inhibit the formation of mn iii fig 9a combined with the xps analysis of mn 2p presented in section 3 5 1 the abovementioned results indicate that the production and stabilization of the intermediate mn iii in the femnox s iv system were the main reasons for the rapid oxidation of as iii in other words the mn component is the main oxidizing species of as iii 3 5 3 pathway of s iv activation based on the abovementioned analysis we concluded that the activation pathway of s iv in the femnox s iv system may involve three redox cycle pairs i fe ii and fe iii ii oxygen sulfur radicals and iii mn iv mn iii and mn ii as shown in fig 10 fe ii in femnox activates s iv via reactions 1 4 to produce so3 guo et al 2013 so3 easily oxidizes to so5 so4 and oh through a chain reaction in the presence of o2 via reactions 5 8 guo et al 2013 the oh so4 and surface oh may oxidize part of as iii to as v meanwhile mn oxides alone may oxidize as iii to as v via reactions 9 11 zhang et al 2007a which is the main as iii oxidation step in the femnox s iv system at the same time the reductively dissolved mn ii ions may be transferred onto the femnox surface again to be oxidized to mn iv or mn iii by fresh so5 radicals through reactions 12 14 barnese et al 2008 berglund et al 1993 this is the driving force behind the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv owing to the enhanced stability of the intermediate mn iii not only the cyclic reaction rate between oxygen sulfur radicals is improved but also the redox cycle of mn ii iii iv is accelerated in addition the femnox s iv system showed poor as iii removal performance under anaerobic conditions suggesting that o2 may play a crucial role in the s iv activation pathway fig s11 in conclusion the ability of the femnox s iv system to rapidly remove as iii can be attributed to the multi pathway oxidation and chemisorption of as iii caused by certain synergistic interactions within the system 1 so3 2 h hso3 2 fe2 hso3 fehso3 3 4fehso3 o2 feso3 h 4 feso3 fe2 so3 5 o2 so3 so5 6 hso3 so5 h so4 2 so4 7 so4 hso3 so3 so4 2 h 8 so4 ho h2o oh so4 2 h 9 h3aso3 2mno2

system was successfully constructed for the rapid removal and efficient oxidation of as iii in water the experimental results showed that the reactive radicals so5 so4 and oh generated by the activation of s iv by fe ii in femnox are involved in the oxidation of as iii but are not the main oxidants the intermediate mn iii from the oxidation of mn ii by the so5 radicals drives the redox cycle between as iii and mn ii iii iv which is the main oxidation pathway of as iii the fe component of femnox efficiently captures as iii and oxidation generated as v in the form of a bidentate complex the femnox s iv system possesses a higher as iii oxidation efficiency and adsorption capacity 76 5 46 3 mg g than femnox alone furthermore the femnox s iv system not only possesses the ability to work in different aqueous matrices but also exhibits satisfactory regeneration performance in particular the femnox nca synthesized via the freezing technique endows femnox nanoparticles with the ability to separate from water and the femnox nca s iv system can effectively treat as contaminated groundwater rapidly in a fixed bed column therefore the femnox s iv or femnox nca s iv system in

15637,groundwater nitrogen contamination is becoming increasingly serious worldwide and natural nitrogen attenuation processes such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction feammox play an important role in mitigating contamination although there has been intensive study of feammox in soils and sediments still lacks research on this process in groundwater this study makes effort to demonstrate the occurrence of feammox in groundwater by combining information from fe n isotope composition the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay and 16s rrna gene sequencing poyang lake plain of yangtze river in central china was selected as the case study area the critical evidences that indicate feammox in groundwater include favorable hydrogeochemical conditions of the alluvia lacustrine aquifer systems the simultaneous enrichment of 15n in ammonium and 56fe the relative high abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the joint elevation of the abundance of the feammox bacteria and the concentration of fe iii redundancy analysis rda indicated that geothrix and rhodobacter may participate directly or cooperatively in the feammox process ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa involved in ammonium oxidizing or feammox process may be stimulated by fe iii under a low oxygen concentration and weakly acidic condition anammox may be indirectly enhanced by products of the nitrogen transformation processes involving feammox bacteria and aoa fe iii concentration is an important environmental factor affecting the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes specific geological background such as the widespread red soils and anthropogenic input of ammonium iron and acidic substances may jointly promote feammox in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feammox groundwater ammonium iron isotope microorganism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of human society and economy has contributed to the severe global challenge of high groundwater nitrogen loads wakida and lerner 2005 xin et al 2019 elevated levels of specific nitrogen compounds in drinking water contribute to chronic digestive system diseases and even cancer who 2004 therefore mitigating groundwater nitrogen contamination is of relevance to human health particularly in water scarce and remote areas in which groundwater is often the main water supply burow et al 2010 different approaches have been proposed and tested to prevent and mitigate nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the identification of natural groundwater nitrogen attenuation processes can provide new ideas for remediation huang et al 2012 han et al 2018 natural nitrogen attenuation mechanisms in groundwater include denitrification and the more energy efficient anammox process rivett et al 2008 smith et al 2015 a new type of nitrogen attenuation process involving anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to ferric iron reduction termed feammox has been identified in recent years in a wide range of environments including mangrove wetland paddy soils riparian zone intertidal wetland and lake sediments ding et al 2014 li et al 2015 2017 guan et al 2018 the end products of this process include dinitrogen gas nitrite or nitrate huang et al 2016 concluded that feammox is prevalent in acidic iron rich soils or sediments however to date studies on the feammox process have focused on surface soils or sediments equivalent studies on groundwater are still very limited although studies on the choushui river in taiwan and the hetao plain in inner mongolia have identified feammox as an important process driving the release of arsenic in groundwater weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 gao et al 2021 feammox as a novel mechanism of natural nitrogen attenuation in groundwater has been poorly studied jointly using multiple stable isotopes is able to facilitate the identification of contaminant sources and their fates widory et al 2004 du et al 2020 since feammox involves the cycling of nitrogen and iron tracing the stable isotope of nitrogen in ammonium is effective for identifying the sources and transformation of ammonium in groundwater hinkle et al 2007 du et al 2017 a study of the stable isotopes of iron in groundwater can help to clarify the process of dissolution precipitation of iron minerals castorina et al 2013 wang et al 2014b since feammox is a biogeochemical process mediated by microbes 16s rrna gene sequencing is a widely used molecular marker in the application of phylogenetic taxonomy to identify microbial communities in groundwater xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 this method is used in combination with other approaches to analyze the primary microbes involved in feammox zhu et al 2022 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr experiments can be used to quantitatively analyze the functional genes and microbial populations involved in nitrogen cycling huang et al 2016 the relationship between the abundance of microbial populations and chemical parameters can be used to infer the main processes involved in the transformation of nitrogen li et al 2017 wang et al 2021a recent studies on feammox in groundwater have been based on nitrogen isotopes or microbes and these studies have yet to utilize iron isotopes weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 gao et al 2021 therefore there is potential to combine stable nitrogen and iron isotopes 16s rrna gene sequencing and the qpcr assay with hydrogeochemistry to extract key information on the occurrence of feammox in groundwater poyang lake plain plp is a densely populated area of fast urbanization and intensive agricultural activities in the middle reaches of the yangtze river jiangxi province central china the rapid increase in population density and socioeconomic development in recent years has caused serious nitrogen pollution of groundwater in the region soldatova et al 2017 soldatova et al 2021 groundwater of the tail of ganjiang river delta grd in the plp forms a reducing environment under the influence of unique geological conditions and human activities soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 and consequently ammonium is the main species of nitrogen compounds in groundwater xiong et al 2021 in addition previous studies have found that acidic iron rich groundwater particularly in the grd poses an additional important water quality challenge to the local water supply shvartsev et al 2016 soldatova et al 2018 thus we speculated at the beginning of this work that the regional hydrogeochemical conditions are favorable for feammox to occur therefore the aims of the present study were to confirm the feammox process in groundwater in the case study area by characterizing stable isotopes of nitrogen in ammonium and iron microbial communities and functional microorganisms and to identify the influence of environmental factors on feammox the results of the present study can act as a reference for studying feammox in groundwater and can be applied to other areas of the world under similar conditions 2 study area materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china and is located in northern jiangxi province south of the yangtze river the vast plp alluvial lacustrine plain was formed under the alluviation of five major rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers flowing into poyang lake and the lacustrine deposits in jiangxi province liao et al 2020a ganjiang river the largest river in the province flows into poyang lake through nanchang the provincial capital forming the grd lan 2016 the entire plain falls into a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 16 19 c and an average annual precipitation of 1400 2400 mm wang et al 2014a liao et al 2018a the elevation of the study area generally decreases from the periphery to the central region accordingly the topography from poyang lake to the east south and west of jiangxi province consists of plain hills mountains and rivers flowing into poyang lake from the mountains sun et al 2014 liao et al 2020a most strata are exposed in the plp and surrounding areas except the lower devonian middle jurassic and neogene liao et al 2018b bedrock types in the plp and surrounding areas include siltstones mudstones slates tuffaceous sandstones and granitoids soldatova et al 2017 2018 quaternary porous aquifers and bedrock fissure aquifers are the main aquifers in this area liao et al 2018b in addition the quaternary shallow aquifers are rich in water content and provide a water resource for domestic agricultural and industrial uses liao et al 2018b wang et al 2021c the quaternary unconsolidated sediments mainly consist of pebbles gravels and sands of different sizes loams clays fig 1 b and red soils rich in iron hydroxides widely covering hills and mountains shvartsev et al 2016 liao et al 2018b groundwater is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and surface water during the wet season whereas groundwater in turn replenishes surface water during the dry season liao et al 2018a 2020b this relationship emphasizes the close interaction between groundwater and surface water lan 2016 groundwater flows in a direction that is roughly consistent with the change in terrain i e from the mountains to poyang lake liao et al 2018a 2018b poyang lake is surrounded by densely populated cities with nanchang city in particular being the city in jiangxi province with the highest population density and a relatively developed industry liu 2009 liao et al 2018b soldatova et al 2018 therefore the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in addition to agricultural activities may be important factors leading to the degradation of groundwater quality downstream of the city 2 2 field sampling and measurements we conducted field sampling work at plp in july 2020 the tail of grd in which feammox is speculated to occur and some groundwater samples from this region were resampled in july 2021

was performed by magigene cloud platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 evidence for the occurrence of feammox the eh values of groundwater samples varied from 121 4 to 26 3 mv mean 52 6 mv ph ranged from 6 18 to 6 45 mean 6 31 and ec varied from 230 to 642 μs cm mean 336 μs cm the narrow range of groundwater do of 0 76 to 1 59 mg l mean 1 15 mg l indicated an anoxic condition which is generally considered to be favorable for anaerobic oxidation of ammonium the concentrations of nh4 n and fe ii ranged from 0 40 to 12 10 mg l mean 3 49 mg l and from 1 70 to 37 50 mg l mean 14 69 mg l respectively the contents of total fe in groundwater varied widely from 3 57 to 67 29 mg l mean 33 82 mg l exceeding even that of ca2 mean 33 39 mg l which may indicate that biogeochemical processes of iron in groundwater are relatively important groundwater phosphorus p doc and tn concentrations ranged from 0 13 to 2 20 mg l mean 0 73 mg l 1 23 to 2 70 mg l mean 1 95 mg l and 0 61 to 12 69 mg l mean 3 39 mg l respectively the results of hydrochemical analysis indicated that groundwater in the study area under weakly oxidizing to reducing and weakly acidic conditions contains high concentrations of fe iii extremely conducive to the occurrence of feammox li et al 2015 huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2018 the groundwater ammonium sources and transformation processes can be determined by coupling nitrogen isotopic signatures with hydrochemical parameters groundwater ammonium δ 15n values ranged from 2 40 to 11 42 mean 9 00 in the plot of δ 15n nh4 verses nh4 n concentration in fig 2 a only one sample showed a δ 15n nh4 value falling within the range indicating an organic matter mineralization source 0 0 to 7 0 hinkle et al 2007 du et al 2017 some samples showed δ 15n nh4 values exceeding 7 0 these samples were characterized by low contents of cl 10 mg l and nh4 n fig 2a indicating the effects of certain ammonium related transformation processes enrichment of 15n in the residual ammonium may result from ammonia volatilization aerobic ammonium oxidation and anammox kendall and aravena 2000 brunner et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 however the groundwater at plp is generally under weakly acidic and weakly oxidizing to reducing conditions which is not conducive to the occurrence of ammonia volatilization and aerobic ammonium oxidation ruiz et al 2003 li et al 2012 the low concentrations of no3 and no2 detected in these samples suggested that anammox may not be the main process leading to enrichment of 15n smith et al 2015 in addition the sample plp 05 showed the highest concentrations of nh4 n 12 10 mg l and cl 67 94 mg l and had a cl br mass ratio of more than 1000 which may be related to the input of exogenous pollutants mcarthur et al 2012 a significantly negative correlation r 0 89 p 0 01 was observed between the value of eh and the content of fe suggesting that reducing conditions led to the enrichment of fe in groundwater the fractionation of iron isotopes was smaller than that of nitrogen isotopes and δ 56fe varied from 0 99 to 0 92 mean 0 02 table s1 provides more information on hydrogeochemical and isotopic data the plot of δ 56fe versus fe indicated that the sample plp 05 showed a relatively high δ 56fe value but not the highest fe content in addition a significantly positive correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 was observed between the δ 56fe and fe concentrations except for sample plp 05 fig 2b this result can be attributed to the reductive dissolution of iron bearing minerals mediated by microbes the absence of significant correlation between the δ 56fe values and fe ii concentrations can be explained by the fact that the fe ii produced by the reduction of iron bearing minerals is easily adsorbed on the surface of newly formed minerals wu et al 2019 the early stage of microbial reduction of iron minerals resulted in the depletion and enrichment of 56fe in groundwater and in sediments respectively as iron minerals dissolution progresses the δ 56fe in the aqueous phase from the residual 56fe enriched iron minerals would be relatively larger compared to the initial δ 56fe values tao et al 2022 the results of rayleigh fractionation indicated that late iron reduction would result in the gradual enrichment of 56fe in groundwater crosby et al 2007 wang et al 2014b moreover fe ii oxidation may not be the main factor leading to the enrichment of 56fe in groundwater under reducing conditions the higher δ 56fe content in plp 05 compared to the other samples may be due to the presence of more complex reactions in this sample or industrial iron imports johnson et al 2003 the strong positive correlation r 0 96 p 0 001 between δ 15n nh4 and δ 56fe value disregarding plp 05 indicated the simultaneous occurrence of ammonium transformation and reductive dissolution of iron bearing minerals fig 3 a therefore anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to ferric iron reduction also known as feammox is the only biogeochemical process that can reasonably explain the results of our observations recent studies have identified acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 as being directly involved in feammox huang and jaffé 2015 2018 the feammox bacteria of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 were detected in all eight groundwater samples at abundances varying from 5 56 106 to 2 46 107 copies ml mean 1 32 107 copies ml the abundances of amoa aoa and amoa aob ranged from 4 56 106 to 6 87 106 copies ml mean 5 62 106 copies ml and from 2 03 105 to 1 17 107 copies ml mean 1 93 106 copies ml respectively the abundances of amoa aoa exceeded those of amoa aob by one order of magnitude in all samples except plp 07 this result suggested a high effectiveness of archaea involved in the oxidizing of ammonium the abundances of hzsa nrfa and urec ranged between 5 20 105 1 19 107 copies ml mean 4 35 106 copies ml 1 17 106 3 03 107 copies ml mean 9 42 106 copies ml and 1 75 107 9 88 107 copies ml mean 3 87 107 copies ml respectively urec was clearly dominant among the six functional microorganisms followed by acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 accounting for 35 64 63 91 and 10 55 24 65 respectively fig 4 a table s2 summarizes the abundance data for the six functional microorganisms the relative abundances of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 in the groundwater samples exceeded those of amoa aoa aerobic ammonium oxidizing gene in aoa amoa aob aerobic ammonium oxidizing gene in aob and hzsa anammox gene this result suggested that feammox may act as an ammonium transformation pathway with a more significant effect than that of aerobic ammonium oxidization and anammox the results of the pca revealed a significant difference in the composition of functional microorganisms of samples with a high content of fe iii 20 mg l to those with lower content of fe iii 10 mg l except for plp 05 fig s3 although sample plp 05 had the highest content of fe iii 38 40 mg l its composition of functional microorganisms is similar to that of the samples with lower fe iii contents in addition the much lower abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 in plp 05 indicated weak feammox at this site therefore the present study excluded the outlier sample plp 05 from the results of analysis fig 3b shows the heatmap of correlation between the abundance of functional microorganisms and hydrochemical parameters the results shown in fig 3b indicate a significant positive correlation between the abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the concentration of fe iii indicating that fe iii can enhance the feammox process li et al 2015 huang et al 2016 the occurrence of feammox is further supported by the good positive correlation r 0 84 p 0 05 between the abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the value of δ 15n nh4 the eight groundwater samples yielded 569 330 16s rrna gene sequences after filtering with the number of sequences obtained from each sample ranging from 67 266 to 75 338 these sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 3 dissimilarity cutoff thereby providing 3377 6171 otus the rarefaction curve represents the relationship between the diversity index and the proportion of extracted sequence numbers the flattening of the curve indicates that the sequencing coverage is sufficient fig s1 proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in the groundwater samples accounting for 17 to 61 of the microbial community fig s2a within proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria accounting for 8 to 38 5 to 21 and 3 to 14 of the microbial community respectively were the three most abundant classes fig s2b and thought to contribute to the nitrogen and iron cycles shu et al 2016 among the 20 most abundant genera sideroxydans are involved in ferrous oxidation under neutral conditions whereas geobacter pseudomonas geothrix are widely distributed in the natural environment and act as iron reducing bacteria irb fig s2c bond and lovley 2005 lovley et al 2011 liu et al 2012 ding et al 2017 this result indicates that iron oxidation reduction mediated by microbes is one of the main biogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater in this region the remaining genera involved in partial or complete ammonium oxidation included sphingomonas rhodobacter and rhizobium huang et al 2014 fitzgerald et al 2015 kuykendall et al 2015 liu et al 2017 erkal et al 2019 suggesting that ammonium oxidizing processes are also significant only the genus candidatus nitrososphaera an aoa zhu et al 2022 was present in small amounts however nitrososphaeraceae the only known family of aoa in the feammox system li et al 2019 was relatively abundant the aob were dominated by nitrosomonas whereas nitrosospira were only detected in one sample only two genera of anammox bacteria anaob candidatus brocadia and candidatus anammoximicrobium wang et al 2021b were detected with the former dominant besides for the 20 most abundant genera enhydrobacter may also be involved in the ammonium oxidation process staley and brenner 2015 xiu et al 2020 the irb with relative low abundances in the samples included the genera anaeromyxobacter dechloromonas thermoanaerobaculum desulfosporosinus clostridium sensu stricto 12 and shewanella losey et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 bao and li 2017 huang and jaffé 2018 zhu et al 2022 fig 4b shows the relative abundances of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes in these samples geothrix is a known irb and culture experiments have indicated that it plays an important role in feammox bond and lovley 2005 zhou et al 2016 rhodobacter is a bacterium adapted to both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and has been reported to be involved in both ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing processes dobbin et al 1996 xiu et al 2020 both bacteria were among the 20 most abundant genera in the groundwater samples in addition the concentration of fe iii showed positive correlations with the otus of these bacteria fig 5 b this result suggested that these two bacteria may play a vital role in feammox besides there was a strong positive correlation between the otus of geothrix and rhodobacter r 0 99 p 0 001 suggesting that they may also act synergistically in feammox 3 2 environmental factors affecting feammox and concomitant processes the relative abundance of aerobic ammonium oxidizing functional genes indicates that aoa may prevail over aob in abundance since hu et al 2014 showed that aoa plays a dominant role in acid soil nitrification this process may also play an important role in nitrogen transformation in groundwater under weakly acidic conditions although past studies have considered aoa to be aerobic bacteria the results of a recent study showed that nitrosopumilus maritimus a type of aoa can supply the oxygen required for ammonia oxidization under anoxic conditions kraft et al 2022 therefore the process of ammonium oxidization involved aoa cannot be ignored in anoxic conditions a significant positive correlation was observed between the abundance of amoa aoa and the content of fe iii fig 3b this result indicates that fe iii may enhance the ammonium oxidizing process in which aoa participates which is further supported by the iron requirements of aoa shafiee et al 2019 in addition previous study suggests that aoa is likely to play an important role in feammox zhu et al 2022 the feammox process can produce dinitrogen gas as well as nitrite and nitrate and nitrate or nitrite produced by feammox can be further converted to dinitrogen gas by denitrification or anammox ding et al 2017 guan et al 2018 however the production of dinitrogen gas through feammox was considered more energetically favorable yang et al 2012 in addition nitrite is also produced by the weak ammonium oxidizing process in which aoa participates therefore in this case anammox may exist as a weak nitrogen transformation pathway this may also explain the significant positive correlation between the abundance of hzsa and the content of fe iii with fe iii indirectly promoting the growth of hzsa fig 3b in addition the three remaining functional genes including amoa aob nrfa respiratory nitrite ammonification gene and urec organic nitrogen mineralization gene were also positively correlated with fe iii concentration suggesting that fe iii may accelerate nitrogen cycling rda was used to elucidate the effects of environmental factors on functional microorganisms with the two dimensions rda1 and rda2 explaining 61 11 and 23 05 of the total variance respectively fig 5a eh and fe iii showed a negative and positive correlation with these six functional microorganisms respectively nh4 n promoted the growth of two functional microorganisms acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and hzsa however no significant correlation was observed between ph and acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and between ph and amoa aoa and these two functional microorganisms are conducive to growth under more acidic conditions the results possibly due to lack of an obvious acid gradient fig 5b shows the rda of the relationship between the distributions of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes in response to environmental variables rda1 and rda2 explained 38 83 and 22 51 of the variance respectively the results showed the positive correlation between fe iii contents and the abundances of geothrix rhodobacter dechloromonas and desulfosporosinus which may be associated with feammox furthermore fe iii promoted the growth of aob including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira bacteria such as pseudomonas and enhydrobacter showed a negative correlation with fe iii and this result can be attributed to toxicity resulting from high contents of heavy metal other bacteria such as sphingomonas and geobacter were shown to be more ph sensitive and ph was observed to be negative correlated with aoa and potential feammox however it is unfortunate that aoa and anaob were not found to be stimulated by fe iii indicating the possible presence of unknown microbes it can be concluded from the results of the present study that fe iii plays an important role both in the abundance of functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling and in the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes 3 3 linking feammox to geological setting and human activities red regolith is widely developed in the hilly and mountainous regions of the study area soldatova et al 2017 liao et al 2018b these red soils were formed by weathering of bedrocks such as granite and sandstone shvartsev et al 2016 the red appearance of the soils can be attributed to their high fe hydroxide content which also contributes to their acidity shvartsev et al 2016 liao et al 2018b grd was mainly formed under the alluviation of ganjiang river and lacustrine deposition and the sedimentary grains show typical features of coarse grains at the bottom and fine grains at the top lan 2016 liao et al 2020a sediment particle size decreases in the tail of this typical alluvial lacustrine geological unit the thickness of the surface low permeable layer becomes larger and groundwater flow becomes more sluggish thereby forming a more reducing subsurface environment in the tail of grd choi et al 2016 then iron hydroxide dissolution under a reducing condition leads to fe enrichment in groundwater liao et al 2018b the plp has long been an important agricultural area for china the coupled influence of long term application of fertilizer and organic matter mineralization results in groundwater ammonium enrichment under a reducing condition soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 the long term application of organic fertilizer also contributes to the formation of a reducing environment in the study area soldatova et al 2017 in addition nanchang the capital of jiangxi province is located upstream of the study area and has a large population density and hosts many factories domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharged in this city may seep into the ground and be transported in groundwater systems liu 2009 soldatova et al 2018 evidence from previous studies on nitrogen and oxygen isotopes in nitrate indicates that nitrate in groundwater in the study area is mainly derived from domestic sewage and manure soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 hence anthropogenic input is also a non negligible factor leading to the enrichment of ammonium iron and acidic substances in groundwater in the tail of grd in summary the occurrence of feammox in groundwater in the study area is closely related to the specific geological settings and the intensive human activities the methodology and results of the present study should be applicable to other regions of the world under with similar conditions fig 6 shows the proposed conceptual model of feammox and concomitant processes in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer system at grd 4 conclusions the occurrence of feammox in groundwater of the poyang lake plain is jointly supported by the favorable hydrogeochemical conditions the joint enrichment of ammonium 15n and 56fe the relative high abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the positive relationship between the abundance of the feammox bacteria and the concentration of fe iii the bacteria geothrix and rhodobacter potentially directly or cooperatively participate in feammox under anoxic and weakly acidic conditions fe iii facilitates the ammonium oxidizing role of aoa and aoa may play a vital role in the feammox process anammox may occur using feammox bacteria and aoa produced no2 or no3 as reactants the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes were affected by fe iii which is an important environmental factor the

15637,groundwater nitrogen contamination is becoming increasingly serious worldwide and natural nitrogen attenuation processes such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction feammox play an important role in mitigating contamination although there has been intensive study of feammox in soils and sediments still lacks research on this process in groundwater this study makes effort to demonstrate the occurrence of feammox in groundwater by combining information from fe n isotope composition the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay and 16s rrna gene sequencing poyang lake plain of yangtze river in central china was selected as the case study area the critical evidences that indicate feammox in groundwater include favorable hydrogeochemical conditions of the alluvia lacustrine aquifer systems the simultaneous enrichment of 15n in ammonium and 56fe the relative high abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the joint elevation of the abundance of the feammox bacteria and the concentration of fe iii redundancy analysis rda indicated that geothrix and rhodobacter may participate directly or cooperatively in the feammox process ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa involved in ammonium oxidizing or feammox process may be stimulated by fe iii under a low oxygen concentration and weakly acidic condition anammox may be indirectly enhanced by products of the nitrogen transformation processes involving feammox bacteria and aoa fe iii concentration is an important environmental factor affecting the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes specific geological background such as the widespread red soils and anthropogenic input of ammonium iron and acidic substances may jointly promote feammox in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feammox groundwater ammonium iron isotope microorganism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of human society and economy has contributed to the severe global challenge of high groundwater nitrogen loads wakida and lerner 2005 xin et al 2019 elevated levels of specific nitrogen compounds in drinking water contribute to chronic digestive system diseases and even cancer who 2004 therefore mitigating groundwater nitrogen contamination is of relevance to human health particularly in water scarce and remote areas in which groundwater is often the main water supply burow et al 2010 different approaches have been proposed and tested to prevent and mitigate nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the identification of natural groundwater nitrogen attenuation processes can provide new ideas for remediation huang et al 2012 han et al 2018 natural nitrogen attenuation mechanisms in groundwater include denitrification and the more energy efficient anammox process rivett et al 2008 smith et al 2015 a new type of nitrogen attenuation process involving anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to ferric iron reduction termed feammox has been identified in recent years in a wide range of environments including mangrove wetland paddy soils riparian zone intertidal wetland and lake sediments ding et al 2014 li et al 2015 2017 guan et al 2018 the end products of this process include dinitrogen gas nitrite or nitrate huang et al 2016 concluded that feammox is prevalent in acidic iron rich soils or sediments however to date studies on the feammox process have focused on surface soils or sediments equivalent studies on groundwater are still very limited although studies on the choushui river in taiwan and the hetao plain in inner mongolia have identified feammox as an important process driving the release of arsenic in groundwater weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 gao et al 2021 feammox as a novel mechanism of natural nitrogen attenuation in groundwater has been poorly studied jointly using multiple stable isotopes is able to facilitate the identification of contaminant sources and their fates widory et al 2004 du et al 2020 since feammox involves the cycling of nitrogen and iron tracing the stable isotope of nitrogen in ammonium is effective for identifying the sources and transformation of ammonium in groundwater hinkle et al 2007 du et al 2017 a study of the stable isotopes of iron in groundwater can help to clarify the process of dissolution precipitation of iron minerals castorina et al 2013 wang et al 2014b since feammox is a biogeochemical process mediated by microbes 16s rrna gene sequencing is a widely used molecular marker in the application of phylogenetic taxonomy to identify microbial communities in groundwater xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 this method is used in combination with other approaches to analyze the primary microbes involved in feammox zhu et al 2022 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr experiments can be used to quantitatively analyze the functional genes and microbial populations involved in nitrogen cycling huang et al 2016 the relationship between the abundance of microbial populations and chemical parameters can be used to infer the main processes involved in the transformation of nitrogen li et al 2017 wang et al 2021a recent studies on feammox in groundwater have been based on nitrogen isotopes or microbes and these studies have yet to utilize iron isotopes weng et al 2017 xiu et al 2020 xiu et al 2021 gao et al 2021 therefore there is potential to combine stable nitrogen and iron isotopes 16s rrna gene sequencing and the qpcr assay with hydrogeochemistry to extract key information on the occurrence of feammox in groundwater poyang lake plain plp is a densely populated area of fast urbanization and intensive agricultural activities in the middle reaches of the yangtze river jiangxi province central china the rapid increase in population density and socioeconomic development in recent years has caused serious nitrogen pollution of groundwater in the region soldatova et al 2017 soldatova et al 2021 groundwater of the tail of ganjiang river delta grd in the plp forms a reducing environment under the influence of unique geological conditions and human activities soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 and consequently ammonium is the main species of nitrogen compounds in groundwater xiong et al 2021 in addition previous studies have found that acidic iron rich groundwater particularly in the grd poses an additional important water quality challenge to the local water supply shvartsev et al 2016 soldatova et al 2018 thus we speculated at the beginning of this work that the regional hydrogeochemical conditions are favorable for feammox to occur therefore the aims of the present study were to confirm the feammox process in groundwater in the case study area by characterizing stable isotopes of nitrogen in ammonium and iron microbial communities and functional microorganisms and to identify the influence of environmental factors on feammox the results of the present study can act as a reference for studying feammox in groundwater and can be applied to other areas of the world under similar conditions 2 study area materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china and is located in northern jiangxi province south of the yangtze river the vast plp alluvial lacustrine plain was formed under the alluviation of five major rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers flowing into poyang lake and the lacustrine deposits in jiangxi province liao et al 2020a ganjiang river the largest river in the province flows into poyang lake through nanchang the provincial capital forming the grd lan 2016 the entire plain falls into a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 16 19 c and an average annual precipitation of 1400 2400 mm wang et al 2014a liao et al 2018a the elevation of the study area generally decreases from the periphery to the central region accordingly the topography from poyang lake to the east south and west of jiangxi province consists of plain hills mountains and rivers flowing into poyang lake from the mountains sun et al 2014 liao et al 2020a most strata are exposed in the plp and surrounding areas except the lower devonian middle jurassic and neogene liao et al 2018b bedrock types in the plp and surrounding areas include siltstones mudstones slates tuffaceous sandstones and granitoids soldatova et al 2017 2018 quaternary porous aquifers and bedrock fissure aquifers are the main aquifers in this area liao et al 2018b in addition the quaternary shallow aquifers are rich in water content and provide a water resource for domestic agricultural and industrial uses liao et al 2018b wang et al 2021c the quaternary unconsolidated sediments mainly consist of pebbles gravels and sands of different sizes loams clays fig 1 b and red soils rich in iron hydroxides widely covering hills and mountains shvartsev et al 2016 liao et al 2018b groundwater is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and surface water during the wet season whereas groundwater in turn replenishes surface water during the dry season liao et al 2018a 2020b this relationship emphasizes the close interaction between groundwater and surface water lan 2016 groundwater flows in a direction that is roughly consistent with the change in terrain i e from the mountains to poyang lake liao et al 2018a 2018b poyang lake is surrounded by densely populated cities with nanchang city in particular being the city in jiangxi province with the highest population density and a relatively developed industry liu 2009 liao et al 2018b soldatova et al 2018 therefore the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in addition to agricultural activities may be important factors leading to the degradation of groundwater quality downstream of the city 2 2 field sampling and measurements we conducted field sampling work at plp in july 2020 the tail of grd in which feammox is speculated to occur and some groundwater samples from this region were resampled in july 2021 eight representative groundwater samples with different ammonium concentrations were collected from residential wells the depths of which ranged from 9 to 45 m fig 1a various variables were measured in the field using a portable multi parameter meter hach hq40d including oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature t the orp was converted into eh with a standard orp solution and the details of standard solution can be found in supporting information prior to sampling fresh groundwater was pumped for at least 30 min until groundwater

was performed by magigene cloud platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 evidence for the occurrence of feammox the eh values of groundwater samples varied from 121 4 to 26 3 mv mean 52 6 mv ph ranged from 6 18 to 6 45 mean 6 31 and ec varied from 230 to 642 μs cm mean 336 μs cm the narrow range of groundwater do of 0 76 to 1 59 mg l mean 1 15 mg l indicated an anoxic condition which is generally considered to be favorable for anaerobic oxidation of ammonium the concentrations of nh4 n and fe ii ranged from 0 40 to 12 10 mg l mean 3 49 mg l and from 1 70 to 37 50 mg l mean 14 69 mg l respectively the contents of total fe in groundwater varied widely from 3 57 to 67 29 mg l mean 33 82 mg l exceeding even that of ca2 mean 33 39 mg l which may indicate that biogeochemical processes of iron in groundwater are relatively important groundwater phosphorus p doc and tn concentrations ranged from 0 13 to 2 20 mg l mean 0 73 mg l 1 23 to 2 70 mg l mean 1 95 mg l and 0 61 to 12 69 mg l mean 3 39 mg l respectively the results of hydrochemical analysis indicated that groundwater in the study area under weakly oxidizing to reducing and weakly acidic conditions contains high concentrations of fe iii extremely conducive to the occurrence of feammox li et al 2015 huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2018 the groundwater ammonium sources and transformation processes can be determined by coupling nitrogen isotopic signatures with hydrochemical parameters groundwater ammonium δ 15n values ranged from 2 40 to 11 42 mean 9 00 in the plot of δ 15n nh4 verses nh4 n concentration in fig 2 a only one sample showed a δ 15n nh4 value falling within the range indicating an organic matter mineralization source 0 0 to 7 0 hinkle et al 2007 du et al 2017 some samples showed δ 15n nh4 values exceeding 7 0 these samples were characterized by low contents of cl 10 mg l and nh4 n fig 2a indicating the effects of certain ammonium related transformation processes enrichment of 15n in the residual ammonium may result from ammonia volatilization aerobic ammonium oxidation and anammox kendall and aravena 2000 brunner et al 2013 norrman et al 2015 however the groundwater at plp is generally under weakly acidic and weakly oxidizing to reducing conditions which is not conducive to the occurrence of ammonia volatilization and aerobic ammonium oxidation ruiz et al 2003 li et al 2012 the low concentrations of no3 and no2 detected in these samples suggested that anammox may not be the main process leading to enrichment of 15n smith et al 2015 in addition the sample plp 05 showed the highest concentrations of nh4 n 12 10 mg l and cl 67 94 mg l and had a cl br mass ratio of more than 1000 which may be related to the input of exogenous pollutants mcarthur et al 2012 a significantly negative correlation r 0 89 p 0 01 was observed between the value of eh and the content of fe suggesting that reducing conditions led to the enrichment of fe in groundwater the fractionation of iron isotopes was smaller than that of nitrogen isotopes and δ 56fe varied from 0 99 to 0 92 mean 0 02 table s1 provides more information on hydrogeochemical and isotopic data the plot of δ 56fe versus fe indicated that the sample plp 05 showed a relatively high δ 56fe value but not the highest fe content in addition a significantly positive correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 was observed between the δ 56fe and fe concentrations except for sample plp 05 fig 2b this result can be attributed to the reductive dissolution of iron bearing minerals mediated by microbes the absence of significant correlation between the δ 56fe values and fe ii concentrations can be explained by the fact that the fe ii produced by the reduction of iron bearing minerals is easily adsorbed on the surface of newly formed minerals wu et al 2019 the early stage of microbial reduction of iron minerals resulted in the depletion and enrichment of 56fe in groundwater and in sediments respectively as iron minerals dissolution progresses the δ 56fe in the aqueous phase from the residual 56fe enriched iron minerals would be relatively larger compared to the initial δ 56fe values tao et al 2022 the results of rayleigh fractionation indicated that late iron reduction would result in the gradual enrichment of 56fe in groundwater crosby et al 2007 wang et al 2014b moreover fe ii oxidation may not be the main factor leading to the enrichment of 56fe in groundwater under reducing conditions the higher δ 56fe content in plp 05 compared to the other samples may be due to the presence of more complex reactions in this sample or industrial iron imports johnson et al 2003 the strong positive correlation r 0 96 p 0 001 between δ 15n nh4 and δ 56fe value disregarding plp 05 indicated the simultaneous occurrence of ammonium transformation and reductive dissolution of iron bearing minerals fig 3 a therefore anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to ferric iron reduction also known as feammox is the only biogeochemical process that can reasonably explain the results of our observations recent studies have identified acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 as being directly involved in feammox huang and jaffé 2015 2018 the feammox bacteria of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 were detected in all eight groundwater samples at abundances varying from 5 56 106 to 2 46 107 copies ml mean 1 32 107 copies ml the abundances of amoa aoa and amoa aob ranged from 4 56 106 to 6 87 106 copies ml mean 5 62 106 copies ml and from 2 03 105 to 1 17 107 copies ml mean 1 93 106 copies ml respectively the abundances of amoa aoa exceeded those of amoa aob by one order of magnitude in all samples except plp 07 this result suggested a high effectiveness of archaea involved in the oxidizing of ammonium the abundances of hzsa nrfa and urec ranged between 5 20 105 1 19 107 copies ml mean 4 35 106 copies ml 1 17 106 3 03 107 copies ml mean 9 42 106 copies ml and 1 75 107 9 88 107 copies ml mean 3 87 107 copies ml respectively urec was clearly dominant among the six functional microorganisms followed by acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 accounting for 35 64 63 91 and 10 55 24 65 respectively fig 4 a table s2 summarizes the abundance data for the six functional microorganisms the relative abundances of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 in the groundwater samples exceeded those of amoa aoa aerobic ammonium oxidizing gene in aoa amoa aob aerobic ammonium oxidizing gene in aob and hzsa anammox gene this result suggested that feammox may act as an ammonium transformation pathway with a more significant effect than that of aerobic ammonium oxidization and anammox the results of the pca revealed a significant difference in the composition of functional microorganisms of samples with a high content of fe iii 20 mg l to those with lower content of fe iii 10 mg l except for plp 05 fig s3 although sample plp 05 had the highest content of fe iii 38 40 mg l its composition of functional microorganisms is similar to that of the samples with lower fe iii contents in addition the much lower abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 in plp 05 indicated weak feammox at this site therefore the present study excluded the outlier sample plp 05 from the results of analysis fig 3b shows the heatmap of correlation between the abundance of functional microorganisms and hydrochemical parameters the results shown in fig 3b indicate a significant positive correlation between the abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the concentration of fe iii indicating that fe iii can enhance the feammox process li et al 2015 huang et al 2016 the occurrence of feammox is further supported by the good positive correlation r 0 84 p 0 05 between the abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the value of δ 15n nh4 the eight groundwater samples yielded 569 330 16s rrna gene sequences after filtering with the number of sequences obtained from each sample ranging from 67 266 to 75 338 these sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 3 dissimilarity cutoff thereby providing 3377 6171 otus the rarefaction curve represents the relationship between the diversity index and the proportion of extracted sequence numbers the flattening of the curve indicates that the sequencing coverage is sufficient fig s1 proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in the groundwater samples accounting for 17 to 61 of the microbial community fig s2a within proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria accounting for 8 to 38 5 to 21 and 3 to 14 of the microbial community respectively were the three most abundant classes fig s2b and thought to contribute to the nitrogen and iron cycles shu et al 2016 among the 20 most abundant genera sideroxydans are involved in ferrous oxidation under neutral conditions whereas geobacter pseudomonas geothrix are widely distributed in the natural environment and act as iron reducing bacteria irb fig s2c bond and lovley 2005 lovley et al 2011 liu et al 2012 ding et al 2017 this result indicates that iron oxidation reduction mediated by microbes is one of the main biogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater in this region the remaining genera involved in partial or complete ammonium oxidation included sphingomonas rhodobacter and rhizobium huang et al 2014 fitzgerald et al 2015 kuykendall et al 2015 liu et al 2017 erkal et al 2019 suggesting that ammonium oxidizing processes are also significant only the genus candidatus nitrososphaera an aoa zhu et al 2022 was present in small amounts however nitrososphaeraceae the only known family of aoa in the feammox system li et al 2019 was relatively abundant the aob were dominated by nitrosomonas whereas nitrosospira were only detected in one sample only two genera of anammox bacteria anaob candidatus brocadia and candidatus anammoximicrobium wang et al 2021b were detected with the former dominant besides for the 20 most abundant genera enhydrobacter may also be involved in the ammonium oxidation process staley and brenner 2015 xiu et al 2020 the irb with relative low abundances in the samples included the genera anaeromyxobacter dechloromonas thermoanaerobaculum desulfosporosinus clostridium sensu stricto 12 and shewanella losey et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 bao and li 2017 huang and jaffé 2018 zhu et al 2022 fig 4b shows the relative abundances of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes in these samples geothrix is a known irb and culture experiments have indicated that it plays an important role in feammox bond and lovley 2005 zhou et al 2016 rhodobacter is a bacterium adapted to both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and has been reported to be involved in both ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing processes dobbin et al 1996 xiu et al 2020 both bacteria were among the 20 most abundant genera in the groundwater samples in addition the concentration of fe iii showed positive correlations with the otus of these bacteria fig 5 b this result suggested that these two bacteria may play a vital role in feammox besides there was a strong positive correlation between the otus of geothrix and rhodobacter r 0 99 p 0 001 suggesting that they may also act synergistically in feammox 3 2 environmental factors affecting feammox and concomitant processes the relative abundance of aerobic ammonium oxidizing functional genes indicates that aoa may prevail over aob in abundance since hu et al 2014 showed that aoa plays a dominant role in acid soil nitrification this process may also play an important role in nitrogen transformation in groundwater under weakly acidic conditions although past studies have considered aoa to be aerobic bacteria the results of a recent study showed that nitrosopumilus maritimus a type of aoa can supply the oxygen required for ammonia oxidization under anoxic conditions kraft et al 2022 therefore the process of ammonium oxidization involved aoa cannot be ignored in anoxic conditions a significant positive correlation was observed between the abundance of amoa aoa and the content of fe iii fig 3b this result indicates that fe iii may enhance the ammonium oxidizing process in which aoa participates which is further supported by the iron requirements of aoa shafiee et al 2019 in addition previous study suggests that aoa is likely to play an important role in feammox zhu et al 2022 the feammox process can produce dinitrogen gas as well as nitrite and nitrate and nitrate or nitrite produced by feammox can be further converted to dinitrogen gas by denitrification or anammox ding et al 2017 guan et al 2018 however the production of dinitrogen gas through feammox was considered more energetically favorable yang et al 2012 in addition nitrite is also produced by the weak ammonium oxidizing process in which aoa participates therefore in this case anammox may exist as a weak nitrogen transformation pathway this may also explain the significant positive correlation between the abundance of hzsa and the content of fe iii with fe iii indirectly promoting the growth of hzsa fig 3b in addition the three remaining functional genes including amoa aob nrfa respiratory nitrite ammonification gene and urec organic nitrogen mineralization gene were also positively correlated with fe iii concentration suggesting that fe iii may accelerate nitrogen cycling rda was used to elucidate the effects of environmental factors on functional microorganisms with the two dimensions rda1 and rda2 explaining 61 11 and 23 05 of the total variance respectively fig 5a eh and fe iii showed a negative and positive correlation with these six functional microorganisms respectively nh4 n promoted the growth of two functional microorganisms acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and hzsa however no significant correlation was observed between ph and acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and between ph and amoa aoa and these two functional microorganisms are conducive to growth under more acidic conditions the results possibly due to lack of an obvious acid gradient fig 5b shows the rda of the relationship between the distributions of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes in response to environmental variables rda1 and rda2 explained 38 83 and 22 51 of the variance respectively the results showed the positive correlation between fe iii contents and the abundances of geothrix rhodobacter dechloromonas and desulfosporosinus which may be associated with feammox furthermore fe iii promoted the growth of aob including nitrosomonas and nitrosospira bacteria such as pseudomonas and enhydrobacter showed a negative correlation with fe iii and this result can be attributed to toxicity resulting from high contents of heavy metal other bacteria such as sphingomonas and geobacter were shown to be more ph sensitive and ph was observed to be negative correlated with aoa and potential feammox however it is unfortunate that aoa and anaob were not found to be stimulated by fe iii indicating the possible presence of unknown microbes it can be concluded from the results of the present study that fe iii plays an important role both in the abundance of functional microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling and in the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes 3 3 linking feammox to geological setting and human activities red regolith is widely developed in the hilly and mountainous regions of the study area soldatova et al 2017 liao et al 2018b these red soils were formed by weathering of bedrocks such as granite and sandstone shvartsev et al 2016 the red appearance of the soils can be attributed to their high fe hydroxide content which also contributes to their acidity shvartsev et al 2016 liao et al 2018b grd was mainly formed under the alluviation of ganjiang river and lacustrine deposition and the sedimentary grains show typical features of coarse grains at the bottom and fine grains at the top lan 2016 liao et al 2020a sediment particle size decreases in the tail of this typical alluvial lacustrine geological unit the thickness of the surface low permeable layer becomes larger and groundwater flow becomes more sluggish thereby forming a more reducing subsurface environment in the tail of grd choi et al 2016 then iron hydroxide dissolution under a reducing condition leads to fe enrichment in groundwater liao et al 2018b the plp has long been an important agricultural area for china the coupled influence of long term application of fertilizer and organic matter mineralization results in groundwater ammonium enrichment under a reducing condition soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 the long term application of organic fertilizer also contributes to the formation of a reducing environment in the study area soldatova et al 2017 in addition nanchang the capital of jiangxi province is located upstream of the study area and has a large population density and hosts many factories domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharged in this city may seep into the ground and be transported in groundwater systems liu 2009 soldatova et al 2018 evidence from previous studies on nitrogen and oxygen isotopes in nitrate indicates that nitrate in groundwater in the study area is mainly derived from domestic sewage and manure soldatova et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 hence anthropogenic input is also a non negligible factor leading to the enrichment of ammonium iron and acidic substances in groundwater in the tail of grd in summary the occurrence of feammox in groundwater in the study area is closely related to the specific geological settings and the intensive human activities the methodology and results of the present study should be applicable to other regions of the world under with similar conditions fig 6 shows the proposed conceptual model of feammox and concomitant processes in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer system at grd 4 conclusions the occurrence of feammox in groundwater of the poyang lake plain is jointly supported by the favorable hydrogeochemical conditions the joint enrichment of ammonium 15n and 56fe the relative high abundance of acidimicrobiaceae bacterium a6 and the positive relationship between the abundance of the feammox bacteria and the concentration of fe iii the bacteria geothrix and rhodobacter potentially directly or cooperatively participate in feammox under anoxic and weakly acidic conditions fe iii facilitates the ammonium oxidizing role of aoa and aoa may play a vital role in the feammox process anammox may occur using feammox bacteria and aoa produced no2 or no3 as reactants the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and the composition of ammonium oxidizing and iron reducing microbes were affected by fe iii which is an important environmental factor the

15638,the increasing environmental problems due to various organic micropollutants in water cause the search of suitable additional water treatment methods gaining experimental data for the large amount and variety of pollutants would consume a lot of time as well as economic and ecologic resources an alternative approach is predictive quantitative structure property relationship qspr modeling which establishes a correlation between the structural properties of a molecules with a biological physical or chemical property therefore in this study qspr modeling has been conducted using extensive validation techniques and statistical test to investigate the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants with ozonation in contrast to most of the other studies the underlying dataset rate constants for 92 organic molecules were obtained under standardized conditions with defined experimental parameters qspr modeling was executed using a combination of the software padel for descriptor calculation and qsarins for the modeling process respecting all five oecd requirements for applicable qsar qspr models the final model was selected using a multi criteria decision making tool to evaluate the model quality based on all calculated statistical quality parameters the model included 10 selected descriptors and fingerprints and showed good regression abilities predictive power and stability r² 0 8221 ccctr 0 9024 q²loo 0 7436 r²ext 0 8420 q²f1 0 8104 the applicability domain of the qspr model was defined and an interpretation of selected model descriptors has been connected to previous experimental studies a significant influence of the interpretable descriptors was put into experimental context and compared with previous studies and models for example the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule and the occurrence of important substructures such as a formamide group seem to decrease the removal rate constant the contribution of lone electrons entering into resonance as well as the occurrence of fused rings were identified as influences for the increase of the degradability of micropollutants by

disrupting chemicals edcs pharmaceuticals synthetic dyes pesticides and herbicides have been detected in various water samples all around the world albergamo et al 2019 vrana et al 2018 gao et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2018 additionally the possible risk to the environment and human health is a suspect of scientific research the later may include endocrine and hormonal disruption reproduction cancer diabetes obesity and the weakness of the immunological system deblonde et al 2011 the sources of these organic pollutants can be quite diverse but wastewater treatment plant effluents are considered one of the major emission sources eggen et al 2014 luo et al 2014 this is why more and more countries and regions worldwide implement different strategies to control the exposure and emission of organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment liu et al 2021b although conventional treatment technologies such as biofiltration or activated sludge systems are not typically designed to effectively remove these organic micropollutants they can help to remove large portions of biodegradable micropollutants terry and summers 2018 but due to the low biodegradability of various synthetic organic pollutants these conventional treatment methods sometimes encounter their limits in eliminating these substances completely gorito et al 2022 promising approaches specialized on the removal of organic micropollutants include advanced oxidation processes aops and ozone based technologies umar et al 2010 sillanpää et al 2018 coha et al 2021 wang and zhuan 2020 the most applied degradation and disinfection process in full scale water and wastewater treatment is ozonation umar et al 2013 liu et al 2021b the degradation of organic micropollutants with ozone based processes is mainly based on the direct oxidation by ozone o3 and the generation of hydroxyl radicals and other ros glaze et al 1987 broséus et al 2009 rekhate and srivastava 2020 the direct oxidation by dissolved ozone is selective as it reacts only with compounds with high electron density under different mechanisms such as electrophilic substitution or cycloaddition reaction described by the criegee mechanism fig 1 lim et al 2022 joseph et al 2021 the indirect oxidation with hydroxyl radicals however is non selective and can take place by electrophilic addition to an olefin or aromatic system abstraction of a hydrogen atom from carbon reaction with sulphur nitrogen or phosphorus heteroatoms and electron transfer reactions lee and von gunten 2012 ning et al 2007 umar et al 2013 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 sillanpää et al 2018 due to different degradation mechanisms occurring during ozonolysis and the different behavior of the large variety of organic micropollutants a prediction of the degradation behavior of molecules within the degradation process can be quite challenging a promising approach to cope with that problem is the calculation of mathematical models to predict the behavior of compounds on basis of their chemical structure thereby qspr quantitative structure property relationship is used to correlate a specific molecular property such as the degradation reaction rate constant with the physicochemical characteristics of the substance tropsha et al 2003 awfa et al 2021 such modeling is also suggested in the european legislation of chemicals reach european parliament 2007 another advantage of qspr modeling is the potential contribution to the understanding of reaction pathways and mechanisms by identifying important physicochemical characteristics most relevant for the specifically investigated process for the implementation of qspr models in industry and regulation the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd defined five principles that should be met by reliable and valid qspr models 1 a defined endpoint 2 an unambiguous algorithm 3 a defined domain of application 4 appropriate measures of goodness of fit robustness and predictivity and 5 a mechanistic interpretation if possible organisation for economic co operation and development 2007 gramatica 2013 the number of qspr models dealing with the degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment processes is constantly increasing awfa et al 2021 the application of qspr modeling on the degradation of organic pollutants by ozonation has been executed in previous studies beiknejad et al 2021 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a zhu et al 2015 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2014 ideally the defined endpoint values for the underlying dataset should be curated in standardized test protocols and experimental setups organisation for economic co operation and development 2007 eriksson et al 2003 however most qspr qsar studies on ozonation either collect their experimental data from different studies or are based on only a very small dataset additionally robust statistical analysis is not always carried out with caution awfa et al 2021 dearden et al 2009 gramatica 2020 in our study we wanted to address this gap by obtaining the experimental data for the investigated 92 organic molecules with the identical experimental setup and parameters under standardized and reproducible conditions and by applying an extensive amount of statistical methods to ensure the stability and reliability of the obtained model in contrast to most qspr studies regarding the ozonation of organic compounds we did not investigate the sole elementary reaction rate constant for the reaction with dissolved ozone but rather the overall removal rate of the pollutants as a sum of all degradation reactions occurring when ozone is injected into an aqueous pollutant solution the dataset included almost exclusively aromatic compounds with a large number being phenols and anilines although this does not mirror the broad structural diversity of all common micropollutants it allowed for a smaller structural spectrum of the dataset and therefore for a more stable modeling process the conducted qspr modeling was based on gramatica et al 2013 previously applied by glienke et al 2022 the selected descriptors of the final models were interpreted in the context of the overall degradation to obtain broader knowledge of the ozonation process of organic micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials a list of all chemicals including

substances including phenol and bisphenol derivates pharmaceuticals and pesticides were obtained in a standardized experimental setup the resulting removal rate constants koz thereby do not only represent the elementary reaction of dissolved ozone with a compound but is rather the sum of all possible degradation pathways within the whole process including the reaction with ozone other reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals and transformation products the dataset included almost exclusively aromatic compounds whereby phenol derivates and anilines make up more of 70 of the substances the other compounds were different substituted benzenes azabenzenes naphthalenes and benzo azoles all experiments were performed in 400 ml of a 10 µmol l micropollutant solution in ultrapure water with an initial ph of 7 in a triple determination the reaction took place in a 1 l glass bulb with a gas inlet tube including a porous frit of porosity 2 40 100 µm p100 2 5 cm robu glasfiltergeräte gmbh ozone was obtained with an ozone generator com ad 01 anseros and the gaseous ozone concentration was measured with an ozone analyzer gm 6000 pro anseros as these two are endurance test devices a bypass was included in the setup to keep the instruments at the same working mode when cleaning the reactor to ensured better stability and reproducibility of the experiment the oxygen ozone gas stream from the generator was mixed with nitrogen to reduce the ozone concentration per nm³ the resulting reaction gas flow was therefore 57 l h with an ozone concentration of 0 5

plotted against the sample time the graph was then linearly fitted between one minute up to a maximum degradation degree of 60 for each compound the average rate constant value was calculated by means of the triple determination which was then logarithmically transformed for the use as the endpoint value in the modeling process results can be found in the supplement material 2 3 qspr modeling process the conducted qspr modeling mainly followed the procedure described in depth in glienke et al 2022 all molecular descriptors were calculated with the padel descriptor software version 2 21 yap 2011 and the further modeling process with the implemented padel descriptors were carried out using qsarins software version 2 2 4 http www qsar it gramatica et al 2013 2014 2 3 1 dataset splitting for the splitting of the dataset into representative training set and validation set cdk chemistry development kit fingerprints were calculated with a length of 1024 and a search depth of 8 based on all 92 molecules they were reduced by pair wise correlation 95 and constancy 90 the dataset was then split into training set and validation set in a ratio of 4 1 based on structural properties characterized by principal component analysis pca of the cdk fingerprints 2 3 2 molecular descriptors for modeling for modeling one and bi dimensional descriptors pubchem fingerprints substructure fingerprints and substructure fingerprint counts were calculated using the software padel to reduce problems of redundant information and binary collinearity the descriptor pool was filtered for pair wise correlation greater 95 and constancy greater 90 the remaining descriptors text s6 were normalized and used for further modeling within the qsarins software the splitting into training set and validation set obtained from chapter 2 3 1 was adopted 2 3 3 model building descriptor selection and validation multiple linear regression was used as the underlying mathematical approach eq 2 tying to minimize the sum of squares of the difference between experimental endpoint and its calculated value on basis of the training set 2 y b 0 j 1 j b j x j b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b j x j u all possible descriptor combinations of 2 dependent variables were calculated before calculating higher dimensional models using genetic algorithm with q²loo the fitness function a population size of 400 100 generations per size and a mutation rate of 20 the maximum number of descriptors was set to nfeature max 13 as the number of model descriptors should not exceed 1 5 of the number of molecules in the training set ntr 75 the variable significance level was set to 0 05 and the critical quik value todeschini et al 1999 to 0 050 to filter out models with too high correlation between the model descriptors detailed information about all executed model validation methods like tests for chance correlation can be found in text s8 in the supplement material the best overall performing model was selected with the multi criteria decision making tool mcdm which calculates one value out of all previously calculated statistical values this allows to select the best performing model based on all statistical parameters rather than one criterion 3 results 3 1 experimentally derived rate constants and calculated descriptors degradation experiments by injecting ozone into aqueous pollutant solution were performed with 92 organic compounds in a standardized setup a full overview of all removal rate constants including standard variation are given in table s7 the values of the experimental rate constants for this specific experimental setup vary between 0 0005 min 1 pyridine 3 carboxamide and 0 3773 min 1 8 aminonaphthalene 1 sulfonic acid the distribution of the logarithmical rate constants is shown in fig 3 b as the data appeared near normal distributed it was seen as suitable for qspr modeling to search for potential clusters within the structural domain of the dataset the first two pca dimensions based on the 628 normalized descriptors used for the modeling process were plotted against each other fig 3 no outlier and hard clusters could be determined so the structural spectrum of the dataset was seen as homogeneous enough for modeling purposes also the splitting based on cdk fingerprints led to an even distribution of molecules within the structural spectrum to ensure the representation of different structural information in both training and validation set 3 2 qspr model 3 2 1 statistical parameters of the final qspr model based on experimental values for removal rate constants koz a qspr modeling procedure with descriptor selection and model validation was carried out as described in chapter 2 3 the best model selected via mcdm is defined by the following equation for unstandardized coefficients l o g k p r e d 0 7460 1 0073 a m r 0 6045 a a t s c 4 i 0 3934 g a t s 5 c 0 8798 s s s c h 2 1 1444 e t a b e t a n s d 1 0702 n f r i n g 0 4864 g g i 9 0 3486 p u b c h e m f p 451 0 6586 p u b c h e m f p 576 0 4049 p u b c h e m f p 643 as mathematical correctness and statistical foundation is necessary for a reliable and applicable qspr model the model was carefully analyzed and validated the coefficients standardized coefficients the confidence intervals co int 95 and the p values of the model descriptors are listed in table 1 as the ratio of the confidence interval and the descriptor coefficient is always below 1 and the respected p values are always below 0 05 the model must not be considered suspect the intercorrelation matrix of the model descriptors is shown in table s8 all binary correlation values are below the critical value of 0 7 dormann et al 2013 for multicollinearity between all model descriptors the quik test with a critical value of 0 05 has been applied during the modeling process therefore severe multicollinearity of the model descriptors can be precluded with high probability an overview of all statistical values obtained during the whole modeling process is given in table 2 the regression and residual plots are shown in fig 4 the residuals in fig 4b show the deviation of the molecules from the optimal diagonal line in the regression plot in fig 4a overall good values for the goodness of fit r² r²adj the model stability q²loo q²lmo and the predictability r²ext could be received high values for the concordance correlation coefficients ccctr and cccext additionally show a high correctness of linear regression for the training set as well as the validation set this is also supported with a low value for the lack of fit lof which points out the good regression ability of the model also the values for the y scrambling and randomization tests r²yscr q²yscr r²yrand q²yrand were much lower than the values of the final model indicating that the probability of mathematical chance correlation can be seen as low 3 2 2 applicability domain to evaluate the applicability domain of the final model both the williams plot and the insubria graph are shown in fig 5 in the former graph the diagonal hat elements are plotted against the standardized residual predictions by the model equation with a critical hat value of h 0 4400 two molecules from the training set were found as structural outliers additionally the insubria graph plots the diagonal hat elements against the predicted endpoint values this can be especially useful for external compounds outside the dataset without experimental data as the insubria plot is in no need for an experimental endpoint value and can be used for molecules for which no experimental data is available in addition to these mathematical definitions of the applicability domain the narrow chemical spectrum of the training set should be considered when applying the qspr models to external molecules as the model was developed on a dataset mostly consisting of aromatic compounds with a large portion of phenol derivates and anilines the suitability of the model therefore is limited to similar aromatic molecules with simultaneously acceptable hat values additionally the experimental background plays also a role for the applicability of qspr models as this model is based on experiments in ultrapure water an application for real wastewater is limited as matrix effects due to dissolved organic and inorganic compounds highly influence reaction kinetics and degradability a future model based on the influences of different matrices is needed to cope with that 3 2 3 additional validation and test for chance correlation in addition to the external validation to evaluate the predictability of the model equation further tests were applied leave many out lmo cross validation was carried out to evaluate the model stability fig 6 a as the results for the lmo cross validation are located around the result of the model equation with only a few exceptions the stability of the model can be seen a high as a change in the dataset by leaving 30 of the data out of the set can lead to similarly good results in a lot of iterations the stability of the model therefore is high as the model results are not strongly dependent on the entire training set the graphs for the y scrambling fig 6b and randomization fig 6c show lower values for r² q² for the test results compared to the model equation as the change of the endpoint value led to worse performing models the occurrence of mathematical chance correlation between the endpoint and the model descriptors can be seen as disproved to support these results the probability for chance correlation was calculated with permuted endpoint randomization and scrambling on the entire dataset fig s4 for the permuted endpoint randomization test the resulted p value for the probability of chance correlation for r² and q² were 0 0038 and 0 004 respectively for the random endpoint randomization test these p values were 0 0000 for r² and 0 000 for q² as all of the results were well below the widely used acceptance level of 0 05 the probability of chance correlation for the final model can be dismissed in accordance with the results of the y randomization and scrambling tests before 3 2 4 descriptor interpretation the final model selected with the mcdm tool contains 10 different model descriptors when compared with the relative frequency of the descriptors used in the best 10 overall models fig 7 seven of the final model descriptors are present in all of the 10 best models and ggi9 and aatsc4i are present in 90 and 80 of the best 10 models respectively these descriptors and their structural information can therefore be seen as highly important for calculating the experimental endpoint of this applied ozonation process the selected descriptors of the final model with a description of their background and their influence on the rate constant in ozonation are listed in table 3 due to the fact that the modeling was carried out on basis of the removal rate of the investigated compounds a mechanistical interpretation for an elementary reaction is not possible as the overall measured degradation includes many different reaction mechanisms at once this is why the performed descriptor interpretation should not be seen as a mechanistical interpretation of an elementary reaction additionally a universally valid interpretation on basis of a dataset of this size cannot be achieved nevertheless a few reliable statements can be made by looking at the interpretable model descriptors and linking them to the experimental background the descriptor amr is the molar refractivity calculated based on a group contribution method by the ghose crippen model ghose and crippen 1987 in this approach each atom is represented by one of 110 atom types fragments also including constitutive factors of the property the molar refractivity mr is then calculated using eq 3 3 m r 4 π n a α 3 m ρ n 2 1 n 2 2 with na as avogadro s number α as the polarizability m as the molecular weight ρ as the density and n as the refractive index the molar refractivity of the molecule amr then is calculated as the sum of individual group values following eq 3 the molar refractivity is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance madhuritha et al 2004 generally the polarizability of a compound is a measurement of the capability of its electronic system to be distorted by an external field and has a strong influence on the overall reactivity of the molecule watson and freeman 1963 one problem of the amr is that it can only be calculated for molecules containing c h o n s and halogens ghose and crippen 1987 therefore this qspr model cannot be applied to molecules with other heteroatoms within the model equation an increase in amr leads to a reduced reaction rate constant and therefore to a slower degradation indicating that big molecules that are easily polarised are degraded slower within the underlying dataset molecules with low normalized amr values are for example phenol and aniline table s8 as these small molecules have polar characteristics and a low polarizability due to their own dipole moment in previous studies it was also found that the polarizability of a compound is negatively correlated to the degradability by ozonation huang et al 2020 liu et al 2010 although this effect is expressed with different descriptors in other qspr models the reoccurring selection of descriptors expressing the negative effect of polarizability on the degradability by ozonation is indicating its importance and goes along with the results of this study sssch2 describes the sum of the atom type e states for the fragment ch2 this descriptor has a positive influence on the calculated endpoint the descriptor has higher values for the occurrence of multiple ch2 fragments which seems contradicting to the experimental background at first as alkanes are usually not degraded during ozonolysis the selection of this descriptor could be biased due to an anomaly of the underlying dataset as most molecules with a high value for the descriptor possess an alkyl group substituted to the aromatic ring as these substituents have a i effect on the aromatic system they tend to increase the electron density within the ring which increases the reactivity towards the electrophilic ozone molecule leading to an increased reaction rate constant lim et al 2022 it should be checked in the future with an extended dataset where the occurrence of multiple ch2 fragments is more diverse if the selection of this descriptor still applies for a broader spectrum of molecules another explanation for the selection of that descriptor is that the calculated removal rate in this study includes not only the reaction of the compound with ozone but also with hydroxyl radicals or other reactive species the former for example tends to react with alkyl groups via hydrogen abstraction leading to further degradation the descriptor eta beta ns d is an extended topological atom descriptor and a measure of lone electrons entering into resonance and therefore be capable of contributing to the formation of resonance interaction with an aromatic ring system srinivas and neharika 2021 the positive coefficient implies that heteroatoms with a lone electron pair which can contribute to the resonance of an aromatic system are beneficial for the degradation this is due to the increased electron density in the aromatic ring which will increase the reactivity towards an electrophilic substitution of ros onto the ring lim et al 2022 for aniline as an example from the dataset the lone electron pair of the nitrogen can enter the aromatic system and therefore increases its electron density this increases the reactivity of the ring towards an electrophilic substitution by ozone hydroxyl radicals and other electrophilic reactive species for 2 pyridin 2 ylpyridine this descriptor has a value of 0 indicating that the lone electron pair of the nitrogen does not contribute to the resonance of the system tekle röttering et al 2016 found similar results in their experimental study indicating that n heterocycles such as pyridine in which the nitrogen lone electron pair does not contribute to the electron density in the ring react slowly with ozone whereby pyridine mostly react through electrophilic substitution of ozone to nitrogen and not to the aromatic ring by forming an amine oxide the descriptor nfring describes the number of fused rings within a molecule it has a positive influence on the reaction rate constant therefore molecules with a higher number of fused rings tend to react faster this could be in accordance to observations on the reactivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs where it was found that the activation barrier for the diels alder cycloaddition reaction of pahs decreases with an increase in the size of the system and the number of fused rings respectively garcía rodeja et al 2016 fernández 2020 this can be explained by looking at the bond characteristics of naphthalene compared to benzene within benzene all cc bonds are the same length as they are halfway in between single and double bonds however in naphthalene as a compound with two fused aromatic rings some cc bond lengths are shorter than others indicating that some aromatic bonds have more of a single or a double bond character respectively roberts and caserio 1977 applied on the reaction with dissolved ozone the activation barrier of the cycloaddition reaction on one side of the molecule could be lower with a higher number of fused rings because some aromatic bonds have more of a double bond character therefore the cycloaddition reaction to those bonds would result in a ring opening as also proposed in different experimental studies for pahs choi and hong 2007 lundstedt et al 2017 within the dataset of this study compounds with fused rings mostly consisted of naphthalene and quinoline derivates which can be oxidized with ozone by forming aldehydes and ketones through ring opening lee et al 2017 raja and valsaraj 2005 the qspr model for the ozonation of organic micropollutants developed by sudhakaran and amy 2013 supports the theory of the importance of the double bond character as their calculated model also indicated a strong positive influence on the degradability of a compound by ozonation another study based on a dataset in which some molecules contained fused rings found that an increasing number of ring atoms also increases the degradability by ozonation due to possibly higher electron density sudhakaran et al 2012 in addition to the reaction with dissolved ozone electrophilic reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals can react with aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic compounds to form hydroxyalkyl radicals pubchemfp451 is a fingerprint for the substructure c n o regardless of their count fig 8 its occurrence decreases the removal rate constant this goes along with previous studies where formamide residues were found as prominent products for the ozonation of pyrazoles imidazoles and pyrroles tekle röttering et al 2020 tong et al 2020 also identified formamide derivates as degradation products of atmospheric organic amines with ozone this indicates that the formamide group is quite stable against the reaction with ozone and therefore might function as a dead end site for the reaction however the selection of the descriptor might be biased in this study as within the underlying dataset the occurrence of the formamide group mostly always goes along with additional stabilizing effects such as the deactivation of the molecule due to other functional groups or m effects further expansion of the dataset is needed to make sure that the selection of the fingerprint is not only because of dataset anomalies the fingerprint pubchemfp576 is based on the substructure n c c c 1 regardless of their count fig 8 its occurrence also decreases the reaction rate constant within the dataset the occurrence of this fingerprint always goes along with a nitrogen as a heteroatom within an aromatic system e g pyridine or imidazole as discussed with the descriptor eta beta ns d this leads to a decreased electron density within the ring and therefore decreases the overall reactivity of the molecule towards the reaction with ozone or other electrophilic species lim et al 2022 the last descriptor in the model equation is pubchem643 it is a fingerprint for the substructure 1 c c n 1 regardless of its count fig 8 and has a positive coefficient in the model therefore the rate constant increases with increasing fingerprint values in this dataset the occurrence of this fragment is associated with the occurrence of a primary or secondary amino group substituted onto an aromatic system as amino groups have a m effect the electron density within the aromatic system is increased which increases the reactivity for an electrophilic substitution in ortho or para configuration 3 2 5 qualitative model interpretation the obtained model and the executed descriptor interpretation can be used for a qualitative interpretation of the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants by ozonation the interpretation can be applied for example to selected bisphenol derivates to search for trends within the dataset as seen in table 4 the endpoint values increase drastically from bisphenol s to thiodiphenol with a small value for amr the later is less polarizable and smaller leading to a higher reactivity in ozonation additionally thiodiphenol contains a thioether group whose lone electron pairs can contribute to the resonance of the aromatic rings higher value for eta beta ns d increasing the reactivity towards reactive species this trend of the rate constant therefore goes along nicely with the individual descriptor interpretations however the qualitative interpretation of the trend between bisphenol s and bisphenol a is a little less trivial bisphenol a has a higher value for amr which should result in a lower rate constant than bisphenol s which is not the case this is because the lower values of the descriptors aatsc4i and gats5c make up for the higher amr value this example demonstrates that structural influences on the endpoint always must be seen as a whole when searching for qualitative trends within a dataset as some effects might work against each other overall this study showed that qpsr modeling can help to quantify the influence of the chemical structure on degradation processes by ozonation interesting aspects could be identified and connected with experimental observations by looking at some of the selected model descriptors and interpreting them within the experimental background for a qualitative interpretation all identified influences must be considered as some effects might counteract with each other even tough the ozonation of organic molecules take place via numerous different reaction pathways and through various reactive species qspr modeling can quantify structural influences on the degradability of a large pool of organic micropollutants 4 conclusions in this study a qspr model was calculated for the prediction of the removal rate constant of the ozonation of organic micropollutants the underlying experimental data was obtained in a standardized laboratory setup with defined parameters to ensure a sufficient and homogeneous quality of the kinetic values the five oecd principles for qsar qspr models were carefully respected within the modeling process the modeling process including extensive internal and external validation as well es multiple statistical quality tests were executed with the software qsarins the best final model was chosen using a multiple criteria decision making tool to find the best overall performing model by taking all calculated statistical parameters into account the selected final model contains 10 descriptors and shows good quality in regression and prediction abilities as well as robustness r² 0 8221 r²adj 0 7943 ccctr 0

modeling tests the interpretation of some selected model descriptors was carried out within the experimental background 1 the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule decreases the removal rate constant of a molecule indicating that smaller less polarizable molecules tend to be degraded faster 2 lone electrons contributing to the aromatic system seem to increase the degradability of a compound due to a higher reactivity of the aromatic ring 3 additionally the higher the number of fused rings the faster the degradation with ozonation as within fused aromatic rings some aromatic bonds have more of a double bond character which then can function as a reactive side 4 the formamide group was found as an important fingerprint for the calculation of the reaction rate constant as the occurrence of that substructure decreases the degradability of a compound indicating this functional group as a possible dead end side for the reaction appendices

15638,the increasing environmental problems due to various organic micropollutants in water cause the search of suitable additional water treatment methods gaining experimental data for the large amount and variety of pollutants would consume a lot of time as well as economic and ecologic resources an alternative approach is predictive quantitative structure property relationship qspr modeling which establishes a correlation between the structural properties of a molecules with a biological physical or chemical property therefore in this study qspr modeling has been conducted using extensive validation techniques and statistical test to investigate the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants with ozonation in contrast to most of the other studies the underlying dataset rate constants for 92 organic molecules were obtained under standardized conditions with defined experimental parameters qspr modeling was executed using a combination of the software padel for descriptor calculation and qsarins for the modeling process respecting all five oecd requirements for applicable qsar qspr models the final model was selected using a multi criteria decision making tool to evaluate the model quality based on all calculated statistical quality parameters the model included 10 selected descriptors and fingerprints and showed good regression

for example the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule and the occurrence of important substructures such as a formamide group seem to decrease the removal rate

disrupting chemicals edcs pharmaceuticals synthetic dyes pesticides and herbicides have been detected in various water samples all around the world albergamo et al 2019 vrana et al 2018 gao et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2018 additionally the possible risk to the environment and human health is a suspect of scientific research the later may include endocrine and hormonal disruption reproduction cancer diabetes obesity and the weakness of the immunological system deblonde et al 2011 the sources of these organic pollutants can be quite diverse but wastewater treatment plant effluents are considered one of the major emission sources eggen et al 2014 luo et al 2014 this is why more and more countries and regions worldwide implement different strategies to control the exposure and emission of organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment liu et al 2021b although conventional treatment technologies such as biofiltration or activated sludge systems are not typically designed to effectively remove these organic micropollutants they can help to remove large portions of biodegradable micropollutants terry and summers 2018 but due to the low biodegradability of various synthetic organic pollutants these conventional treatment methods sometimes encounter their limits in eliminating these substances completely gorito et al 2022 promising approaches specialized on the removal of organic micropollutants include advanced oxidation processes aops and ozone based technologies umar et al 2010 sillanpää et al 2018 coha et al 2021 wang and zhuan 2020 the most applied degradation and disinfection process in full scale water and wastewater treatment is ozonation umar et al 2013 liu et al 2021b the degradation of organic micropollutants with ozone based processes is mainly based on the direct oxidation by ozone o3 and the generation of hydroxyl radicals and other ros glaze et al 1987 broséus et al 2009 rekhate and srivastava 2020 the direct oxidation by dissolved ozone is selective as it reacts only with compounds with high electron density under different mechanisms such as electrophilic substitution or cycloaddition reaction described by the criegee mechanism fig 1 lim et al 2022 joseph et al 2021 the indirect oxidation with hydroxyl radicals however is non selective and can take place by electrophilic addition to an olefin or aromatic system abstraction of a hydrogen atom from carbon reaction with sulphur nitrogen or phosphorus heteroatoms and electron transfer reactions lee and von gunten 2012 ning et al 2007 umar et al 2013 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 sillanpää et al 2018 due to different degradation mechanisms occurring during ozonolysis and the different behavior of the large variety of organic micropollutants a prediction of the degradation behavior of molecules within the degradation process can be quite challenging a promising approach to cope with that problem is the calculation of mathematical models to predict the behavior of compounds on basis of their chemical structure thereby qspr quantitative structure property relationship is used to correlate a specific molecular property such as the degradation reaction rate constant with the physicochemical characteristics of the substance tropsha et al 2003 awfa et al 2021 such modeling is also suggested in the european legislation of chemicals reach european parliament 2007 another advantage of qspr modeling is the potential contribution to the understanding of reaction pathways and mechanisms by identifying important physicochemical characteristics most relevant for the specifically investigated process for the implementation of qspr models in industry and regulation the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd defined five principles that should be met by reliable and valid qspr models 1 a defined endpoint 2 an unambiguous algorithm 3 a defined domain of application 4 appropriate measures of goodness of fit robustness and predictivity and 5 a mechanistic interpretation if possible organisation for economic co operation and development 2007 gramatica 2013 the number of qspr models dealing with the degradation of organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment processes is constantly increasing awfa et al 2021 the application of qspr modeling on the degradation of organic pollutants by ozonation has been executed in previous studies beiknejad et al 2021 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2021a zhu et al 2015 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2014 ideally the defined endpoint values for the underlying dataset should be curated in standardized test protocols and experimental setups organisation for economic co operation and development 2007 eriksson et al 2003 however most qspr qsar studies on ozonation either collect their experimental data from different studies or are based on only a very small dataset additionally robust statistical analysis is not always carried out with caution awfa et al 2021 dearden et al 2009 gramatica 2020 in our study we wanted to address this gap by obtaining the experimental data for the investigated 92 organic molecules with the identical experimental setup and parameters under standardized and reproducible conditions and by applying an extensive amount of statistical methods to ensure the stability and reliability of the obtained model in contrast to most qspr studies regarding the ozonation of organic compounds we did not investigate the sole elementary reaction rate constant for the reaction with dissolved ozone but rather the overall removal rate of the pollutants as a sum of all degradation reactions occurring when ozone is injected into an aqueous pollutant solution the dataset included almost exclusively aromatic compounds with a large number being phenols and anilines although this does not mirror the broad structural diversity of all common micropollutants it allowed for a smaller structural spectrum of the dataset and therefore for a more stable modeling process the conducted qspr modeling was based on gramatica et al 2013 previously applied by glienke et al 2022 the selected descriptors of the final models were interpreted in the context of the overall degradation to obtain broader knowledge of the ozonation process of organic micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials a list of all chemicals including

ln c 0 c t k t with c0 as start concentration ct as concentration of the analyte at time t and k as the reaction rate constant to do so the values of the natural logarithm of the ratio c0 ct were plotted against the sample time the graph was then linearly fitted between one minute up to a maximum degradation degree of 60 for each compound the average rate constant value was calculated by means of the triple determination which was then logarithmically transformed for the use as the endpoint value in the modeling process results can be found in the supplement material 2 3 qspr modeling process the conducted qspr modeling mainly followed the procedure described in depth in glienke et al 2022 all molecular descriptors were calculated with the padel descriptor software version 2 21 yap 2011 and the further modeling process with the implemented padel descriptors were carried out using qsarins software version 2 2 4 http www qsar it gramatica et al 2013 2014 2 3 1 dataset splitting for the splitting of the dataset into representative training set and validation set cdk chemistry development kit fingerprints were calculated with a length of 1024 and a search depth of 8 based on all 92 molecules they were reduced by pair wise correlation 95 and constancy 90 the dataset was then split into training set and validation set in a ratio of 4 1 based on structural properties characterized by principal component analysis pca of the cdk fingerprints 2 3 2 molecular descriptors for modeling for modeling one and bi dimensional descriptors pubchem fingerprints substructure fingerprints and substructure fingerprint counts were calculated using the software padel to reduce problems of redundant information and binary collinearity the descriptor pool was filtered for pair wise correlation greater 95 and constancy greater 90 the remaining descriptors text s6 were normalized and used for further modeling within the qsarins software the splitting into training set and validation set obtained from chapter 2 3 1 was adopted 2 3 3 model building descriptor selection and validation multiple linear regression was used as the underlying mathematical approach eq 2 tying to minimize the sum of squares of the difference between experimental endpoint and its calculated value on basis of the training set 2 y b 0 j 1 j b j x j b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b j x j u all possible descriptor combinations of 2 dependent variables were calculated before calculating higher dimensional models using genetic algorithm with q²loo the fitness function a population size of 400 100 generations per size and a mutation rate of 20 the maximum number of descriptors was set to nfeature max 13 as the number of model descriptors should not exceed 1 5 of the number of molecules in the training set ntr 75 the variable significance level was set to 0 05 and the critical quik value todeschini et al 1999 to 0 050 to filter out models with too high correlation between the model descriptors detailed information about all executed model validation methods like tests for chance correlation can be found in text s8 in the supplement material the best overall performing model was selected with the multi criteria decision making tool mcdm which calculates one value out of all previously calculated statistical values this allows to select the best performing model based on all statistical parameters rather than one criterion 3 results 3 1 experimentally derived rate constants and calculated descriptors degradation experiments by injecting ozone into aqueous pollutant solution were performed with 92 organic compounds in a standardized setup a full overview of all removal rate constants including standard variation are given in table s7 the values of the experimental rate constants for this specific experimental setup vary between 0 0005 min 1 pyridine 3 carboxamide and 0 3773 min 1 8 aminonaphthalene 1 sulfonic acid the distribution of the logarithmical rate constants is shown in fig 3 b as the data appeared near normal distributed it was seen as suitable for qspr modeling to search for potential clusters within the structural domain of the dataset the first two pca dimensions based on the 628 normalized descriptors used for the modeling process were plotted against each other fig 3 no outlier and hard clusters could be determined so the structural spectrum of the dataset was seen as homogeneous enough for modeling purposes also the splitting based on cdk fingerprints led to an even distribution of molecules within the structural spectrum to ensure the representation of different structural information in both training and validation set 3 2 qspr model 3 2 1 statistical parameters of the final qspr model based on experimental values for removal rate constants koz a qspr modeling procedure with descriptor selection and model validation was carried out as described in chapter 2 3 the best model selected via mcdm is defined by the following equation for unstandardized coefficients l o g k p r e d 0 7460 1 0073 a m r 0 6045 a a t s c 4 i 0 3934 g a t s 5 c 0 8798 s s s c h 2 1 1444 e t a b e t a n s d 1 0702 n f r i n g 0

qspr model the model was carefully analyzed and validated the coefficients standardized coefficients the confidence intervals co int 95 and the p values of the model descriptors are listed in table 1 as the ratio of the confidence interval and the descriptor coefficient is always below 1 and the respected p values are always below 0 05 the model must not be considered suspect the intercorrelation matrix of the model descriptors is shown in table s8 all binary correlation values are below the critical value of 0 7 dormann et al 2013 for multicollinearity between all model descriptors the quik test with a critical value of 0 05 has been applied during the modeling process therefore severe multicollinearity of the model descriptors can be precluded with high probability an overview of all statistical values obtained during the whole modeling process is given in table 2 the regression and residual plots are shown in fig 4 the residuals in fig 4b show the deviation of the molecules from the optimal diagonal line in the regression plot in fig 4a overall good values for the goodness of fit r² r²adj the model stability q²loo q²lmo and the predictability r²ext could be received high values for the concordance correlation coefficients ccctr and cccext additionally show a high correctness of linear regression for the training set as well as the validation set this is also supported with a low value for the lack of fit lof which points out the good regression ability of the model also the values for the y scrambling and randomization tests r²yscr q²yscr r²yrand q²yrand were much lower than the values of the final model indicating that the probability of mathematical chance correlation can be seen as low 3 2 2 applicability domain to evaluate the applicability domain of the final model both the williams plot and the insubria graph are shown in fig 5 in the former graph the diagonal hat elements are plotted against the standardized residual predictions by the model equation with a critical hat value of h 0 4400 two molecules from the training set were found as structural outliers additionally the insubria graph plots the diagonal hat elements against the predicted endpoint values this can be especially useful for external compounds outside the dataset without experimental data as the insubria plot is in no need for an experimental endpoint value and can be used for molecules for which no experimental data is available in addition to these mathematical definitions of the applicability domain the narrow chemical spectrum of the training set should be considered when applying the qspr models to external molecules as the model was developed on a dataset mostly consisting of aromatic compounds with a large portion of phenol derivates and anilines the suitability of the model therefore is limited to similar aromatic molecules with simultaneously acceptable hat values additionally the experimental background plays also a role for the applicability of qspr models as this model is based on experiments in ultrapure water an application for real wastewater is limited as matrix effects due to dissolved organic and inorganic compounds highly influence reaction kinetics and degradability a future model based on the influences of different matrices is needed to cope with that 3 2 3 additional validation and test for chance correlation in addition to the external validation to evaluate the predictability of the model equation further tests were applied leave many out lmo cross validation was carried out to evaluate the model stability fig 6 a as the results for the lmo cross validation are located around the result of the model equation with only a few exceptions the stability of the model can be seen a high as a change in the dataset by leaving 30 of the data out of the set can lead to similarly good results in a lot of iterations the stability of the model therefore is high as the model results are not strongly dependent on the entire training set the graphs for the y scrambling fig 6b and randomization fig 6c show lower values for r² q² for the test results compared to the model equation as the change of the endpoint value led to worse performing models the occurrence of mathematical chance correlation between the endpoint and the model descriptors can be seen as disproved to support these results the probability for chance correlation was calculated with permuted endpoint randomization and scrambling on the entire dataset fig s4 for the permuted endpoint randomization test the resulted p value for the probability of chance correlation for r² and q² were 0 0038 and 0 004 respectively for the random endpoint randomization test these p values were 0 0000 for r² and 0 000 for q² as all of the results were well below the widely used acceptance level of 0 05 the probability of chance correlation for the final model can be dismissed in accordance with the results of the y randomization and scrambling tests before 3 2 4 descriptor interpretation the final model selected with the mcdm tool contains 10 different model descriptors when compared with the relative frequency of the descriptors used in the best 10 overall models fig 7 seven of the final model descriptors are present in all of the 10 best models and ggi9 and aatsc4i are present in 90 and 80 of the best 10 models respectively these descriptors and their structural information can therefore be seen as highly important for calculating the experimental endpoint of this applied ozonation process the selected descriptors of the final model with a description of their background and their influence on the rate constant in ozonation are listed in table 3 due to the fact that the modeling was carried out on basis of the removal rate of the investigated compounds a mechanistical interpretation for an elementary reaction is not possible as the overall measured degradation includes many different reaction mechanisms at once this is why the performed descriptor interpretation should not be seen as a mechanistical interpretation of an elementary reaction additionally a universally valid interpretation on basis of a dataset of this size cannot be achieved nevertheless a few reliable statements can be made by looking at the interpretable model descriptors and linking them to the experimental background the descriptor amr is the molar refractivity calculated based on a group contribution method by the ghose crippen model ghose and crippen 1987 in this approach each atom is represented by one of 110 atom types fragments also including constitutive factors of the property the molar refractivity mr is then calculated using eq 3 3 m r 4 π n a α 3 m ρ n 2 1 n 2 2 with na as avogadro s number α as the polarizability m as the molecular weight ρ as the density and n as the refractive index the molar refractivity of the molecule amr then is calculated as the sum of individual group values following eq 3 the molar refractivity is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance madhuritha et al 2004 generally the polarizability of a compound is a measurement of the capability of its electronic system to be distorted by an external field and has a strong influence on the overall reactivity of the molecule watson and freeman 1963 one problem of the amr is that it can only be calculated for molecules containing c h o n s and halogens ghose and crippen 1987 therefore this qspr model cannot be applied to molecules with other heteroatoms within the model equation an increase in amr leads to a reduced reaction rate constant and therefore to a slower degradation indicating that big molecules that are easily polarised are degraded slower within the underlying dataset molecules with low normalized amr values are for example phenol and aniline table s8 as these small molecules have polar characteristics and a low polarizability due to their own dipole moment in previous studies it was also found that the polarizability of a compound is negatively correlated to the degradability by ozonation huang et al 2020 liu et al 2010 although this effect is expressed with different descriptors in other qspr models the reoccurring selection of descriptors expressing the negative effect of polarizability on the degradability by ozonation is indicating its importance and goes along with the results of this study sssch2 describes the sum of the atom type e states for the fragment ch2 this descriptor has a positive influence on the calculated endpoint the descriptor has higher values for the occurrence of multiple ch2 fragments which seems contradicting to the experimental background at first as alkanes are usually not degraded during ozonolysis the selection of this descriptor could be biased due to an anomaly of the underlying dataset as most molecules with a high value for the descriptor possess an alkyl group substituted to the aromatic ring as these substituents have a i effect on the aromatic system they tend to increase the electron density within the ring which increases the reactivity towards the electrophilic ozone molecule leading to an increased reaction rate constant lim et al 2022 it should be checked in the future with an extended dataset where the occurrence of multiple ch2 fragments is more diverse if the selection of this descriptor still applies for a broader spectrum of molecules another explanation for the selection of that descriptor is that the calculated removal rate in this study includes not only the reaction of the compound with ozone but also with hydroxyl radicals or other reactive species the former for example tends to react with alkyl groups via hydrogen abstraction leading to further degradation the descriptor eta beta ns d is an extended topological atom descriptor and a measure of lone electrons entering into resonance and therefore be capable of contributing to the formation of resonance interaction with an aromatic ring system srinivas and neharika 2021 the positive coefficient implies that heteroatoms with a lone electron pair which can contribute to the resonance of an aromatic system are beneficial for the degradation this is due to the increased electron density in the aromatic ring which will increase the reactivity towards an electrophilic substitution of ros onto the ring lim et al 2022 for aniline as an example from the dataset the lone electron pair of the nitrogen can enter the aromatic system and therefore increases its electron density this increases the reactivity of the ring towards an electrophilic substitution by ozone hydroxyl radicals and other electrophilic reactive species for 2 pyridin 2 ylpyridine this descriptor has a value of 0 indicating that the lone electron pair of the nitrogen does not contribute to the resonance of the system tekle röttering et al 2016 found similar results in their experimental study indicating that n heterocycles such as pyridine in which the nitrogen lone electron pair does not contribute to the electron density in the ring react slowly with ozone whereby pyridine mostly react through electrophilic substitution of ozone to nitrogen and not to the aromatic ring by forming an amine oxide the descriptor nfring describes the number of fused rings within a molecule it has a positive influence on the reaction rate constant therefore molecules with a higher number of fused rings tend to react faster this could be in accordance to observations on the reactivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs where it was found that the activation barrier for the diels alder cycloaddition reaction of pahs decreases with an increase in the size of the system and the number of fused rings respectively garcía rodeja et al 2016 fernández 2020 this can be explained by looking at the bond characteristics of naphthalene compared to benzene within benzene all cc bonds are the same length as they are halfway in between single and double bonds however in naphthalene as a compound with two fused aromatic rings some cc bond lengths are shorter than others indicating that some aromatic bonds have more of a single or a double bond character respectively roberts and caserio 1977 applied on the reaction with dissolved ozone the activation barrier of the cycloaddition reaction on one side of the molecule could be lower with a higher number of fused rings because some aromatic bonds have more of a double bond character therefore the cycloaddition reaction to those bonds would result in a ring opening as also proposed in different experimental studies for pahs choi and hong 2007 lundstedt et al 2017 within the dataset of this study compounds with fused rings mostly consisted of naphthalene and quinoline derivates which can be oxidized with ozone by forming aldehydes and ketones through ring opening lee et al 2017 raja and valsaraj 2005 the qspr model for the ozonation of organic micropollutants developed by sudhakaran and amy 2013 supports the theory of the importance of the double bond character as their calculated model also indicated a strong positive influence on the degradability of a compound by ozonation another study based on a dataset in which some molecules contained fused rings found that an increasing number of ring atoms also increases the degradability by ozonation due to possibly higher electron density sudhakaran et al 2012 in addition to the reaction with dissolved ozone electrophilic reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals can react with aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic compounds to form hydroxyalkyl radicals pubchemfp451 is a fingerprint for the substructure c n o regardless of their count fig 8 its occurrence decreases the removal rate constant this goes along with previous studies where formamide residues were found as prominent products for the ozonation of pyrazoles imidazoles and pyrroles tekle röttering et al 2020 tong et al 2020 also identified formamide derivates as degradation products of atmospheric organic amines with ozone this indicates that the formamide group is quite stable against the reaction with ozone and therefore might function as a dead end site for the reaction however the selection of the descriptor might be biased in this study as within the underlying dataset the occurrence of the formamide group mostly always goes along with additional stabilizing effects such as the deactivation of the molecule due to other functional groups or m effects further expansion of the dataset is needed to make sure that the selection of the fingerprint is not only because of dataset anomalies the fingerprint pubchemfp576 is based on the substructure n c c c 1 regardless of their count fig 8 its occurrence also decreases the reaction rate constant within the dataset the occurrence of this fingerprint always goes along with a nitrogen as a heteroatom within an aromatic system e g pyridine or imidazole as discussed with the descriptor eta beta ns d this leads to a decreased electron density within the ring and therefore decreases the overall reactivity of the molecule towards the reaction with ozone or other electrophilic species lim et al 2022 the last descriptor in the model equation is pubchem643 it is a fingerprint for the substructure 1 c c n 1 regardless of its count fig 8 and has a positive coefficient in the model therefore the rate constant increases with increasing fingerprint values in this dataset the occurrence of this fragment is associated with the occurrence of a primary or secondary amino group substituted onto an aromatic system as amino groups have a m effect the electron density within the aromatic system is increased which increases the reactivity for an electrophilic substitution in ortho or para configuration 3 2 5 qualitative model interpretation the obtained model and the executed descriptor interpretation can be used for a qualitative interpretation of the structural influence on the degradability of organic micropollutants by ozonation the interpretation can be applied for example to selected bisphenol derivates to search for trends within the dataset as seen in table 4 the endpoint values increase drastically from bisphenol s to thiodiphenol with a small value for amr the later is less polarizable and smaller leading to a higher reactivity in ozonation additionally thiodiphenol contains a thioether group whose lone electron pairs can contribute to the resonance of the aromatic rings higher value for eta beta ns d increasing the reactivity towards reactive species this trend of the rate constant therefore goes along nicely with the individual descriptor interpretations however the qualitative interpretation of the trend between bisphenol s and bisphenol a is a little less trivial bisphenol a has a higher value for amr which should result in a lower rate constant than bisphenol s which is not the case this is because the lower values of the descriptors aatsc4i and gats5c make up for the higher amr value this example demonstrates that structural influences on the endpoint always must be seen as a whole when searching for qualitative trends within a dataset as some effects might work against each other overall this study showed that qpsr modeling can help to quantify the influence of the chemical structure on degradation processes by ozonation interesting aspects could be identified and connected with experimental observations by looking at some of the selected model descriptors and interpreting them within the experimental background for a qualitative interpretation all identified influences must be considered as some effects might counteract with each other even tough the ozonation of organic molecules take place via numerous different reaction pathways and through various reactive species qspr modeling can quantify structural influences on the degradability of a large pool of organic micropollutants 4 conclusions in this study a qspr model was calculated for the prediction of the removal rate constant of the ozonation of organic micropollutants the underlying experimental data was obtained in a standardized laboratory setup with defined parameters to ensure a sufficient and homogeneous quality of the kinetic values the five oecd principles for qsar qspr models were carefully respected within the modeling process the modeling process including extensive internal and external validation as well es multiple statistical quality tests were executed with the software qsarins the best final model was chosen using a multiple criteria decision making tool to find the best overall performing model by taking all calculated statistical parameters into account the selected final model contains 10 descriptors and shows good quality in regression and prediction abilities as well as robustness r² 0 8221 r²adj 0 7943 ccctr 0

modeling tests the interpretation of some selected model descriptors was carried out within the experimental background 1 the molar refractivity as a measure of size and polarizability of a molecule decreases the removal rate constant of a molecule indicating that smaller less polarizable molecules tend to be degraded faster 2 lone electrons contributing to the aromatic system seem to increase the degradability of a compound due to a higher reactivity of the aromatic ring 3 additionally the higher the number of fused rings the faster the degradation with ozonation as within fused aromatic rings some aromatic bonds have more of a double bond character which then can function as a reactive side 4 the formamide group was found as an important fingerprint for the calculation of the reaction rate constant as the occurrence of that substructure decreases the degradability of a compound indicating this functional group as a possible dead end side for the reaction appendices

15639,cyanobacterial blooms appear more strongly constantly and globally yet the positive effect of surface solar ultraviolet radiation uv on cyanobacterial bloom in natural freshwater habitats is largely ignored here in situ and laboratory studies were jointly designed to probe the mechanism of cyanobacterial bloom promoted by solar uv light the results showed that solar uv light is a key trigger factor for the accumulation of total phosphorus dissolved inorganic phosphorus and polyphosphate polyp in blooming cyanobacterial cells the increase of uv dose induces polyp accumulation to result in the excessive phosphorus uptake of blooming cyanobacteria which provides sufficient phosphorus for cyanobacterial growth in suitable environment solar uv light also can promote the contents of phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin producing sufficient atp by photosynthesis for polyp synthesis in cyanobacterial cells in lake enviroment the frequent variations of uv irradiance exposure prompts cyanobacteria to absorb excessive phosphorus from suspended solid or sediment cyanobacterial intracellular phosphorus is accumulated for their growth uv light promotes polyp accumulation in blooming cyanobacterial cells to avoid damage the adsorption amount of phosphorus increases for exuberant growth and then more surface blooming cyanobacteria are exposed to uv light to absorb ample phosphorus thus the positive feedback occurs in lake water bodies with abundant phosphorus this amplified cycle of cyanobacterial density and phosphorus due to solar uv light in eutrophic water bodies is analogous to a triode to amplify visible photosynthesis by uv light as a base electric current in the energy flow process in lake environment therefore cyanobacterial phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect is used to describe this phenomenon a new explanation is provided for the continuing proliferating mechanism of cyanobacterial bloom besides a new perspective appears on the outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms in natural eutrophic lake water bodies worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar ultraviolet radiation polyphosphate phosphorus phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect cyanobacterial bloom data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are currently ravaging on global scale posing grave threats to both public health and aquatic ecosystems brooks et al 2016 the ongoing global warming and escalating anthropogenic activities cause more frequent intense and persistent cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 the evolving capacities of cyanobacteria including high temperature tolerance low nutrient tolerance and the formation of aggregates to withstand adverse conditions and so on give them dominance in various waters in particular buoyancy regulators gas vesicles make cyanobacteria a competitive winner in nutrient limited waters under solar light exposure via regulating their depth in water column zou et al 2022 unfortunately blooming cyanobacteria always accompanied by more intense ultraviolet uv light exposure because they float on the water surface uv radiation has long been considered as a restriction factor for cyanobacterial growth and expansion in most case mloszewska et al 2018 high intensity uv radiation may increase of the risk of cyanobacterial physiological structure damage at both the molecular and cellular levels yang et al 2015 the majority of cyanobacterial blooms on global scale occur in the summer along with intense uv radiation the ultraviolet radiation b intensity uvb 280 320 nm is 1 5 2 0 w m 2 and ultraviolet radiation a intensity is 50 60 w m 2 uva 320 400 nm under very clear skies at temperate to equatorial latitudes castenholz 1997 the cyanobacterial blooms occurred increase in lakes at mid low latitudes and equator regions where the elevation in uv irradiance is normally detected carey et al 2012a this observation is aligned with other studies as was observed that increasing cyanobacteria exist in enhanced surface solar uv radiation induced by the more serious ozone hole even surviving under high uv radiation ehling schulz and scherer 1999 there should be a protection mechanism that cyanobacteria have against high uv intensity therefore it is required more extensive ecosystem effect of uv light on anomalous lacustrine cyanobacterial blooms should be explained evolving cyanobacteria have diversified strategies to adapt to uv radiation mainly comprising avoidance responses to escape high uvb radiation in different water depth cyanobacteria can also synthesis uv absorbing compounds such as mycosporine like amino acids and from efficient repair systems for uv induced damage ehling schulz and scherer 1999 donkor and häner 1995 in addition the synthesized cyanobacterial intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides induced by uv light improve their uv resistance ehling schulz et al 1997 cyanobacteria in motion form large colonies to effectively shade their internal structure from uv damage huisman et al 2018 however there are new links between solar uv radiation and surface cyanobacterial blooms in various water bodies the longstanding focus on damage of high intensity uv radiation to cyanobacteria the constant variation in uv radiation for cyanobacteria has been ignored due to vertical migration or fluctuations of cyanobacteria and the low intensity solar uv radiation because of latitude and longitude geographical position cloud cover and ozone content yang et al 2015 ehling schulz and scherer 1999 xu and gao 2009 thus an over amplification of the adverse uv effects might appear in natural water environment ren et al 2020 found that ambient uv radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on microcystis aeruginosa and high phosphorus availability could alleviate or eliminate the negative effects of uv radiation on cyanobacteria consequently uv adaptation processes of cyanobacteria resulted in an elevated demand for phosphorus which resulted in increased phosphorus uptake rates what s more some microbes have been shown to accumulate abundant phosphorus in the form of polyphosphate polyp granules even in waters where phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations are very lower chen et al 2022 ou et al 2019 polyp a polymer of phosphate of varying lengths usually acts as a temporary reservoir of phosphate pi in the cell and has been identified in all kingdoms of life rao et al 2009 achbergerová and nahálka 2011 the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of polyp in bacteria is polyphosphate kinase ppk ppk synthesizes polyp by transferring the terminal phosphate of atp to polyp seufferheld et al 2008 polyp plays an important role in microbial adaptation to extreme environments e g high temperature high uv radiation seufferheld et al 2008 in lacustrine cyanobacteria blooming the action of polyp involved in p cycle might be associated with decrease of damage of uv light in this study in situ and laboratory experiments were jointly designed to answer the following questions in freshwater lakes worldwide 1 do cyanobacteria excessively uptake phosphorus as a result of polyp accumulation in uv adaption process 2 is cyanobacteria blooming due to the increased phosphorus utilization capacity triggered by solar uv light our study provides new insight into the mechanism of the continuous outbreak of cyanobacterial bloom in lakes and eventually the prevention and control of cyanobacterial blooms 2 materials and methods to explore the effect of solar uv light on improving intracellular polyp accumulation and growth of cyanobacteria the polyp content of natural microcystis colonies from lakes was first determined under different solar uv exposure doses in lakes with different water depths in situ then according to the actual effective uv dose received by cyanobacteria in the natural lakes during summer we simulated that increasing uv radiation promotes polyp accumulation in microcystis and thus prompts cyanobacterial growth in the simulated environment in an additional laboratory experiment we investigated the rapid cyanobacterial growth caused by the intracellular polyp accumulation due to exposure to uv radiation during their vertical migration in the water columns 2 1 source of cyanobacterial materials natural microcystis colonies samples were collected from different lakes lake taihu and lake guchenghu in jiangsu province and lake chaohu in anhui province of china before the experiments these samples were first filtered through a 250 μm sieve to select cyanobacterial colonies the filtered cyanobacterial colonies were stored under continuous light of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 at 30 c microscopic observations of these collected cyanobacterial scum samples revealed that the numbers of microcystis were more than 99 81 of the total phytoplankton the main species were microcystis viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii while zooplankton was rarely found the planktonic cyanobacterium m aeruginosa an unicellular cyanobacterium was chosen as the model organism due to its widespread existence in these different lakes m aeruginosa was originally obtained from lake taihu m aeruginosa cells were cultured at 25 c under 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 of photosynthetically active radiation par with cool white fluorescent lamps light dark regime of 12 h 12 h in bg11 medium bg11 medium buffered at ph 7 0 contained 22 6 μm 0 7 mg p l 1 phosphate flasks were shaken three times per day to prevent the cyanobacterial cells from adhering to inner walls and the position of flasks was exchanged randomly to ensure uniform light exposure a two week culture cell density exceeding 4 2 108 cells l 1 was harvested by centrifugation washed twice with ultrapure water and resuspended in fresh phosphorus free bg11 medium to give the same cell density this culture was incubated for an additional period of 8 days under the above culture conditions 2 2 field and laboratory experiments 2 2 1 effects of solar uv radiation on contents of different forms of intracellular phosphorus in natural microcystis colonies in field experiments to assess the effect of solar uv radiation exposure dose on polyp accumulation of natural blooming cyanobacteria 25 ml high density natural microcystis colonies 4 97 107 cells l 1 from wild habitats were exposed to solar uv radiation for 1 h at different water depths of 0 cm 10 cm and 20 cm with 0 45 μm nylon mesh 12 cm 12 cm in an open water region in lake chaohu st1 lake guchenhu st2 and lake taihu st3 with different nutrients levels on a sunny day fig 1 moreover other subsamples were exposed to solar uv radiation on the water surface for 1 h and then replaced at 10 cm of water depth for 1 h again the corresponding sets of samples were exposed to solar uv radiation on the water surface layer for 1 h and then replaced them at 10 cm of water depth for 1 h and finally placed on the water surface for another 1 h to explore the changes of cyanobacterial intracellular polyp contents at different uv exposure dose with different water depth in those lakes three replicates were conducted in each treatment the aqueous total phosphorus tp concentrations were 0 084 0 050 and 0 158 mg l 1 at experiments sites in lake chaohu st1 lake guchenghu st2 and lake taihu st3 respectively while the aqueous pi contents available for direct uptake by cyanobacteria were 0 023 0 012 and 0 041 mg l 1 in these three lakes respectively the aqueous dissolved total phosphorus dtp contents were 0 052 0 042 and 0 086 mg l 1 in these three lakes respectively all the in situ tests were carried out in summer when the lake water temperature was above 30 c and the solar uv radiation intensity reaching the water surface among 20 30 w m 2 the uv radiation intensities were reduced with increasing water depth due to the distinct transparency and cyanobacterial densities in these three lakes table s1 2 2 2 effects of uv radiation on phosphorus absorption of m aeruginosa in laboratory experiments two sets of experiments with different uv exposure doses were designed to ascertain the effect of uv irradiation on the phosphorus absorption of m

induces polyp accumulation of blooming cyanobacteria in three lakes surface blooming cyanobacterial colonies inevitably receive greater uv radiation than the subsurface ones due to the light attenuatio mloszewska et al 2018 erikson 1933 cyanobacterial colonies were placed at different water depths of 0 10 and 20 cm with distinct uv radiation to simulate cyanobacterial vertical distribution in lake chaohu lake guchenghu and lake taihu with different eutrophic levels uv radiation promotes contents of polyp pi and tp in the surface blooming cyanobacterial colonies than that in subsurface blooming cyanobacterial colonies at water depths of 10 cm or 20 cm after 1 h solar uv light exposure in three lakes fig 2 we repeatedly alternately placed the cyanobacteria samples on the surface and the subsurface of a 10 cm water depth for 1 h each time the results showed that the high solar uv radiation dose with radiation time extension apparently promoted the contents of pi polyp and tp in blooming cyanobacteria fig 3 thus these in situ results confirmed that uv radiation stimulated the cyanobacterial phosphorus uptake and polyp accumulation in lake water bodies m aeruginosa is the dominant bloom forming species in lake taihu lake chaohu and lake guchenghu zeng et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 we employed m aeruginosa as a model cyanobacterium to verify the results of in situ studies only with the variable uv light in contrast the intracellular contents of polyp pi and tp in m aeruginosa under different uv and par exposure doses were substantially larger than those under only par exposure furthermore the accumulation amounts of different forms of phosphorus in m aeruginosa increased with increase of the uv radiation time fig 4 which showed the high consistency with the observed changes in polyp pi and tp in natural blooming cyanobacterial colonies in situ lake experiments in light of this validation uv light is undisputed as a key driver improving intracellular polyp pi and tp accumulations of cyanobacteria phosphorus is regarded as a critical biogenic ingredient in aquatic ecosystems and a plausible candidate to explain ongoing cyanobacterial blooms in manifold waters toothman et al 2009 chuai et al 2011 among other things pi is the only form of phosphorus that can be directly absorbed and utilized by cyanobacteria martin 1975 which is integral to metabolic processes as a functional component of many molecules in the cell including nucleic acids phospholipids phosphoproteins and metabolites related to most catabolic and anabolic pathways and signaling molecules sanz luque et al 2020 because uv radiation impacted cyanobacterial intracellular phosphorus content thus uv radiation affects the nutrients utilization behavior and the elemental composition of cyanobacterial cells carrillo et al 2015 ihnacik et al 2014 sereda et al 2011 demonstrated that uv radiation greatly reduced planktonic phosphorus acquisition and then exacerbated the phosphorus limitation for algal growth in oligotrophic systems thus uv radiation could change intracellular phosphorus contents however shelly 2010 and hessen 1997 found that uv exposure remarkably increased phosphorus uptake of some algal species to balance between damage and repair processes of cells which showed a strong distinction with the results of sereda 2011 according to a study by ren et al 2020 the phosphorus utilization behavior of m aeruginosa could have a great increase after short term uv radiation m aeruginosa had uv adaptation capability which could depended on phosphorus availability in the culture medium the uv light promoted pi and tp accumulation in cyanobacterial cells thus uv light controlled intracellular phosphorus utilization because uv light directly affected the metabolism and growth of cyanobacteria polyp is a linear polymer consisting of dozens to hundreds of phosphate residues linked by a high energy phosphoanhydride bond and is mainly stored in acidocalcisome its synthesis and accumulation appeared to impact a myriad of cellular functions jahid et al 2006 the polyp accumulation appeared at very high intracellular concentrations in microbes under various environmental pressures such as high temperature and low redox habitats especially under stress conditions if pi was abundant rao 2009 shi et al 2007 polyp had the dual roles of uv absorption bennoson and williams 1972 and uv resistance through binding to nucleic acids and proteins to protect them from damage kornberg et al 1999 cyanobacteria exposed to uv light would accumulate a certain amount of polyp importantly polyp synthesis inevitably induced a decline in intracellular pi content in cyanobacteria then cyanobacterial cells absorbed more extracellular phosphorus to ensure polyp synthesis because polyp synthesis was a bidirectional dynamic process and finally increasing the intracellular tp content the cyanobacterial pi and tp contents increased due to rapid polyp accumulation under uv light thus uv light induces blooming cyanobacterial polyp accumulation to could promote excessive phosphorus uptake from natural water accumulated polyp under uv light enhances the uv resistance of cyanobacteria and provides sufficient nutrients for cyanobacterial growth if they move to the non pressure of uv environment 3 2 polyp accumulated under solar uv light promotes cyanobacterial growth cyanobacterial intracellular polyp accumulation ascribed to uv radiation in situ lake experiment and laboratory experiments provides a substantial material basis for cyanobacterial growth and diffusion fig s1 on account of this it is worth paying even more attention to the relationship between uv radiation and cyanobacterial density under the action of polyp as a medium uv radiation has long been considered as a restriction factor for cyanobacterial growth and expansion mloszewska et al 2018 extensive studies have been conducted to better understand the mechanisms of the complex impacts of uv radiation on cyanobacteria xu and gao 2009 high uv radiation adversely affects cyanobacterial physiological structures cyanobacterial photosynthesis activity and cell viability yang et al 2015 uv radiation could damage the photosynthetic apparatus in many kinds of algae wulff et al 2007 the effects of prolonged or enhanced uv radiation were investigated especially for phytoinduced damages attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion and other factors häder et al 2014 poll et al 2010 this was also the case in our study high uv radiation inhibited the synthesis of photosynthetic pigment chl a and phycobilin of m aeruginosa figs s2 and s3 and caused oxidative stress fig s4 to inhibit cyanobacterial growth the fv fm and etrmax representing the efficiency of photosynthesis of m aeruginosa were inhibited at high dose of uv radiation fig s5 blooming cyanobacteria in natural lake water bodies have evolved various strategies to alleviate photoinduced damage or promote self repair in the face of prolonged exposure stress to high doses of uv radiation häder et al 2011 for example cyanobacteria can synthesize humus like matter wang et al 2012 polysaccharides fig s6 ehling schulz and scherer 1999 and mycosporine like amino acids to improve the anti uv ability donkor and häner 1995 cyanobacteria regulate their phycobilin contents in real time according to light intensity and light quality rómulo et al 2006 which constitute nearly half of the soluble proteins in cyanobacterial cells and contribute much absorption of uvb to resist uv harm richa et al 2015 wang et al 2012 furthermore the ambient uv radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on cyanobacteria and the increased synthesis of antioxidizes and photosynthetic pigments makes cyanobacteria have a better adaptation under uv stress and decrease negative effects of uv radiation on its growth ren et al 2020 besides phycobilins effectively funnel light energy to the underlying psii reaction centers krauspe et al 2021 and high phycobilin contents are conducive to dramatically increasing cyanobacterial light usage efficiency in natural water bodies zhang et al 2013 thus the increases in phycobilin contents can transfer more energy to psii rcs at strong dose of uv light mccluskey et al 2002 in our study the phycobilin biosynthesis increase in m aeruginosa exposed to uv radiation fig 5 which can be responsible for the increase of atp amount fig 6 because atp is involved in transporting electrons producing proteins synthesizing pigments and other processes shelly 2005 overall the upregulations of the pc ac and pe contents promote the transformation of sufficient energy in the form of atp in m aeruginosa in natural water body and then atp is used for polyp synthesis with the regulation of the ppk1 gene expression increased fig s7 and for biological activities to promote the growth of m aeruginosa previous studies so far paid more attention on the effect of high intensity uv radiation on cyanobacteria as a long term static process mloszewska et al 2018 yang et al 2015 causing the excessive amplification of uv adverse effects in the present study the uv radiation dose of lower than 60 kj m 2 promoted cyanobacterial growth along with intracellular polyp accumulation and phycobilin concentration upregulation fig 7 b and 7c thus low dose uv radiation did not inhibit cyanobacterial growth but promote cyanobacterial growth by stimulating cyanobacterial polyp formation and phycobilin improvement m aeruginosa as a model species is used to investigate the cyanobacterial growth under variable uv intensity associated with the nonnegligible vertical cyanobacterial migration by the end of the experiment the density of m aeruginosa was unanimously lower under static culture than that under vertical migration culture at high intensity uv radiation fig 8 a and 8b thus cyanobacterial vertical migration both makes them to avoid constant high intensity uv radiation exposure and prompts them to grow rapidly after accumulating polyp under short term high dose solar uv radiation this intermittent solar uv light exposure due to cyanobacterial vertical migration can be beneficial for cyanobacterial bloom the density of m aeruginosa under static culture was higher than that under vertical migration culture at low intensity uv radiation fig 8c the high achieved uv exposure dose improves cyanobacterial growth at low intensity uv radiation thus solar uv light has the overlooked potential to stimulate cyanobacterial growth and magnify an expansive cyanobacterial response in lake water body and polyp synthesis of cyanobacteria plays a key role in this process 3 3 mechanism of uv light amplifying cyanobacterial growth cyanobacteria are likely endowed with a highly efficient mechanism to amplify the positive effect of visible photosynthesis on cyanobacteria proliferation under uv light in the present study uv light stimulates cyanobacteria to synthesize phycobilins and chl a and then promotes the synthesis of atp which provides substrates for intracellular polyp accumulation in cyanobacteria uv light triggers cyanobacterial polyp accumulation directly as a stress response to protect cyanobacterial cells in adverse environment furthermore the rapid accumulation of intracellular polyp can decrease intracellular phosphate content of cyanobacteria and then cyanobacteria uptake excessive phosphorus this excessive phosphorus is used to favor cyanobacteria proliferation if cyanobacteria are in suitable environment therefore the positive feedback that uv light promotes polyp accumulation and even more intracellular accumulated phosphorus is used for cyanobacteria proliferation in water bodies with abundant nutrients will be continuously amplified with the vertical migration of cyanobacteria between water surface and underwater this process is analogous to a triode to amplify cyanobacterial visible photosynthesis by uv light as a base electric current in the energy flow process in lake bodies the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus projected in the eutrophic water body plays a continuous accelerating role in the cyanobacterial growth under low dose uv radiation which can be called the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect fig 9 the amplified cycle will collapse if the solar energy support is insufficient on rainy or cloudy days previous studies from static culture demonstrated the sensitivity of phytoplankton to ambient uv in natural environment häder et al 2014 but they did not necessarily quantify the effects of uv on photosynthesis in situ wind driven vertical migration of cyanobacteria in lake water may arguably contribute to the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect under suitable uv radiation intensity in eutrophic water layers some studies have been performed on the influence of critical wind speed on bloom cyanobacterial vertical migration yet the critical wind speeds obtained vary from 2 0 to 4 5 m s 1 owing to the differences in analysis methods in different water bodies huang et al 2014 cao et al 2006 if the wind speed is lower than the critical value more surface blooming cyanobacteria is exposed to high dose uv light wu et al 2015 cyanobacterial blooms cannot appear if the wind speed is higher than the critical value because bloom cyanobacterial colonies were mixed with water wu et al 2015 then the underwater cyanobacteria can greatly grow through utilization of absorbed phosphorus because cyanobacteria have high par utilization efficiency even at low visible light intensity li et al 2006 more cyanobacterial colonies appear on the lake water surface to exposure solar uv light if the wind speed is lower than the critical value again in calm water bodies with blooming cyanobacteria long term low wind speeds and low atmospheric pressure levels increase cyanobacterial exposure to uv radiation in summer shi et al 2017 there are the risk of photoinhibition at high photon irradiance and thermal damage at high temperature excess of 30 c cao et al 2006 and extreme uv radiation in this case cyanobacterial colonies are inclined to voluntarily sacrifice the surface layer cells to encourage rapid subsurface cyanobacterial proliferation fig s8 in the cyanobacterial accumulation regions in addition uv driven vertical migration of cyanobacteria in lake water may also conducive to the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect the amount of gas vesicles in cyanobacteria increases in the presence of uv b rajagopal et al 2005 besides the vertical movement of cyanobacteria due to changes in buoyancy is accompanied with changes in uv radiation häder 2007 cyanobacteria can regulate buoyancy by collapse or formation of gas vesicles oliver and walsby 1988 to make them under a more appropriate uv exposure dose and then effectively carry out the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect significantly the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus seems to operate efficiently in natural water with suitable light temperature and adequate nutrient conditions solar light intensity determines cyanobacterial energy sources and water temperature determines cyanobacterial growth rates huisman et al 2018 and phosphorus is the material basis of cyanobacterial growth ho et al 2019 for the eutrophic shallow lake water bodies external inputs and endogenous release provide sufficient phosphorus for cyanobacterial growth xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 resulting in spiral amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus under uv light however the spiral amplified cycle of cyanobacteria with phosphorus not only can appear in eutrophic lake water bodies but also in oligotrophic lake water bodies cyanobacterial blooms occur in oligotrophic lake water body too carey et al 2012b leblanc et al 2008 the efficient operation of the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria with phosphorus in oligotrophic water body mainly appears after the rainstorm cyanobacteria efficiently take up and store phosphorus from the run off in low nutrient environments under solar light jeppesen et al 2009 sterner et al 2020 bjerrum and canfield 2002 cottingham et al 2016 phosphorus also provided by suspended solid and sediment in water body is sufficient for cyanobacterial proliferation under uv light radiation though the available phosphate for cyanobacteria only accounts for small percentage of the total phosphorus in natural water fig s9 thus low intensity cyanobacterial bloom can appear occasionally in oligotrophic lake water body kromkamp 1987 in summary the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus triggered by uv light plays a significant role in the cyanobacterial growth process through polyphosphate accumulation and will probably favor cyanobacterial blooms in lake water bodies this amplified cycle due to cyanobacterial phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect provides a new explanation for cyanobacterial bloom and a new theoretical basis for the global increases in cyanobacterial dominance in natural lake water bodies 4 conclusion uv light triggers cyanobacterial polyp accumulation to decrease intracellular phosphate content consequently cyanobacteria steadily uptakes phosphate to favor an increase in cyanobacterial density uv light also promotes the synthesis of chl a and phycobilins of cyanobacteria to increase in atp synthesis for the accumulation of intracellular polyp the frequent changes in uv irradiance exposure dose make cyanobacteria avoid constant exposure to high intensity uv radiation due to cyanobacterial colonies continuous vertical migration and prompt them to grow rapidly after adsorbing ample phosphorus under short term high intensity uv radiation the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus by phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect continuously occurs in abundant nutrient water bodies uv light promotes polyp accumulation in blooming cyanobacterial cells for their exuberant growth and then more surface blooming cyanobacteria are exposed to uv light to adsorb ample phosphorus the increasing cyanobacterial growth induced by uv light through polyphosphate accumulation provides a new explanation for the growth mechanism of cyanobacteria and a new

15639,cyanobacterial blooms appear more strongly constantly and globally yet the positive effect of surface solar ultraviolet radiation uv on cyanobacterial bloom in natural freshwater habitats is largely ignored here in situ and laboratory studies were jointly designed to probe the mechanism of cyanobacterial bloom promoted by solar uv light the results showed that solar uv light is a key trigger factor for the accumulation of total phosphorus dissolved inorganic phosphorus and polyphosphate polyp in blooming cyanobacterial cells the increase of uv dose induces polyp accumulation to result in the excessive phosphorus uptake of blooming cyanobacteria which provides sufficient phosphorus for cyanobacterial growth in suitable environment solar uv light also can promote the contents of phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin producing sufficient atp by photosynthesis for polyp synthesis in cyanobacterial cells in lake enviroment the frequent variations of uv irradiance exposure prompts cyanobacteria to absorb excessive phosphorus from suspended solid or sediment cyanobacterial intracellular phosphorus is accumulated for their growth uv light promotes polyp accumulation in blooming cyanobacterial cells to avoid damage the adsorption amount of phosphorus increases for exuberant growth and then more surface blooming cyanobacteria are exposed to uv light to absorb ample phosphorus thus the positive feedback occurs in lake water bodies with abundant phosphorus this amplified cycle of cyanobacterial density and phosphorus due to solar uv light in eutrophic water bodies is analogous to a triode to amplify visible photosynthesis by uv light as a base electric current in the energy flow process in lake environment therefore cyanobacterial phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect is used to describe this phenomenon a new explanation is provided for the continuing proliferating mechanism of cyanobacterial bloom besides a new perspective appears on the outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms in natural eutrophic lake water bodies worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar ultraviolet radiation polyphosphate phosphorus phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect cyanobacterial bloom data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are currently ravaging on global scale posing grave threats to both public health and aquatic ecosystems brooks et al 2016 the ongoing global warming and escalating anthropogenic activities cause more frequent intense and persistent cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 the evolving capacities of cyanobacteria including high temperature tolerance low nutrient tolerance and the formation of aggregates to withstand adverse conditions and so on give them dominance in various waters in particular buoyancy regulators gas vesicles make cyanobacteria a competitive winner in nutrient limited waters under solar light exposure via regulating their depth in water column zou et al 2022 unfortunately blooming cyanobacteria always accompanied by more intense ultraviolet uv light exposure because they float on the water surface uv radiation has long been considered as a restriction factor for cyanobacterial growth and expansion in most case mloszewska et al 2018 high intensity uv radiation may increase of the risk of cyanobacterial physiological structure damage at both the molecular and cellular levels yang et al 2015 the majority of cyanobacterial blooms on global scale occur in the summer along with intense uv radiation the ultraviolet radiation b intensity uvb 280 320 nm is 1 5 2 0 w m 2 and ultraviolet radiation a intensity is 50 60 w m 2 uva 320 400 nm under very clear skies at temperate to equatorial latitudes castenholz 1997 the cyanobacterial blooms occurred increase in lakes at mid low latitudes and equator regions where the elevation in uv irradiance is normally detected carey et al 2012a this observation is aligned with other studies as was observed that increasing cyanobacteria exist in enhanced surface solar uv radiation induced by the more serious ozone hole even surviving under high uv radiation ehling schulz and scherer 1999 there should be a protection mechanism that cyanobacteria have against high uv intensity therefore it is required more extensive ecosystem effect of uv light on anomalous lacustrine cyanobacterial blooms should be explained evolving cyanobacteria have diversified strategies to adapt to uv radiation mainly comprising avoidance responses to escape high uvb radiation in different water depth cyanobacteria can also synthesis uv absorbing compounds such as mycosporine like amino acids and from efficient repair systems for uv induced damage ehling schulz and scherer 1999 donkor and häner 1995 in addition the synthesized cyanobacterial intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides induced by uv light improve their uv resistance ehling schulz et al 1997 cyanobacteria in motion form large colonies to effectively shade their internal structure from uv damage huisman et al 2018 however there are new links between solar uv radiation and surface cyanobacterial blooms in various water bodies the longstanding focus on damage of high intensity uv radiation to cyanobacteria the constant variation in uv radiation for cyanobacteria has been ignored due to vertical migration or fluctuations of cyanobacteria and the low intensity solar uv radiation because of latitude and longitude geographical position cloud cover and ozone content yang et al 2015 ehling schulz and scherer 1999 xu and gao 2009 thus an over amplification of the adverse uv effects might appear in natural water environment ren et al 2020 found that ambient uv radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on microcystis aeruginosa and high phosphorus availability could alleviate or eliminate the negative effects of uv radiation on cyanobacteria consequently uv adaptation processes of cyanobacteria resulted in an elevated demand for phosphorus which resulted in increased phosphorus uptake rates what s more some microbes have been shown to accumulate abundant phosphorus in the form of polyphosphate polyp granules even in waters where phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations are very lower chen et al 2022 ou et al 2019 polyp a polymer of phosphate of varying lengths usually acts as a temporary reservoir of phosphate pi in the cell and has been identified in all kingdoms of life rao et al 2009 achbergerová and nahálka 2011 the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of polyp in bacteria is polyphosphate kinase ppk ppk synthesizes polyp by transferring the terminal phosphate of atp to polyp seufferheld et al 2008 polyp plays an important role in microbial adaptation to extreme environments e g high temperature high uv radiation seufferheld et al 2008 in lacustrine cyanobacteria blooming the action of polyp involved in p cycle might be associated with decrease of damage of uv light in this study in situ and laboratory experiments were jointly designed to answer the following questions in freshwater lakes worldwide 1 do cyanobacteria excessively uptake phosphorus as a result of polyp accumulation in uv adaption process 2 is cyanobacteria blooming due to the increased phosphorus utilization capacity triggered by solar uv light our study provides new insight into the mechanism of the continuous outbreak of cyanobacterial bloom in lakes and eventually the prevention and control of cyanobacterial blooms 2 materials and methods to explore the effect of solar uv light on improving intracellular polyp accumulation and growth of cyanobacteria the polyp content of natural microcystis colonies from lakes was first determined under different solar uv exposure doses in lakes with different water depths in situ then according to the actual effective uv dose received by cyanobacteria in the natural lakes during summer we simulated that increasing uv radiation promotes polyp accumulation in microcystis and thus prompts cyanobacterial growth in the simulated environment in an additional laboratory experiment we investigated the rapid cyanobacterial growth caused by the intracellular polyp accumulation due to exposure to uv radiation during their vertical migration in the water columns 2 1 source of cyanobacterial materials natural microcystis colonies samples were collected from different lakes lake taihu and lake guchenghu in jiangsu province and lake chaohu in anhui province of china before the experiments these samples were first filtered through a 250 μm sieve to select cyanobacterial colonies the filtered cyanobacterial colonies were stored under continuous light of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 at 30 c microscopic observations of these collected cyanobacterial scum samples revealed that the numbers of microcystis were more than 99 81 of the total phytoplankton the main species were microcystis viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii while zooplankton was rarely found the planktonic cyanobacterium m aeruginosa an unicellular cyanobacterium was chosen as the model organism due to its widespread existence in these different lakes m aeruginosa was originally obtained from lake taihu m aeruginosa cells were cultured at 25 c under 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 of photosynthetically active radiation par with cool white fluorescent lamps light dark regime of 12 h 12 h in bg11 medium bg11 medium buffered at ph 7 0 contained 22 6 μm 0 7 mg p l 1 phosphate flasks were shaken three times per day to prevent the cyanobacterial cells from adhering to inner walls and the position of flasks was exchanged randomly to ensure uniform light exposure a two week culture cell density exceeding 4 2 108 cells l 1 was harvested by centrifugation washed twice with ultrapure water and resuspended in fresh phosphorus free bg11 medium to give the same cell density this culture was incubated for an additional period of 8 days under the above culture conditions 2 2 field and laboratory experiments 2 2 1 effects of solar uv radiation on contents of different forms of intracellular phosphorus in natural microcystis colonies in field experiments to assess the effect of solar uv radiation exposure dose on polyp accumulation of natural blooming cyanobacteria 25 ml high density natural microcystis colonies 4 97 107 cells l 1 from wild habitats were exposed to solar uv radiation for 1 h at different water depths of 0 cm 10 cm and 20 cm with 0 45 μm nylon mesh 12 cm 12 cm in an open water region in lake chaohu st1 lake guchenhu st2 and lake taihu st3 with different nutrients levels on a sunny day fig 1 moreover other subsamples were exposed to solar uv radiation on the water surface for 1 h and then replaced at 10 cm of water depth for 1 h again the corresponding sets of samples were exposed to solar uv radiation on the water surface layer for 1 h and then replaced them at 10 cm of water depth for 1 h and finally placed on the water surface for another 1 h to explore the changes of cyanobacterial intracellular polyp contents at different uv exposure dose with different water depth in those lakes three replicates were conducted in each treatment the aqueous total phosphorus tp concentrations were 0 084 0 050 and 0 158 mg l 1 at experiments sites in lake chaohu st1 lake guchenghu st2 and lake taihu st3 respectively while the aqueous pi contents available for direct uptake by cyanobacteria were 0 023 0 012 and 0 041 mg l 1 in these three lakes respectively the aqueous dissolved total phosphorus dtp contents were 0 052 0 042 and 0 086 mg l 1 in these three lakes respectively all the in situ tests were carried out in summer when the lake water temperature was above 30 c and the solar uv radiation intensity reaching the water surface among 20 30 w m 2 the uv radiation intensities were reduced with increasing water depth due to the distinct transparency and cyanobacterial densities in these three lakes table s1 2 2 2 effects of uv radiation on phosphorus absorption of m aeruginosa in laboratory experiments two sets of experiments with different uv exposure doses were designed to ascertain the effect of uv irradiation on the phosphorus absorption of m

induces polyp accumulation of blooming cyanobacteria in three lakes surface blooming cyanobacterial colonies inevitably receive greater uv radiation than the subsurface ones due to the light attenuatio mloszewska et al 2018 erikson 1933 cyanobacterial colonies were placed at different water depths of 0 10 and 20 cm with distinct uv radiation to simulate cyanobacterial vertical distribution in lake chaohu lake guchenghu and lake taihu with different eutrophic levels uv radiation promotes contents of polyp pi and tp in the surface blooming cyanobacterial colonies than that in subsurface blooming cyanobacterial colonies at water depths of 10 cm or 20 cm after 1 h solar uv light exposure in three lakes fig 2 we repeatedly alternately placed the cyanobacteria samples on the surface and the subsurface of a 10 cm water depth for 1 h each time the results showed that the high solar uv radiation dose with radiation time extension apparently promoted the contents of pi polyp and tp in blooming cyanobacteria fig 3 thus these in situ results confirmed that uv radiation stimulated the cyanobacterial phosphorus uptake and polyp accumulation in lake water bodies m aeruginosa is the dominant bloom forming species in lake taihu lake chaohu and lake guchenghu zeng et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 we employed m aeruginosa as a model cyanobacterium to verify the results of in situ studies only with the variable uv light in contrast the intracellular contents of polyp pi and tp in m aeruginosa under different uv and par exposure doses were substantially larger than those under only par exposure furthermore the accumulation amounts of different forms of phosphorus in m aeruginosa increased with increase of the uv radiation time fig 4 which showed the high consistency with the observed changes in polyp pi and tp in natural blooming cyanobacterial colonies in situ lake experiments in light of this validation uv light is undisputed as a key driver improving intracellular polyp pi and tp accumulations of cyanobacteria phosphorus is regarded as a critical biogenic ingredient in aquatic ecosystems and a plausible candidate to explain ongoing cyanobacterial blooms in manifold waters toothman et al 2009 chuai et al 2011 among other things pi is the only form of phosphorus that can be directly absorbed and utilized by cyanobacteria martin 1975 which is integral to metabolic processes as a functional component of many molecules in the cell including nucleic acids phospholipids phosphoproteins and metabolites related to most catabolic and anabolic pathways and signaling molecules sanz luque et al 2020 because uv radiation impacted cyanobacterial intracellular phosphorus content thus uv radiation affects the nutrients utilization behavior and the elemental composition of cyanobacterial cells carrillo et al 2015 ihnacik et al 2014 sereda et al 2011 demonstrated that uv radiation greatly reduced planktonic phosphorus acquisition and then exacerbated the phosphorus limitation for algal growth in oligotrophic systems thus uv radiation could change intracellular phosphorus contents however shelly 2010 and hessen 1997 found that uv exposure remarkably increased phosphorus uptake of some algal species to balance between damage and repair processes of cells which showed a strong distinction with the results of sereda 2011 according to a study by ren et al 2020 the phosphorus utilization behavior of m aeruginosa could have a great increase after short term uv radiation m aeruginosa had uv adaptation capability which could depended on phosphorus availability in the culture medium the uv light promoted pi and tp accumulation in cyanobacterial cells thus uv light controlled intracellular phosphorus utilization because uv light directly affected the metabolism and growth of cyanobacteria polyp is a linear polymer consisting of dozens to hundreds of phosphate residues linked by a high energy phosphoanhydride bond and is mainly stored in acidocalcisome its synthesis and accumulation appeared to impact a myriad of cellular functions jahid et al 2006 the polyp accumulation appeared at very high intracellular concentrations in microbes under various environmental pressures such as high temperature and low redox habitats especially under stress conditions if pi was abundant rao 2009 shi et al 2007 polyp had the dual roles of uv absorption bennoson and williams 1972 and uv resistance through binding to nucleic acids and proteins to protect them from damage kornberg et al 1999 cyanobacteria exposed to uv light would accumulate a certain amount of polyp importantly polyp synthesis inevitably induced a decline in intracellular pi content in cyanobacteria then cyanobacterial cells absorbed more extracellular phosphorus to ensure polyp synthesis because polyp synthesis was a bidirectional dynamic process and finally increasing the intracellular tp content the cyanobacterial pi and tp contents increased due to rapid polyp accumulation under uv light thus uv light induces blooming cyanobacterial polyp accumulation to could promote excessive phosphorus uptake from natural water accumulated polyp under uv light enhances the uv resistance of cyanobacteria and provides sufficient nutrients for cyanobacterial growth if they move to the non pressure of uv environment 3 2 polyp accumulated under solar uv light promotes cyanobacterial growth cyanobacterial intracellular polyp accumulation ascribed to uv radiation in situ lake experiment and laboratory experiments provides a substantial material basis for cyanobacterial growth and diffusion fig s1 on account of this it is worth paying even more attention to the relationship between uv radiation and cyanobacterial density under the action of polyp as a medium uv radiation has long been considered as a restriction factor for cyanobacterial growth and expansion mloszewska et al 2018 extensive studies have been conducted to better understand the mechanisms of the complex impacts of uv radiation on cyanobacteria xu and gao 2009 high uv radiation adversely affects cyanobacterial physiological structures cyanobacterial photosynthesis activity and cell viability yang et al 2015 uv radiation could damage the photosynthetic apparatus in many kinds of algae wulff et al 2007 the effects of prolonged or enhanced uv radiation were investigated especially for phytoinduced damages attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion and other factors häder et al 2014 poll et al 2010 this was also the case in our study high uv radiation inhibited the synthesis of photosynthetic pigment chl a and phycobilin of m aeruginosa figs s2 and s3 and caused oxidative stress fig s4 to inhibit cyanobacterial growth the fv fm and etrmax representing the efficiency of photosynthesis of m aeruginosa were inhibited at high dose of uv radiation fig s5 blooming cyanobacteria in natural lake water bodies have evolved various strategies to alleviate photoinduced damage or promote self repair in the face of prolonged exposure stress to high doses of uv radiation häder et al 2011 for example cyanobacteria can synthesize humus like matter wang et al 2012 polysaccharides fig s6 ehling schulz and scherer 1999 and mycosporine like amino acids to improve the anti uv ability donkor and häner 1995 cyanobacteria regulate their phycobilin contents in real time according to light intensity and light quality rómulo et al 2006 which constitute nearly half of the soluble proteins in cyanobacterial cells and contribute much absorption of uvb to resist uv harm richa et al 2015 wang et al 2012 furthermore the ambient uv radiation exerted oxidative stresses rather than direct lethal effects on cyanobacteria and the increased synthesis of antioxidizes and photosynthetic pigments makes cyanobacteria have a better adaptation under uv stress and decrease negative effects of uv radiation on its growth ren et al 2020 besides phycobilins effectively funnel light energy to the underlying psii reaction centers krauspe et al 2021 and high phycobilin contents are conducive to dramatically increasing cyanobacterial light usage efficiency in natural water bodies zhang et al 2013 thus the increases in phycobilin contents can transfer more energy to psii rcs at strong dose of uv light mccluskey et al 2002 in our study the phycobilin biosynthesis increase in m aeruginosa exposed to uv radiation fig 5 which can be responsible for the increase of atp amount fig 6 because atp is involved in transporting electrons producing proteins synthesizing pigments and other processes shelly 2005 overall the upregulations of the pc ac and pe contents promote the transformation of sufficient energy in the form of atp in m aeruginosa in natural water body and then atp is used for polyp synthesis with the regulation of the ppk1 gene expression increased fig s7 and for biological activities to promote the growth of m aeruginosa previous studies so far paid more attention on the effect of high intensity uv radiation on cyanobacteria as a long term static process mloszewska et al 2018 yang et al 2015 causing the excessive amplification of uv adverse effects in the present study the uv radiation dose of lower than 60 kj m 2 promoted cyanobacterial growth along with intracellular polyp accumulation and phycobilin concentration upregulation fig 7 b and 7c thus low dose uv radiation did not inhibit cyanobacterial growth but promote cyanobacterial growth by stimulating cyanobacterial polyp formation and phycobilin improvement m aeruginosa as a model species is used to investigate the cyanobacterial growth under variable uv intensity associated with the nonnegligible vertical cyanobacterial migration by the end of the experiment the density of m aeruginosa was unanimously lower under static culture than that under vertical migration culture at high intensity uv radiation fig 8 a and 8b thus cyanobacterial vertical migration both makes them to avoid constant high intensity uv radiation exposure and prompts them to grow rapidly after accumulating polyp under short term high dose solar uv radiation this intermittent solar uv light exposure due to cyanobacterial vertical migration can be beneficial for cyanobacterial bloom the density of m aeruginosa under static culture was higher than that under vertical migration culture at low intensity uv radiation fig 8c the high achieved uv exposure dose improves cyanobacterial growth at low intensity uv radiation thus solar uv light has the overlooked potential to stimulate cyanobacterial growth and magnify an expansive cyanobacterial response in lake water body and polyp synthesis of cyanobacteria plays a key role in this process 3 3 mechanism of uv light amplifying cyanobacterial growth cyanobacteria are likely endowed with a highly efficient mechanism to amplify the positive effect of visible photosynthesis on cyanobacteria proliferation under uv light in the present study uv light stimulates cyanobacteria to synthesize phycobilins and chl a and then promotes the synthesis of atp which provides substrates for intracellular polyp accumulation in cyanobacteria uv light triggers cyanobacterial polyp accumulation directly as a stress response to protect cyanobacterial cells in adverse environment furthermore the rapid accumulation of intracellular polyp can decrease intracellular phosphate content of cyanobacteria and then cyanobacteria uptake excessive phosphorus this excessive phosphorus is used to favor cyanobacteria proliferation if cyanobacteria are in suitable environment therefore the positive feedback that uv light promotes polyp accumulation and even more intracellular accumulated phosphorus is used for cyanobacteria proliferation in water bodies with abundant nutrients will be continuously amplified with the vertical migration of cyanobacteria between water surface and underwater this process is analogous to a triode to amplify cyanobacterial visible photosynthesis by uv light as a base electric current in the energy flow process in lake bodies the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus projected in the eutrophic water body plays a continuous accelerating role in the cyanobacterial growth under low dose uv radiation which can be called the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect fig 9 the amplified cycle will collapse if the solar energy support is insufficient on rainy or cloudy days previous studies from static culture demonstrated the sensitivity of phytoplankton to ambient uv in natural environment häder et al 2014 but they did not necessarily quantify the effects of uv on photosynthesis in situ wind driven vertical migration of cyanobacteria in lake water may arguably contribute to the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect under suitable uv radiation intensity in eutrophic water layers some studies have been performed on the influence of critical wind speed on bloom cyanobacterial vertical migration yet the critical wind speeds obtained vary from 2 0 to 4 5 m s 1 owing to the differences in analysis methods in different water bodies huang et al 2014 cao et al 2006 if the wind speed is lower than the critical value more surface blooming cyanobacteria is exposed to high dose uv light wu et al 2015 cyanobacterial blooms cannot appear if the wind speed is higher than the critical value because bloom cyanobacterial colonies were mixed with water wu et al 2015 then the underwater cyanobacteria can greatly grow through utilization of absorbed phosphorus because cyanobacteria have high par utilization efficiency even at low visible light intensity li et al 2006 more cyanobacterial colonies appear on the lake water surface to exposure solar uv light if the wind speed is lower than the critical value again in calm water bodies with blooming cyanobacteria long term low wind speeds and low atmospheric pressure levels increase cyanobacterial exposure to uv radiation in summer shi et al 2017 there are the risk of photoinhibition at high photon irradiance and thermal damage at high temperature excess of 30 c cao et al 2006 and extreme uv radiation in this case cyanobacterial colonies are inclined to voluntarily sacrifice the surface layer cells to encourage rapid subsurface cyanobacterial proliferation fig s8 in the cyanobacterial accumulation regions in addition uv driven vertical migration of cyanobacteria in lake water may also conducive to the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect the amount of gas vesicles in cyanobacteria increases in the presence of uv b rajagopal et al 2005 besides the vertical movement of cyanobacteria due to changes in buoyancy is accompanied with changes in uv radiation häder 2007 cyanobacteria can regulate buoyancy by collapse or formation of gas vesicles oliver and walsby 1988 to make them under a more appropriate uv exposure dose and then effectively carry out the phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect significantly the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus seems to operate efficiently in natural water with suitable light temperature and adequate nutrient conditions solar light intensity determines cyanobacterial energy sources and water temperature determines cyanobacterial growth rates huisman et al 2018 and phosphorus is the material basis of cyanobacterial growth ho et al 2019 for the eutrophic shallow lake water bodies external inputs and endogenous release provide sufficient phosphorus for cyanobacterial growth xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 resulting in spiral amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus under uv light however the spiral amplified cycle of cyanobacteria with phosphorus not only can appear in eutrophic lake water bodies but also in oligotrophic lake water bodies cyanobacterial blooms occur in oligotrophic lake water body too carey et al 2012b leblanc et al 2008 the efficient operation of the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria with phosphorus in oligotrophic water body mainly appears after the rainstorm cyanobacteria efficiently take up and store phosphorus from the run off in low nutrient environments under solar light jeppesen et al 2009 sterner et al 2020 bjerrum and canfield 2002 cottingham et al 2016 phosphorus also provided by suspended solid and sediment in water body is sufficient for cyanobacterial proliferation under uv light radiation though the available phosphate for cyanobacteria only accounts for small percentage of the total phosphorus in natural water fig s9 thus low intensity cyanobacterial bloom can appear occasionally in oligotrophic lake water body kromkamp 1987 in summary the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus triggered by uv light plays a significant role in the cyanobacterial growth process through polyphosphate accumulation and will probably favor cyanobacterial blooms in lake water bodies this amplified cycle due to cyanobacterial phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect provides a new explanation for cyanobacterial bloom and a new theoretical basis for the global increases in cyanobacterial dominance in natural lake water bodies 4 conclusion uv light triggers cyanobacterial polyp accumulation to decrease intracellular phosphate content consequently cyanobacteria steadily uptakes phosphate to favor an increase in cyanobacterial density uv light also promotes the synthesis of chl a and phycobilins of cyanobacteria to increase in atp synthesis for the accumulation of intracellular polyp the frequent changes in uv irradiance exposure dose make cyanobacteria avoid constant exposure to high intensity uv radiation due to cyanobacterial colonies continuous vertical migration and prompt them to grow rapidly after adsorbing ample phosphorus under short term high intensity uv radiation the amplified cycle of cyanobacteria and phosphorus by phosphorus assimilation ultraviolet effect continuously occurs in abundant nutrient water bodies uv light promotes polyp accumulation in blooming cyanobacterial cells for their exuberant growth and then more surface blooming cyanobacteria are exposed to uv light to adsorb ample phosphorus the increasing cyanobacterial growth induced by uv light through polyphosphate accumulation provides a new explanation for the growth mechanism of cyanobacteria and a new
