20020,rural households in developing countries rely on communal water supplies and household water frequently becomes contaminated following its collection transportation and during its storage using culture dependent and independent techniques we examined the changes in microbial water quality between communal tap water and household water storage in a rural area of cameroon africa the culturable fecal indicator bacteria fib were used to assess the potential health risks associated with different household water storage conditions e g type of container and open vs closed container and interventions e g water storage days cleaned on the last day of use and hygiene practices only the amount of days the water was stored significantly differed p value 0 05 which showed that potential health risks increased when water was stored for more than 3 days the higher abundance of molecular fib in biofilm than household water suggested that omnipresent biofilm in household water could potential health risk the high throughput sequencing revealed that the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in both the water and the biofilm samples bacterial genera seen in biofilm bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter and comamonas acinetobacter chryseobacterium stenotrophomonas and corynebacterium were relatively more abundant in the biofilm than in the water potential bacterial pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and haemophilus influenza were detected in household water and biofilm the microbial quality might be affected by water storage time and households repeatedly using the same water storage containers without proper sanitization triggering microbial regrowth and biofilm formation on water containers higher bacterial diversity and potentially pathogenic bacteria found in the biofilm samples of a household water supply are unhealthy for the house s inhabitants it is important to develop interventions aimed at preventing the formation of these dangerous biofilms in a communal water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water household water biofilm metagenomics developing country 1 introduction there has been significant progress in improving the quality of drinking water worldwide 91 of the global population uses an improved water source e g piped water public tap stands borehole rainwater protected spring or dug well which is an increase from 76 in 1990 dos santos et al 2017 however more than 663 million people mainly living in sub saharan africa and asia still lack access to improved sources of drinking water who unicef 2015 while the water situation has improved in sub saharan africa since 1990 the region as a whole lags behind every other developing region in the world in water and sanitation coverage dos santos et al 2017 even in communities with access to potable water the elderly and children under five years old especially face the risk of drinking contaminated water due to unsafe drinking water poor sanitation and poor hygiene mintz et al 1995 wright et al 2004 in cameroon for instance only 47 of the rural population has access to clean drinking water who unicef 2015 in rural areas microbial contaminations are recognized to be a problem during water collection and transport from the source and then in the subsequent storage of water in a household to reduce the waterborne disease in household water environmental health interventions such as household water treatments and safe storage solutions encouraging inhabitants to wash their hands with soap and proper sanitation have been highlighted davis et al 2011 wright et al 2004 for instance household water treatment better sanitation facilities and hygiene education reduced the levels of diarrhea from meta analysis fewtrell et al 2005 however the users of the communal water supply often transport their water to private residences to ensure they have enough water to last through non supply periods at these residences the water frequently becomes contaminated during storage due to poor hygienic practices mintz et al 1995 the unsafe storage of potable water and poor hygiene increased the number of coliform inside storage containers possibly due to microbial regrowth and their ability to survive as biofilm mellor et al 2013 biofilm formation has been observed on all surfaces of household containers where microorganisms can attach by secreting an extracellular polymer substance burkowska but et al 2015 mellor et al 2013 biofilm are not sensitive to environmental stressors and more resistant to antimicrobial treatments creating an environmental reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms wingender and flemming 2011 repeated use of the same water storage containers can lead to the regrowth of microorganisms and biofilm formation which poses potential health risks bisi johnson et al 2017 mellor et al 2013 stigler granados et al 2014 thomas et al 2015 van der merwe et al 2013 to date most studies of microbial water quality in developing countries have focused on the detection of specific organisms and or the quantification of coliforms using culturable methods e g the most probable number and membrane filter techniques researchers have used the traditional techniques of fecal coliform heterotrophic bacteria or e coli as surrogate bacteria to assess microbial water quality recently molecular techniques particularly the polymerase chain reaction pcr based method have been proposed as an alternative method to monitor and track pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria fib because they offer sensitive and quantitative analytical tools girones et al 2010 also the advent of the next generation sequencing ngs based on 16s rrna metagenomics has enabled the analysis of the entire microbial community of a given sample without the need for culturing the bacteria tan et al 2015 a ngs approach can provide a broad spectrum identification of different microbes along with a high resolution phylogenetic microbial community profiling while also indicating the abundance of genetic traits of the pathogens in water samples mukherjee et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of using a ngs approach to understand the changes in microbial communities of a source water and a household water storage and the effect of hygiene practices on biofilm formation in a water storage container in a developing country also it allow us to gain in depth knowledge about the comprehensive microbial quality and safety of the water available whereas detection of predetermined microbial indicators are often unable to assess all microbial pathogens particularly ngs approach could reveal the overall microbial composition ecology and diversity microorganisms leading to more comprehensive and representative risk characterization thus our research questions were designed to investigate how microbial water quality deteriorates when taken from the communal tap water supply to the household water storage container considering variables such as 1 the type of container used for water storage 2 the length of time that water is stored in a container 3 the utensil used to collect water and 4 the households associated hygienic practices to determine the microbial contamination associated with household water storage we used traditional culture based methods quantitative pcr and the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicon using the illumina miseq platform the objectives of this study were to i determine the fib concentrations of 20 household water and community tap stands in a gravity fed water distribution system in ntisaw cameroon ii quantify the molecular fib of potable water household water containers and utensils e g cups and buckets from two households and iii assess the microbial diversity and structure associated with the water and containers used in this rural area of cameroon 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site setting and household selection the field study was conducted in ntisaw a rural community in the ndu subdivision of the donga mantung division in the northwest region of cameroon the study area is characterized by a monsoon season from the end of february through november followed by an intense dry period december through mid february outside of the town of ndu which has a water supply network to pump ground water to the residents the majority of the rural communities in the subdivision lack improved water sources ntisaw has installed a gravity fed water distribution system which collects water from a protected spring and distributes the water to 16 public tap stands the village of ntisaw is comprised of two ethnic groups the mborrorro people who are primarily herders and the wimbum tribe who are mainly subsistence farmers with an average salary of two groups of approximately 100 000 cfa per year 0 57 usd per day 2 2 sampling information after water leaves the ntisaw public tap system there are two primary locations of microbial contamination during domestic storage the collection and or storage container and the utensils used to distribute the water to assess if water became contaminated samples were collected from 20 households in ntisaw 12 of the population every 1 4 weeks for 4 months february 2014 to may 2014 between 6 30am 8 30am a sample was obtained from each household s container using the utensils that the household uses to distribute water for domestic purposes in our first visits to each households we surveyed household information e g number of people water usage length of water storage and etc and microbial water qualities additionally during 2 3 of the sampling events a secondary sample was collected directly from the storage containers to determine if there was a difference in the quality of the stored water versus the water that was in contact with a household utensil all samples were plated within 2 h of collection in duplicate using 3m petrifilmtm e coli coliform ec plates 2 3 households survey households were not told when samples would be collected to prevent any alteration in behavior however this meant that some families were not home or did not have water when asked to provide samples preventing the analysis of their water for that sampling event one of the twenty households was only sampled from twice while all others were sampled 5 8 times all 20 households are included in the analysis unless otherwise stated when samples were collected households were asked to provide information on when and where the water was collected and when the container was last cleaned with soap as hygienic practices we noted how the material of the water storage container looked and if there was a container lid during the sampling events 2 4 analysis of e coli and fecal coliforms within the ec plate medium an indicator dye stains bacterial colonies red lactose traps gas under the top film to distinguish coliforms from non coliform bacteria and 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronide bcig indicates β glucuronidase gus activity when the gus enzyme cleaves bcig it yields a dark blue precipitate at the site of enzymatic activity causing a gus producing bacterial colony like escherichia coli e coli to appear blue this is referred to as fecal coliform bacteria fib in this paper however other coliform colonies are red and closely associated with entrapped gas the total coliform counts consists of both the red and blue colonies associated with gas after 24 36 h of incubation at 36 2 c the bacterial growth on the ec plates for each household was enumerated after classifying coliforms on the ec plate as total coliforms non coliforms or fecal coliform the sample was then categorized into a microbial contamination category from 0 to 8 based on the criteria shown in table 1 on days in which samples were collected from households additional samples were collected from some public taps when tested bacterial loading rates from the taps were normally in microbial contamination category 0 and never above 1 2 5 dna extraction and qpcr two of the twenty households participating in water sampling agreed to an additional water sampling event to be used for microbial community analysis both houses were located in the center of town and used the same water tap floqswab a copan flocked swab cat 502cs01 was used to collect samples from 1 the utensil which the household used to distribute water from the storage container and 2 the bucket used to collect water from the public tap researchers brushed the swab around the inside surface of the container the tip was then broken off into a sterile 15 ml test tube containing 100 μl of pbst 137 mm nacl 2 68 mm kcl 10 14 mm na2hpo4 1 76 mm kh2po4 and 0 1 tween 20 dna was extracted from those samples using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca following the protocol outlined in the manufacturer s instructions additionally 0 2 0 5 l of water was collected in sterile 250 ml bottles from 1 the households storage containers 2 the spring box which supplies all water to the village and 3 the tap from which the families collect water these samples were filtered through a magna nylon 0 22 μm filter and the filter was aseptically placed into a lysing matrix e tube with the fastprep 24 system mp biomedicals solon oh usa dna was isolated from these additional 14 samples using the ultracleantm soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the extracted dna was measured with the nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific foster city all samples were transported with cold packs and then stored at 20 c until needed for further analysis amplification was done in 384 well plates in a viiatm 7 real time pcr system applied

community analysis and detection of potential human pathogens the 16s rrna genes were amplified from all the dna extracts using primer sets 515f 909r wang and qian 2009 for multiplexed 16s amplicon sequencing on the miseq system in brief pcr preparation and sequencing on the illumina miseq benchtop sequencer using pair end 250 bp kits was performed these reads were excluded from the data analysis if the average quality score was lower than 10 during the split library script performed by qiime caporaso et al 2010 chimera checking was done in qiime using usearch to remove chimeric sequences the sequences obtained were processed using qiime version 1 8 to perform operational taxonomic unit otu clustering otus defined by a 97 sequence similarity were picked using open reference based otu with uclust and the representative sequences were submitted to the rdp classifier wang et al 2007 to obtain the taxonomy assignment and relative abundance of each otu from the greengenes database desantis et al 2006 alpha diversity diversity within a given sample metrics i e chao1 shannon index and inverse simpson were determined using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 shannon evenness was calculated by dividing observed otus by the natural logarithm of the shannon index chao1 is an estimator of species richness i e number of species the inverse simpson metric is a species diversity indicator the differential abundance in a sparse high throughput microbial marker gene survey was conducted to determine otus that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple samples paulson et al 2013 beta diversity diversity among samples weighted unifrac based principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots were calculated using the r package phyloseq following rarefaction of the data using the qiime pipeline to identify potential human pathogens bioinformatics analysis was performed using qiime protocol sequences were clustered against the human pathogen database as described previously kumaraswamy et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2015 after the initial preprocessing step the sequences were clustered against the human pathogenic sequences of clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria which has 617 sequences of clinical isolates of the 16s rrna gene sequences and genus species classification srinivasan et al 2015 the threshold value was set to a 99 similarity for alignment of the otus and taxonomic identification the closed reference based out with usearch and multiple sequences alignment was done using pynast the sequences were filtered with the human pathogen database statistical and metadata analysis of the microbiome data was conducted through phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 and microbiomeanalyst dhariwal et al 2017 2 7 statistical analysis for correlating the data all statistical analyses were completed using minitab for statistical computing the non parametric method of kirskal wallis was used to compare the potential risk associated with categorical variables in addition the anova statistical test was used to analyze the difference among the abundances of e coli and total coliform as measured by two molecular qpcr assays 3 results 3 1 microbial water quality and potential health risks in household water data from the survey of 170 households in ntisaw provides a comprehensive picture of water usage and health in the community table s2 in ntisaw there are 834 people counted in this census with a mean household size of 4 9 family members that do not live in the village for at least two consecutive days every two weeks were not counted the concentrations of culturable coliform were monitored in 20 households communal water resources including protected spring and public tap waters were also monitored the quality of water at the source water and water tap were of low microbial quality having risk categories of 0 or 1 the household samples were tested as having risk categories ranging from 0 to 6 table 1 which indicates potential health risks however the microbial water quality of the household water often deteriorated with the presence of fecal coliform up to 44 cfu ml even though the water quality of the spring and public tap waters met the who guidelines for safe drinking water we surveyed the household water storage behaviors linked with health risks e g type of container and open vs closed container and potential interventions e g water storage days cleaned last day and education fig 1 shows the potential risks associated with household water storage and practices the containers that the families in ntisaw use were categorized as either a jerrycan a metal pot or a plastic bucket statistical tests of kruskal wallist indicated that the potential risks posed by the type of containers were insignificant p value 0 263 in addition the effect of having a closed or open water container on the inhabitants health was negligible in this study p value 0 735 the relationship between household storage conditions e g time stored and types of container used and potential risks were examined because the type of container and the amount of days the water was stored could be associated with microbial regrowth leading to potential health risks the potential risks were significantly different depending on the length of time the water was stored p value 0 05 showing that a storage period of more than 3 days increased potential health risks fig 1d interestingly the inhabitants hygiene practices were not clearly associated with potential health risks because there was insignificant different among the cleaned last day p value 0 406 3 2 qpcr analyses of fecal indicator bacteria in a household water system the total coliform and e coli genes were enumerated using qpcr to determine the level of microbial contamination in the water and biofilm samples from the households waters supplies two households f14 and f6 were selected to examine the abundance of fib and the formation of biofilm in household utensils only f14 was instructed to clean cups and buckets before sampling so the effect of hygienic practices could be compared as expected the concentrations of total coliform were significantly higher than those of e coli in all samples except the source water where the concentrations of total coliform and e coli were in the same order of magnitude the concentrations of total coliform and e coli from the bucket and cup samples were higher than those of the source water samples as shown in fig 2 a the abundance of total coliform and e coli however more significantly increased in biofilm than in water samples as shown in fig 2b p value 0 02 and 0 05 for e coli and total coliform respectively the abundance of e coli and total coliform increased in the household water due to bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation however the effect of hygiene practices e g cleaning containers on the reduction of e coli and total coliform was not significant implying that biofilm were persistent even after hygiene practices were employed by the household 3 3 analysis of microbial communities in the household water taxonomic composition of water and biofilm samples revealed that the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria in the household water except for one biofilm sample from a cup ms14c2 fig 3 shows the relative abundance of microbial diversity indicating that alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria are consistently the most abundant among clades on the class level others included actinobacteria cytophagia bacilli flavobacteriia and clostridia under the proteobacteria phylum burkholderiales pseudomonadales enterobacteriales and xanthomonadales were the most predominant bacterial families at the genus level the most abundant genera included unassigned groups from pseudomonas acinetobacter enterobacteriaceae comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae figs s1 and s2 to understand the changes in microbial communities caused by the households water storage and hygiene practices the relative abundances of microbial communities were clustered by the type of water storage containers and sample type biofilm vs water sampling location and seasonal variation when the types of containers were examined acinetobacter was most abundant in the bucket 36 cup 42 and source water 67 but methylobacterium erwinia sphingobacterium brachybacterium were present in the buckets and cups only as shown in fig 4 the second most abundant genera were comamonas bucket and source water and pseudomonas cup the microbial distribution observed in the water and biofilm samples were similar even though acinetobacter chryseobacterium stenotrophomonas and corynebacterium were relatively more abundant in biofilm than in water also the most abundant genus in the source water spring box was pseudomonas while acinetobacter was the most abundant in the other samples tap stand family 6 and family 14 indicating that microbial compositions changed during transport and storage alpha diversities were calculated within a given community to understand how the type of containers the water biofilm samples locations or season altered the species richness and evenness in fig 5 alpha diversity metrics of the type of containers demonstrated that the microbial communities observed in the household container were more diverse than those observed in the source water implying that microbial communities originated not only from the source water but also from other sources such as the soil humans and the air the observed and chao 1 indices in biofilm and water showed that species richness did not significantly differ p value 0 05 while the shannon and inverse simpson indices from biofilm were significantly different than those of the water p value 0 05 since shannon and inverse simpson indices measure the distribution of an individual among groups high indices show a low homogeneity of species suggesting specific otus were more abundant than others in the biofilm taxonomically less diverse biofilm on the surface of buckets and cups implied that biofilm colonizers would persist in the household water storage containers for instance the differential abundance analysis using microbiomeanalyst showed that genera of brachybacterium erwinia enhydrobacter citrobacter deinococcus were differentially abundant in the biofilm p value 0 05 a principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to visualize similarities or dissimilarities in the microbial community in fig 6 although no obvious clustering was apparent between the biofilm and water samples biofilm samples clustered separately from the spring box and tap stand samples suggesting that the biofilm community was relatively distinct and far from the water microbiome no distinct clustering between family 14 and family 6 indicated that hygiene practices might not have a strong effect on the microbial communities in the houses water systems 3 4 estimation of potential human pathogens in the household water system using high throughput 16s rrna gene analysis the 16s rrna gene sequences were compared against the human pathogenic sequences using closed reference out calling the 16s rrna gene sequences matched 10 different pathogenic sequences belonging to various genera and species within the database of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens the most sequences of all the gram negative pathogens identified were acinetobacter baumannii followed by strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and haemophilus influenzae among the gram positive bacteria matched with human pathogenic sequences staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus viridans were present in the most samples fig s3 fig 7 displays the relative abundance of the different clustering based on seasons a type of samples b sample location c and type of containers d the human pathogenic bacteria were more abundant in the samples taken in may rather than those taken in january also several other potential human pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia constituted a significantly higher proportion of microbial communities in biofilm samples as compared to the source water the relative abundance of bacterial pathogens increased up to 40 when compared to the source water spring box suggesting that the microbial contamination may have originated from non source water citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter aerogenes were observed in non source water only similarly bacterial pathogen from the containers exhibited a different abundance than those of the source water fig 7 alpha diversity analyses proved that higher diversity indices were present in the household water systems implying that abundant and diverse pathogenic bacteria could increase the potential health risks in the household systems fig 4s 4 discussion the study of microbial pollutants in potable water has generally been limited in developing countries and microbial communities including their potential pathogenic bacteria in household water have not yet been fully investigated in this study we investigated microbial water quality in household water in rural regions of sub saharan africa using culture dependent and independent techniques such as qpcr and high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing this study could be the first comprehensive attempt to assess the changes in microbial communities associated with hygiene practices e g cleaning a container and sampling campaigns e g type of container location and season that could interfere with the microbial structures of the household water storage system in a developing country in this study the potential health risks observed were higher in the household containers and utensils than in the source water this is consistent with the findings of previous studies ahmed et al 2013 momba and kaleni 2002 oloruntoba et al 2016 the microbial water quality declined after being collected from the community tap and transported to the home hygiene practice cleaning water containers and the water vessel type opened closed container and the type of material used for the containers did not reduce the health risk significantly interestingly employing hygiene practices did not result in a substantial reduction of the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in the water samples one possible explanation for this might be that the short duration of the study limits our ability to draw a conclusion about more complicated hygiene practices such as larger behavioral changes and informational interventions it has been shown that hygiene practices and time intensive behaviors like cleaning the vessels more frequently are difficult for subjects to maintain hamoudi et al 2012 a socio psychological approach of behavioral change might be required to test the effectiveness of household water treatment practices davis et al 2011 lilje and mosler 2017 however the amount of time the water was stored in a household increased potential health risks plausibly due to biofilm growth and formation on the surface of the containers another possible explanation might be that the repeated use of the same containers for water storage resulted in the formation of biofilm containing bacterial cells because of the presence of biofilms on walls and sediments within the household water storage burkowska but et al 2015 mellor et al 2013 wingender and flemming 2011 in the present study we enumerated the total coliform and e coli from the household water and containers using the qpcr technique although a pcr based method could not differentiate between live and dead cells in given samples molecular microbiological testing could provide insight into the fecal contamination of the household water the concentration of genomic e coli and total coliform in the containers was significantly higher than the concentrations in the source water indicating that bacteria were able to persist and even grow in such oligotrophic environments by forming biofilm also the higher concentration of genomic e coli and total coliform might be explained by the presence of the viable but nonculturable cell vbnc inside biofilm girones et al 2010 lee and bae 2017 it has been shown that biofilms from water samples do not reflect the total cell count at least a part of the biofilm populations of bacteria persists in a viable but non culturable vbnc state and remains undetectable by the conventional methods liu et al 2008 wingender and flemming 2011 more importantly many bacterial species enter a transient state of dormancy as a strategy to survive unfavorable conditions lennon and jones 2011 when in this state bacteria cannot be detected using culture based methods but they remain viable and retain virulence under environmental stressors lennon and jones 2011 thus molecular microbiological testing could elucidate the relationship between hygiene practices and the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in a household water storage system past studies have reported that the microbial community structure of a drinking water system is governed by the source water the drinking water treatment process and the type of pipe used in the urban water system berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015 to date however little is known about the changes that happen in water s microbial communities when taken from the communal source to a household water storage container in a developing country a household s potable water supply must be collected from a single public well spring or stand pipe transported to the home and then stored for future household use oloruntoba et al 2016 by understanding the changes in microbial communities in a household water supply researchers can gain insight into the inhabitants hygiene practices and the quality of water storage the water is frequently contaminated by unhygienic conditions and or biofilm formation in the home in our study the ubiquitous and persistent genera were observed these were mainly members of phylum proteobacteria including pseudomonas acinetobacter comamonas and unassigned genus from enterobacteriaceae the pseudomonas genus organisms are mostly free living bacteria widely distributed in soil water marine environments and on the skin of animals including humans mann and wozniak 2012 also acinetobacter was ubiquitously detected in the samples acinetobacter can be isolated from freshwater estuaries sewages sea water drinking water and biofilms in drinking water distribution systems doughari et al 2011 both bacteria are able to form highly structured biofilm with distinct properties that colonize new surfaces or join existing biofilm one of most abundant bacterial families in this study was enterobacteriaceae which is a large family of gram negative bacteria that includes many of the more familiar pathogens such as salmonella escherichia coli yersinia pestis klebsiella shigella proteus enterobacter serratia and citrobacter we further interrogated the presence of potential human pathogens using metagenomic sequencing data initially after quality filtering the raw sequences were compared with the greengenes database using the qiime otus classification later the sequences were compared with the databases of a broad range of clinically relevant bacteria pathogens srinivasan et al 2015 using this approach we identified 10 different potential pathogenic bacteria in the source water and household samples the relative abundance of those potential pathogens indicated that they were pervasive in the household water and biofilm samples these pathogens included acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia the sequence matched bacteria are mostly opportunistic pathogen bacteria but they are often isolated from environments for instance citrobacter freundii is an opportunistic pathogen but it is also a resident of the human gastrointestinal tract and is often found in drinking water samples payne et al 2010 stenotrophomona maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats including plant rhizospheres animals foods and water sources brooke 2012 interestingly acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen primarily associated with hospital acquired infections peleg et al 2008 it was reported however that the environmental acinetobacter baumannii strain was similar to a clinical isolate and originated from paleosol hrenovic et al 2014 these potential pathogenic bacteria found in biofilm could be recovered from soil and water implying that household water could be contaminated during collection transport and storage also haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter freundii could come from human microbiota because they are commensal bacteria in gut and the upper respiratory arce et al 2009 payne et al 2010 overall the potential pathogen bacteria tended to be persistent in the containers and utensils as a biofilm on the water s surface the observed bacteria are known to be efficient at forming biofilm faille et al 2003 longo et al 2014 pompilio et al 2008 based on the findings presented here this study reveals several practical implications for control microbial water quality in a household water system first consistent and multiple hygiene interventions at household level required for inhibiting and removing biofilm from the containers and utensils in a household biofilm formation on containers and utensils were persistent after hygiene practices e g closed vessel and cleaning water storage container with soap the use of chlorine or bleach could be an appropriate method to remove biofilm from the water container second fecal indicator bacteria such as fecal coliform and e coli might not be a good proxy for assessing microbial water qualities in a household water system since potential pathogenic microorganisms were not enteric pathogen fecal indicator bacteria may not assess microbial water qualities where reintroduced or regrown pathogens exit in a household water system finally ngs techniques reveals microbial composition ecology diverse microorganisms leading to more representative microbial characterization and risk assessment of water quality the potential human pathogenic bacteria such as acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were related to antimicrobial resistant bacteria blasco et al 2008 brooke 2012 karumathil et al 2014 mckeon et al 1995 since self medication is a common practice in developing countries where patients often get antimicrobials without prescription potential health risks associated with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and prevalence of those bacteria in water resources in a developing country should be examined thus household hygiene practices e g point of use chemical disinfection and more comprehensive and representative risk characterization should be required to reduce health risks in water storage condition in a developing country the 16s rrna gene could prove to be a useful diagnostic tool for identifying the presence of pathogens in a water sample kumaraswamy et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2015 however some genera need further validation in addition to the 16s rrna sequences for accurate pathogen identification because even though the sequences have a more than 99 similarity to the reference database they do not conclusively prove the presence of pathogenic bacteria also the high similarity of 16s rrna sequences of species within the genera makes the ngs approach less discriminatory for pathogen identification while the presence of pathogens could be confirmed with qpcr with suitable maker genes or culturable methods it would not be feasible to screen the lists of potential human pathogens that are important in a developing country using the clinically relevant human pathogen database we could assess the overall risk of the microbial contaminants found in a household s water storage system and the inhabitants hygiene practices the findings of our approach provide a potential way to identify potential human pathogens in household water especially in a developing country where alternate suitable microbial monitoring methods are limited 5 conclusion a microbial survey of the household water in a rural community in cameroon indicated that water was frequently contaminated during the storage period before consumption culture dependent and culture independent techniques of qpcr and high throughput sequences analyses revealed more complex microbial communities exhibited in the household water containers and utensils than source water the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis revealed a rich bacterial diversity and higher abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria in biofilm which may pose a health risk to the houses inhabitants the qpcr and high throughput sequences analyses confirmed microbial regrowth and biofilm formation even after cleaning the container and utensils implying that health risk could be minimized and avoided by consistent and multiple hygiene interventions next generation sequencing for assessment of microbial water quality can serve as a tool of estimating potential health risk in a household water system conflicts interest none acknowledgements a special thank you to

20020,rural households in developing countries rely on communal water supplies and household water frequently becomes contaminated following its collection transportation and during its storage using culture dependent and independent techniques we examined the changes in microbial water quality between communal tap water and household water storage in a rural area of cameroon africa the culturable fecal indicator bacteria fib were used to assess the potential health risks associated with different household water storage conditions e g type of container and open vs closed container and interventions e g water storage days cleaned on the last day of use and hygiene practices only the amount of days the water was stored significantly differed p value 0 05 which showed that potential health risks increased when water was stored for more than 3 days the higher abundance of molecular fib in biofilm than household water suggested that omnipresent biofilm in household water could potential health risk the high throughput sequencing revealed that the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in both the water and the biofilm samples bacterial genera seen in biofilm bacteria such as pseudomonas acinetobacter and comamonas acinetobacter chryseobacterium stenotrophomonas and corynebacterium were relatively more abundant in the biofilm than in the water potential bacterial pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and haemophilus influenza were detected in household water and biofilm the microbial quality might be affected by water storage time and households repeatedly using the same water storage containers without proper sanitization triggering microbial regrowth and biofilm formation on water containers higher bacterial diversity and potentially pathogenic bacteria found in the biofilm samples of a household water supply are unhealthy for the house s inhabitants it is important to develop interventions aimed at preventing the formation of these dangerous biofilms in a communal water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water household water biofilm metagenomics developing country 1 introduction there has been significant progress in improving the quality of drinking water worldwide 91 of the global population uses an improved water source e g piped water public tap stands borehole rainwater protected spring or dug well which is an increase from 76 in 1990 dos santos et al 2017 however more than 663 million people mainly living in sub saharan africa and asia still lack access to improved sources of drinking water who unicef 2015 while the water situation has improved in sub saharan africa since 1990 the region as a whole lags behind every other developing region in the world in water and sanitation coverage dos santos et al 2017 even in communities with access to potable water the elderly and children under five years old especially face the risk of drinking contaminated water due to unsafe drinking water poor sanitation and poor hygiene mintz et al 1995 wright et al 2004 in cameroon for instance only 47 of the rural population has access to clean drinking water who unicef 2015 in rural areas microbial contaminations are recognized to be a problem during water collection and transport from the source and then in the subsequent storage of water in a household to reduce the waterborne disease in household water environmental health interventions such as household water treatments and safe storage solutions encouraging inhabitants to wash their hands with soap and proper sanitation have been highlighted davis et al 2011 wright et al 2004 for instance household water treatment better sanitation facilities and hygiene education reduced the levels of diarrhea from meta analysis fewtrell et al 2005 however the users of the communal water supply often transport their water to private residences to ensure they have enough water to last through non supply periods at these residences the water frequently becomes contaminated during storage due to poor hygienic practices mintz et al 1995 the unsafe storage of potable water and poor hygiene increased the number of coliform inside storage containers possibly due to microbial regrowth and their ability to survive as biofilm mellor et al 2013 biofilm formation has been observed on all surfaces of household containers where microorganisms can attach by secreting an extracellular polymer substance burkowska but et al 2015 mellor et al 2013 biofilm are not sensitive to environmental stressors and more resistant to antimicrobial treatments creating an environmental reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms wingender and flemming 2011 repeated use of the same water storage containers can lead to the regrowth of microorganisms and biofilm formation which poses potential health risks bisi johnson et al 2017 mellor et al 2013 stigler granados et al 2014 thomas et al 2015 van der merwe et al 2013 to date most studies of microbial water quality in developing countries have focused on the detection of specific organisms and or the quantification of coliforms using culturable methods e g the most probable number and membrane filter techniques researchers have used the traditional techniques of fecal coliform heterotrophic bacteria or e coli as surrogate bacteria to assess microbial water quality recently molecular techniques particularly the polymerase chain reaction pcr based method have been proposed as an alternative method to monitor and track pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria fib because they offer sensitive and quantitative analytical tools girones et al 2010 also the advent of the next generation sequencing ngs based on 16s rrna metagenomics has enabled the analysis of the entire microbial community of a given sample without the need for culturing the bacteria tan et al 2015 a ngs approach can provide a broad spectrum identification of different microbes along with a high resolution phylogenetic microbial community profiling while also indicating the abundance of genetic traits of the pathogens in water samples mukherjee et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of using a ngs approach to understand the changes in microbial communities of a source water and a household water storage and the effect of hygiene practices on biofilm formation in a water storage container in a developing country also it allow us to gain in depth knowledge about the comprehensive microbial quality and safety of the water available whereas detection of predetermined microbial indicators are often unable to assess all microbial pathogens particularly ngs approach could reveal the overall microbial composition ecology and diversity microorganisms leading to more comprehensive and representative risk characterization thus our research questions were designed to investigate how microbial water quality deteriorates when taken from the communal tap water supply to the household water storage container considering variables such as 1 the type of container used for water storage 2 the length of time that water is stored in a container 3 the utensil used to collect water and 4 the households associated hygienic practices to determine the microbial contamination associated with household water storage we used traditional culture based methods quantitative pcr and the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicon using the illumina miseq platform the objectives of this study were to i determine the fib concentrations of 20 household water and community tap stands in a gravity fed water distribution system in ntisaw cameroon ii quantify the molecular fib of potable water household water containers and utensils e g cups and buckets from two households and iii assess the microbial diversity and structure associated with the water and containers used in this rural area of cameroon 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site setting and household selection the field study was conducted in ntisaw a rural community in the ndu subdivision of the donga mantung division in the northwest region of cameroon the study area is characterized by a monsoon season from the end of february through november followed by an intense dry period december through mid february outside of the town of ndu which has a water supply network to pump ground water to the residents the majority of the rural communities in the subdivision lack improved water sources ntisaw has installed a gravity fed water distribution system which collects water from a protected spring and distributes the water to 16 public tap stands the village of ntisaw is comprised of two ethnic groups the mborrorro people who are primarily herders and the wimbum tribe who are mainly subsistence farmers with an average salary of two groups of approximately 100 000 cfa per year 0 57 usd per day 2 2 sampling information after water leaves the ntisaw public tap system there are two primary locations of microbial contamination during domestic storage the collection and or storage container and the utensils used to distribute the water to assess if water became contaminated samples were collected from 20 households in ntisaw 12 of the population every 1 4 weeks for 4 months february 2014 to may 2014 between 6 30am 8 30am a sample was obtained from each household s container using the utensils that the household uses to distribute water for domestic purposes in our first visits to each households we surveyed household information e g number of people water usage length of water storage and etc and microbial water qualities additionally during 2 3 of the sampling events a secondary sample was collected directly from the storage containers to determine if there was a difference in the quality of the stored water versus the water that was in contact with a household utensil all samples were plated within 2 h of collection in duplicate using 3m petrifilmtm e coli coliform ec plates 2 3 households survey households were not told when samples would be collected to prevent any alteration in behavior however this meant that some families were not home or did not have water when asked to provide samples preventing the analysis of their water for that sampling event one of the twenty households was only sampled from twice while all others were sampled 5 8 times all 20 households are included in the analysis unless otherwise stated when samples were collected households were asked to provide information on when and where the water was collected and when the container was last cleaned with soap as hygienic practices we noted how the material of the water storage container looked and if there was a container lid during the sampling events 2 4 analysis of e coli and fecal coliforms within the ec plate medium an indicator dye stains bacterial colonies red lactose traps gas under the top film to distinguish coliforms from non coliform bacteria and 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronide bcig indicates β glucuronidase gus activity when the gus enzyme cleaves bcig it yields a dark blue precipitate at the site of enzymatic activity causing a gus producing bacterial colony like escherichia coli e coli to appear blue this is referred to as fecal coliform bacteria fib in this paper however other coliform colonies are red and closely associated with entrapped gas the total coliform counts consists of both the red and blue colonies associated with gas after 24 36 h of incubation at 36 2 c the bacterial growth on the ec plates for each household was enumerated after classifying coliforms on the ec plate as total coliforms non coliforms or fecal coliform the sample was then categorized into a microbial contamination category from 0 to 8 based on the criteria shown in table 1 on days in which samples were collected from households additional samples were collected from some public taps when tested bacterial loading rates from the taps were normally in microbial contamination category 0 and never above 1 2 5 dna extraction and qpcr two of the twenty households participating in water sampling agreed to an additional water sampling event to be used for microbial community analysis both houses were located in the center of town and used the same water tap floqswab a copan flocked swab cat 502cs01 was used to collect samples from 1 the utensil which the household used to distribute water from the storage container and 2 the bucket used to collect water from the public tap researchers brushed the swab around the inside surface of the container the tip was then broken off into a sterile 15 ml test tube containing 100 μl of pbst 137 mm nacl 2 68 mm kcl 10 14 mm na2hpo4 1 76 mm kh2po4 and 0 1 tween 20 dna was extracted from those samples using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca following the protocol outlined in the manufacturer s instructions additionally 0 2 0 5 l of water was collected in sterile 250 ml bottles from 1 the households storage containers 2 the spring box which supplies all water to the village and 3 the tap from which the families collect water these samples were filtered through a magna nylon 0 22 μm filter and the filter was aseptically placed into a lysing matrix e tube with the fastprep 24 system mp biomedicals solon oh usa dna was isolated from these additional 14 samples using the ultracleantm soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the extracted dna was measured with the nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo scientific foster city all samples were transported with cold packs and then stored at 20 c until needed for further analysis amplification was done in 384 well plates in a viiatm 7 real time pcr system applied

foster city ca 2 μl of dna template and the primers probe for the total coliform maheux et al 2014 and e coli chern et al 2011 plates with no dna template were run as a negative control the thermal cycle profile consisted of 2 min at 50 c followed by 10 min at 95 c and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 60 c triplicate pcr reactions were conducted with taqman and sybr green qpcr 2 6 microbial community analysis and detection of potential human pathogens the 16s rrna genes were amplified from all the dna extracts using primer sets 515f 909r wang and qian 2009 for multiplexed 16s amplicon sequencing on the miseq system in brief pcr preparation and sequencing on the illumina miseq benchtop sequencer using pair end 250 bp kits was performed these reads were excluded from the data analysis if the average quality score was lower than 10 during the split library script performed by qiime caporaso et al 2010 chimera checking was done in qiime using usearch to remove chimeric sequences the sequences obtained were processed using qiime version 1 8 to perform operational taxonomic unit otu clustering otus defined by a 97 sequence similarity were picked using open reference based otu with uclust and the representative sequences were submitted to the rdp classifier wang et al 2007 to obtain the taxonomy assignment and relative abundance of each otu from the greengenes database desantis et al 2006 alpha diversity diversity within a given sample metrics i e chao1 shannon index and inverse simpson were determined using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 shannon evenness was calculated by dividing observed otus by the natural logarithm of the shannon index chao1 is an estimator of species richness i e number of species the inverse simpson metric is a species diversity indicator the differential abundance in a sparse high throughput microbial marker gene survey was conducted to determine otus that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple samples paulson et al 2013 beta diversity diversity among samples weighted unifrac based principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots were calculated using the r package phyloseq following rarefaction of the data using the qiime pipeline to identify potential human pathogens bioinformatics analysis was performed using qiime protocol sequences were clustered against the human pathogen database as described previously kumaraswamy et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2015 after the initial preprocessing step the sequences were clustered against the human pathogenic sequences of clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria which has 617 sequences of clinical isolates of the 16s rrna gene sequences and genus species classification srinivasan et al 2015 the threshold value was set to a 99 similarity for alignment of the otus and taxonomic identification the closed reference based out with usearch and multiple sequences alignment was done using pynast the sequences were filtered with the human pathogen database statistical and metadata analysis of the microbiome data was conducted through phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 and microbiomeanalyst dhariwal et al 2017 2 7 statistical analysis for correlating the data all statistical analyses were completed using minitab for statistical computing the non parametric method of kirskal wallis was used to compare the potential risk associated with categorical variables in addition the anova statistical test was used to analyze the difference among the abundances of e coli and total coliform as measured by two molecular qpcr assays 3 results 3 1 microbial water quality and potential health risks in household water data from the survey of 170 households in ntisaw provides a comprehensive picture of water usage and health in the community table s2 in ntisaw there are 834 people counted in this census with a mean household size of 4 9 family members that do not live in the village for at least two consecutive days every two weeks were not counted the concentrations of culturable coliform were monitored in 20 households communal water resources including protected spring and public tap waters were also monitored the quality of water at the source water and water tap were of low microbial quality having risk categories of 0 or 1 the household samples were tested as having risk categories ranging from 0 to 6 table 1 which indicates potential health risks however the microbial water quality of the household water often deteriorated with the presence of fecal coliform up to 44 cfu ml even though the water quality of the spring and public tap waters met the who guidelines for safe drinking water we surveyed the household water storage behaviors linked with health risks e g type of container and open vs closed container and potential interventions e g water storage days cleaned last day and education fig 1 shows the potential risks associated with household water storage and practices the containers that the families in ntisaw use were categorized as either a jerrycan a metal pot or a plastic bucket statistical tests of kruskal wallist indicated that the potential risks posed by the type of containers were insignificant p value 0 263 in addition the effect of having a closed or open water container on the inhabitants health was negligible in this study p value 0 735 the relationship between household storage conditions e g time stored and types of container used and potential risks were examined because the type of container and the amount of days the water was stored could be associated with microbial regrowth leading to potential health risks the potential risks were significantly different depending on the length of time the water was stored p value 0 05 showing that a storage period of more than 3 days increased potential health risks fig 1d interestingly the inhabitants hygiene practices were not clearly associated with potential health risks because there was insignificant different among the cleaned last day p value 0 406 3 2 qpcr analyses of fecal indicator bacteria in a household water system the total coliform and e coli genes were enumerated using qpcr to determine the level of microbial contamination in the water and biofilm samples from the households waters supplies two households f14 and f6 were selected to examine the abundance of fib and the formation of biofilm in household utensils only f14 was instructed to clean cups and buckets before sampling so the effect of hygienic practices could be compared as expected the concentrations of total coliform were significantly higher than those of e coli in all samples except the source water where the concentrations of total coliform and e coli were in the same order of magnitude the concentrations of total coliform and e coli from the bucket and cup samples were higher than those of the source water samples as shown in fig 2 a the abundance of total coliform and e coli however more significantly increased in biofilm than in water samples as shown in fig 2b p value 0 02 and 0 05 for e coli and total coliform respectively the abundance of e coli and total coliform increased in the household water due to bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation however the effect of hygiene practices e g cleaning containers on the reduction of e coli and total coliform was not significant implying that biofilm were persistent even after hygiene practices were employed by the household 3 3 analysis of microbial communities in the household water taxonomic composition of water and biofilm samples revealed that the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria in the household water except for one biofilm sample from a cup ms14c2 fig 3 shows the relative abundance of microbial diversity indicating that alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria are consistently the most abundant among clades on the class level others included actinobacteria cytophagia bacilli flavobacteriia and clostridia under the proteobacteria phylum burkholderiales pseudomonadales enterobacteriales and xanthomonadales were the most predominant bacterial families at the genus level the most abundant genera included unassigned groups from pseudomonas acinetobacter enterobacteriaceae comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae figs s1 and s2 to understand the changes in microbial communities caused by the households water storage and hygiene practices the relative abundances of microbial communities were clustered by the type of water storage containers and sample type biofilm vs water sampling location and seasonal variation when the types of containers were examined acinetobacter was most abundant in the bucket 36 cup 42 and source water 67 but methylobacterium erwinia sphingobacterium brachybacterium were present in the buckets and cups only as shown in fig 4 the second most abundant genera were comamonas bucket and source water and pseudomonas cup the microbial distribution observed in the water and biofilm samples were similar even though acinetobacter chryseobacterium stenotrophomonas and corynebacterium were relatively more abundant in biofilm than in water also the most abundant genus in the source water spring box was pseudomonas while acinetobacter was the most abundant in the other samples tap stand family 6 and family 14 indicating that microbial compositions changed during transport and storage alpha diversities were calculated within a given community to understand how the type of containers the water biofilm samples locations or season altered the species richness and evenness in fig 5 alpha diversity metrics of the type of containers demonstrated that the microbial communities observed in the household container were more diverse than those observed in the source water implying that microbial communities originated not only from the source water but also from other sources such as the soil humans and the air the observed and chao 1 indices in biofilm and water showed that species richness did not significantly differ p value 0 05 while the shannon and inverse simpson indices from biofilm were significantly different than those of the water p value 0 05 since shannon and inverse simpson indices measure the distribution of an individual among groups high indices show a low homogeneity of species suggesting specific otus were more abundant than others in the biofilm taxonomically less diverse biofilm on the surface of buckets and cups implied that biofilm colonizers would persist in the household water storage containers for instance the differential abundance analysis using microbiomeanalyst showed that genera of brachybacterium erwinia enhydrobacter citrobacter deinococcus were differentially abundant in the biofilm p value 0 05 a principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted to visualize similarities or dissimilarities in the microbial community in fig 6 although no obvious clustering was apparent between the biofilm and water samples biofilm samples clustered separately from the spring box and tap stand samples suggesting that the biofilm community was relatively distinct and far from the water microbiome no distinct clustering between family 14 and family 6 indicated that hygiene practices might not have a strong effect on the microbial communities in the houses water systems 3 4 estimation of potential human pathogens in the household water system using high throughput 16s rrna gene analysis the 16s rrna gene sequences were compared against the human pathogenic sequences using closed reference out calling the 16s rrna gene sequences matched 10 different pathogenic sequences belonging to various genera and species within the database of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens the most sequences of all the gram negative pathogens identified were acinetobacter baumannii followed by strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and haemophilus influenzae among the gram positive bacteria matched with human pathogenic sequences staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus viridans were present in the most samples fig s3 fig 7 displays the relative abundance of the different clustering based on seasons a type of samples b sample location c and type of containers d the human pathogenic bacteria were more abundant in the samples taken in may rather than those taken in january also several other potential human pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia constituted a significantly higher proportion of microbial communities in biofilm samples as compared to the source water the relative abundance of bacterial pathogens increased up to 40 when compared to the source water spring box suggesting that the microbial contamination may have originated from non source water citrobacter freundii stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter aerogenes were observed in non source water only similarly bacterial pathogen from the containers exhibited a different abundance than those of the source water fig 7 alpha diversity analyses proved that higher diversity indices were present in the household water systems implying that abundant and diverse pathogenic bacteria could increase the potential health risks in the household systems fig 4s 4 discussion the study of microbial pollutants in potable water has generally been limited in developing countries and microbial communities including their potential pathogenic bacteria in household water have not yet been fully investigated in this study we investigated microbial water quality in household water in rural regions of sub saharan africa using culture dependent and independent techniques such as qpcr and high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing this study could be the first comprehensive attempt to assess the changes in microbial communities associated with hygiene practices e g cleaning a container and sampling campaigns e g type of container location and season that could interfere with the microbial structures of the household water storage system in a developing country in this study the potential health risks observed were higher in the household containers and utensils than in the source water this is consistent with the findings of previous studies ahmed et al 2013 momba and kaleni 2002 oloruntoba et al 2016 the microbial water quality declined after being collected from the community tap and transported to the home hygiene practice cleaning water containers and the water vessel type opened closed container and the type of material used for the containers did not reduce the health risk significantly interestingly employing hygiene practices did not result in a substantial reduction of the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in the water samples one possible explanation for this might be that the short duration of the study limits our ability to draw a conclusion about more complicated hygiene practices such as larger behavioral changes and informational interventions it has been shown that hygiene practices and time intensive behaviors like cleaning the vessels more frequently are difficult for subjects to maintain hamoudi et al 2012 a socio psychological approach of behavioral change might be required to test the effectiveness of household water treatment practices davis et al 2011 lilje and mosler 2017 however the amount of time the water was stored in a household increased potential health risks plausibly due to biofilm growth and formation on the surface of the containers another possible explanation might be that the repeated use of the same containers for water storage resulted in the formation of biofilm containing bacterial cells because of the presence of biofilms on walls and sediments within the household water storage burkowska but et al 2015 mellor et al 2013 wingender and flemming 2011 in the present study we enumerated the total coliform and e coli from the household water and containers using the qpcr technique although a pcr based method could not differentiate between live and dead cells in given samples molecular microbiological testing could provide insight into the fecal contamination of the household water the concentration of genomic e coli and total coliform in the containers was significantly higher than the concentrations in the source water indicating that bacteria were able to persist and even grow in such oligotrophic environments by forming biofilm also the higher concentration of genomic e coli and total coliform might be explained by the presence of the viable but nonculturable cell vbnc inside biofilm girones et al 2010 lee and bae 2017 it has been shown that biofilms from water samples do not reflect the total cell count at least a part of the biofilm populations of bacteria persists in a viable but non culturable vbnc state and remains undetectable by the conventional methods liu et al 2008 wingender and flemming 2011 more importantly many bacterial species enter a transient state of dormancy as a strategy to survive unfavorable conditions lennon and jones 2011 when in this state bacteria cannot be detected using culture based methods but they remain viable and retain virulence under environmental stressors lennon and jones 2011 thus molecular microbiological testing could elucidate the relationship between hygiene practices and the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in a household water storage system past studies have reported that the microbial community structure of a drinking water system is governed by the source water the drinking water treatment process and the type of pipe used in the urban water system berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015 to date however little is known about the changes that happen in water s microbial communities when taken from the communal source to a household water storage container in a developing country a household s potable water supply must be collected from a single public well spring or stand pipe transported to the home and then stored for future household use oloruntoba et al 2016 by understanding the changes in microbial communities in a household water supply researchers can gain insight into the inhabitants hygiene practices and the quality of water storage the water is frequently contaminated by unhygienic conditions and or biofilm formation in the home in our study the ubiquitous and persistent genera were observed these were mainly members of phylum proteobacteria including pseudomonas acinetobacter comamonas and unassigned genus from enterobacteriaceae the pseudomonas genus organisms are mostly free living bacteria widely distributed in soil water marine environments and on the skin of animals including humans mann and wozniak 2012 also acinetobacter was ubiquitously detected in the samples acinetobacter can be isolated from freshwater estuaries sewages sea water drinking water and biofilms in drinking water distribution systems doughari et al 2011 both bacteria are able to form highly structured biofilm with distinct properties that colonize new surfaces or join existing biofilm one of most abundant bacterial families in this study was enterobacteriaceae which is a large family of gram negative bacteria that includes many of the more familiar pathogens such as salmonella escherichia coli yersinia pestis klebsiella shigella proteus enterobacter serratia and citrobacter we further interrogated the presence of potential human pathogens using metagenomic sequencing data initially after quality filtering the raw sequences were compared with the greengenes database using the qiime otus classification later the sequences were compared with the databases of a broad range of clinically relevant bacteria pathogens srinivasan et al 2015 using this approach we identified 10 different potential pathogenic bacteria in the source water and household samples the relative abundance of those potential pathogens indicated that they were pervasive in the household water and biofilm samples these pathogens included acinetobacter baumannii citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia the sequence matched bacteria are mostly opportunistic pathogen bacteria but they are often isolated from environments for instance citrobacter freundii is an opportunistic pathogen but it is also a resident of the human gastrointestinal tract and is often found in drinking water samples payne et al 2010 stenotrophomona maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats including plant rhizospheres animals foods and water sources brooke 2012 interestingly acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen primarily associated with hospital acquired infections peleg et al 2008 it was reported however that the environmental acinetobacter baumannii strain was similar to a clinical isolate and originated from paleosol hrenovic et al 2014 these potential pathogenic bacteria found in biofilm could be recovered from soil and water implying that household water could be contaminated during collection transport and storage also haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter freundii could come from human microbiota because they are commensal bacteria in gut and the upper respiratory arce et al 2009 payne et al 2010 overall the potential pathogen bacteria tended to be persistent in the containers and utensils as a biofilm on the water s surface the observed bacteria are known to be efficient at forming biofilm faille et al 2003 longo et al 2014 pompilio et al 2008 based on the findings presented here this study reveals several practical implications for control microbial water quality in a household water system first consistent and multiple hygiene interventions at household level required for inhibiting and removing biofilm from the containers and utensils in a household biofilm formation on containers and utensils were persistent after hygiene practices e g closed vessel and cleaning water storage container with soap the use of chlorine or bleach could be an appropriate method to remove biofilm from the water container second fecal indicator bacteria such as fecal coliform and e coli might not be a good proxy for assessing microbial water qualities in a household water system since potential pathogenic microorganisms were not enteric pathogen fecal indicator bacteria may not assess microbial water qualities where reintroduced or regrown pathogens exit in a household water system finally ngs techniques reveals microbial composition ecology diverse microorganisms leading to more representative microbial characterization and risk assessment of water quality the potential human pathogenic bacteria such as acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa citrobacter freundii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were related to antimicrobial resistant bacteria blasco et al 2008 brooke 2012 karumathil et al 2014 mckeon et al 1995 since self medication is a common practice in developing countries where patients often get antimicrobials without prescription potential health risks associated with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and prevalence of those bacteria in water resources in a developing country should be examined thus household hygiene practices e g point of use chemical disinfection and more comprehensive and representative risk characterization should be required to reduce health risks in water storage condition in a developing country the 16s rrna gene could prove to be a useful diagnostic tool for identifying the presence of pathogens in a water sample kumaraswamy et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2015 however some genera need further validation in addition to the 16s rrna sequences for accurate pathogen identification because even though the sequences have a more than 99 similarity to the reference database they do not conclusively prove the presence of pathogenic bacteria also the high similarity of 16s rrna sequences of species within the genera makes the ngs approach less discriminatory for pathogen identification while the presence of pathogens could be confirmed with qpcr with suitable maker genes or culturable methods it would not be feasible to screen the lists of potential human pathogens that are important in a developing country using the clinically relevant human pathogen database we could assess the overall risk of the microbial contaminants found in a household s water storage system and the inhabitants hygiene practices the findings of our approach provide a potential way to identify potential human pathogens in household water especially in a developing country where alternate suitable microbial monitoring methods are limited 5 conclusion a microbial survey of the household water in a rural community in cameroon indicated that water was frequently contaminated during the storage period before consumption culture dependent and culture independent techniques of qpcr and high throughput sequences analyses revealed more complex microbial communities exhibited in the household water containers and utensils than source water the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis revealed a rich bacterial diversity and higher abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria in biofilm which may pose a health risk to the houses inhabitants the qpcr and high throughput sequences analyses confirmed microbial regrowth and biofilm formation even after cleaning the container and utensils implying that health risk could be minimized and avoided by consistent and multiple hygiene interventions next generation sequencing for assessment of microbial water quality can serve as a tool of estimating potential health risk in a household water system conflicts interest none acknowledgements a special thank you to

20021,flow cytomtery fcm has become a standard approach to enumerate viruses in water research however the nature of the fluorescent signal in flow cytometric analysis of water samples and the mechanism of its formation have not been addressed for bacteriophages expected in wastewaters here we assess the behaviour of fluorescent dna staining dyes in aqueous solutions as well as sensitivity and accuracy of fcm for enumeration of dna stained model bacteriophages λ p1 and t4 we demonstrate that in aqueous systems fluorescent dyes form a self stabilized pseudolyophilic emulsion of auto fluorescing colloid particles sample shaking and addition of surfactants enhance auto fluorescence due to increased dispersion and in the presence of surfactants stabilization of the dye emulsion bacteriophages with genome sizes 100 kbp i e λ p1 did not generate a distinct population signal to be detected by one of the most sensitive fcm instruments available bd lsr fortessa x 20 whereas the larger t4 bacteriophage was resolved as a distinct population of events these results indicate that the use of fluorescent dyes for bacteriophage enumeration by flow cytometry can produce false

critical to the presence of possible artifacts analysed by fcm this dye produces small crystals or amorphous mass which may also lead to uneven distribution of the sybr fluorophore among the aliquots

controls with no surfactant added flow cytometric analysis of various concentrations of sybr green i in te demonstrated a distinct population of fluorescent particles event counts in some random sample tubes were much higher than in other replicate tubes with supposedly the same concentration of sybr data not shown most likely this variability was the effect of non uniform dispersion of sybr

dilutions as well as when compared with the plaque assay counts fig 8 however significant disturbing of the samples led to decreased fcm virus events fig 7 d f and estimated numbers did not correspond to the plaque assay data therefore care in sample handling is also important when quantifying t4 bacteriophages by fcm 4 discussion 4 1 fcm artifacts due to colloidal fluorophore particulates as sybr green i is a hydrophobic chemical with low solubility in aqueous solvents national center for biotechnology information pubchem compound database cid 10436340 https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 10436340 accessed july 20 2017 there are inherent problems in using such fluorophores when targeting small particles like viruses by fcm though not widely discussed in the microbiological literature sybr green i forms a disperse colloid rather than a homogenous molecular solution disperse systems can be formed via two main routes mechanical dispersion or condensation from oversaturated solutions shchukin et al 2001 for example heating samples to 80 c during staining procedure enhances oversaturation of the solution and colloid particles start forming as the temperature decreases the fact that fluorescent particles appear in both heated and unheated samples demonstrates that either route or both routes together might contribute to sybr green i dispersion a further indication of this dispersion was seen by the sybr fcm signal increase by shaking sonication or pipetting presumably due to the increase in auto fluorescing dye colloidal particles to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of such chemical aspect of fluorescent dyes and its associated interference with small particle enumeration by fcm consequently keeping samples undisturbed for certain amounts of time reduces these apparent virus event counts this is a typical behaviour of lyophobic disperse systems shchukin et al 2001 in such systems mechanically dispersed colloid particles tend to coagulate and if interaction energy between the particles allows they will coalesce into larger particles when the interaction energy is insufficient due to low concentration and small diameter of remaining particles coalescence becomes impossible and the disperse system self stabilizes shchukin et al 2001 our findings demonstrate that sybr green i as it is used in flow cytometry for virus enumeration looks like a good example of a self stabilized or pseudolyophilic system such behaviour is not unique to sybr green i as the fluorescent dye safeview plus applied biological materials inc ref g468 was also shown to self stabilize in solution in the same manner which we confirmed by flow cytometry s4 furthermore the addition of surfactants to a panel of sybr green i solutions generated and stabilized artifact particles into emulsions fig 3 which could be misidentified as virus populations by fcm hence when high gain levels are used to enumerate small particle virions by fcm hydrophobic fluorophores may generate various levels of false positive virus signals the same phenomenon was observed earlier by pollard 2012 who compared the excitation and emission spectra of organic matter in water in parallel with intact virus particles and confirmed that about 70 of the fluorescent signal was associated with the matrix itself independently of the presence or absence of virus although pollard did not use flow cytometry his findings contribute to our observations that fluorescent colloid dye particles present in dye stained virus suspensions can comprise a significant portion of the fcm signal hence the use of fluorescent dyes for virus enumeration by flow cytometry may produce false positive signals and lead to overestimation of total virus counts by misreporting colloid particles as virions depending on instrument sensitivity further research is needed to optimize reporting procedures involving small particle count in pseudolyophilic colloid systems so as to address stained virus and no virus but stain present controls as discussed below 4 2 precautions for identification of target virion populations by fcm to reduce misidentification of virions in environmental matrices the instrument and assay sensitivity could be estimated using a panel of bacteriophages of various genome sizes as such the target population s could be identified by gating it them from the total stained suspension signal as illustrated in the current work serial dilutions of the sample need to be correlated with the decline in target signal which should be independent of dye concentration and should appear as a defined target population e g fig 7 once the population is identified and gated fcm signal counts should correlate to bacteriophage enumeration by a second established method such as culture based plaque assay e g fig 8 stained no virus aqueous phase control should always be applied during target identification in order to minimize false positive signals in addition staining of virus particles with nucleic acid stains may require heating of the samples to 80 c in order to expose viral nucleic acid brussaard 2009 successful enumeration of nucleic acid targets relies on gentle handling of such heated samples we speculate that in order for the number of fluorescent signals to correlate to the number of target nucleic acid molecules associated with virions the freshly heated and released viral dna needs to remain compact rough handling of the sample could untangle the dna molecule creating distant contact points with the dye and therefore decreasing the intensity of dye signal associated with a single dna molecule 5 conclusions commonly used fluorescent dyes create pseudolyophilic colloid systems which auto fluoresce as stained virus like particles even in the absence of dna the presence of surfactants further enhances non specific fluorescence of such dye colloids and therefore use of surfactants for sample preparation should be avoided altogether these interfere with small particle enumeration by fluorescence based assays such as flow cytometry successful enumeration relies on correct identification of the target population by the careful use of negative virus control samples the instrument sensitivity should be assessed by comparison with established culture based methods given the pseudolyophilic colloidal nature of fluorophores used in fcm sample handling can additionally affect the accuracy of virus enumeration overall further research is needed to optimize the use of fluorescent dyes for virus quantification

particles coalescence becomes impossible and the disperse system self stabilizes shchukin et al 2001 our findings demonstrate that sybr green i as it is used in flow cytometry for virus enumeration looks like a good example of a self stabilized or pseudolyophilic system such behaviour is not unique to sybr green i as the fluorescent dye safeview plus applied biological materials inc ref g468 was also shown to self stabilize in solution in the same manner which we confirmed by flow cytometry s4 furthermore the addition of surfactants to a panel of sybr green i solutions generated and stabilized artifact particles into emulsions fig 3 which could be misidentified as virus populations by fcm hence when high gain levels are used to enumerate small particle virions by fcm hydrophobic fluorophores may generate various levels of false positive virus signals the same phenomenon was observed earlier by pollard 2012 who compared the excitation and emission spectra of organic matter in water in parallel with intact virus particles and confirmed that about 70 of the fluorescent signal was associated with the matrix itself independently of the presence or absence of virus although pollard did not use flow cytometry his findings contribute to our observations that fluorescent colloid dye particles present in dye stained virus suspensions can comprise a significant portion of the fcm signal hence the use of fluorescent dyes for virus enumeration by flow cytometry may produce false positive signals and lead to overestimation of total virus counts by misreporting colloid particles as virions depending on instrument sensitivity further research is needed to optimize reporting procedures involving small particle count in pseudolyophilic colloid systems so as to address stained virus and no virus but stain present controls as discussed below 4 2 precautions for identification of target virion populations by fcm to reduce misidentification of virions in environmental matrices the instrument and assay sensitivity could be estimated using a panel of bacteriophages of various genome sizes as such the target population s could be identified by gating it them from the total stained suspension signal as illustrated in the current work serial dilutions of the sample need to be correlated with the decline in target signal which should be independent of dye concentration and should appear as a defined target population e g fig 7 once the population is identified and gated fcm signal counts should correlate to bacteriophage enumeration by a second established method such as culture based plaque assay e g fig 8 stained no virus aqueous phase control should always be applied during target identification in order to minimize false positive signals in addition staining of virus particles with nucleic acid stains may require heating of the samples to 80 c in order to expose viral nucleic acid brussaard 2009 successful enumeration of nucleic acid targets relies on gentle handling of such heated samples we speculate that in order for the number of fluorescent signals to correlate to the number of target nucleic acid molecules associated with virions the freshly heated and released viral dna needs to remain compact rough handling of the sample could untangle the dna molecule creating distant contact points with the dye and therefore decreasing the intensity of dye signal associated with a single dna molecule 5 conclusions commonly used fluorescent dyes create pseudolyophilic colloid systems which auto fluoresce as stained virus like particles even in the absence of dna the presence of surfactants further enhances non specific fluorescence of such dye colloids and therefore use of surfactants for sample preparation should be avoided altogether these interfere with small particle enumeration by fluorescence based assays such as flow cytometry successful enumeration relies on correct identification of the target population by the careful use of negative virus control samples the instrument sensitivity should be assessed by comparison with established culture based methods given the pseudolyophilic colloidal nature of fluorophores used in fcm sample handling can additionally affect the accuracy of virus enumeration overall further research is needed to optimize the use of fluorescent dyes for virus quantification

20022,urban water and wastewater utilities are striving to improve their environmental and economic performances due to multiple challenges such as increasingly stringent quality criterion aging infrastructure constraining financial burden growing urban population climate challenges and dwindling resources growing needs of holistic assessments of urban water systems are required to identify systems level cross domain solutions this study evaluated the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of urban water and wastewater systems with two utilities in greater cincinnati region as a case study the scope of this study includes the entire urban water and wastewater systems starting from raw water acquisition for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge the detailed process based life cycle models were developed based on the datasets provided by local water and wastewater utilities the life cycle assessment indicated that the operation and maintenance of drinking water distribution was a dominating contributor for energy consumption 43 and global warming potential 41 wastewater discharge from the wastewater treatment plant contributed to more than 80 of the total eutrophication potential the cost analysis determined that labor and maintenance cost 19 for wastewater collection and electricity cost 13 for drinking water distribution were major contributors electricity purchased by the utility was the driver for the majority of impact categories assessed with the exception of eutrophication blue water use and metal depletion infrastructure requirements had a negligible influence on impact results contributing less than 3 to most categories with the exception of metal depletion where it led to 68 of total burdens sensitivity analysis showed that the life cycle environmental results were more sensitive to the choice of the electricity mixes and electricity consumption than the rest of input parameters such as chemical dosages and infrastructure life time this is one of the first comprehensive studies of the whole urban water system using real case data it elucidates a bigger picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban centralized water system inherent to a modern city as large population centers a significant expenditure has to be invested to provide water services function moving water treating water wastewater in order to avoid human and environmental health problems this study provides insights for optimization potentials of overall treatment efficiency and can serve as a benchmark for communities considering adoption of alternative water systems keywords water wastewater urban water systems life cycle assessment environmental impacts cost 1 introduction sustainable urban water systems are vital to provide the public with drinking water and sanitation services and to promote the balanced environmental economic and social health of communities now and in the future currently most urban water systems in developed countries have been managed to satisfy the urban water and sanitation demands through centralized configurations however with multiple challenges such as increasingly stringent quality criterion aging infrastructure constraining financial burden growing urban population climate effects and the promotion of sustainable and healthy communities there is urgent need for systematically evaluating the performance of the current infrastructure and identifying strategies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban water system management life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost lcc analysis can assess the whole urban water system in a comprehensive way to identify critical processes and potential areas for improvement of the system lca is a well established system accounting method to quantify energy consumption and environmental impacts through the entire life cycle of a product or process lca studies of water systems track various environmental impacts derived from direct and supply chain activities complementary to the lca approach lcc analyses quantify the financial costs of water systems from raw material extraction construction operation and demolishment at the end of life the existing body of literature contributes greatly to the understanding of the environmental and economic impacts of the whole urban water system but lack in the following three areas first life cycle studies of whole urban water systems in the u s based on the use of real utility datasets are still missing life cycle studies of whole urban water systems are necessary to understand the relative contributions of water and wastewater systems and to serve as a baseline assessment for system optimization and adaptation loubet et al 2014 ma et al 2015 xue et al 2015 as documented by a recent review article loubet et al 2014 and several recent case studies jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 xue et al 2016 a few lca studies quantified the life cycle environmental impacts of the entire urban water and wastewater system amores et al 2013 arpke and hutzler 2006 jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 lemos et al 2013 loubet et al 2014 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 slagstad and brattebø 2014 the majority of these studies have focused on water and wastewater services in europe and australia with some exceptions arpke and hutzler 2006 jeong et al 2015 xue et al 2016 it was estimated the energy consumption and global warming potential gwp of a water and wastewater system in the united states without cost implications arpke and hutzler 2006 the life cycle environmental impacts of water and wastewater systems in atlanta was assessed jeong et al 2015 but the study heavily relied on european datasets for the infrastructure construction phase although another study xue et al 2016 evaluated the impacts of various water and wastewater option the scales were at the household level there are differences in unit treatment processes in u s and other areas in the world such as disinfection or disposal strategies the lca of urban water and wastewater treatment built with actual utility datasets in north america are still needed to understand how the local specificity could affect the outcome and how the results can be used for decision making another limitation is that many lca studies of whole urban water systems have not identified the contribution of the unit processes to the overall life cycle environmental impacts although the aggregation of the processes might be helpful as a screening approach it is not particularly useful for decision makers pinpointing the issues and finding solutions a few studies have assessed the contribution of unit processes in either water or wastewater treatment plants however the scope of these studies bonton and barbeau 2012 hospido et al 2010 igos et al 2014 langevin et al 2010 lederer and rechberger 2010 pradel et al 2010 are limited to a single or a few stages of the whole urban system the analyses that cover the entire water system and assess stage contributions at unit process level to the environmental impacts of the overall water system remain limited lastly the debate of relative contributions between infrastructure and operational phases is ongoing some found that the contributions of construction phase were minimal while others indicated a significant role in multiple environmental categories detailed inventories of infrastructure materials and machinery and associated energy requirements are necessary to elucidate the relative contributions of infrastructure phase expanding on previous work this study presents a life cycle environmental and economic analysis of an urban water system as a whole using u s specific real case data from the greater cincinnati region this study developed more detailed inventory and assessment in two major areas including 1 the contribution of unit processes in the entire water and wastewater treatment trains and 2 the contribution of infrastructure stage at the unit process level a companion emergy study arden et al 2019 was also conducted to evaluate the same system from the thermodynamic perspective for a multi faceted evaluation together they provide a more complete picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban water system while providing insights for more sustainable water system management 2 method 2 1 life cycle assessment standard approaches for goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact analysis and interpretation as described by the international organization for standardization s iso 14040 series were used and summarized below international organization for standardization 2010 2 1 1 goal and scope this study aims to understand 1 the detailed process based life cycle models from real treatment plant data so that the utility managers are able to make targeted decisions 2 the importance of integration of water and wastewater management and a bigger picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban centralized water system 3 the environmental impacts and costs of an urban water system using the greater cincinnati region as a case study and identify the contributions of the unit processes on their respective impacts fig 1 illustrates the system boundary of the lca model the processes start at the acquisition of source water from the ohio river and end at the discharge of wastewater effluent to mill creek material energy and transportation inputs and environmental releases which occurred during infrastructure construction and facility operation were included the 22 unit processes of water and wastewater systems were created to represent richard miller drinking water treatment dwt and mill creek wastewater treatment plants wwtp in cincinnati ohio for the year 2011 richard miller dwt provides drinking water to parts of hamilton butler warren and clermont counties in ohio and boone county kentucky with an operating capacity of 120 mgd mill creek wwtp is the largest wastewater treatment plant among the 7 main plants within the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati msdgc with a nominal capacity of 120 mgd and maximum capacity of 360 mgd for combined sewer during wet weather the unit processes for the water treatment train include source water acquisition flocculation sedimentation filtration adsorption conditioning primary disinfection fluoridation and water distribution the unit processes for wastewater treatment train include wastewater collection grit removal primary sedimentation aeration secondary clarifier and sludge handling primary disinfection and wastewater discharge the detailed description of dwt and wwtp system is shown in figs s1 and s2 the functional unit reflects that the provision of drinking water and sanitation services is the key service of water and wastewater systems aligned with previous lca studies 1 m3 of treated and distributed water meeting or exceeding national primary drinking water regulations was initially used as the functional unit for the drinking water analysis and 1 m3 of treated and discharged wastewater was initially used as the functional unit for the wastewater analysis results for drinking water and wastewater are combined here to a functional unit of 1 m3 of delivered drinking water which is subsequently treated after use to illustrate the comprehensive impact of municipal water treatment services while on average 30 of drinking water is used for outdoor activities in the us this study assumes that in the long term all drinking water will eventually be treated as wastewater and the ratio of delivered drinking water to treated wastewater is 1 1 ma et al 2015 national research council of the national academies 2006 based on local utility datasets 19 of treated drinking water was lost through leakage during distribution drinking water treatment plant dwtp impacts were therefore scaled up based on the distribution leakage rate with the existing combined sewer system in cincinnati stormwater penetration accounts for 24 of flow to the wwtp during wet events however when the combined sewer flow exceeds the maximum capacity of the wwtp the excess flow presenting approximately 17 of the average annual flow bypasses the secondary treatment since the majority of stormwater bypasses secondary treatment the functional unit in this analysis is not adjusted based on stormwater flow which can also vary greatly seasonally and from dry years to wet years 2 1 2 life cycle inventory the foreground inventory data for the life cycle inventory lci were provided by greater cincinnati water works gcww and the msdgc through an iterative questionnaire process and were documented using federal commons lci unit process templates usda national agricultural library 2017 additionally site visit and periodic discussions with utilities were conducted to ensure appropriate use of infrastructure and operational datasets the detailed material energy and transport inputs for constructing and operating water and wastewater systems at unit process level are documented in tables s1 s14 since the year 2011 was the most recent year when the operational data for the water system was available for this study the ultraviolet uv operation adopted by gcww in 2013 was not included in the system boundary for upstream processes such as chemical and electricity production data were taken from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel u s life cycle inventory database us lci national renewable energy laboratory 2012 a publicly available lci source the openlca1 6 software was used to construct the lci for the urban water system in cincinnati due to its transparency and public availability in the wwtp the biogenic carbon dioxide co2 emission from aeration and greenhouse gas ghg emissions from the sludge incineration process were computed for a complete ghg inventory table s8 but only the fossil co2 was included in the impact assessment because municipal wastewater mostly comes from food which has a short rotation period resulting in negligible net gwp cherubini et al 2011 liu et al 2017 msdgc provided the input parameters including volume of aerobic reactor annual flow of influent wastewater influent and effluent total suspended solids and solids retention time while the remaining parameters of a typical conventional activated sludge treatment system were obtained from literature monteith et al 2005 the methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from the aeration and sludge thickening processes were determined to be minimal foley and lant 2010 the ghg emissions of sludge incineration were estimated based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2006 guidelines which included sludge volume and incineration temperature according to the ipcc guidelines a range of 40 50 of carbon content of dry sludge and 4 85 10 5 kg of ch4 emitted kg of dry sludge burned were used to estimate ch4 emissions intergovernmental panel on climate change n2o emissions were calculated based on a default value for nitrogen content of dry sludge published by the biosolids emissions assessment model canadian council of ministers of the environment 2009 2 1 3 life cycle impact assessment the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and environmental impacts traci version 2 0 developed by the u s epa specifically to model environmental and human health impacts in the u s was the primary life cycle impact assessment lcia method applied in this work us environmental protection agency 2014 additionally the recipe method was used to characterize fossil fuel and metal depletion goedkoop et al 2008 life cycle energy consumption was tracked using the cumulative energy demand method swiss centre for life cycle inventories 2010 as guided by the water footprint assessment manual goedkoop et al 2009 the blue water footprint served as an additional impact category to represent the direct and indirect water withdrawal in water and wastewater processes the impact assessment categories and the underlying methods that were considered are summarized in table s15 life cycle impacts were analyzed to include the contributions of 1 various life cycle stages and unit processes within the entire treatment train and 2 infrastructure and operation stages 2 2 life cycle cost assessment the annual operational and maintenance o m costs in year 2011 provided by gcww were allocated to each unit process and normalized to 1 m3 of drinking water delivered for the water system for the cost in wastewater the annual o m cost in year 2012 was provided by msdgc and allocated to each unit process and normalized to 1 m3 of wastewater treated for the wastewater system delivered drinking water and wastewater life cycle costs were also combined to represent the same functional unit as the lca plant wide costs such as insurance and o m labor costs were calculated and represented in the overhead category the infrastructure cost was not included in this study due to data limitation since some pipes tanks and machinery were more than a century old baseline drinking water and wastewater life cycle costs are important to incorporate as an additional metric in the analysis to understand trade offs between unit process cost considerations and lca findings baseline cost results can also be utilized in the future to understand how changing the treatment plant configurations and or operations will impact the underlying economics of municipal water treatment 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the influences of 16 key input parameters on the lca and lcc results the assessed input parameters included chlorine usage by the dwtp lime usage by dwtp alum coagulant usage by dwtp sodium hypochlorite usages by dwtp and wwtp natural gas usage for granular activated carbon gac reactivation by dwtp electricity usages at the dwtp water distribution wastewater collection and wwtp respectively carbon content of incinerated sludge and lifetimes of dwtp water distribution infrastructure wastewater collection infrastructure and wwtp respectively in addition the influences of choices of electricity grids on life cycle environmental impacts of the urban water system were assessed 3 results 3 1 contribution of unit processes to the life cycle environmental and economic impacts the process contribution analysis fig 2 indicates that electricity used for water distribution was the primary contributor for environmental impact categories including fossil fuel depletion and energy demand the electricity consumption during dwtp in plant pumping water distribution and wastewater aeration resulted in 21 43 and 13 of total fossil fuel depletion respectively except for the gravity driven wastewater collection system moving water whether in the network or in plant as well as disintegrating organics in wastewater is energy intensive stokes and horvath 2009 detailed contribution results for specific unit processes in the life cycle of 1 m3 of water delivered and subsequently treated are provided in table s17 moreover water distribution 41 and dwtp in plant pumping 20 ranked as the top two significant contributing processes for gwp other gwp contributors included aeration at the wwtp 12 and sludge incineration 7 eutrophication impacts were overwhelmingly dominated by the release of wastewater effluent even though the average ammonia 7 66 g m3 and phosphorus 0 55 g m3 levels in 2011 met the discharge standards the second biggest contributor for eutrophication potential 5 5 was the landfill disposal of sediment from the dwtp the findings on eutrophication are consistent with previous studies amores et al 2013 buckley et al 2011 friedrich et al 2009 lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 which confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus releases from the wastewater discharge were the major contributors to the eutrophication impact in other regions furthermore water distribution accounts for over 3 100 miles of piping the collection system has less than 1 700 miles and was the largest contributor 61 to metal depletion while the primary material for drinking water distribution network is ductile iron the wastewater collection pipe network mainly consists of concrete pipes notably productions of the chemicals used in water conditioning in dwtp to adjust ph added another 11 to the metal depletion results also two of the biggest contributors for human health noncancer impact included water distribution and chemical usage together contributing to 65 of human health noncancer impact while water distribution remained the biggest contributor 32 to ecotoxicity impact the second biggest contributor was sludge thickening and dewatering stage due to the application of polymer polyacrylamide and its upstream production in addition cost based rankings were different from the life cycle impact rankings due to the inclusion of labor expenditure in cost the lcc analysis found that wastewater collection accounted for 19 of the total cost mainly due to the expensive labor followed by drinking water distribution contributing for 13 fig 2 sludge thickening wastewater system overhead and drinking water plant wide overhead contributed to around 10 11 of the total cost the rest of the stages contributed to less than 8 of the total cost 3 2 underlying drivers of life cycle environmental impacts fig 3 displays the underlying drivers of the life cycle impacts including direct on site air and water releases as well as on site fuel consumption impacts associated with generation and delivery of electricity purchased by the utilities burdens for infrastructure production and impacts from chemical and material production and transportation upstream electricity generation and delivery processes from electricity purchased by the utilities were the primary contributors for global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion and human health categories the detailed unit process contributions to the life cycle impacts are list in table s17 as shown in fig 3 the infrastructure stage combined water and wastewater contributed to less than 10 of environmental impacts with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories the infrastructure stage dominated the metal depletion impact category mainly due to the metal requirement for drinking water distribution and sewer collection networks infrastructure contributed 13 to total human health noncancer impact due to carbon disulfide air emissions from cast iron production processes table s18 the direct use of natural gas diesel and gasoline within water and wastewater treatment plants categorized as utility on site fuel usage only resulted in 5 of life cycle energy demand ch4 and no2 directly generated during wastewater sludge incineration at the wwtp contributed to 3 5 of life cycle gwp in contrast eutrophication and blue water use were driven by on site nutrient discharge from wwtp and water withdrawal of the dwtp respectively additionally cast iron use in piping networks during drinking water distribution and sewer collection contributed to 34 of life cycle metal depletion upstream impacts associated with purchased chemicals and materials contributed 7 20 to the majority of impacts with the exception of eutrophication potential blue water use and ecotoxicity chemical production also contributed 46 to ecotoxicty impacts largely from acetic acid emission related to the sludge thickener polymer production as well as phenol benzene and toluene emissions from upstream natural gas extraction for chemical use the top contributing unit process and pollutants are summarized in tables s19 and s20 our estimates of the infrastructure s contribution to the environmental impacts of the whole urban water system in cincinnati were much lower than the estimates of atlanta water system jeong et al 2015 found that infrastructure construction contributed 68 to carcinogenic effect 30 to the ozone depletion 34 to the gwp 35 to the non carcinogenic effects and 39 to the respiratory effects respectively jeong et al 2015 this discrepancy is caused by the fundamentally different systems and underlining data sets although the distribution network is longer and more material intensive in cincinnati than in atlanta higher energy use in the cincinnati system dominated most of the life cycle impact categories and over shadowed the impacts of infrastructure while we computed the lci of infrastructure based on pipe materials pipe lengths treatment tanks and storage units dimensions and pump types provided by the local utilities the atlanta study relied on european infrastructure datasets for pump stations water and wastewater treatment plants and pipes networks for distribution and collection jeong et al 2015 our assessment based on real utility data provides a more detailed lci and stage contribution analyses table s18 which is valuable for improving the targeted process management without compromising the systematic view this study found that the gwp of wastewater infrastructure was less than 2 of the global warming impact caused by the wastewater subsystem which lies at the lower end of the reported range of 1 30 machado et al 2007 morera et al 2016 2017 ortiz et al 2007 renou et al 2008 risch et al 2015 vlasopoulos et al 2006 the wide range of infrastructure contribution partially reflects the inherent system variability such as different treatment technologies and infrastructure characteristics and distinct data sources various data sources including the existing ecoinvent database equipment designs manufacturer and supplier questionnaire responses and real information from existing systems were utilized to estimate life cycle environmental impacts of infrastructure this study along with two previous studies morera et al 2016 2017 collected detailed information on construction materials equipment devices and civil works for wastewater infrastructure in addition our study indicates that the contribution of water infrastructure to total gwp was 1 6 times higher than the contribution of wastewater infrastructure due to the extensive pipelines for water distribution in greater cincinnati region 3 3 sensitivity analysis among the investigated factors in table s22 the choice of electricity mix was the most influential factor to life cycle environmental impacts the u s average and reliability first corporation west rfcw grids represent the national average and local conditions of electricity production respectively the u s average electricity mix was used in the baseline analysis such that results would be more applicable to facilities across the country the changes of life cycle environmental impacts due to replacing the local rfcw grid with the u s average grid is shown in fig 4 while the switch from the rfcw electricity to u s average grid resulted in up to a 36 decline of the total smog impact due to the decreased usage of coal this change had negligible impacts less than 2 on eutrophication metal depletion and human health noncancer impacts in addition this change of electricity mixes caused 7 19 of decreases for global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification and ozone depletion criteria impacts the decreases of global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification and ozone depletion were due to less use of coal in the u s average grid compared to the rfcw grid however the switch from rfcw electricity to national average increased human health cancer and ecotoxicity impacts the u s average electricity contains a higher percentage of natural gas than rfcw electricity table s21 which caused the higher ecotoxicity and human health cancer impact compared to using the u s average electricity grid the impact increases for the u s average electrical grid were specifically due to dioxin and aromatic hydrocarbon emissions associated with the extraction and production of natural gas fig 5 displays the sensitivity of the water system to various changes in electricity and chemical consumption following electricity mix electricity consumption ranked as the second most influential input parameter the electricity usage sensitivity assessed net impacts when overall purchased electricity consumption was varied by 10 as shown in fig s4 changing the total electricity used for water distribution changed the total impacts of entire water and wastewater systems up to 4 5 on the contrary varying the total electricity used in wastewater by 10 resulted in up to 0 04 of the total gwp the distinct sensitivity results for water distribution and wastewater treatment were due to the significant electricity usage in water distribution and wastewater treatment by reducing the usage of electricity or switching to renewable energy the total water treatment impacts could be greatly reduced while the gwp of water distribution was influenced by electricity consumption to convey water the ghg emitted from wastewater treatment was mainly related to the electricity and natural gas use during aeration and sludge incineration and n2o emissions during sludge incineration in addition eutrophication and metal depletion were not sensitive to the electricity usage as they were driven by wastewater effluent quality and infrastructure respectively compared to electricity mix and usage chemical and material usage had negligible impacts on lca findings as shown in fig 5 varying material usages such as natural gas chlorine alum lime and sodium hypochlorite consumptions by minimum and maximum values reported by the utilities resulted in a less than 2 change on environmental impacts for the majority of impact categories costs results however were sensitive to the amount of gaseous chlorine and sodium hypochlorite used in the drinking water and wastewater process human heath noncancer results were also moderately sensitive to the amount of sodium hypochlorite used for wwtp disinfection 2 4 similarly influences of infrastructure lifetime were minimal with the exception of metal depletion impact category table s24 the varied infrastructure lifetime resulted in a significant change of metal depletion impact ranging from 10 to 17 in addition the cost of water and wastewater systems was sensitive to electricity unit cost and consumption electricity unit cost was the dominant parameter for total cost fig s3 by varying electricity unit cost by 20 the total operational cost can change 7 accordingly 4 discussion based upon our analysis and values currently reflected in the literature fig 6 the energy consumption of the whole water system in north america presents great variability a previous study focused on energy consumption gwp of entire water and wastewater systems in the u s and reported that the total direct electricity consumption spans from 0 32 to 1 43 kwh m3 arpke and hutzler 2006 our estimate of 1 25 kwh m3 resides in the higher end of the reported range another study determined electricity intensity of 0 615 kwh m3 is required for the entire water and wastewater system in atlanta jeong et al 2015 which is much lower than the average electricity consumption in cincinnati systems gcww s richard miller plant in cincinnati acquires most of its intake water from the ohio river which is a receiver of upstream municipal wastewater discharges sanitary sewer overflows and urban and agricultural storm water runoffs in order to achieve high drinking water quality energy intensive gac was employed gcww employed a uv disinfection process in 2013 to further ensure the water quality although uv disinfection is not included in this study one would expect its addition will require more energy use and have more corresponding environmental impacts to produce the final treated drinking water the leading contributors to the life cycle fossil energy depletion of the whole urban water system were not consistent in previous studies our cincinnati case study demonstrated that drinking water distribution was the top contributor to energy depletion fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion metal depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants categories fig 2 due to the massive piping network needed for transporting the treated water uphill over a large service area in the greater cincinnati area the distribution system within the whole urban water system is the most energy intensive stage electricity of 0 94 kwh m3 was spent by richard miller water treatment plant to treat and distribute drinking water which is much higher than the 0 11 0 66 kwh m3 range arpke and hutzler 2006 similarly the energy consumption for water distribution in cincinnati also exceeded the average value 0 38 kwh m3 provided by the river net work report which is based on multiple surveys across the u s river network 2009 two previous studies friedrich et al 2009 amores et al 2013 agreed with our study in that the water distribution stage ranked as the largest contributor to multiple categories energy demand fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion metal depletion human health cancer and human health criteria pollutants in contrast other studies lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 identified the wastewater treatment and disposal stage as the largest contribution to energy consumption and had most of the environmental impacts this discrepancy is caused by the differences in energy intensity of drinking water distribution stages in the different regions studied our study indicated a higher energy consumption of the drinking water distribution system in cincinnati than other regions despite the variation in energy use in drinking water treatment the centralized treatment configuration is designed to achieve one water quality standard it is inherently inefficient because of many lower quality non potable use such as firefighting periodical system flushing irrigation clothes washing and toilet flushing such centralized configuration also makes it unavoidable to convey water over long distance as urban sprawl has been an inevitable phenomenon in city development such long distance transporting water becomes extremely energy intensive alternatively drinking water systems can be designed by incorporating concepts of decentralization and fit for purpose for example decentralized non potable water reuse could not only improve system efficiency by reducing the degree of treatment required which is important in a city with relatively poor quality of source water for non potable purposes but also eliminating the pipe network required to distribute large quantities of water the choice of distinct impact assessment methods may result in large discrepancies in eutrophication human health and ecotoxicity categories hospido et al 2012 pizzol et al 2011 in this study the traci 2 0 and recipe 2008 methodology were employed whereas a number of studies amores et al 2013 friedrich et al 2009 lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 used the eco indicator 99 goedkoop and spriensma 1999 or the cml guinee et al 2001 methodologies within this study characterization factors for human health and ecotoxicity categories were obtained from the traci model which are the same as toxicity characterization factors in the usetox model us environmental protection agency 2014 often the usetox model is considered a best practice methodology for ecotoxicity and human toxicity for lcia corominas et al 2013 most lcas for the entire water and wastewater systems have not reported life cycle water use inventory nor conducted water stress impact assessment due to absent datasets and large uncertainty of current impact assessment approaches this comprehensive study focused on the life cycle blue water inventory and did not attempt to calculate water stress impact two studies amores et al 2013 jeong et al 2015 applied the water stress indicator proposed by previous studies canals et al 2009 pfister et al 2009 this is a fast developing research area to create apply and validate life cycle water use inventory and water stress impact assessment approaches núñez et al 2016 the transparent inventory of blue water in this study fills in some data gaps for future development of inventory and impact assessment in water stress scarcity and will give local decision makers relevant data to create better informed management solutions the whole urban water system results in diverse environmental impacts ranging from natural resources depletion to air and water quality degradation and associated negative human health impacts focusing on a single or a few impact categories such as energy consumption or gwp is insufficient to describe the holistic environmental impacts of water systems in order to understand the diverse impacts of urban water systems and to avoid potential tradeoffs it is necessary to perform lca for a suite of impact categories moreover the top contributing processes varied for different impact categories which suggests that different processes should be targeted in order to minimize the corresponding environmental impacts for example minimizing electricity consumption will reduce fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts in contrast reducing nutrients in wastewater effluents will mitigate the eutrophication impact in addition the comparison with previous studies indicate that environmental impacts of urban water systems are case specific in the greater cincinnati area the extensive distribution piping network and the fact that drinking water is delivered uphill owing to the location of the plant at the bottom of the ohio river valley result in high energy use in water conveyance energy saving efforts can be made to renew more efficient pumps optimize the distribution network performance and reduce losses in the network or incorporate decentralization concepts in water supply cashman et al 2018 ma et al 2015 the high impacts contributed from drinking water acquisition and treatment is in part due to the source water quality from ohio river upstream source water protection will improve water quality and minimize treatment cost electricity use in wastewater treatment also contributes significantly to various environmental impacts strategies such as stormwater diversion energy recovery through anaerobic digestion could reduce and offset the energy use in the plant and lower the end of life disposal cost this case study shows when available real datasets for infrastructure and operation maintenance should be collected from utilities for a truly representative lci and such targeted analyses provides bigger picture of urban water management as well as specific optimization potentials to improve overall system efficiency caution should be taken when generic databases are applied to assess the environmental impacts of a particular water system 5 conclusions based upon the detailed utility datasets this study holistically quantified life cycle impacts and costs of urban water systems such comprehensive analyses provide insights for further lca studies and provide scientific basis to support utilities managers in effective and balanced decision making this study emphasizes importance of collecting case specific lci for supporting effective decision making the generic values from commercial lca databases and average median values of existing literature are incapable of accurately representing local conditions using average median values of literature may result in misleading life cycle impacts and hampering effective decision making for example the energy use of drinking water distribution in greater cincinnati far exceeded the median value of the previous studies on urban drinking water systems while the energy consumption of wastewater collection and treatment in greater cincinnati was much smaller than the median value of previous studies on urban wastewater systems based on the utility datasets one may conclude that electricity for drinking water system should be prioritized for reduction within the urban water systems however if solely relying on the literature values a contradictory suggestion that wastewater system should be prioritized for mitigating energy consumption may misguide decision making in fact the synthesis of existing studies indicates that energy consumption of urban water systems vary significantly due to differences in treatment processes geographical context and management strategies case specific datasets for infrastructure and operation maintenance should be collected from utilities for truly representative life cycle inventory in order to understand the diverse impacts of urban water systems and to provide scientific basis for the balanced decision support it is necessary to perform lca and lcc of entire water and wastewater systems for a suite of impact categories such comprehensive analyses pinpoint the relative contributions of treatment stages and identify the top contributing processes for various impact categories for example electricity use is a key contributor to life cycle fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts in contrast nutrient discharge in wastewater effluents dominates life cycle eutrophication impact the analyses of stage contributions from various perspectives such as unit processes supply chain components and life cycle stages are critical to reveal top contributors for identifying targeted mitigation strategies based on relative contributions of unit processes minimizing electricity consumption will reduce fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts comparing the contributions of on site and supply chain activities we found that on site activities significantly influence only blue water footprint and eutrophication impacts the majority of life cycle environmental impacts were driven by the supply chain activities such as energy and chemical production which are usually beyond the authority of water and wastewater utilities regarding the contributions of infrastructure and operational stages this detailed analysis led to the conclusion that the contributions of infrastructure stage to environmental impacts were dwarfed by the operational stage with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories overall reducing water withdrawal and improving discharge quality during operation stage can lower the local impacts of urban water services while targeting energy intensive unit process during operation stage can lower the supply chain impacts of urban water services sensitivity analyses demonstrated the cost of water and wastewater systems was sensitive to electricity mix unit cost and consumption this analysis provides insights for communities from other regions with different electricity mix and price energy saving throughout the system can greatly improve the system efficiency adopting cleaner energy sources reducing electricity use designing system configuration with fit for purpose resource recovery and decentralization concepts are effective strategies to mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of urban water systems this study and its framework provides a necessary benchmark to which future system improvements can be compared disclaimer the views expressed in this article are those of the authors

20022,urban water and wastewater utilities are striving to improve their environmental and economic performances due to multiple challenges such as increasingly stringent quality criterion aging infrastructure constraining financial burden growing urban population climate challenges and dwindling resources growing needs of holistic assessments of urban water systems are required to identify systems level cross domain solutions this study evaluated the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of urban water and wastewater systems with two utilities in greater cincinnati region as a case study the scope of this study includes the entire urban water and wastewater systems starting from raw water acquisition for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge the detailed process based life cycle models were developed based on the datasets provided by local water and wastewater utilities the life cycle assessment indicated that the operation and maintenance of drinking water distribution was a dominating contributor for energy consumption 43 and global warming potential 41 wastewater discharge from the wastewater treatment plant contributed to more than 80 of the total eutrophication potential the cost analysis determined that labor and maintenance cost 19 for wastewater collection and electricity cost 13 for drinking water distribution were major contributors electricity purchased by the utility was the driver for the majority of impact categories assessed with the exception of eutrophication blue water use and metal depletion infrastructure requirements had a negligible influence on impact results contributing less than 3 to most categories with the exception of metal depletion where it led to 68 of total burdens sensitivity analysis showed that the life cycle environmental results were more sensitive to the choice of the electricity mixes and electricity consumption than the rest of input parameters such as chemical dosages and infrastructure life time this is one of the first comprehensive studies of the whole urban water system using real case data it elucidates a bigger picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban centralized water system inherent to a modern city as large population centers a significant expenditure has to be invested to provide water services function moving water treating water wastewater in order to avoid human and environmental health problems this study provides insights for optimization potentials of overall treatment efficiency and can serve as a benchmark for communities considering adoption of alternative water systems keywords water wastewater urban water systems life cycle assessment environmental impacts cost 1 introduction sustainable urban water systems are vital to provide the public with drinking water and sanitation services and to promote the balanced environmental economic and social health of communities now and in the future currently most urban water systems in developed countries have been managed to satisfy the urban water and sanitation demands through centralized configurations however with multiple challenges such as increasingly stringent quality criterion aging infrastructure constraining financial burden growing urban population climate effects and the promotion of sustainable and healthy communities there is urgent need for systematically evaluating the performance of the current infrastructure and identifying strategies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban water system management life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost lcc analysis can assess the whole urban water system in a comprehensive way to identify critical processes and potential areas for improvement of the system lca is a well established system accounting method to quantify energy consumption and environmental impacts through the entire life cycle of a product or process lca studies of water systems track various environmental impacts derived from direct and supply chain activities complementary to the lca approach lcc analyses quantify the financial costs of water systems from raw material extraction construction operation and demolishment at the end of life the existing body of literature contributes greatly to the understanding of the environmental and economic impacts of the whole urban water system but lack in the following three areas first life cycle studies of whole urban water systems in the u s based on the use of real utility datasets are still missing life cycle studies of whole urban water systems are necessary to understand the relative contributions of water and wastewater systems and to serve as a baseline assessment for system optimization and adaptation loubet et al 2014 ma et al 2015 xue et al 2015 as documented by a recent review article loubet et al 2014 and several recent case studies jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 xue et al 2016 a few lca studies quantified the life cycle environmental impacts of the entire urban water and wastewater system amores et al 2013 arpke and hutzler 2006 jeong et al 2015 lane et al 2015 lemos et al 2013 loubet et al 2014 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 slagstad and brattebø 2014 the majority of these studies have focused on water and wastewater services in europe and australia with some exceptions arpke and hutzler 2006 jeong et al 2015 xue et al 2016 it was estimated the energy consumption and global warming potential gwp of a water and wastewater system in the united states without cost implications arpke and hutzler 2006 the life cycle environmental impacts of water and wastewater systems in atlanta was assessed jeong et al 2015 but the study heavily relied on european datasets for the infrastructure construction phase although another study xue et al 2016 evaluated the impacts of various water and wastewater option the scales were at the household level there are differences in unit treatment processes in u s and other areas in the world such as disinfection or disposal strategies the lca of urban water and wastewater treatment built with actual utility datasets in north america are still needed to understand how the local specificity could affect the outcome and how the results can be used for decision making another limitation is that many lca studies of whole urban water systems have not identified the contribution of the unit processes to the overall life cycle environmental impacts although the aggregation of the processes might be helpful as a screening approach it is not particularly useful for decision makers pinpointing the issues and finding solutions a few studies have assessed the contribution of unit processes in either water or wastewater treatment plants however the scope of these studies bonton and barbeau 2012 hospido et al 2010 igos et al 2014 langevin et al 2010 lederer and rechberger 2010 pradel et al 2010 are limited to a single or a few stages of the whole urban system the analyses that cover the entire water system and assess stage contributions at unit process level to the environmental impacts of the overall water system remain limited lastly the debate of relative contributions between infrastructure and operational phases is ongoing some found that the contributions of construction phase were minimal while others indicated a significant role in multiple environmental categories detailed inventories of infrastructure materials and machinery and associated energy requirements are necessary to elucidate the relative contributions of infrastructure phase expanding on previous work this study presents a life cycle environmental and economic analysis of an urban water system as a whole using u s specific real case data from the greater cincinnati region this study developed more detailed inventory and assessment in two major areas including 1 the contribution of unit processes in the entire water and wastewater treatment trains and 2 the contribution of infrastructure stage at the unit process level a companion emergy study arden et al 2019 was also conducted to evaluate the same system from the thermodynamic perspective for a multi faceted evaluation together they provide a more complete picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban water system while providing insights for more sustainable water system management 2 method 2 1 life cycle assessment standard approaches for goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact analysis and interpretation as described by the international organization for standardization s iso 14040 series were used and summarized below international organization for standardization 2010 2 1 1 goal and scope this study aims to understand 1 the detailed process based life cycle models from real treatment plant data so that the utility managers are able to make targeted decisions 2 the importance of integration of water and wastewater management and a bigger picture of energy resource and cost distributions in a typical urban centralized water system 3 the environmental impacts and costs of an urban water system using the greater cincinnati region as a case study and identify the contributions of the unit processes on their respective impacts fig 1 illustrates the system boundary of the lca model the processes start at the acquisition of source water from the ohio river and end at the discharge of wastewater effluent to mill creek material energy and transportation inputs and environmental releases which occurred during infrastructure construction and facility operation were included the 22 unit processes of water and wastewater systems were created to represent richard miller drinking water treatment dwt and mill creek wastewater treatment plants wwtp in cincinnati ohio for the year 2011 richard miller dwt provides drinking water to parts of hamilton butler warren and clermont counties in ohio and boone county kentucky with an operating capacity of 120 mgd mill creek wwtp is the largest wastewater treatment plant among the 7 main plants within the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati msdgc with a nominal capacity of 120 mgd and maximum capacity of 360 mgd for combined sewer during wet weather the unit processes for the water treatment train include source water acquisition flocculation sedimentation filtration adsorption conditioning primary disinfection fluoridation and water distribution the unit processes for wastewater treatment train include wastewater collection grit removal primary sedimentation aeration secondary clarifier and sludge handling primary disinfection and wastewater discharge the detailed description of dwt and wwtp system is shown in figs s1 and s2 the functional unit reflects that the provision of drinking water and sanitation services is the key service of water and wastewater systems aligned with previous lca studies 1 m3 of treated and distributed water meeting or exceeding national primary drinking water regulations was initially used as the functional unit for the drinking water analysis and 1 m3 of treated and discharged wastewater was initially used as the functional unit for the wastewater analysis results for drinking water and wastewater are combined here to a functional unit of 1 m3 of delivered drinking water which is subsequently treated after use to illustrate the comprehensive impact of municipal water treatment services while on average 30 of drinking water is used for outdoor activities in the us this study assumes that in the long term all drinking water will eventually be treated as wastewater and the ratio of delivered drinking water to treated wastewater is 1 1 ma et al 2015 national research council of the national academies 2006 based on local utility datasets 19 of treated drinking water was lost through leakage during distribution drinking water treatment plant dwtp impacts were therefore scaled up based on the distribution leakage rate with the existing combined sewer system in cincinnati stormwater penetration accounts for 24 of flow to the wwtp during wet events however when the combined sewer flow exceeds the maximum capacity of the wwtp the excess flow presenting approximately 17 of the average annual flow bypasses the secondary treatment since the majority of stormwater bypasses secondary treatment the functional unit in this analysis is not adjusted based on stormwater flow which can also vary greatly seasonally and from dry years to wet years 2 1 2 life cycle inventory the foreground inventory data for the life cycle inventory lci were provided by greater cincinnati water works gcww and the msdgc through an iterative questionnaire process and were documented using federal commons lci unit process templates usda national agricultural library 2017 additionally site visit and periodic discussions with utilities were conducted to ensure appropriate use of infrastructure and operational datasets the detailed material energy and transport inputs for constructing and operating water and wastewater systems at unit process level are documented in tables s1 s14 since the year 2011 was the most recent year when the operational data for the water system was available for this study the ultraviolet uv operation adopted by gcww in 2013 was not included in the system boundary for upstream processes such as chemical and electricity production data were taken from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel u s life cycle inventory database us lci national renewable energy laboratory 2012 a publicly available lci source the openlca1 6 software was used to construct the lci for the urban water system in cincinnati due to its transparency and public availability in the wwtp the biogenic carbon dioxide co2 emission from aeration and greenhouse gas ghg emissions from the sludge incineration process were computed for a complete ghg inventory table s8 but only the fossil co2 was included in the impact assessment because municipal wastewater mostly comes from food which has a short rotation period resulting in negligible net gwp cherubini et al 2011 liu et al 2017 msdgc provided the input parameters including volume of aerobic reactor annual flow of influent wastewater influent and effluent total suspended solids and solids retention time while the remaining parameters of a typical conventional activated sludge treatment system were obtained from literature monteith et al 2005 the methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions from the aeration and sludge thickening processes were determined to be minimal foley and lant 2010 the ghg emissions of sludge incineration were estimated based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2006 guidelines which included sludge volume and incineration temperature according to the ipcc guidelines a range of 40 50 of carbon content of dry sludge and 4 85 10 5 kg of ch4 emitted kg of dry sludge burned were used to estimate ch4 emissions intergovernmental panel on climate change n2o emissions were calculated based on a default value for nitrogen content of dry sludge published by the biosolids emissions assessment model canadian council of ministers of the environment 2009 2 1 3 life cycle impact assessment the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and environmental impacts traci version 2 0 developed by the u s epa specifically to model environmental and human health impacts in the u s was the primary life cycle impact assessment lcia method applied in this work us environmental protection agency 2014 additionally the recipe method was used to characterize fossil fuel and metal depletion goedkoop et al 2008 life cycle energy consumption was tracked using the cumulative energy demand method swiss centre for life cycle inventories 2010 as guided by the water footprint assessment manual goedkoop et al 2009 the blue water footprint served as an additional impact category to represent the direct and indirect water withdrawal in water and wastewater processes the impact assessment categories and the underlying methods that were considered are summarized in table s15 life cycle impacts were analyzed to include the contributions of 1 various life cycle stages and unit processes within the entire treatment train and 2 infrastructure and operation stages 2 2 life cycle cost assessment the annual operational and maintenance o m costs in year 2011 provided by gcww were allocated to each unit process and normalized to 1 m3 of drinking water delivered for the water system for the cost in wastewater the annual o m cost in year 2012 was provided by msdgc and allocated to each unit process and normalized to 1 m3 of wastewater treated for the wastewater system delivered drinking water and wastewater life cycle costs were also combined to represent the same functional unit as the lca plant wide costs such as insurance and o m labor costs were calculated and represented in the overhead category the infrastructure cost was not included in this study due to data limitation since some pipes tanks and machinery were more than a century old baseline drinking water and wastewater life cycle costs are important to incorporate as an additional metric in the analysis to understand trade offs between unit process cost considerations and lca findings baseline cost results can also be utilized in the future to understand how changing the treatment plant configurations and or operations will impact the underlying economics of municipal water treatment 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the influences of 16 key input parameters on the lca and lcc results the assessed input parameters included chlorine usage by the dwtp lime usage by dwtp alum coagulant usage by dwtp sodium hypochlorite usages by dwtp and wwtp natural gas usage for granular activated carbon gac reactivation by dwtp electricity usages at the dwtp water distribution wastewater collection and wwtp respectively carbon content of incinerated sludge and lifetimes of dwtp water distribution infrastructure wastewater collection infrastructure and wwtp respectively in addition the influences of choices of electricity grids on life cycle environmental impacts of the urban water system were assessed 3 results 3 1 contribution of unit processes to the life cycle environmental and economic impacts the process contribution analysis fig 2 indicates that electricity used for water distribution was the primary contributor for environmental impact categories including fossil fuel depletion and energy demand the electricity consumption during dwtp in plant pumping water distribution and wastewater aeration resulted in 21 43 and 13 of total fossil fuel depletion respectively except for the gravity driven wastewater collection system moving water whether in the network or in plant as well as disintegrating organics in wastewater is energy intensive stokes and horvath 2009 detailed contribution results for specific unit processes in the life cycle of 1 m3 of water delivered and subsequently treated are provided in table s17 moreover water distribution 41 and dwtp in plant pumping 20 ranked as the top two significant contributing processes for gwp other gwp contributors included aeration at the wwtp 12 and sludge incineration 7 eutrophication impacts were overwhelmingly dominated by the release of wastewater effluent even though the average ammonia 7 66 g m3 and phosphorus 0 55 g m3 levels in 2011 met the discharge standards the second biggest contributor for eutrophication potential 5 5 was the landfill disposal of sediment from the dwtp the findings on eutrophication are consistent with previous studies amores et al 2013 buckley et al 2011 friedrich et al 2009 lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 which confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus releases from the wastewater discharge were the major contributors to the eutrophication impact in other regions furthermore water distribution accounts for over 3 100 miles of piping the collection system has less than 1 700 miles and was the largest contributor 61 to metal depletion while the primary material for drinking water distribution network is ductile iron the wastewater collection pipe network mainly consists of concrete pipes notably productions of the chemicals used in water conditioning in dwtp to adjust ph added another 11 to the metal depletion results also two of the biggest contributors for human health noncancer impact included water distribution and chemical usage together contributing to 65 of human health noncancer impact while water distribution remained the biggest contributor 32 to ecotoxicity impact the second biggest contributor was sludge thickening and dewatering stage due to the application of polymer polyacrylamide and its upstream production in addition cost based rankings were different from the life cycle impact rankings due to the inclusion of labor expenditure in cost the lcc analysis found that wastewater collection accounted for 19 of the total cost mainly due to the expensive labor followed by drinking water distribution contributing for 13 fig 2 sludge thickening wastewater system overhead and drinking water plant wide overhead contributed to around 10 11 of the total cost the rest of the stages contributed to less than 8 of the total cost 3 2 underlying drivers of life cycle environmental impacts fig 3 displays the underlying drivers of the life cycle impacts including direct on site air and water releases as well as on site fuel consumption impacts associated with generation and delivery of electricity purchased by the utilities burdens for infrastructure production and impacts from chemical and material production and transportation upstream electricity generation and delivery processes from electricity purchased by the utilities were the primary contributors for global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion and human health categories the detailed unit process contributions to the life cycle impacts are list in table s17 as shown in fig 3 the infrastructure stage combined water and wastewater contributed to less than 10 of environmental impacts with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories the infrastructure stage dominated the metal depletion impact category mainly due to the metal requirement for drinking water distribution and sewer collection networks infrastructure contributed 13 to total human health noncancer impact due to carbon disulfide air emissions from cast iron production processes table s18 the direct use of natural gas diesel and gasoline within water and wastewater treatment plants categorized as utility on site fuel usage only resulted in 5 of life cycle energy demand ch4 and no2 directly generated during wastewater sludge incineration at the wwtp contributed to 3 5 of life cycle gwp in contrast eutrophication and blue water use were driven by on site nutrient discharge from wwtp and water withdrawal of the dwtp respectively additionally cast iron use in piping networks during drinking water distribution and sewer collection contributed to 34 of life cycle metal depletion upstream impacts associated with purchased chemicals and materials contributed 7 20 to the majority of impacts with the exception of eutrophication potential blue water use and ecotoxicity chemical production also contributed 46 to ecotoxicty impacts largely from acetic acid emission related to the sludge thickener polymer production as well as phenol benzene and toluene emissions from upstream natural gas extraction for chemical use the top contributing unit process and pollutants are summarized in tables s19 and s20 our estimates of the infrastructure s contribution to the environmental impacts of the whole urban water system in cincinnati were much lower than the estimates of atlanta water system jeong et al 2015 found that infrastructure construction contributed 68 to carcinogenic effect 30 to the ozone depletion 34 to the gwp 35 to the non carcinogenic effects and 39 to the respiratory effects respectively jeong et al 2015 this discrepancy is caused by the fundamentally different systems and underlining data sets although the distribution network is longer and more material intensive in cincinnati than in atlanta higher energy use in the cincinnati system dominated most of the life cycle impact categories and over shadowed the impacts of infrastructure while we computed the lci of infrastructure based on pipe materials pipe lengths treatment tanks and storage units dimensions and pump types provided by the local utilities the atlanta study relied on european infrastructure datasets for pump stations water and wastewater treatment plants and pipes networks for distribution and collection jeong et al 2015 our assessment based on real utility data provides a more detailed lci and stage contribution analyses table s18 which is valuable for improving the targeted process management without compromising the systematic view this study found that the gwp of wastewater infrastructure was less than 2 of the global warming impact caused by the wastewater subsystem which lies at the lower end of the reported range of 1 30 machado et al 2007 morera et al 2016 2017 ortiz et al 2007 renou et al 2008 risch et al 2015 vlasopoulos et al 2006 the wide range of infrastructure contribution partially reflects the inherent system variability such as different treatment technologies and infrastructure characteristics and distinct data sources various data sources including the existing ecoinvent database equipment designs manufacturer and supplier questionnaire responses and real information from existing systems were utilized to estimate life cycle environmental impacts of infrastructure this study along with two previous studies morera et al 2016 2017 collected detailed information on construction materials equipment devices and civil works for wastewater infrastructure in addition our study indicates that the contribution of water infrastructure to total gwp was 1 6 times higher than the contribution of wastewater infrastructure due to the extensive pipelines for water distribution in greater cincinnati region 3 3 sensitivity analysis among the investigated factors in table s22 the choice of electricity mix was the most influential factor to life cycle environmental impacts the u s average and reliability first corporation west rfcw grids represent the national average and local conditions of electricity production respectively the u s average electricity mix was used in the baseline analysis such that results would be more applicable to facilities across the country the changes of life cycle environmental impacts due to replacing the local rfcw grid with the u s average grid is shown in fig 4 while the switch from the rfcw electricity to u s average grid resulted in up to a 36 decline of the total smog impact due to the decreased usage of coal this change had negligible impacts less than 2 on eutrophication metal depletion and human health noncancer impacts in addition this change of electricity mixes caused 7 19 of decreases for global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification and ozone depletion criteria impacts the decreases of global warming energy demand fossil depletion acidification and ozone depletion were due to less use of coal in the u s average grid compared to the rfcw grid however the switch from rfcw electricity to national average increased human health cancer and ecotoxicity impacts the u s average electricity contains a higher percentage of natural gas than rfcw electricity table s21 which caused the higher ecotoxicity and human health cancer impact compared to using the u s average electricity grid the impact increases for the u s average electrical grid were specifically due to dioxin and aromatic hydrocarbon emissions associated with the extraction and production of natural gas fig 5 displays the sensitivity of the water system to various changes in electricity and chemical consumption following electricity mix electricity consumption ranked as the second most influential input parameter the electricity usage sensitivity assessed net impacts when overall purchased electricity consumption was varied by 10 as shown in fig s4 changing the total electricity used for water distribution changed the total impacts of entire water and wastewater systems up to 4 5 on the contrary varying the total electricity used in wastewater by 10 resulted in up to 0 04 of the total gwp the distinct sensitivity results for water distribution and wastewater treatment were due to the significant electricity usage in water distribution and wastewater treatment by reducing the usage of electricity or switching to renewable energy the total water treatment impacts could be greatly reduced while the gwp of water distribution was influenced by electricity consumption to convey water the ghg emitted from wastewater treatment was mainly related to the electricity and natural gas use during aeration and sludge incineration and n2o emissions during sludge incineration in addition eutrophication and metal depletion were not sensitive to the electricity usage as they were driven by wastewater effluent quality and infrastructure respectively compared to electricity mix and usage chemical and material usage had negligible impacts on lca findings as shown in fig 5 varying material usages such as natural gas chlorine alum lime and sodium hypochlorite consumptions by minimum and maximum values reported by the utilities resulted in a less than 2 change on environmental impacts for the majority of impact categories costs results however were sensitive to the amount of gaseous chlorine and sodium hypochlorite used in the drinking water and wastewater process human heath noncancer results were also moderately sensitive to the amount of sodium hypochlorite used for wwtp disinfection 2 4 similarly influences of infrastructure lifetime were minimal with the exception of metal depletion impact category table s24 the varied infrastructure lifetime resulted in a significant change of metal depletion impact ranging from 10 to 17 in addition the cost of water and wastewater systems was sensitive to electricity unit cost and consumption electricity unit cost was the dominant parameter for total cost fig s3 by varying electricity unit cost by 20 the total operational cost can change 7 accordingly 4 discussion based upon our analysis and values currently reflected in the literature fig 6 the energy consumption of the whole water system in north america presents great variability a previous study focused on energy consumption gwp of entire water and wastewater systems in the u s and reported that the total direct electricity consumption spans from 0 32 to 1 43 kwh m3 arpke and hutzler 2006 our estimate of 1 25 kwh m3 resides in the higher end of the reported range another study determined electricity intensity of 0 615 kwh m3 is required for the entire water and wastewater system in atlanta jeong et al 2015 which is much lower than the average electricity consumption in cincinnati systems gcww s richard miller plant in cincinnati acquires most of its intake water from the ohio river which is a receiver of upstream municipal wastewater discharges sanitary sewer overflows and urban and agricultural storm water runoffs in order to achieve high drinking water quality energy intensive gac was employed gcww employed a uv disinfection process in 2013 to further ensure the water quality although uv disinfection is not included in this study one would expect its addition will require more energy use and have more corresponding environmental impacts to produce the final treated drinking water the leading contributors to the life cycle fossil energy depletion of the whole urban water system were not consistent in previous studies our cincinnati case study demonstrated that drinking water distribution was the top contributor to energy depletion fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion metal depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants categories fig 2 due to the massive piping network needed for transporting the treated water uphill over a large service area in the greater cincinnati area the distribution system within the whole urban water system is the most energy intensive stage electricity of 0 94 kwh m3 was spent by richard miller water treatment plant to treat and distribute drinking water which is much higher than the 0 11 0 66 kwh m3 range arpke and hutzler 2006 similarly the energy consumption for water distribution in cincinnati also exceeded the average value 0 38 kwh m3 provided by the river net work report which is based on multiple surveys across the u s river network 2009 two previous studies friedrich et al 2009 amores et al 2013 agreed with our study in that the water distribution stage ranked as the largest contributor to multiple categories energy demand fossil depletion acidification smog ozone depletion metal depletion human health cancer and human health criteria pollutants in contrast other studies lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 identified the wastewater treatment and disposal stage as the largest contribution to energy consumption and had most of the environmental impacts this discrepancy is caused by the differences in energy intensity of drinking water distribution stages in the different regions studied our study indicated a higher energy consumption of the drinking water distribution system in cincinnati than other regions despite the variation in energy use in drinking water treatment the centralized treatment configuration is designed to achieve one water quality standard it is inherently inefficient because of many lower quality non potable use such as firefighting periodical system flushing irrigation clothes washing and toilet flushing such centralized configuration also makes it unavoidable to convey water over long distance as urban sprawl has been an inevitable phenomenon in city development such long distance transporting water becomes extremely energy intensive alternatively drinking water systems can be designed by incorporating concepts of decentralization and fit for purpose for example decentralized non potable water reuse could not only improve system efficiency by reducing the degree of treatment required which is important in a city with relatively poor quality of source water for non potable purposes but also eliminating the pipe network required to distribute large quantities of water the choice of distinct impact assessment methods may result in large discrepancies in eutrophication human health and ecotoxicity categories hospido et al 2012 pizzol et al 2011 in this study the traci 2 0 and recipe 2008 methodology were employed whereas a number of studies amores et al 2013 friedrich et al 2009 lassaux et al 2007 lundie et al 2004 mahgoub et al 2010 used the eco indicator 99 goedkoop and spriensma 1999 or the cml guinee et al 2001 methodologies within this study characterization factors for human health and ecotoxicity categories were obtained from the traci model which are the same as toxicity characterization factors in the usetox model us environmental protection agency 2014 often the usetox model is considered a best practice methodology for ecotoxicity and human toxicity for lcia corominas et al 2013 most lcas for the entire water and wastewater systems have not reported life cycle water use inventory nor conducted water stress impact assessment due to absent datasets and large uncertainty of current impact assessment approaches this comprehensive study focused on the life cycle blue water inventory and did not attempt to calculate water stress impact two studies amores et al 2013 jeong et al 2015 applied the water stress indicator proposed by previous studies canals et al 2009 pfister et al 2009 this is a fast developing research area to create apply and validate life cycle water use inventory and water stress impact assessment approaches núñez et al 2016 the transparent inventory of blue water in this study fills in some data gaps for future development of inventory and impact assessment in water stress scarcity and will give local decision makers relevant data to create better informed management solutions the whole urban water system results in diverse environmental impacts ranging from natural resources depletion to air and water quality degradation and associated negative human health impacts focusing on a single or a few impact categories such as energy consumption or gwp is insufficient to describe the holistic environmental impacts of water systems in order to understand the diverse impacts of urban water systems and to avoid potential tradeoffs it is necessary to perform lca for a suite of impact categories moreover the top contributing processes varied for different impact categories which suggests that different processes should be targeted in order to minimize the corresponding environmental impacts for example minimizing electricity consumption will reduce fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts in contrast reducing nutrients in wastewater effluents will mitigate the eutrophication impact in addition the comparison with previous studies indicate that environmental impacts of urban water systems are case specific in the greater cincinnati area the extensive distribution piping network and the fact that drinking water is delivered uphill owing to the location of the plant at the bottom of the ohio river valley result in high energy use in water conveyance energy saving efforts can be made to renew more efficient pumps optimize the distribution network performance and reduce losses in the network or incorporate decentralization concepts in water supply cashman et al 2018 ma et al 2015 the high impacts contributed from drinking water acquisition and treatment is in part due to the source water quality from ohio river upstream source water protection will improve water quality and minimize treatment cost electricity use in wastewater treatment also contributes significantly to various environmental impacts strategies such as stormwater diversion energy recovery through anaerobic digestion could reduce and offset the energy use in the plant and lower the end of life disposal cost this case study shows when available real datasets for infrastructure and operation maintenance should be collected from utilities for a truly representative lci and such targeted analyses provides bigger picture of urban water management as well as specific optimization potentials to improve overall system efficiency caution should be taken when generic databases are applied to assess the environmental impacts of a particular water system 5 conclusions based upon the detailed utility datasets this study holistically quantified life cycle impacts and costs of urban water systems such comprehensive analyses provide insights for further lca studies and provide scientific basis to support utilities managers in effective and balanced decision making this study emphasizes importance of collecting case specific lci for supporting effective decision making the generic values from commercial lca databases and average median values of existing literature are incapable of accurately representing local conditions using average median values of literature may result in misleading life cycle impacts and hampering effective decision making for example the energy use of drinking water distribution in greater cincinnati far exceeded the median value of the previous studies on urban drinking water systems while the energy consumption of wastewater collection and treatment in greater cincinnati was much smaller than the median value of previous studies on urban wastewater systems based on the utility datasets one may conclude that electricity for drinking water system should be prioritized for reduction within the urban water systems however if solely relying on the literature values a contradictory suggestion that wastewater system should be prioritized for mitigating energy consumption may misguide decision making in fact the synthesis of existing studies indicates that energy consumption of urban water systems vary significantly due to differences in treatment processes geographical context and management strategies case specific datasets for infrastructure and operation maintenance should be collected from utilities for truly representative life cycle inventory in order to understand the diverse impacts of urban water systems and to provide scientific basis for the balanced decision support it is necessary to perform lca and lcc of entire water and wastewater systems for a suite of impact categories such comprehensive analyses pinpoint the relative contributions of treatment stages and identify the top contributing processes for various impact categories for example electricity use is a key contributor to life cycle fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts in contrast nutrient discharge in wastewater effluents dominates life cycle eutrophication impact the analyses of stage contributions from various perspectives such as unit processes supply chain components and life cycle stages are critical to reveal top contributors for identifying targeted mitigation strategies based on relative contributions of unit processes minimizing electricity consumption will reduce fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and criteria pollutants impacts comparing the contributions of on site and supply chain activities we found that on site activities significantly influence only blue water footprint and eutrophication impacts the majority of life cycle environmental impacts were driven by the supply chain activities such as energy and chemical production which are usually beyond the authority of water and wastewater utilities regarding the contributions of infrastructure and operational stages this detailed analysis led to the conclusion that the contributions of infrastructure stage to environmental impacts were dwarfed by the operational stage with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories overall reducing water withdrawal and improving discharge quality during operation stage can lower the local impacts of urban water services while targeting energy intensive unit process during operation stage can lower the supply chain impacts of urban water services sensitivity analyses demonstrated the cost of water and wastewater systems was sensitive to electricity mix unit cost and consumption this analysis provides insights for communities from other regions with different electricity mix and price energy saving throughout the system can greatly improve the system efficiency adopting cleaner energy sources reducing electricity use designing system configuration with fit for purpose resource recovery and decentralization concepts are effective strategies to mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of urban

20023,with increasing populations mounting environmental pressures and aging infrastructure urban water and wastewater utilities have to make investment decisions limited by both economic and environmental constraints the challenges facing urban water systems can no longer be sustainably solved by traditional siloed water management approaches a central premise of contemporary urban water management paradigms is that in order for urban water systems to be more sustainable and economical an improvement in resource use efficiency at system level must be achieved this study provides a quantification of the total resource use of a typical urban water system exemplified in greater cincinnati region from raw water extraction for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge providing a better understanding of resource expenditure distributions within the system and a necessary benchmark to which future system improvements can be compared the emergy methodology was used so that the total environmental work required to produce disparate system inputs could be expressed using a common unit the results were compared to the concurring life cycle assessment lca and life cycle costing lcc results of the same system emergy results highlight drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution as two resource intensive stages with energy for pumping and chemicals for conditioning representing the greatest inputs to the former and energy for pumping and metals for piping representing the greatest inputs to the latter for wastewater collection and treatment stages aeration and sludge handling were identified as the highest emergy unit processes mostly due to energy use comparison with lca results substantiate the environmental concerns associated with energy use in the drinking water treatment and distribution stages but indicate that environmental burdens associated with infrastructure are more dependent upon upstream resource use rather than downstream environmental impact results from emergy lca and lcc point towards aeration and sludge handling as two unit processes on the wastewater side that are particularly costly and environmentally impactful results in total are used to suggest alternative strategies that can alleviate identified environmental burdens and economic costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords emergy integrated urban water management sustainability system analysis resource efficiency 1 introduction urban water challenges in industrialized nations are no longer solely comprised of the low cost provision of supply sanitation and drainage services as populations increase energy and water resources become more scarce and ecological impacts mount urban water resource managers must also take into account factors such as total resource use and environmental impacts of investment decisions to do so managers must have a holistic understanding of current urban water systems and search for system level integrated solutions that maximize public utility operation alliance 2017 hering et al 2013 luthy 2013 these themes are echoed in recently developed management approaches including sustainable urban water management suwm larsen and gujer 1997 marlow et al 2013 integrated urban water management iuwm and water sensitive urban design wsud wong 2006 a central theme of each approach is that in order for urban water systems uws here broadly referring to the infrastructure associated with the provision of supply sanitation and drainage services in urban areas to become more sustainable an improvement in overall resource use efficiency is necessary marlow et al 2013 thus a necessary first step is the quantification of the total resource use of the existing uws emergy analysis is a method used to quantify and compare different resource inputs using a common unit providing a unique broad and inclusive measure of total resource use of a system in contrast to traditional economic accounting which primarily accounts for the human labor required to make a product or service emergy also accounts for the work done by nature to produce the natural capital e g water energy minerals etc upon which those products or services depend thus providing a direct accounting of the full resource costs previous studies have used emergy analysis to evaluate different components of the urban water system including different drinking water treatment plants dwtp arbault et al 2013 buenfil 2001 pulselli et al 2011 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 siracusa and la rosa 2006 vassallo et al 2009 and alternatives to conventional wwtps such as anaerobic digesters moss et al 2014 and treatment wetlands arias and brown 2009 geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 siracusa and la rosa 2006 while quantifying the resource costs of water treatment using different approaches which are shown to be site specific and highly dependent upon the locally demanded level of service these studies also provided significant advances to the emergy methodology for example buenfil 2001 provided a comprehensive evaluation of water supply alternatives and used the emergy to money ratio to show that potable water is highly economically undervalued arbault et al 2013 through the use of emergy based indicators showed that dwtps are rather blind to economic markets and exert a low pressure on local non renewable resources at the expense of imported non renewable resources in studies comparing traditional wwtps to alternative treatment approaches such as constructed wetlands study objectives varied but were loosely based on the idea that in order to improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment treatment systems should use more renewable resources and less total resources to that end arias and brown 2009 showed that when land area is available and wastewater flows aren t very large constructed wetlands provide greater value than conventional wwtps in terms of performance cost and resource utilization siracusa and la rosa 2006 showed that treating wwtp effluent with a constructed wetland and beneficially reusing the final effluent in dry rural agricultural areas conferred a reduction in net resource use compared to full treatment in a wwtp and discharge to a river lastly geber and bjorkland found that when holding level of service in this case phosphorus removal constant the total resource inputs required for treatment using a tertiary wwtp secondary wwtp constructed wetland and natural wetland only were strikingly similar geber and bjorklund 2001 though useful past studies have largely fallen short in considering an individual treatment system s interaction with the next larger system i e the urban water systems although drinking water or wastewater treatment is a system itself but only a subsystem when the entire urban water system is considered for example water reuse at the neighborhood scale may be more resource intensive than a centralized wwtp however if it offsets potable demand and reduces the piping infrastructure requirements there may be a net improvement to overall uws efficiency not to mention the greater resiliency conferred through a lessened dependence on raw water import unfortunately examples of such holistic analyses remain rare due to the inherent variability in different systems as well as the lack of a suitable framework and common unit of measure to assess the complex interactions in a clear and concise way burn et al 2012 hester and little 2013 based on those knowledge of subsystems the more comprehensive evaluations of the next larger system urban water system become more important if overall system efficiency and sustainability are the goals of urban water management after all the system is more than the sum of its part xue et al 2015 ma et al 2015 emergy provides the unique common measure equipped to explore the behavior of a system as a whole and the interactions between subcomponents can be observed and optimized and its sustainability can be assessed often without looking at the next larger system it limits our understanding of the organization and relative in efficiencies of the current system as the foundation of emergy theory and evaluation methods maximum empower principle states that all self organizing systems tend to maximize their rates of emergy use or empower and those system that maximize empower will prevail brown and herendeen 1996 odum 1996 in other words prevailing systems tend to produce a maximum power output and for this purpose operate at optimal efficiency rather than at maximum efficiency emergy method offers an alternative perspective to the historically narrow attempt to equate sustainability with use fewer resources in the context of societal sub systems i e the uws implications can be thought of in terms of nested feedbacks sub systems that feed into or back upon the next larger system beget stronger more competitive systems that are able to reinforce resource intake and direct net resource savings into the development of more organized sustainable states using emergy analysis to evaluate the degree to which resources flow through or are fed back could be a powerful way of gauging the contribution of alternative uws configurations to the competitiveness and thus sustainability of the larger societal system lastly while the complexity of the uws warrants a systems approach its multidimensional nature warrants the use of multiple metrics to avoid externalization of impacts mayer 2008 xue et al 2015 emergy and life cycle assessment lca are two integrated assessment metrics that have been used in parallel or in hybrid in many sustainability evaluations of regional or product systems emergy is a donor perspective concept while lca is a receiver user perspective one emergy captures the natural capital and ecosystem contribution to a system regional or product based it focuses on total resource use for example for phosphorus and its derivative production emergy includes how much work the nature has to invest to produce phosphorus ore that has market values in technosphere in lca the system boundary of phosphorus product starts with the technosphere mining process but does not include the embedded values in phosphorus rock however besides the technological inputs lca includes environmental emissions as part of life cycle inventory the environmental impacts are the focus of lca a methodology that uses multiple metrics may compensate each other for weakness and provide better insights of the complexity of the system performance ingwersen 2011 raugei et al 2014 ulgiati et al 2006 due to the complementary natures of the two tools some researchers explore the hybrid approach such as emergy life cycle assessment by combining the features of emergy with lca bakshi 2000 baral and bakshi 2010 ulgiati et al 2007 pizzigallo et al 2008 rugani et al 2011 rugani and benetto 2012 or the two tools are used as complementary metrics to capture multi facets of an environmental system that are relevant to sustainability hopton et al 2010 ingwersen et al 2014 arbault et al 2013 the comparison of the two metrics may provide the insights to maximize system efficiency while minimize environmental impacts this study provides the first emergy analysis of a complete uws from source water abstraction to wastewater discharge using real data from the greater cincinnati area it is a companion paper to xue et al 2018 which provides an lca and life cycle costing lcc of the same system results are first presented at the dwtp and wwtp scale showing the total resource requirements of each unit process and then discussed in comparison with lca and lcc findings then emergy flows are shown at the uws scale using a subwatershed located within the service areas of the treatment plants to explore the nesting relationship of the built environment within its supporting natural environment 2 methods 2 1 cincinnati water treatment plants the two treatment plants studied are the greater cincinnati water works gcww richard miller water treatment plant dwtp and the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati msd mill creek wastewater treatment plant wwtp both located in cincinnati ohio for each plant an lca and operational cost assessment at the unit process level was performed following the international organization for standardizations iso 140 140 series usepa 2014a b this study utilized the life cycle inventories lci using operational data from 2011 the dwtp lci included the unit processes in the source water acquisition water treatment train and distribution network to the consumer the wwtp lci evaluated the unit processes including sewer collection network treatment train effluent discharge and sludge disposal for infrastructure components inputs were annualized over the assumed lifetime of the component table 1 both lcis include infrastructure and operational inputs general plant parameters are given in table 1 the dwtp fig s1 has a capacity of 240 million gallons per day mgd and supplies water for the greater cincinnati region and part of kentucky on average in 2011 it processed 106 mgd of source water from the ohio river and delivered 89 mgd to consumers with the remaining 17 mgd attributed to losses in the distribution system once source water is pumped to the plant suspended solids are removed through coagulation with aluminum sulfate and gravity settling the resulting sludge is thickened and disposed back to ohio river while the supernatant proceeds through sand filtration to remove additional solids following filtration organics and adsorbable micro pollutants are removed using granular activated carbon gac which has to be periodically regenerated on site prior to distribution the water is conditioned to adjust ph disinfected and fluorinated chlorine residuals are maintained in the distribution system usepa 2014b the wwtp fig s2 has a nominal capacity of 120 mgd and a maximum capacity of 360 mgd to accommodate high flows from the combined sewer during wet weather events during high flow events the flow can exceed the capacity of the wwtp and the excess combined sewage bypasses to nearby mill creek during non wet weather events typical wastewater are from households industry and stream baseflow lift station pumping is necessary along the collection system however the majority of transport energy is gravity based since the wwtp sits at the bottom of the sewershed at the wwtp the treatment train includes a screening step for large and settle able debris primary sedimentation for suspended solid removal secondary treatment of dissolved organics using an aerobic activated sludge process secondary clarifiers to settle flocs and disinfection prior to discharge sludge from primary and secondary treatment steps is thickened dewatered incinerated and the ash is disposed in a landfill 2 2 lick run uws in order to perform an emergy analysis of a complete uws a sub watershed located within the service area boundaries of the assessed dwtp and wwtp was selected dwtp and wwtp total service areas were not used directly as they are not identical only overlapping lick run is a 2 900 acre sub watershed of the lower mill creek watershed in cincinnati oh which sits on the north bank of the ohio river it has become the focal point of a larger effort by msd to reduce wet weather sewage discharges as it has the largest combined sewer overflow cso in msd s service area representing a quarter of the total wastewater flow generated within lick run msdgc 2009 a number of reports have been written documenting existing conditions and proposed solutions usepa 2011 from which basin characteristics and hydrologic flows basin area imperviousness vegetated annual precipitation annual evapotranspiration were derived see table s9 for calculations and sources since lick run is a sub watershed resource flows associated with the dwtp and wwtp were down scaled according to the population of lick run 13 750 relative to the service population of both treatment plants treated drinking water allocation to indoor potable indoor nonpotable and outdoor use according to mayer et al 1999 2 3 emergy analysis emergy is defined as the available energy of one form that is used up in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service odum 1996 grounded in thermodynamics and general system theory it accounts for quality differences between forms of resources and energy using a single common unit of measure solar emjoules sej the general application of the method for inputs to a process or system is demonstrated in equation 1 for each input flow of material energy or labor x i a specific quality factor unit emergy value uev i is applied resulting in an emergy value for each pathway uevs are expressed in units of sej solar emjoules per mass volume energy or dollars depending on the particular flow x i eq 1 e m e r g y i 1 i n u e v i x i application of equation 1 to each individual input allows for the quantification of total emergy input to a process or system e g a drinking water treatment plant conversely if the objective is to obtain a quality factor or uev for the output of a process or system e g the treated water from the drinking water treatment plant a rearranged version of equation 1 would be used where individual emergy inputs are summed then divided by the output quantity x for this study both approaches were utilized for inputs to the evaluated components of the study system including treatment plants and pipe networks uevs were obtained from the literature for emergy flows along pathways in the subsequent lick run analysis the inversion of equation 1 was used to calculate for example the uev of treated drinking water provided to a household all uevs used calculated and cited hereafter are referenced to the 1 20 e25 sej yr global emergy baseline brown et al 2016 uev library and emergy calculation tables are provided in the supplemental information 3 results table 2 shows the results of the emergy analysis for the cincinnati dwtp and wwtp it requires 1 8e 12 sej of resource inputs to provide 1 m3 of potable water to a cincinnati consumer nearly twice as much as the 9 1e 11 sej required to collect and treat 1 m3 of combined wastewater for drinking water treatment including infrastructure no distribution no source water 8 8e 11 sej m3 is within the range of comparable results for drinking water treatment from the literature of 4 0e 11 to 11e 11 sej m3 arbault et al 2013 buenfil 2001 pulselli et al 2011 for wastewater treatment without collection 7 3e 11 sej m3 is required by the msdgc system this is also comparable though slightly less than past studies which showed a range of 6 9e 11 to 1 5e 12 sej m3 arias and brown 2009 behrend 2007 geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 vassallo et al 2009 the fact that the cincinnati water system was the largest in size treating an annual flow of 1 6e 08 m3 yr compared to 1 2e 06 to 1 2e 07 m3 yr for past studies suggests that economies of scale may be a factor another factor that may have resulted in the lower treatment uev is that the cincinnati system is the only one to treat combined sewage which likely has a lower organics concentration than sewage without stormwater and thus may be easier to treat fig 1 provides a breakdown of emergy inputs to the major processes in the cincinnati uws from source water acquisition to wastewater discharge each process is subdivided into emergy for infrastructure inputs operational energy inputs e g electricity fuel etc and operational non energy inputs e g labor chemicals etc and is shown alongside operational cost data as shown the most resource intensive stage is drinking water distribution followed closely by drinking water acquisition treatment and wastewater treatment the high emergy inputs to the drinking water distribution system are due to the high energy inputs associated with pumping uphill owing to the location of the plant at the bottom of the ohio river valley and vice versa to explain the minimal energy inputs required for wastewater collection as well as the extensive pipe network as shown in table 1 the total mileage of piping for the distribution system is about double that of the collection system despite handling much less water annually the high resource cost of drinking water treatment is in part due to the source water quality gcww receives its source water from the ohio river which is prone to contamination by upstream municipal wastewater discharge sanitary sewer outflows and urban and agricultural storm water runoff this is reflected both in the energy inputs required for this stage as well as the non energy inputs which include chemical inputs like sodium hydroxide and aluminum sulfate used for conditioning and solids adsorption respectively for wastewater treatment energy inputs make up 65 of the total emergy input mostly due to electricity required for aeration and natural gas required for sludge incineration a breakdown of inputs by unit process is given in fig 2 in drinking water unit processes distribution is the most resource intensive with allocations split approximately in half between electricity for pumping and infrastructure mostly iron piping following distribution are energy for pumping at the plant then conditioning with sodium hydroxide on the wastewater side only 20 of the total emergy input is allocated to the collection system while the majority of the plant inputs are allocated to the treatment process 80 at the unit process level aeration is the most resource intensive all attributed to electricity this is followed by wastewater collection then sludge incineration which is primarily the result of natural gas use as the above results have shown the total resource footprints of supply and sanitation services are largely driven by a select few unit processes which are a function of energy material or labor inputs for both services approximately 40 of the total resource footprint is attributable to electricity for supply this is followed by cast iron for distribution piping 20 sodium hydroxide 11 and natural gas 5 which together with electricity make up 77 of the total emergy input table s4 on the sanitation side electricity is followed by natural gas 14 labor 12 and concrete 12 which together with electricity make up 77 of the total emergy input table s8 first these rankings indicate that the total resource footprints are most sensitive to the selection of and uncertainty in the uevs of these main inputs for example a wide range of uevs for electricity exist in the literature for fossil fuel based electricity if the grid mix include sources like nuclear and wind the uncertainty in uev is even higher brown and ulgiati 2002 caruso et al 2001 odum 1996 rugani et al 2011 second if resource use reduction is the goal replacing these main inputs with the ones having less emergy should be considered for example renewable energy sources like solar and wind generally have lower uevs 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other metrics the results of the lca analysis also showed the environmental significance of energy consumption at the dwtp wwtp and distribution system based on those results it is evident that electricity for water distribution pumping drinking water treatment in plant pumping and wastewater treatment aeration were the top three contributors to the environmental impact categories such as fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and human health criteria thus efforts to reduce energy consumption of various unit processes will be beneficial from both an emissions impact and resource appropriation perspective the lca analysis did not however find comparable environmental impact associated with drinking water infrastructure concluding that the infrastructure stage contributed less than 10 of environmental impacts with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories this discrepancy is due to differences in method goals and scopes emergy accounting takes a donor side or producer perspective and captures the work done by the geobiosphere in producing a product incorporating the time scale of material cycles in other words the scarcity of the resources is indirectly captured in the uev values lca on the other hand takes a user side or consumer perspective and focuses on the various environmental impacts of any product or process ridolfi and bastianoni 2008 rugani 2010 emergy is therefore better able to identify use of comparably scarcer resources providing an indication of excessive appropriation of specific resources in terms of operational costs the highest are attributed to drinking water and wastewater treatment stages fig 1 for drinking water that the operational costs are greatest at the treatment plant is intuitive to a degree ensuring the reliable production of water safe for public consumption is a complex process requiring sophisticated technology and close oversight while the distribution phase may be relatively more hands off largely dependent on energy for pumping pressurized piping system and materials for extensive infrastructure networks interestingly the operational emergy inputs to drinking water distribution are very high due to electricity inputs 4 92e 11 sej m3 or 96 of total operational emergy but operational costs are not despite the largest cost input also being attributed to purchased electricity 0 020 m3 or 69 of total operational cost in contrast the largest cost input to wastewater collection is for labor 0 021 m3 or 95 of total operational cost though operational emergy inputs to wastewater collection are almost negligible thus if utility managers were seeking to solely reduce operational costs of water supply economic indicators may point to drinking water treatment treatment being more costly to operate than distribution conversely a focus on environmental costs emergy and impacts lca would point towards the energy use of distribution vice versa with wastewater collection as efforts to reduce labor costs of collection would have little relative effect on treatment plant environmental burdens the discrepancy between cost in dollars and emergy displayed most prominently for water distribution and wastewater collection in fig 1 and fig s3 at the unit process level illustrates the value of directly comparing the two accounting methods economic costs reflect the work done by labor in obtaining materials and energy whereas emergy accounts for both these human services as well as the work done by the geobiosphere in generating the raw materials for wastewater collection the relatively minimal energy and materials reflect the resource efficiencies that can be achieved by using gravity as the source energy and large unpressurized pipe networks to convey flows the relatively high dollar costs 95 of which are attributed to labor and miscellaneous operation and maintenance are reflective of the large personnel efforts required to operate and maintain such an old conveyance system like many historic us cities some parts are over 100 years old indeed a direct comparison of emergy to dollars at the unit process level reveals that labor has one of the greatest emergy ratios fig s3 in comparison the fact that unit processes such as pumping have a low emergy ratio may imply that the total resource costs may be underestimated if using traditional economic accounting methods 4 2 implications for future water alternatives the large allocation of resources to the distribution system may reflect the fact that the system is designed around one quality standard i e drinking water but used for many lower quality purposes such as firefighting irrigation clothes washing and toilet flushing ma et al 2015 okun 2005 walski et al 2001 when combined with the need to periodically flush the system to maintain adequate public health standards for both potable and non potable purpose these factors result in system inefficiencies and overdesign alternatively drinking water systems designed around a decentralized and fit for purpose concept such as nonpotable water reuse may be able to alleviate some of this heavy resource burden by realizing additional efficiencies grigg et al 2013 particularly in a location like cincinnati which is also typical of numerous other large cities located on a major river decentralized nonpotable water reuse could reduce the degree of treatment required which is important in a city with relatively poor quality of source water furthermore decentralization holds promise for reducing the pipe network required to distribute large quantities of water at the wwtp the high emergy inputs required for aeration and sludge incineration support the notion that the traditional aerobic approach to oxidize dissolved organic waste is energy and resource intensive nacwa 2008 furthermore nutrient management requires still more resource investment to prevent eutrophication in receiving water bodies recent work indicates the emerging efforts to seek more comprehensive and sustainable solutions to maximize the recovery of water energy and nutrients ma et al 2015 schoen et al 2014 xue et al 2015 biogas generation from anaerobic digestion may offset the energy consumption and address sludge production issues furthermore if combined with the concept of source separation so that the nutrient and organic flows of wastewater are more concentrated not only does a wastewater treatment plant have the possibility to be energy positive ma et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 it can also help restore important nutrient cycles ma et al 2015 zeeman et al 2008 emergy could be a useful tool in weighing the additional efforts required for energy recovery like new unit process infrastructure and labor against the system benefits of reduced energy use while lca could help characterize any potential net benefits to reduced nutrient discharges for both plants non infrastructure inputs to plant treatment processes including materials chemicals energy and labor are the largest emergy inputs however resource requirements for infrastructure are still a non trivial component of the overall system being 27 of the total drinking water system and 24 of the total wastewater system this is in contrast to many urban water lca studies which demonstrate that the contribution of infrastructure to overall impacts is small enough to justify omission of these components this highlights an important difference between emergy an upstream donor side perspective which emphasizes on the total resource use including natural capital and lca a downstream receiver side perspective which focuses on the impacts of resource flows while the downstream impacts of material usage may not be great relative to those of operational inputs the natural capital consumption is still important particularly for nonrenewable materials such as metals and plastics the comparison of economic to emergy inputs also highlights an important shortcoming of traditional economic accounting in that appropriation of natural resources is not directly accounted for only the services associated with acquisition and processing of the resources when finite resources are considered in sustainability evaluations it is imperative to couple multiple tools to better capture the complexities of water systems and provide a more complete system perspective xue et al 2015 4 3 a systems perspective the utility of emergy analysis is in part due to its ability to place disparate flows of material and energy on a common unit of measure accounting for the cumulative in space and time resource inputs at multiple scales at the system scale this lends itself to evaluation of the total resource use of alternative system configurations fig 3 a and b shows the lick run uws in terms of the major flows of water and emergy respectively calculations in table s9 in these diagrams the components of the built environment are grouped together above the components of the natural environment this is done partially for energetic reasons the emergy inputs to the built environment are generally more concentrated than the renewable flows supporting the natural environment leading to greater emergy density of the built components and partially to illustrate the fact that in its current state the water flows within lick run are largely separated water inputs to the built environment including water treatment plants and consumers are generally separate from water inputs to the natural environment only in certain cases including leakage from distribution system and stormwater collection do built and natural flows intersect greater interaction between the built and natural environment is a central theme of suwm iuwm and wsud and as fig 3a illustrates great potentials for improvement in this fairly typical watershed hydrologically precipitation is the largest contributor to the system with 11 6 million cubic meters per year mm3 yr followed by abstraction from the ohio river to the dwtp at 2 8 mm3 yr of that 13 is allocated to potable indoor use 22 to nonpotable indoor use 49 to nonpotable outdoor use and 16 is lost throughout the system mostly to groundwater through pipe leaks of the 6 6 mm3 yr of precipitation that is not evapotranspired most becomes as groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff which when combined with runoff from the built system e g outdoor use of distributed water results in 3 9 mm3 yr of generated stormwater compared to the other main inputs to the collection system of potable and nonpotable indoor use 0 96 mm3 yr stormwater dominates the flow input to the wastewater system this flow pattern is a common scenario in the u s as nearly 860 municipalities nationwide have combined sewer systems css usepa compared to a natural system where 50 of rainfall is infiltrated and ultimately supports photosynthetic transpiration and healthy streamflow conditions the flow pattern of a css reduces these natural processes while increasing the burden on the collection system and wwtp u s environmental protection agency 2003 the implementation of green infrastructure practices throughout the watershed would restore a more natural hydrologic behavior thus promoting overall system productivity and resilience as well as reducing the burden on built infrastructure when viewed in terms of emergy flows several observations become apparent first inputs are hierarchical with food inputs making up the first and largest tier followed by inputs to water infrastructure then by renewable inputs all separated by at least one order of magnitude the difference between inputs of food emergy to society and inputs of nonrenewables to the built uws clearly demonstrates the magnitude of resource inputs to the modern agricultural system and demonstrates the unique perspective offered by emergy in comparing these two system inputs this partially explains the large expenditures in the sanitation sector as the concentration of food related inputs generates correspondingly large and concentrated wastewater flows which must be managed to protect human and environmental health kennedy et al 2007 crucially the emergy flows illustrated in fig 3b are overwhelmingly linear with high emergy water and sewage passing through the system with little to no feedback although the majority of the energy content of the food is extracted by human body metabolism approximately 10 is passed in urine and feces along with important nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen and potassium rose et al 2015 even if only 10 of the flow in fig 3b could be utilized this still represents a tremendous potential source of energy and nutrients under the current treatment configuration this wastewater flow is diluted and resources have to be spent on management of these wastes by the wwtp strategies such as source separation and anaerobic digestion for energy recovery could not only reduce the treatment expenditure but also offset upstream inputs for energy production for example if the system expands to the agricultural sector the recycle pathways from the uws e g dewatered sludge struvite etc could improve the resource efficiency of food provision ma et al 2015 although such an analysis is outside the scope of the current study the resource intensity of the current food production system and its interaction with the uws food water energy nexus highlights the need of domestic wastewater resource recovery and incorporation of beneficial feedbacks to improve overall system efficiency looking at emergy inputs other than food nonrenewable inputs to the built environment are still an order of magnitude larger than renewable inputs to the natural environment which represent just 2 4 of total inputs to the system table s12 still this is to be expected as cities are not self contained entities and require much externally in both time and space i e ancient biomass derived fossil fuel appropriated natural capital for support moreover renewable inputs to the united states in 2008 were also approximately 2 sweeney et al 2007 accordingly the overall system sustainability can be increased by either improving the resource use efficiency of existing processes thus lowering nonrenewable resource inputs altering the internal configuration with other more efficient unit processes or reorganizing the internal flows of resources to create beneficial feedbacks for example utilizing the currently underutilized stormwater and greywater flows mostly renewable inputs as a nonpotable source to offset potable demand mostly nonrenewable inputs and wwtp load mostly nonrenewable inputs may represent a more sustainable and balanced system configuration a system framework using emergy analysis allows decision makers to see the comprehensive internal interactions calculate the degree of internal feedback relative to total inputs identify productive vs wasteful patterns and holistically design urban water systems to maximize resource use efficiency 5 conclusions this study quantified the total resource inputs to an existing uws and placed the results within the context of the surrounding environment in doing so we have identified particularly resource intensive and inefficient components of the current system allowing for recommendation of targeted improvements crucially using fundamental principles of emergy theory we suggest that the lack of internal beneficial feedback within and between sub systems is ultimately limiting the degree to which the competitiveness or sustainability of the larger system may be improved through the future evaluation of alternative system configurations mainly those that incorporate internal feedbacks such as water nutrient and or energy reuse we can test the hypothesis that naturally stems from this work mainly systems that incorporate internal beneficial feedback mechanisms allowing for maintenance or enhancement of productivity or level of service at reduced levels of environmental resource appropriation will similarly reduce their level of environmental impact key findings of this study include centralized potable water supply including treatment and distribution is the most resource intensive urban water service in terms of emergy combined with the lack of internal feedback within the existing system decentralized nonpotable water reuse systems could help offset potable demand reducing the need for extensive infrastructure networks and resource intensive potable level treatment particularly when source water quality e g large rivers with highly developed and industrialized watersheds is poor future studies should quantify the value of this feedback relative to total system inputs aeration and sludge handling processes of the wastewater treatment stage that remove the organic waste fraction without utilizing any of its inherent energy are the sources of greatest impact at the wastewater treatment plant as measured by resource use emergy environmental impact lca and cost lcc processes that obtain energy from waste such as anaerobic digestion could be used to improve the status of all three of these metrics emergy and lca results both pointed towards drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution as environmentally burdensome stages in the urban water system however lca results emphasized environmental impacts associated with electricity use while emergy results emphasized energy use as well as infrastructure material demands particularly for the distribution system this illustrates how the two methods used together can substantiate the most environmentally critical aspects of a process or system and also where using just one method may not be able to characterize the full environmental burden important insight into the sustainability of complex systems can be gained by conducting analyses that quantify resource use emergy environmental impacts lca and cost lcc of the total system the data and framework presented here is intended to be part of an integrated sustainability framework that will be used to assess water systems for the city of tomorrow ma et al 2015

20023,with increasing populations mounting environmental pressures and aging infrastructure urban water and wastewater utilities have to make investment decisions limited by both economic and environmental constraints the challenges facing urban water systems can no longer be sustainably solved by traditional siloed water management approaches a central premise of contemporary urban water management paradigms is that in order for urban water systems to be more sustainable and economical an improvement in resource use efficiency at system level must be achieved this study provides a quantification of the total resource use of a typical urban water system exemplified in greater cincinnati region from raw water extraction for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge providing a better understanding of resource expenditure distributions within the system and a necessary benchmark to which future system improvements can be compared the emergy methodology was used so that the total environmental work required to produce disparate system inputs could be expressed using a common unit the results were compared to the concurring life cycle assessment lca and life cycle costing lcc results of the same system emergy results highlight drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution as two resource intensive stages with energy for pumping and chemicals for conditioning representing the greatest inputs to the former and energy for pumping and metals for piping representing the greatest inputs to the latter for wastewater collection and treatment stages aeration and sludge handling were identified as the highest emergy unit processes mostly due to energy use comparison with lca results substantiate the environmental concerns associated with energy use in the drinking water treatment and distribution stages but indicate that environmental burdens associated with infrastructure are more dependent upon upstream resource use rather than downstream environmental impact results from emergy lca and lcc point towards aeration and sludge handling as two unit processes on the wastewater side that are particularly costly and environmentally impactful results in total are used to suggest alternative strategies that can alleviate identified environmental burdens and economic costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords emergy integrated urban water management sustainability system analysis resource efficiency 1 introduction urban water challenges in industrialized nations are no longer solely comprised of the low cost provision of supply sanitation and drainage services as populations increase energy and water resources become more scarce and ecological impacts mount urban water resource managers must also take into account factors such as total resource use and environmental impacts of investment decisions to do so managers must have a holistic understanding of current urban water systems and search for system level integrated solutions that maximize public utility operation alliance 2017 hering et al 2013 luthy 2013 these themes are echoed in recently developed management approaches including sustainable urban water management suwm larsen and gujer 1997 marlow et al 2013 integrated urban water management iuwm and water sensitive urban design wsud wong 2006 a central theme of each approach is that in order for urban water systems uws here broadly referring to the infrastructure associated with the provision of supply sanitation and drainage services in urban areas to become more sustainable an improvement in overall resource use efficiency is necessary marlow et al 2013 thus a necessary first step is the quantification of the total resource use of the existing uws emergy analysis is a method used to quantify and compare different resource inputs using a common unit providing a unique broad and inclusive measure of total resource use of a system in contrast to traditional economic accounting which primarily accounts for the human labor required to make a product or service emergy also accounts for the work done by nature to produce the natural capital e g water energy minerals etc upon which those products or services depend thus providing a direct accounting of the full resource costs previous studies have used emergy analysis to evaluate different components of the urban water system including different drinking water treatment plants dwtp arbault et al 2013 buenfil 2001 pulselli et al 2011 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 siracusa and la rosa 2006 vassallo et al 2009 and alternatives to conventional wwtps such as anaerobic digesters moss et al 2014 and treatment wetlands arias and brown 2009 geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 siracusa and la rosa 2006 while quantifying the resource costs of water treatment using different approaches which are shown to be site specific and highly dependent upon the locally demanded level of service these studies also provided significant advances to the emergy methodology for example buenfil 2001 provided a comprehensive evaluation of water supply alternatives and used the emergy to money ratio to show that potable water is highly economically undervalued arbault et al 2013 through the use of emergy based indicators showed that dwtps are rather blind to economic markets and exert a low pressure on local non renewable resources at the expense of imported non renewable resources in studies comparing traditional wwtps to alternative treatment approaches such as constructed wetlands study objectives varied but were loosely based on the idea that in order to improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment treatment systems should use more renewable resources and less total resources to that end arias and brown 2009 showed that when land area is available and wastewater flows aren t very large constructed wetlands provide greater value than conventional wwtps in terms of performance cost and resource utilization siracusa and la rosa 2006 showed that treating wwtp effluent with a constructed wetland and beneficially reusing the final effluent in dry rural agricultural areas conferred a reduction in net resource use compared to full treatment in a wwtp and discharge to a river lastly geber and bjorkland found that when holding level of service in this case phosphorus removal constant the total resource inputs required for treatment using a tertiary wwtp secondary wwtp constructed wetland and natural wetland only were strikingly similar geber and bjorklund 2001 though useful past studies have largely fallen short in considering an individual treatment system s interaction with the next larger system i e the urban water systems although drinking water or wastewater treatment is a system itself but only a subsystem when the entire urban water system is considered for example water reuse at the neighborhood scale may be more resource intensive than a centralized wwtp however if it offsets potable demand and reduces the piping infrastructure requirements there may be a net improvement to overall uws efficiency not to mention the greater resiliency conferred through a lessened dependence on raw water import unfortunately examples of such holistic analyses remain rare due to the inherent variability in different systems as well as the lack of a suitable framework and common unit of measure to assess the complex interactions in a clear and concise way burn et al 2012 hester and little 2013 based on those knowledge of subsystems the more comprehensive evaluations of the next larger system urban water system become more important if overall system efficiency and sustainability are the goals of urban water management after all the system is more than the sum of its part xue et al 2015 ma et al 2015 emergy provides the unique common measure equipped to explore the behavior of a system as a whole and the interactions between subcomponents can be observed and optimized and its sustainability can be assessed often without looking at the next larger system it limits our understanding of the organization and relative in efficiencies of the current system as the foundation of emergy theory and evaluation methods maximum empower principle states that all self organizing systems tend to maximize their rates of emergy use or empower and those system that maximize empower will prevail brown and herendeen 1996 odum 1996 in other words prevailing systems tend to produce a maximum power output and for this purpose operate at optimal efficiency rather than at maximum efficiency emergy method offers an alternative perspective to the historically narrow attempt to equate sustainability with use fewer resources in the context of societal sub systems i e the uws implications can be thought of in terms of nested feedbacks sub systems that feed into or back upon the next larger system beget stronger more competitive systems that are able to reinforce resource intake and direct net resource savings into the development of more organized sustainable states using emergy analysis to evaluate the degree to which resources flow through or are fed back could be a powerful way of gauging the contribution of alternative uws configurations to the competitiveness and thus sustainability of the larger societal system lastly while the complexity of the uws warrants a systems approach its multidimensional nature warrants the use of multiple metrics to avoid externalization of impacts mayer 2008 xue et al 2015 emergy and life cycle assessment lca are two integrated assessment metrics that have been used in parallel or in hybrid in many sustainability evaluations of regional or product systems emergy is a donor perspective concept while lca is a receiver user perspective one emergy captures the natural capital and ecosystem contribution to a system regional or product based it focuses on total resource use for example for phosphorus and its derivative production emergy includes how much work the nature has to invest to produce phosphorus ore that has market values in technosphere in lca the system boundary of phosphorus product starts with the technosphere mining process but does not include the embedded values in phosphorus rock however besides the technological inputs lca includes environmental emissions as part of life cycle inventory the environmental impacts are the focus of lca a methodology that uses multiple metrics may compensate each other for weakness and provide better insights of the complexity of the system performance ingwersen 2011 raugei et al 2014 ulgiati et al 2006 due to the complementary natures of the two tools some researchers explore the hybrid approach such as emergy life cycle assessment by combining the features of emergy with lca bakshi 2000 baral and bakshi 2010 ulgiati et al 2007 pizzigallo et al 2008 rugani et al 2011 rugani and benetto 2012 or the two tools are used as complementary metrics to capture multi facets of an environmental system that are relevant to sustainability hopton et al 2010 ingwersen et al 2014 arbault et al 2013 the comparison of the two metrics may provide the insights to maximize system efficiency while minimize environmental impacts this study provides the first emergy analysis of a complete uws from source water abstraction to wastewater discharge using real data from the greater cincinnati area it is a companion paper to xue et al 2018 which provides an lca and life cycle costing lcc of the same system results are first presented at the dwtp and wwtp scale showing the total resource requirements of each unit process and then discussed in comparison with lca and lcc findings then emergy flows are shown at the uws scale using a subwatershed located within the service areas of the treatment plants to explore the nesting relationship of the built environment within its supporting natural environment 2 methods 2 1 cincinnati water treatment plants the two treatment plants studied are the greater cincinnati water works gcww richard miller water treatment plant dwtp and the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati msd mill creek wastewater treatment plant wwtp both located in cincinnati ohio for each plant an lca and operational cost assessment at the unit process level was performed following the international organization for standardizations iso 140 140 series usepa 2014a b this study utilized the life cycle inventories lci using operational data from 2011 the dwtp lci included the unit processes in the source water acquisition water treatment train and distribution network to the consumer the wwtp lci evaluated the unit processes including sewer collection network treatment train effluent discharge and sludge disposal for infrastructure components inputs were annualized over the assumed lifetime of the component table 1 both lcis include infrastructure and operational inputs general plant parameters are given in table 1 the dwtp fig s1 has a capacity of 240 million gallons per day mgd and supplies water for the greater cincinnati region and part of kentucky on average in 2011 it processed 106 mgd of source water from the ohio river and delivered 89 mgd to consumers with the remaining 17 mgd attributed to losses in the distribution system once source water is pumped to the plant suspended solids are removed through coagulation with aluminum sulfate and gravity settling the resulting sludge is thickened and disposed back to ohio river while the supernatant proceeds through sand filtration to remove additional solids following filtration organics and adsorbable micro pollutants are removed using granular activated carbon gac which has to be periodically regenerated on site prior to distribution the water is conditioned to adjust ph disinfected and fluorinated chlorine residuals are maintained in the distribution system usepa 2014b the wwtp fig s2 has a nominal capacity of 120 mgd and a maximum capacity of 360 mgd to accommodate high flows from the combined sewer during wet weather events during high flow events the flow can exceed the capacity of the wwtp and the excess combined sewage bypasses to nearby mill creek during non wet weather events typical wastewater are from households industry and stream baseflow lift station pumping is necessary along the collection system however the majority of transport energy is gravity based since the wwtp sits at the bottom of the sewershed at the wwtp the treatment train includes a screening step for large and settle able debris primary sedimentation for suspended solid removal secondary treatment of dissolved organics using an aerobic activated sludge process secondary clarifiers to settle flocs and disinfection prior to discharge sludge from primary and secondary treatment steps is thickened dewatered incinerated and the ash is disposed in a landfill 2 2 lick run uws in order to perform an emergy analysis of a complete uws a sub watershed located within the service area boundaries of the assessed dwtp and wwtp was selected dwtp and wwtp total service areas were not used directly as they are not identical only overlapping lick run is a 2 900 acre sub watershed of the lower mill creek watershed in cincinnati oh which sits on the north bank of the ohio river it has become the focal point of a larger effort by msd to reduce wet weather sewage discharges as it has the largest combined sewer overflow cso in msd s service area representing a quarter of the total wastewater flow generated within lick run msdgc 2009 a number of reports have been written documenting existing conditions and proposed solutions usepa 2011 from which basin characteristics and hydrologic flows basin area imperviousness vegetated annual precipitation annual evapotranspiration were derived see table s9 for calculations and sources since lick run is a sub watershed resource flows associated with the dwtp and wwtp were down scaled according to the population of lick run 13 750 relative to the service population of both treatment plants treated drinking water allocation to indoor potable indoor nonpotable and outdoor use according to mayer et al 1999 2 3 emergy analysis emergy is defined as the available energy of one form that is used up in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service odum 1996 grounded in thermodynamics and general system theory it accounts for quality differences between forms of resources and energy using a single common unit of measure solar emjoules sej the general application of the method for inputs to a process or system is demonstrated in equation 1 for each input flow of material energy or labor x i a specific quality factor unit emergy value uev i is applied resulting in an emergy value for each pathway uevs are expressed in units of sej solar emjoules per mass volume energy or dollars depending on the particular flow x i eq 1 e m e r g y i 1 i n u e v i x i application of equation 1 to each individual input allows for the quantification of total emergy input to a process or system e g a drinking water treatment plant conversely if the objective is to obtain a quality factor or uev for the output of a process or system e g the treated water from the drinking water treatment plant a rearranged version of equation 1 would be used where individual emergy inputs are summed then divided by the output quantity x for this study both approaches were utilized for inputs to the evaluated components of the study system including treatment plants and pipe networks uevs were obtained from the literature for emergy flows along pathways in the subsequent lick run analysis the inversion of equation 1 was used to calculate for example the uev of treated drinking water provided to a household all uevs used calculated and cited hereafter are referenced to the 1 20 e25 sej yr global emergy baseline brown et al 2016 uev library and emergy calculation tables are provided in the supplemental information 3 results table 2 shows the results of the emergy analysis for the cincinnati dwtp and wwtp it requires 1 8e 12 sej of resource inputs to provide 1 m3 of potable water to a cincinnati consumer nearly twice as much as the 9 1e 11 sej required to collect and treat 1 m3 of combined wastewater for drinking water treatment including infrastructure no distribution no source water 8 8e 11 sej m3 is within the range of comparable results for drinking water treatment from the literature of 4 0e 11 to 11e 11 sej m3 arbault et al 2013 buenfil 2001 pulselli et al 2011 for wastewater treatment without collection 7 3e 11 sej m3 is required by the msdgc system this is also comparable though slightly less than past studies which showed a range of 6 9e 11 to 1 5e 12 sej m3 arias and brown 2009 behrend 2007 geber and bjorklund 2001 nelson 1998 vassallo et al 2009 the fact that the cincinnati water system was the largest in size treating an annual flow of 1 6e 08 m3 yr compared to 1 2e 06 to 1 2e 07 m3 yr for past studies suggests that economies of scale may be a factor another factor that may have resulted in the lower treatment uev is that the cincinnati system is the only one to treat combined sewage which likely has a lower organics concentration than sewage without stormwater and thus may be easier to treat fig 1 provides a breakdown of emergy inputs to the major processes in the cincinnati uws from source water acquisition to wastewater discharge each process is subdivided into emergy for infrastructure inputs operational energy inputs e g electricity fuel etc and operational non energy inputs e g labor chemicals etc and is shown alongside operational cost data as shown the most resource intensive stage is drinking water distribution followed closely by drinking water acquisition treatment and wastewater treatment the high emergy inputs to the drinking water distribution system are due to the high energy inputs associated with pumping uphill owing to the location of the plant at the bottom of the ohio river valley and vice versa to explain the minimal energy inputs required for wastewater collection as well as the extensive pipe network as shown in table 1 the total mileage of piping for the distribution system is about double that of the collection system despite handling much less water annually the high resource cost of drinking water treatment is in part due to the source water quality gcww receives its source water from the ohio river which is prone to contamination by upstream municipal wastewater discharge sanitary sewer outflows and urban and agricultural storm water runoff this is reflected both in the energy inputs required for this stage as well as the non energy inputs which include chemical inputs like sodium hydroxide and aluminum sulfate used for conditioning and solids adsorption respectively for wastewater treatment energy inputs make up 65 of the total emergy input mostly due to electricity required for aeration and natural gas required for sludge incineration a breakdown of inputs by unit process is given in fig 2 in drinking water unit processes distribution is the most resource intensive with allocations split approximately in half between electricity for pumping and infrastructure mostly iron piping following distribution are energy for pumping at the plant then conditioning with sodium hydroxide on the wastewater side only 20 of the total emergy input is allocated to the collection system while the majority of the plant inputs are allocated to the treatment process 80 at the unit process level aeration is the most resource intensive all attributed to electricity this is followed by wastewater collection then sludge incineration which is primarily the result of natural gas use as the above results have shown the total resource footprints of supply and sanitation services are largely driven by a select few unit processes which are a function of energy material or labor inputs for both services approximately 40 of the total resource footprint is attributable to electricity for supply this is followed by cast iron for distribution piping 20 sodium hydroxide 11 and natural gas 5 which together with electricity make up 77 of the total emergy input table s4 on the sanitation side electricity is followed by natural gas 14 labor 12 and concrete 12 which together with electricity make up 77 of the total emergy input table s8 first these rankings indicate that the total resource footprints are most sensitive to the selection of and uncertainty in the uevs of these main inputs for example a wide range of uevs for electricity exist in the literature for fossil fuel based electricity if the grid mix include sources like nuclear and wind the uncertainty in uev is even higher brown and ulgiati 2002 caruso et al 2001 odum 1996 rugani et al 2011 second if resource use reduction is the goal replacing these main inputs with the ones having less emergy should be considered for example renewable energy sources like solar and wind generally have lower uevs 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other metrics the results of the lca analysis also showed the environmental significance of energy consumption at the dwtp wwtp and distribution system based on those results it is evident that electricity for water distribution pumping drinking water treatment in plant pumping and wastewater treatment aeration were the top three contributors to the environmental impact categories such as fossil fuel depletion acidification smog ozone depletion human health cancer and human health criteria thus efforts to reduce energy consumption of various unit processes will be beneficial from both an emissions impact and resource appropriation perspective the lca analysis did not however find comparable environmental impact associated with drinking water infrastructure concluding that the infrastructure stage contributed less than 10 of environmental impacts with the exception of metal depletion and human noncancer impact categories this discrepancy is due to differences in method goals and scopes emergy accounting takes a donor side or producer perspective and captures the work done by the geobiosphere in producing a product incorporating the time scale of material cycles in other words the scarcity of the resources is indirectly captured in the uev values lca on the other hand takes a user side or consumer perspective and focuses on the various environmental impacts of any product or process ridolfi and bastianoni 2008 rugani 2010 emergy is therefore better able to identify use of comparably scarcer resources providing an indication of excessive appropriation of specific resources in terms of operational costs the highest are attributed to drinking water and wastewater treatment stages fig 1 for drinking water that the operational costs are greatest at the treatment plant is intuitive to a degree ensuring the reliable production of water safe for public consumption is a complex process requiring sophisticated technology and close oversight while the distribution phase may be relatively more hands off largely dependent on energy for pumping pressurized piping system and materials for extensive infrastructure networks interestingly the operational emergy inputs to drinking water distribution are very high due to electricity inputs 4 92e 11 sej m3 or 96 of total operational emergy but operational costs are not despite the largest cost input also being attributed to purchased electricity 0 020 m3 or 69 of total operational cost in contrast the largest cost input to wastewater collection is for labor 0 021 m3 or 95 of total operational cost though operational emergy inputs to wastewater collection are almost negligible thus if utility managers were seeking to solely reduce operational costs of water supply economic indicators may point to drinking water treatment treatment being more costly to operate than distribution conversely a focus on environmental costs emergy and impacts lca would point towards the energy use of distribution vice versa with wastewater collection as efforts to reduce labor costs of collection would have little relative effect on treatment plant environmental burdens the discrepancy between cost in dollars and emergy displayed most prominently for water distribution and wastewater collection in fig 1 and fig s3 at the unit process level illustrates the value of directly comparing the two accounting methods economic costs reflect the work done by labor in obtaining materials and energy whereas emergy accounts for both these human services as well as the work done by the geobiosphere in generating the raw materials for wastewater collection the relatively minimal energy and materials reflect the resource efficiencies that can be achieved by using gravity as the source energy and large unpressurized pipe networks to convey flows the relatively high dollar costs 95 of which are attributed to labor and miscellaneous operation and maintenance are reflective of the large personnel efforts required to operate and maintain such an old conveyance system like many historic us cities some parts are over 100 years old indeed a direct comparison of emergy to dollars at the unit process level reveals that labor has one of the greatest emergy ratios fig s3 in comparison the fact that unit processes such as pumping have a low emergy ratio may imply that the total resource costs may be underestimated if using traditional economic accounting methods 4 2 implications for future water alternatives the large allocation of resources to the distribution system may reflect the fact that the system is designed around one quality standard i e drinking water but used for many lower quality purposes such as firefighting irrigation clothes washing and toilet flushing ma et al 2015 okun 2005 walski et al 2001 when combined with the need to periodically flush the system to maintain adequate public health standards for both potable and non potable purpose these factors result in system inefficiencies and overdesign alternatively drinking water systems designed around a decentralized and fit for purpose concept such as nonpotable water reuse may be able to alleviate some of this heavy resource burden by realizing additional efficiencies grigg et al 2013 particularly in a location like cincinnati which is also typical of numerous other large cities located on a major river decentralized nonpotable water reuse could reduce the degree of treatment required which is important in a city with relatively poor quality of source water furthermore decentralization holds promise for reducing the pipe network required to distribute large quantities of water at the wwtp the high emergy inputs required for aeration and sludge incineration support the notion that the traditional aerobic approach to oxidize dissolved organic waste is energy and resource intensive nacwa 2008 furthermore nutrient management requires still more resource investment to prevent eutrophication in receiving water bodies recent work indicates the emerging efforts to seek more comprehensive and sustainable solutions to maximize the recovery of water energy and nutrients ma et al 2015 schoen et al 2014 xue et al 2015 biogas generation from anaerobic digestion may offset the energy consumption and address sludge production issues furthermore if combined with the concept of source separation so that the nutrient and organic flows of wastewater are more concentrated not only does a wastewater treatment plant have the possibility to be energy positive ma et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 it can also help restore important nutrient cycles ma et al 2015 zeeman et al 2008 emergy could be a useful tool in weighing the additional efforts required for energy recovery like new unit process infrastructure and labor against the system benefits of reduced energy use while lca could help characterize any potential net benefits to reduced nutrient discharges for both plants non infrastructure inputs to plant treatment processes including materials chemicals energy and labor are the largest emergy inputs however resource requirements for infrastructure are still a non trivial component of the overall system being 27 of the total drinking water system and 24 of the total wastewater system this is in contrast to many urban water lca studies which demonstrate that the contribution of infrastructure to overall impacts is small enough to justify omission of these components this highlights an important difference between emergy an upstream donor side perspective which emphasizes on the total resource use including natural capital and lca a downstream receiver side perspective which focuses on the impacts of resource flows while the downstream impacts of material usage may not be great relative to those of operational inputs the natural capital consumption is still important particularly for nonrenewable materials such as metals and plastics the comparison of economic to emergy inputs also highlights an important shortcoming of traditional economic accounting in that appropriation of natural resources is not directly accounted for only the services associated with acquisition and processing of the resources when finite resources are considered in sustainability evaluations it is imperative to couple multiple tools to better capture the complexities of water systems and provide a more complete system perspective xue et al 2015 4 3 a systems perspective the utility of emergy analysis is in part due to its ability to place disparate flows of material and energy on a common unit of measure accounting for the cumulative in space and time resource inputs at multiple scales at the system scale this lends itself to evaluation of the total resource use of alternative system configurations fig 3 a and b shows the lick run uws in terms of the major flows of water and emergy respectively calculations in table s9 in these diagrams the components of the built environment are grouped together above the components of the natural environment this is done partially for energetic reasons the emergy inputs to the built environment are generally more concentrated than the renewable flows supporting the natural environment leading to greater emergy density of the built components and partially to illustrate the fact that in its current state the water flows within lick run are largely separated water inputs to the built environment including water treatment plants and consumers are generally separate from water inputs to the natural environment only in certain cases including leakage from distribution system and stormwater collection do built and natural flows intersect greater interaction between the built and natural environment is a central theme of suwm iuwm and wsud and as fig 3a illustrates great potentials for improvement in this fairly typical watershed hydrologically precipitation is the largest contributor to the system with 11 6 million cubic meters per year mm3 yr followed by abstraction from the ohio river to the dwtp at 2 8 mm3 yr of that 13 is allocated to potable indoor use 22 to nonpotable indoor use 49 to nonpotable outdoor use and 16 is lost throughout the system mostly to groundwater through pipe leaks of the 6 6 mm3 yr of precipitation that is not evapotranspired most becomes as groundwater recharge or stormwater runoff which when combined with runoff from the built system e g outdoor use of distributed water results in 3 9 mm3 yr of generated stormwater compared to the other main inputs to the collection system of potable and nonpotable indoor use 0 96 mm3 yr stormwater dominates the flow input to the wastewater system this flow pattern is a common scenario in the u s as nearly 860 municipalities nationwide have combined sewer systems css usepa compared to a natural system where 50 of rainfall is infiltrated and ultimately supports photosynthetic transpiration and healthy streamflow conditions the flow pattern of a css reduces these natural processes while increasing the burden on the collection system and wwtp u s environmental protection agency 2003 the implementation of green infrastructure practices throughout the watershed would restore a more natural hydrologic behavior thus promoting overall system productivity and resilience as well as reducing the burden on built infrastructure when viewed in terms of emergy flows several observations become apparent first inputs are hierarchical with food inputs making up the first and largest tier followed by inputs to water infrastructure then by renewable inputs all separated by at least one order of magnitude the difference between inputs of food emergy to society and inputs of nonrenewables to the built uws clearly demonstrates the magnitude of resource inputs to the modern agricultural system and demonstrates the unique perspective offered by emergy in comparing these two system inputs this partially explains the large expenditures in the sanitation sector as the concentration of food related inputs generates correspondingly large and concentrated wastewater flows which must be managed to protect human and environmental health kennedy et al 2007 crucially the emergy flows illustrated in fig 3b are overwhelmingly linear with high emergy water and sewage passing through the system with little to no feedback although the majority of the energy content of the food is extracted by human body metabolism approximately 10 is passed in urine and feces along with important nutrients such as phosphorus nitrogen and potassium rose et al 2015 even if only 10 of the flow in fig 3b could be utilized this still represents a tremendous potential source of energy and nutrients under the current treatment configuration this wastewater flow is diluted and resources have to be spent on management of these wastes by the wwtp strategies such as source separation and anaerobic digestion for energy recovery could not only reduce the treatment expenditure but also offset upstream inputs for energy production for example if the system expands to the agricultural sector the recycle pathways from the uws e g dewatered sludge struvite etc could improve the resource efficiency of food provision ma et al 2015 although such an analysis is outside the scope of the current study the resource intensity of the current food production system and its interaction with the uws food water energy nexus highlights the need of domestic wastewater resource recovery and incorporation of beneficial feedbacks to improve overall system efficiency looking at emergy inputs other than food nonrenewable inputs to the built environment are still an order of magnitude larger than renewable inputs to the natural environment which represent just 2 4 of total inputs to the system table s12 still this is to be expected as cities are not self contained entities and require much externally in both time and space i e ancient biomass derived fossil fuel appropriated natural capital for support moreover renewable inputs to the united states in 2008 were also approximately 2 sweeney et al 2007 accordingly the overall system sustainability can be increased by either improving the resource use efficiency of existing processes thus lowering nonrenewable resource inputs altering the internal configuration with other more efficient unit processes or reorganizing the internal flows of resources to create beneficial feedbacks for example utilizing the currently underutilized stormwater and greywater flows mostly renewable inputs as a nonpotable source to offset potable demand mostly nonrenewable inputs and wwtp load mostly nonrenewable inputs may represent a more sustainable and balanced system configuration a system framework using emergy analysis allows decision makers to see the comprehensive internal interactions calculate the degree of internal feedback relative to total inputs identify productive vs wasteful patterns and holistically design urban water systems to maximize resource use efficiency 5 conclusions this study quantified the total resource inputs to an existing uws and placed the results within the context of the surrounding environment in doing so we have identified particularly resource intensive and inefficient components of the current system allowing for recommendation of targeted improvements crucially using fundamental principles of emergy theory we suggest that the lack of internal beneficial feedback within and between sub systems is ultimately limiting the degree to which the competitiveness or sustainability of the larger system may be improved through the future evaluation of alternative system configurations mainly those that incorporate internal feedbacks such as water nutrient and or energy reuse we can test the hypothesis that naturally stems from this work mainly systems that incorporate internal beneficial feedback mechanisms allowing for maintenance or enhancement of productivity or level of service at reduced levels of environmental resource appropriation will similarly reduce their level of environmental impact key findings of this study include centralized potable water supply including treatment and distribution is the most resource intensive urban water service in terms of emergy combined with the lack of internal feedback within the existing system decentralized nonpotable water reuse systems could help offset potable demand reducing the need for extensive infrastructure networks and resource intensive potable level treatment particularly when source water quality e g large rivers with highly developed and industrialized watersheds is poor future studies should quantify the value of this feedback relative to total system inputs aeration and sludge handling processes of the wastewater treatment stage that remove the organic waste fraction without utilizing any of its inherent energy are the sources of greatest impact at the wastewater treatment plant as measured by resource use emergy environmental impact lca and cost lcc processes that obtain energy from waste such as anaerobic digestion could be used to improve the status of all three of these metrics emergy and lca results both pointed towards drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution as environmentally burdensome stages in the urban water system however lca results emphasized environmental impacts associated with electricity use while emergy results emphasized energy use as well as infrastructure material demands particularly for the distribution system this illustrates how the two methods used together can substantiate the most environmentally critical aspects of a process or system and also where using just one method may not be able to characterize the full environmental burden important insight into the sustainability of complex systems can be gained by conducting analyses that quantify resource use emergy environmental impacts lca and cost lcc of the total system the data and framework presented here is intended to be part of an integrated sustainability framework that will be used to assess water systems for the city of tomorrow ma et al 2015

20024,population growth paired with growing freshwater scarcity in various parts of the world will reduce the potential of food self sufficiency in many countries today two thirds of the global population are already living in areas facing severe water scarcity at least one month of the year this raises the importance of addressing the relationship between water availability and food import in water scarce countries net import of staple crops including cereals roots and tubers is analysed in relation to water availability per capita for the period 1961 2010 considering five decadal averages the relation found is used together with the population growth scenarios from the united nations to project staple crop imports in water scarce countries for the year 2050 as a result of population growth in water scarce countries alone global international trade in staple crops is projected to increase by a factor of 1 4 1 8 towards 2050 compared to the average in 2001 2010 in order to meet the staple food needs of the 42 most water scarce countries in the world graphical abstract image 1 keywords global trade food security staple crops water scarcity population growth 1 introduction water scarcity is a major challenge in the coming decades particularly for food production davis et al 2017 an estimated 4 0 billion people are living under conditions of severe water scarcity for at least 1 month of the year 3 3 billion for at least 3 months and 1 8 billion at least half a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the increasing population and the changing pattern of water availability that results from global warming reduce the potential of sufficient food production in many countries godfray et al 2010 given that already today most water scarce countries rely on food imports the question is how much the water scarcity driven global demand for food imports may grow according to the medium projection of the united nations the world population will reach 9 7 billion by 2050 and exceed 11 billion by 2100 united nations 2015 africa and asia will have the highest population growth between 2015 and 2050 with projected population increases of 52 and 17 respectively united nations 2015 these two continents already have the highest undernourishment prevalence levels viz 20 and 12 of their total population respectively fao et al 2015 population growth and climate change are major variables affecting future water demand and scarcity vörösmarty et al 2000 and thus food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 while the green revolution helped in the past to feed a growing global population there is a growing concern about the future gilland 2002 climate change is expected to aggravate the situation and threatening food security by altering spatial and temporal rainfall patterns reducing crop yields in various vulnerable regions parry et al 2004 and lowering food security particularly in sub saharan africa and south asia schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 however it has been widely acknowledged that when it comes to water scarcity population growth is a bigger driver than climate change arnell 2004 gerten et al 2011 schewe et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 food insecurity in water scarce countries can partially be mitigated through improving water productivity in crop production kate et al 2013 through better irrigation and agricultural management practices chukalla et al 2015 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 tilman et al 2011 food import may be another solution to fill the gap between demand and supply from domestic food production in many countries and especially in water scarce countries such imports go along with virtual water import allan 1998 externalising water consumption virtual water trade could be a solution to cope with physical water scarcity if water scare countries import their water intensive food needs from water abundant countries aldaya et al 2010 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 hoekstra and hung 2005 during the past decade a growing number of virtual water trade studies has become available antonelli and sartori 2015 hoekstra 2017 some focussed on quantification and others on analysing policy implications but surprisingly little effort has been made to correlate virtual water import to water scarcity most notably for countries in asia and africa yang et al 2003 investigated the relationship between cereal import and per capita water resources availability for a period of ten years a water scarcity threshold of about 1500 m3 y per capita was identified below which cereal import of a country increases exponentially with the decline of per capita water availability above it no direct relationship was found between cereal import and water endowment a weakness of this study was that staple crops other than cereals like starchy roots and tubers e g cassava potatoes sweet potatoes and yam were not included while many developing countries depend on these other staple crops besides it is more meaningful to consider staple food import in terms of kcal per capita than in terms of kg per capita no follow up has been given after this valuable initial study from yang et al 2003 while good insight into water scarcity driven demand for food import could be useful to project future needs of the many countries that face water scarcity already today this paper aims to study the relation between import of staple foods including cereals roots and tubers and water scarcity with a long term and global perspective the net import of staple crops in kcal y per capita is analysed in relation to water availability per capita for the period 1961 2010 considering five decadal averages the relation found is used together with the low medium and high population growth scenarios from the un united nations 2015 to project future staple crops import in water scarce countries for the year 2050 additionally we investigate the uncertainties related to the three population scenarios and related to the regression analysis 2 material and methods countries have been selected based on three criteria the selection contains countries with a maximum average blue water availability of 5000 m3 y per capita in the period 2001 2010 excluded are countries for which more than 50 of total domestic supply of staple crops is for feed seed processing or other uses and not for food supply excluded are also countries with a population smaller than 500 000 inhabitants in the year 2010 this resulted in a selection of 42 countries in total 13 staple crops were selected barley cassava maize millet and products oats potatoes rice rye sorghum soybeans sweet potatoes wheat and yams the selection is based on the main produced consumed and traded crops globally the selected crops account to 45 of total crop quantity produced 50 of total food supply in kcal day per capita 44 of total crop import and 43 of the total crop export quantities in 2010 fao 2015 gross imports and exports of staple crops in tonne y per country for the period of study 1961 2010 were taken from the faostat database fao 2015 net imports of staple crops in kg were converted into kcal using conversion rates supplemental table 1 per country average net import of staple crops per decade was calculated for each of the five decades in the study period and net import per capita was calculated using decadal average population data from the un united nations 2015 the total blue water availability per capita per country was derived from the faostat database fao 2015 water availability is taken as the total renewable water resources trwr which is the sum of internal and external renewable water resources of a country fao 2003 we added per country the yearly produced desalinated water although desalinated water is mostly used in other sectors than agriculture it helps in reducing the overall pressure on freshwater resources in this way countries that use desalinated water may dedicate a larger share of their fresh water to agriculture the trwr values representing 30 year averages 1961 1990 are assumed to be constant per country over the period of study and divided by decadal averages of population to obtain average water availability per capita per decade regression modelling is used to analyse the relation between the blue water availability per capita y and the net import of staple crops per capita x statistical model testing proved a logarithmic relation to yield the best fit amongst standard functional options for the relation the model was extended to the equation y a log x b i 2 42 c i d i including country specific biases c i implemented by including country specific dummy variables d i statistically country specific biases were significant for most countries and the model extension improved the fitness of the model higher r2 the medium population growth scenario of the un united nations 2015 is used to obtain projections for the decrease in blue water availability per capita per country for the year 2050 the projected net import of staple crops per capita per country in 2050 y based on the blue water availability per capita per country for the year 2050 x is estimated using the equation y a log x b i 2 42 c i d i e i whereby the values for a b and c are taken according to the best fitting curve for the last decade 2001 2010 and ei is the difference between the curve and the value in the last decade for each country the impact of two types of projection uncertainties are estimated the uncertainty in population growth is studied by considering un s low and high population growth scenarios united nations 2015 the uncertainty in the shape of the regression curve is estimated by varying the regression slope coefficient within its 95 reliability interval 3 results 3 1 past blue water availability and net import of staple crops 1961 2010 changes in blue water availability and net import of staple crops from the period 1961 1970 to the period 2001 2010 for 42 selected countries show a clear general trend fig 1 there is a continuous increase in net import of staple crops per capita with decreasing water availability per capita the effect of decreasing water availability per capita on food import becomes more pronounced when water availability becomes less the best fitting regression curve through all data points when also including the data points for all five decades considered follows a logarithmic shape as shown in the supplementary information supplemental fig 1 india pakistan and sri lanka were the exceptions to the general pattern with decreasing net staple food imports while sri lanka remained a net importer of staple crops india and pakistan shifted to become net exporters some countries shifted from being net exporters of staple crops during the first decade to net importers in the last decade this is the case for chad malawi niger kenya south arica swaziland and zimbabwe where a growing domestic demand of staple crops due to population growth affected the countries capability to export and increased their import of staple crops while fig 1 shows changes in blue water availability and staple crops import per capita between the initial and last period exclusively hiding intermediate points in time fig 2 shows all data for the five decadal averages for a few selected countries this exemplifies that some countries shift gradually over time while other countries show a bit more erratic behaviour each country has its specific underlying story benin exhibits a progressive decrease in blue water availability and increase in the net import of staple crops consistent with the shape of the global regression curve for iraq there was a drop in net staple food import between the 1980s and 1990s the economic sanctions imposed on iraq 1990 2003 after the gulf war limited the imports of staple crops alnasrawi 2001 which was partially compensated with increased national production but mostly resulted in reduced food supply food supply dropped by 32 between 1990 and 1991 and is still recovering two decades later fao 2015 kuwait has seen a large decline in its food supply as well dropping by 25 between 1989 and 1990 and reaching its minimum in 1991 with 1900 kcal day per capita fao 2015 opposite to iraq the food supply of kuwait recovered already in 1995 supplemental fig 2 therefore kuwait s food supply drop is not visible in the decadal averages appearing in fig 2 showing the country to follow the steep part of the regression curve at very low water availability cuba follows the trend of the global regression curve but had a dip in net import of staple crops in the 1990s the collapse of the soviet union resulted in deceasing cuban imports due to its economic dependence perkins 1993 cuban imports of maize and wheat dropped by 85 and 36 respectively between 1990 and 1991 fao 2015 food supply decreased from 1989 reached its lowest level in 1993 and started to recover in 1996 in the 2000s imports increased again the data for egypt show an anomaly for the 1990s as well as shown by yang et al 2003 as well the expansion in irrigated land of about 35 during that period increased the production of cereals resulting in a decreased import of cereals per capita while total import continued to increase yang et al 2003 the import dependency ratio of staple crops has decreased from 40 in average between the 1970s and 1980s to an average of 29 between the 1980s and 1990s fao 2015 yang et al 2003 expected that the proportion of the imported cereals in the per capita consumption will again increase in the future as the country s water use is reaching its limit this is confirmed in fig 2 which shows that one decade later the net import of staple crops regained its increasing trend while the import dependency ratio of all staple crops has increased to 31 in average between the 1990s and 2000s in the same way lebanon s import dependency ratio has dropped by 4 due to an increased production of barley potatoes and wheat between the 1990s and 2000s which explains the decrease in the net staple crops import for the last decade for the case of kenya a country that was net exporter of staple crops until 1977 the import dependency ratio has jumped from 3 during the 1960s to over 27 in the period 2001 2010 to keep pace with the growing domestic demand of staple crops this is also partially explained by kenya s policy to promote the production of cash crops gow and parton 1995 such as coffee and tea while staple crop production has in average dropped by 25 between the 1960s and 1990s coffee and tea production have grown by almost 1 5 and 5 times respectively in the same period fao 2015 india pakistan and sri lanka are the only three countries that do not follow the main trend line both india and pakistan have even become a net exporter of staple crops despite their increasing water scarcity in india changes in trade mainly concern increases in rice and wheat exports the green revolution has boosted the productivity in agriculture average wheat yield increased from 0 8 tonne ha in the 1960s to about 3 tonne ha in the 1990s and average rice yield doubled fao 2015 india thus succeeded to become food self sufficient but at the expense of a rapid increase in the appropriation of water resources leading to severe water depletion in many places mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the intensive use of irrigation from groundwater and surface water has caused groundwater degradation in many districts of haryana and punjab the largest contributing states to rice and wheat production in india singh 2000 the irrigated area had been continuously increasing to maintain the food self sufficiency policy similarly pakistan was one of the first beneficiaries of the green revolution in the 1960s with intensification through the introduction of high yielding varieties in wheat and rice and the application of irrigation and fertilisers ali and byerlee 2002 this has led to negative environmental impacts such as salinization overexploitation of groundwater physical and chemical deterioration of the soil and pest problems gupta and seth 2007 sri lanka a country with decreasing imports during the five decade period is an example of a country with an agricultural policy aiming for food self sufficiency in all crops and especially in the production of rice the country s main staple crop due to a combination of high yielding varieties paddy expansion and increased use of irrigation and fertilizer rice production in sri lanka has risen to meet almost 100 of its domestic demand davis et al 2016 the production of rice has increased by a factor of almost five between 1961 and 2010 while the average yearly yield has increased from 1 9 tonne ha to over 4 tonne ha during the same period fao 2015 3 2 projected blue water availability and net import of staple crops 2050 in 2050 when assuming un s medium population growth scenario the net import of staple crops in kcal day per capita is projected to increase for almost all selected countries except for cuba where net import of staple crops is projected to drop slightly by 2 india and pakistan the only net exporting counties of staple crops in the list in the period 2001 2010 will become net importers of staple crops by 2050 table 1 water availability per capita will decrease in all countries fig 3 between the baseline 2001 2010 and the year 2050 the total net import of staple crops for the selected countries in kcal day is projected to increase by a factor 2 5 for the medium population growth scenario or a factor 2 2 for the low or a factor 2 8 for the high population growth scenario supplemental table 2 in the period 2001 2010 the gross import of staple crops in the selected countries in kcal year corresponded to 34 of the world total gross export fao 2015 from this we compute that towards 2050 the overall global trade in staple crops should increase by a factor of 1 4 1 6 or 1 8 according to the low medium and high population growth scenario respectively in order to meet the increased staple food needs of these most water scarce countries supplemental table 3 the largest expected relative increases in the net import of staple crops by a factor of around 30 in the medium population growth scenario are found for chad malawi and uganda that were nearly self sufficient in the 2000s but grow fast and are becoming water scarcer rather quickly the projected net imports of staple crops in 2050 as shown in table 1 and fig 3 are subject to both uncertainty in population growth and uncertainty in the shape of the regression curve uncertainty in population growth directly translates in uncertainty in future water availability per capita indirectly this results in uncertainty on staple food import per capita because food imports depend on water availability per capita following the regression curve the uncertainties in the projected net import of staple crops per country related to population growth range between 57 and 99 kcal day per capita while the uncertainties coming from the curve shape range from 1 until 805 kcal day per capita table 1 the total uncertainty related to the regression analysis at 95 level of confidence ranges from 219 to 275 kcal day per capita supplemental table 4 the horizontal extent of each quadrilateral in fig 3 reflects the uncertainty in population growth the vertical extent follows from the upper and lower estimates for the regression curve shape parameters the shape of the quadrilateral is country dependent for countries with blue water availability exceeding 1500 m3 y per capita in 2050 the quadrilateral is wider horizontally this means that for those countries the uncertainty in population growth mainly translates in moving horizontally in the graph and less vertically because the regression curve has a low slope in this range and uncertainties in the slope are moderate for countries with less than 1500 m3 y of blue water availability per capita the quadrilateral gets stretched more vertically this means that the uncertainties in the curve shape become greater than the uncertainties related to population growth for some countries china cuba el salvador jamaica mauritius south korea sri lanka and trinidad and tobago the data point for 2001 2010 is within the surface of the quadrilateral for 2050 this is due to the fact that following the low population scenario there will be a decrease in the inhabitants of these countries by 2050 4 discussion one of the limitations of the study is the focus on blue water availability and exclusion of green water resources blue and green water scarcity are naturally related though so that it is unlikely that countries with low blue water availability per capita are rich in green water resources to produce food indeed in the selected countries staple crops are mainly irrigated which indicates that rain fed green water based agriculture alone is insufficient nevertheless given the relevance of scarcity of green water schyns et al 2015 we recommend future study to further evaluate the potential effect of increasing green water scarcity or overall green blue water scarcity on international food trade another limitation is that total blue water availability per country has been taken as a 30 years average for the period 1961 1990 not accounting for climatic changes where they may have occurred however when expressed per capita the effect of population growth on water availability per capita will be by far dominant in all countries while precipitation has a high interannual variability the linear trend for the global average precipitation from the global historical climatology network during 1901 2005 is statistically insignificant bates et al 2008 given the strong population growth in all countries considered both in the past and the future trends in national water availability per capita will anyhow be dominated by changes in population however including climatic changes particularly for the future can possibly refine our results we found that although a person normally needs 2000 2500 kcal day there are countries that are importing over that need from only staple crops already in the period 2001 2010 such as djibouti kuwait mauritius and south korea algeria lebanon and tunisia will join these countries by 2050 we may question the validity of our projection method in this range because once all staple food needs are imported the precise amounts will probably rather depend on other factors like dietary preferences and food waste although the regression curve representing the historical relation between net national staple crop import and national water availability per capita that was used to project net national staple crop imports in 2050 gets very steep when water availability per capita gets very low the steepness in the curve is represented by a high number of data points two countries are projected for 2050 to fall outside the bounds of the data used to fit the regression namely kuwait and yemen the results for these two countries should thus be taken with extra caution the projected net import of staple crops for these two countries together represents less than 3 of the total net import of staple crops of the selected countries so it does not affect the overall results of the study although war and other socio political factors have impacted trade of some countries in specific periods e g the economic sanctions for iraq in the 1990s there will be no change in the study results if we exclude those countries from the analysis this has been checked by carrying out the regression analysis without afghanistan iraq and chad for the relatively recent period 2000 2010 this did not cause significant changes affecting the main conclusions of the paper the list of the 42 most water scarce countries includes some countries that are major exporter of one or more specific types of staple crops in 2010 china for instance was an important exporter of millet potatoes rice sorghum sweet potatoes and yams egypt exports potatoes rice and sweet potatoes ghana and jamaica export yams india exports maize millet rice and sorghum iran exports potatoes kenya sorghum and mauritius cassava for rice exports from the selected water scarce countries were responsible for 24 of global export in 2010 india the largest rice exporter already faces major environmental issues related to the overuse of water resources particularly groundwater depletion gupta and seth 2007 which threatens the sustainability of its future production and limits its exporting ability based on an analysis of 42 water scarce countries over five decades of change we found a significant logarithmic shaped relation between net staple food import in kcal day per capita and blue water availability per capita most of the selected countries follow the regression curve shape with an exception for a few anomalously behaving countries such as india pakistan and sri lanka the curve found here has a similar shape as the relation found earlier by yang et al 2003 although they considered different countries less staple crops and a shorter period of change and looked at kg of import rather than kcal 5 conclusions using the regression curve and un population growth scenarios we project that compared to the average in the baseline period 2001 2010 the total net import of staple crops for the selected countries in kcal y will increase towards 2050 by a factor of 2 2 2 5 or 2 8 for the low medium and high population growth scenario respectively this means that global trade in staple foods should increase by a factor of 1 4 1 8 in order to meet the staple food needs of the 42 most water scarce countries in the world this finding is of broader interest than for the water scarce countries only it indirectly influences all other countries involved in staple crop trade amongst others this raises the question of where additional amounts of staple crops in the future could be sourced from and what additional water and other environmental impacts that may have in these other countries contributors the three authors designed the research analysed the data and wrote the paper h c carried out the calculations

availability that results from global warming reduce the potential of sufficient food production in many countries godfray et al 2010 given that already today most water scarce countries rely on food imports the question is how much the water scarcity driven global demand for food imports may grow according to the medium projection of the united nations the world population will reach 9 7 billion by 2050 and exceed 11 billion by 2100 united nations 2015 africa and asia will have the highest population growth between 2015 and 2050 with projected population increases of 52 and 17 respectively united nations 2015 these two continents already have the highest undernourishment prevalence levels viz 20 and 12 of their total population respectively fao et al 2015 population growth and climate change are major variables affecting future water demand and scarcity vörösmarty et al 2000 and thus food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 while the green revolution helped in the past to feed a growing global population there is a growing concern about the future gilland 2002 climate change is expected to aggravate the situation and threatening food security by altering spatial and temporal rainfall patterns reducing crop yields in various vulnerable regions parry et al 2004 and lowering food security particularly in sub saharan africa and south asia schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 however it has been widely acknowledged that when it comes to water scarcity population growth is a bigger driver than climate change arnell 2004 gerten et al 2011 schewe et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 food insecurity in water scarce countries can partially be mitigated through improving water productivity in crop production kate et al 2013 through better irrigation and agricultural management practices chukalla et al 2015 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 tilman et al 2011 food import may be another solution to fill the gap between demand and supply from domestic food production in many countries and especially in water scarce countries such imports go along with virtual water import allan 1998 externalising water consumption virtual water trade could be a solution to cope with physical water scarcity if water scare countries import their water intensive food needs from water abundant countries aldaya et al 2010 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 hoekstra and hung 2005 during the past decade a growing number of virtual water trade studies has become available antonelli and sartori 2015 hoekstra 2017 some focussed on quantification and others on analysing policy implications but surprisingly little effort has been made to correlate virtual water import to water scarcity most notably for countries in asia and africa yang et al 2003 investigated the relationship between cereal import and per capita water resources availability for a period of ten years a water scarcity threshold of about 1500 m3 y per capita was identified below which cereal import of a country increases exponentially with the decline of per capita water availability above it no direct relationship was found between cereal import and water endowment a weakness of this study was that staple crops other than cereals like starchy roots and tubers e g cassava potatoes sweet potatoes and yam were not included while many developing countries depend on these other staple crops besides it is more meaningful to consider staple food import in terms of kcal per capita than in terms of kg per capita no follow up has been given after this valuable initial study from yang et al 2003 while good insight into water scarcity driven demand for food import could be useful to project future needs of the many countries that face water scarcity already today this paper aims to study the relation between import of staple foods including cereals roots and tubers and water scarcity with a long term and global perspective the net import of staple crops in kcal y per capita is analysed in relation to water availability per capita for the period 1961 2010 considering five decadal averages the relation found is used together with the low medium and high population growth scenarios from the un united nations 2015 to project future staple crops import in water scarce countries for the year 2050 additionally we investigate the uncertainties related to the three population scenarios and related to the regression analysis 2 material and methods countries have been selected based on three criteria the selection contains countries with a maximum average blue water availability of 5000 m3 y per capita in the period 2001 2010 excluded are countries for which more than 50 of total domestic supply of staple crops is for feed seed processing or other uses and not for food supply excluded are also countries with a population smaller than 500 000 inhabitants in the year 2010 this resulted in a selection of 42 countries in total 13 staple crops were selected barley cassava maize millet and products oats potatoes rice rye sorghum soybeans sweet potatoes wheat and yams the selection is based on the main produced consumed and traded crops globally the selected crops account to 45 of total crop quantity produced 50 of total food supply in kcal day per capita 44 of total crop import and 43 of the total crop export quantities in 2010 fao 2015 gross imports and exports of staple crops in tonne y per country for the period of study 1961 2010 were taken from the faostat database fao 2015 net imports of staple crops in kg were converted into kcal using conversion rates supplemental table 1 per country average net import of staple crops per decade was calculated for each of the five decades in the study period and net import per capita was calculated using decadal average population data from the un united nations 2015 the total blue water availability per capita per country was derived from the faostat database fao 2015 water availability is taken as the total renewable water resources trwr which is the sum of internal and external renewable water resources of a country fao 2003 we added per country the yearly produced desalinated water although desalinated water is mostly used in other sectors than agriculture it helps in reducing the overall pressure on freshwater resources in this way countries that use desalinated water may dedicate a larger share of their fresh water to agriculture the trwr values representing 30 year averages 1961 1990 are assumed to be constant per country over the period of study and divided by decadal averages of population to obtain average water availability per capita per decade regression modelling is used to analyse the relation between the blue water availability per capita y and the net import of staple crops per capita x statistical model testing proved a logarithmic relation to yield the best fit amongst standard functional options for the relation the model was extended to the equation y a log x b i 2 42 c i d i including country specific biases c i implemented by including country specific dummy variables d i statistically country specific biases were significant for most countries and the model extension improved the fitness of the model higher r2 the medium population growth scenario of the un united nations 2015 is used to obtain projections for the decrease in blue water availability per capita per country for the year 2050 the projected net import of staple crops per capita per country in 2050 y based on the blue water availability per capita per country for the year 2050 x is estimated using the equation y a log x b i 2 42 c i d i e i whereby the values for a b and c are taken according to the best fitting curve for the last decade 2001 2010 and ei is the difference between the curve and the value in the last decade for each country the impact of two types of projection uncertainties are estimated the uncertainty in population growth is studied by considering un s low and high population growth scenarios united nations 2015 the uncertainty in the shape of the regression curve is estimated by varying the regression slope coefficient within its 95 reliability interval 3 results 3 1 past blue water availability and net import of staple crops 1961 2010 changes in blue water availability and net import of staple crops from the period 1961 1970 to the period 2001 2010 for 42 selected countries show a clear general trend fig 1 there is a continuous increase in net import of staple crops per capita with decreasing water availability per capita the effect of decreasing water availability per capita on food import becomes more pronounced when water availability becomes less the best fitting regression curve through all data points when also including the data points for all five decades considered follows a logarithmic shape as shown in the supplementary information supplemental fig 1 india pakistan and sri lanka were the exceptions to the general pattern with decreasing net staple food imports while sri lanka remained a net importer of staple crops india and pakistan shifted to become net exporters some countries shifted from being net exporters of staple crops during the first decade to net importers in the last decade this is the case for chad malawi niger kenya south arica swaziland and zimbabwe where a growing domestic demand of staple crops due to population growth affected the countries capability to export and increased their import of staple crops while fig 1 shows changes in blue water availability and staple crops import per capita between the initial and last period exclusively hiding intermediate points in time fig 2 shows all data for the five decadal averages for a few selected countries this exemplifies that some countries shift gradually over time while other countries show a bit more erratic behaviour each country has its specific underlying story benin exhibits a progressive decrease in blue water availability and increase in the net import of staple crops consistent with the shape of the global regression curve for iraq there was a drop in net staple food import between the 1980s and 1990s the economic sanctions imposed on iraq 1990 2003 after the gulf war limited the imports of staple crops alnasrawi 2001 which was partially compensated with increased national production but mostly resulted in reduced food supply food supply dropped by 32 between 1990 and 1991 and is still recovering two decades later fao 2015 kuwait has seen a large decline in its food supply as well dropping by 25 between 1989 and 1990 and reaching its minimum in 1991 with 1900 kcal day per capita fao 2015 opposite to iraq the food supply of kuwait recovered already in 1995 supplemental fig 2 therefore kuwait s food supply drop is not visible in the decadal averages appearing in fig 2 showing the country to follow the steep part of the regression curve at very low water availability cuba follows the trend of the global regression curve but had a dip in net import of staple crops in the 1990s the collapse of the soviet union resulted in deceasing cuban imports due to its economic dependence perkins 1993 cuban imports of maize and wheat dropped by 85 and 36 respectively between 1990 and 1991 fao 2015 food supply decreased from 1989 reached its lowest level in 1993 and started to recover in 1996 in the 2000s imports increased again the data for egypt show an anomaly for the 1990s as well as shown by yang et al 2003 as well the expansion in irrigated land of about 35 during that period increased the production of cereals resulting in a decreased import of cereals per capita while total import continued to increase yang et al 2003 the import dependency ratio of staple crops has decreased from 40 in average between the 1970s and 1980s to an average of 29 between the 1980s and 1990s fao 2015 yang et al 2003 expected that the proportion of the imported cereals in the per capita consumption will again increase in the future as the country s water use is reaching its limit this is confirmed in fig 2 which shows that one decade later the net import of staple crops regained its increasing trend while the import dependency ratio of all staple crops has increased to 31 in average between the 1990s and 2000s in the same way lebanon s import dependency ratio has dropped by 4 due to an increased production of barley potatoes and wheat between the 1990s and 2000s which explains the decrease in the net staple crops import for the last decade for the case of kenya a country that was net exporter of staple crops until 1977 the import dependency ratio has jumped from 3 during the 1960s to over 27 in the period 2001 2010 to keep pace with the growing domestic demand of staple crops this is also partially explained by kenya s policy to promote the production of cash crops gow and parton 1995 such as coffee and tea while staple crop production has in average dropped by 25 between the 1960s and 1990s coffee and tea production have grown by almost 1 5 and 5 times respectively in the same period fao 2015 india pakistan and sri lanka are the only three countries that do not follow the main trend line both india and pakistan have even become a net exporter of staple crops despite their increasing water scarcity in india changes in trade mainly concern increases in rice and wheat exports the green revolution has boosted the productivity in agriculture average wheat yield increased from 0 8 tonne ha in the 1960s to about 3 tonne ha in the 1990s and average rice yield doubled fao 2015 india thus succeeded to become food self sufficient but at the expense of a rapid increase in the appropriation of water resources leading to severe water depletion in many places mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the intensive use of irrigation from groundwater and surface water has caused groundwater degradation in many districts of haryana and punjab the largest contributing states to rice and wheat production in india singh 2000 the irrigated area had been continuously increasing to maintain the food self sufficiency policy similarly pakistan was one of the first beneficiaries of the green revolution in the 1960s with intensification through the introduction of high yielding varieties in wheat and rice and the application of irrigation and fertilisers ali and byerlee 2002 this has led to negative environmental impacts such as salinization overexploitation of groundwater physical and chemical deterioration of the soil and pest problems gupta and seth 2007 sri lanka a country with decreasing imports during the five decade period is an example of a country with an agricultural policy aiming for food self sufficiency in all crops and especially in the production of rice the country s main staple crop due to a combination of high yielding varieties paddy expansion and increased use of irrigation and fertilizer rice production in sri lanka has risen to meet almost 100 of its domestic demand davis et al 2016 the production of rice has increased by a factor of almost five between 1961 and 2010 while the average yearly yield has increased from 1 9 tonne ha to over 4 tonne ha during the same period fao 2015 3 2 projected blue water availability and net import of staple crops 2050 in 2050 when assuming un s medium population growth scenario the net import of staple crops in kcal day per capita is projected to increase for almost all selected countries except for cuba where net import of staple crops is projected to drop slightly by 2 india and pakistan the only net exporting counties of staple crops in the list in the period 2001 2010 will become net importers of staple crops by 2050 table 1 water availability per capita will decrease in all countries fig 3 between the baseline 2001 2010 and the year 2050 the total net import of staple crops for the selected countries in kcal day is projected to increase by a factor 2 5 for the medium population growth scenario or a factor 2 2 for the low or a factor 2 8 for the high population growth scenario supplemental table 2 in the period 2001 2010 the gross import of staple crops in the selected countries in kcal year corresponded to 34 of the world total gross export fao 2015 from this we compute that towards 2050 the overall global trade in staple crops should increase by a factor of 1 4 1 6 or 1 8 according to the low medium and high population growth scenario respectively in order to meet the increased staple food needs of these most water scarce countries supplemental table 3 the largest expected relative increases in the net import of staple crops by a factor of around 30 in the medium population growth scenario are found for chad malawi and uganda that were nearly self sufficient in the 2000s but grow fast and are becoming water scarcer rather quickly the projected net imports of staple crops in 2050 as shown in table 1 and fig 3 are subject to both uncertainty in population growth and uncertainty in the shape of the regression curve uncertainty in population growth directly translates in uncertainty in future water availability per capita indirectly this results in uncertainty on staple food import per capita because food imports depend on water availability per capita following the regression curve the uncertainties in the projected net import of staple crops per country related to population growth range between 57 and 99 kcal day per capita while the uncertainties coming from the curve shape range from 1 until 805 kcal day per capita table 1 the total uncertainty related to the regression analysis at 95 level of confidence ranges from 219 to 275 kcal day per capita supplemental table 4 the horizontal extent of each quadrilateral in fig 3 reflects the uncertainty in population growth the vertical extent follows from the upper and lower estimates for the regression curve shape parameters the shape of the quadrilateral is country dependent for countries with blue water availability exceeding 1500 m3 y per capita in 2050 the quadrilateral is wider horizontally this means that for those countries the uncertainty in population growth mainly translates in moving horizontally in the graph and less vertically because the regression curve has a low slope in this range and uncertainties in the slope are moderate for countries with less than 1500 m3 y of blue water availability per capita the quadrilateral gets stretched more vertically this means that the uncertainties in the curve shape become greater than the uncertainties related to population growth for some countries china cuba el salvador jamaica mauritius south korea sri lanka and trinidad and tobago the data point for 2001 2010 is within the surface of the quadrilateral for 2050 this is due to the fact that following the low population scenario there will be a decrease in the inhabitants of these countries by 2050 4 discussion one of the limitations of the study is the focus on blue water availability and exclusion of green water resources blue and green water scarcity are naturally related though so that it is unlikely that countries with low blue water availability per capita are rich in green water resources to produce food indeed in the selected countries staple crops are mainly irrigated which indicates that rain fed green water based agriculture alone is insufficient nevertheless given the relevance of scarcity of green water schyns et al 2015 we recommend future study to further evaluate the potential effect of increasing green water scarcity or overall green blue water scarcity on international food trade another limitation is that total blue water availability per country has been taken as a 30 years average for the period 1961 1990 not accounting for climatic changes where they may have occurred however when expressed per capita the effect of population growth on water availability per capita will be by far dominant in all countries while precipitation has a high interannual variability the linear trend for the global average precipitation from the global historical climatology network during 1901 2005 is statistically insignificant bates et al 2008 given the strong population growth in all countries considered both in the past and the future trends in national water availability per capita will anyhow be dominated by changes in population however including climatic changes particularly for the future can possibly refine our results we found that although a person normally needs 2000 2500 kcal day there are countries that are importing over that need from only staple crops already in the period 2001 2010 such as djibouti kuwait mauritius and south korea algeria lebanon and tunisia will join these countries by 2050 we may question the validity of our projection method in this range because once all staple food needs are imported the precise amounts will probably rather depend on other factors like dietary preferences and food waste although the regression curve representing the historical relation between net national staple crop import and national water availability per capita that was used to project net national staple crop imports in 2050 gets very steep when water availability per capita gets very low the steepness in the curve is represented by a high number of data points two countries are projected for 2050 to fall outside the bounds of the data used to fit the regression namely kuwait and yemen the results for these two countries should thus be taken with extra caution the projected net import of staple crops for these two countries together represents less than 3 of the total net import of staple crops of the selected countries so it does not affect the overall results of the study although war and other socio political factors have impacted trade of some countries in specific periods e g the economic sanctions for iraq in the 1990s there will be no change in the study results if we exclude those countries from the analysis this has been checked by carrying out the regression analysis without afghanistan iraq and chad for the relatively recent period 2000 2010 this did not cause significant changes affecting the main conclusions of the paper the list of the 42 most water scarce countries includes some countries that are major exporter of one or more specific types of staple crops in 2010 china for instance was an important exporter of millet potatoes rice sorghum sweet potatoes and yams egypt exports potatoes rice and sweet potatoes ghana and jamaica export yams india exports maize millet rice and sorghum iran exports potatoes kenya sorghum and mauritius cassava for rice exports from the selected water scarce countries were responsible for 24 of global export in 2010 india the largest rice exporter already faces major environmental issues related to the overuse of water resources particularly groundwater depletion gupta and seth 2007 which threatens the sustainability of its future production and limits its exporting ability based on an analysis of 42 water scarce countries over five decades of change we found a significant logarithmic shaped relation between net staple food import in kcal day per capita and blue water availability per capita most of the selected countries follow the regression curve shape with an exception for a few anomalously behaving countries such as india pakistan and sri lanka the curve found here has a similar shape as the relation found earlier by yang et al 2003 although they considered different countries less staple crops and a shorter period of change and looked at kg of import rather than kcal 5 conclusions using the regression curve and un population growth scenarios we project that compared to the average in the baseline period 2001 2010 the total net import of staple crops for the selected countries in kcal y will increase towards 2050 by a factor of 2 2 2 5 or 2 8 for the low medium and high population growth scenario respectively this means that global trade in staple foods should increase by a factor of 1 4 1 8 in order to meet the staple food needs of the 42 most water scarce countries in the world this finding is of broader interest than for the water scarce countries only it indirectly influences all other countries involved in staple crop trade amongst others this raises the question of where additional amounts of staple crops in the future could be sourced from and what additional water and other environmental impacts that may have in these other countries contributors the three authors designed the research analysed the data and wrote the paper h c carried out the calculations
