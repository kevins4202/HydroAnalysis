24880,ecological citizen science data are rapidly growing in availability and use in ecology and conservation many citizen science projects have the flexibility for participants to select where they survey resulting in more participants but also spatially biased data it is important to assess the extent to which these spatially biased data can provide reliable estimates of species distributions here we quantify the extent of site selection bias in a citizen science project and the implications of this spatial bias in species distribution models using data from the birdtrack citizen science project in great britain from 2007 to 2011 we modelled the spatial bias of data submissions we next produced species occupancy models for 138 bird species and assessed the impact of accounting for spatial bias we compared the distributions to those produced using unbiased data from an atlas survey from the same region and time period averaging across 138 species models with spatially biased data produced accurate and precise estimates of species occupancy for most locations in great britain however these distributions were both less accurate and less precise in the scottish highlands showing on average a positive bias accounting for the spatially biased sampling with weights led to on average greater accuracy in the scottish highlands but did not increase precision this region is both distinct in environmental characteristics and has a low density of observations making it difficult to characterise environmental relationships with species occupancy accounting for the spatially biased sampling did not affect average accuracy or precision throughout most of the country spatially biased citizen science data can be used to estimate species occupancy in regions with stationary environmental relationships and good sampling across environmental space the reliability of estimated species distributions from spatially biased data should be further validated and tested under a range of different scenarios keywords birdtrack citizen science occupancy models preferential sampling spatial bias species distribution models 1 introduction datasets collected by citizen scientists are increasingly being used to answer a wide range of ecological questions partly due to their cost effectiveness relative to professional surveys powney and isaac 2015 silvertown 2009 ecological citizen science programmes range widely in geographic scope from a single island e g white et al 2015 to global e g newson et al 2016 sullivan et al 2009 in species scope from single species e g howard and davis 2009 to all species e g karns et al 2006 and from highly structured methods e g harris et al 2016 newson et al 2015 to completely unstructured data collection e g pocock et al 2015 unstructured surveys that allow participants substantial flexibility in location and style of survey will often attract a large number of participants with a wide range of skill and expertise kelling et al 2015 pocock et al 2017 however this flexibility results in participants choosing sites they enjoy visiting and this introduces spatial bias into the resulting data in these flexible and unstructured surveys citizen scientists select sites that they visit based on one or several criteria observers may record from particular sites because they are easily accessible either near to their home dennis and thomas 2000 luck 2007 or close to roads and paths botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 kadmon et al 2004 keller and scallan 1999 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 tiago et al 2017 alternatively they may select sites for ecological reasons selecting protected areas boakes et al 2010 botts et al 2011 freitag et al 1998 reddy and dávalos 2003 tulloch et al 2013 sites with a high species diversity dennis and thomas 2000 hijmans et al 2000 prendergast et al 1993 tulloch et al 2013 or sites with expected presence of a particularly interesting species boakes et al 2010 booth et al 2011 greenwood 2007 tulloch et al 2013 tulloch and szabo 2012 in reality each citizen scientist will likely consider several of these factors and the importance of each factor will vary among participants booth et al 2011 tulloch and szabo 2012 however we expect there will be common patterns among individuals in factors determining site selection aggregating across all participants these site selection preferences can lead to strong spatial biases in recording locations bird et al 2014 dickinson et al 2010 mair and reute 2016 furthermore such spatial bias is likely to be particularly strong when survey guidelines are flexible and therefore the participants comprise a large number of people with a broad range of skills and motivations geldmann et al 2016 in analyses of citizen science data it is important to consider the impact of spatial bias which can lead to biased estimates of species distributions boakes et al 2010 conn et al 2013 yang et al 2013 site selection bias can be put into two broad categories 1 biases that are independent of the response variable and 2 biases that are correlated with the species response diggle et al 2010 biases in category 1 will lead to inferred environmental relationships between species and habitat that are dominated by regions with more surveys however these category 1 biases can often be separated from the response given the independence between the response and the bias biases in category 2 can cause problems because the inferred environmental relationships are confounded with the spatial bias in site selection for example many observers may choose to survey wetland habitat that is highly correlated with the presence of wetland species this spatial bias is more challenging to deal with because it is harder to separate the bias and the response in citizen science surveys with a larger scope than a single species observers are likely to target a variety of sites with high species richness dennis and thomas 2000 prendergast et al 1993 which may be correlated with but not directly related to the occurrence of any individual species when estimating species distributions from presence only data it is important that the spatial bias of presence only data match the spatial bias among the selected pseudo absence data for this reason models for presence only data have a longer history of addressing spatial bias because it is critical to account for the difference between species absence and lack of sampling effort beck et al 2014 fithian et al 2015 mair and reute 2016 phillips et al 2009 a common method to account for spatial bias is to generate pseudo absences with the same spatial bias as the presence data e g higa et al 2014 phillips and dudík 2008 where it is possible to statistically characterise the mechanisms of spatial bias this process will generate a dataset of presences and pseudo absences that are all from the same spatial process when dealing with detection non detection data or presence absence data the non detections are already generated with the same process of spatial bias as the detections therefore the dataset is already at the point that many correction methods target for presence only data however even with this situation there is potential for further impacts of spatial bias for example relationships between species occurrence and environment can vary across space zuckerberg et al 2016 when the detection non detection data are spatially biased then the inferred relationships will be dominated by the locations or habitats that contribute the most data in this paper we examine the effects of such spatial bias where the non detections are already generated with the same process as the detections two main analytical approaches have been used to account for spatial bias in detection non detection data first spatial filtering can reduce the spatial bias by selecting a subset of data that has a more even spatial distribution araújo and guisan 2006 spatial filtering improves the spatial evenness of the data but at the cost of reducing the sample size spatial filtering is effective at reducing a predominance of data from certain regions by reducing the larger scale spatial bias however it will usually not reduce smaller scale bias caused by people selecting certain habitats spatial filtering often has only a small effect on ecological conclusions beck et al 2014 geldmann et al 2016 kadmon et al 2004 a second option is to estimate the probabilities of site selection based on environmental covariates and then use these probabilities to adjust or balance the empirical distribution of the covariates in practice these probabilities are either incorporated as model weights rosenbaum and rubin 1983 or used to produce a post hoc stratification to correct the analysis van turnhout et al 2008 when the site selection process can be assumed to be independent of the species response category 2 biases theoretical results show that using weights can eliminate bias heckmann 1979 the use of weighting methods to address this problem has been studied in a number of disciplines including in statistics where the weights are known as propensity scores guo and fraser 2014 and in machine learning where the problem is known as covariate shift sugiyama and kawanabe 2012 a third emerging option for spatially biased data is to jointly model the site selection process and the ecological response which is an extension of the second option conn et al 2016 diggle et al 2010 pati et al 2011 here we characterise spatial bias in site selection in birdtrack a flexible citizen science scheme and quantify the impact on species distributions of accounting for this bias we model the process of site selection bias and produce a statistical description of the spatial bias preliminary analyses revealed there were many covariates associated with the spatial bias and that the relationships could not be adequately described by a simple model this precluded option three the joint distribution and observation model therefore we modelled spatial bias using a flexible machine learning approach and used the predictions to weight subsequent species distribution models option two above we quantified the differences in predictive performance of estimated species distributions when we accounted for the spatial bias in site selection we validated the models against high quality data with minimal spatial bias and identified situations where inference with spatially biased data is less reliable 2 methods our methods comprise four analytical stages in stage 1 we describe the birdtrack data used for the analysis in stage 2 we classify locations 1 km squares into two categories based on how popular they are to visit in stage 3 we model the probability of a birdtrack list in each location using a variety of environmental variables in stage 4 we use occupancy models to quantify the distributions of 138 species we run one standard model and one model using the results from stage 3 as weights further details of the variables and models are provided in appendix a we compare the results of the occupancy models to models produced using a standardised and unbiased dataset from the same time period 2 1 stage 1 data selection the main dataset for the analysis was birdtrack a citizen science project in which participants collect records of species they detected at given locations the data collection protocol is relaxed and many participants contribute to this project representing a wide range of motivations skill knowledge and behaviour in this study we used a subset of the full dataset which included records of bird species recorded in great britain between 2007 2011 we used only complete lists in which observers reported all the species they were able to detect and identify and we converted counts of birds to a detection non detection response variable we also applied a number of other data filters in order to produce a more standardised and consistent dataset see appendix a for details 2 2 stage 2 site classification we wanted to understand the environmental factors that determine the types of locations from which birdtrack users submit lists however we expected that there would be considerable heterogeneity in the reasons that birdtrack users decide to visit certain locations for example one location may be near to their home whilst another might have a good variety of habitats and another may often host rare birds these different types of sites are likely to be associated with different environmental features in this stage we wanted to identify different types of sites using a clustering algorithm the data showed strong evidence of clustering hopkin s statistic 0 07 hopkins 1954 and the silhouette method suggested there were two clusters kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 we therefore used a k means clustering algorithm haritgan and wong 1979 to split the locations into two clusters based on seven covariates describing the popularity of a site the covariates for each site 1 km square used in the clustering algorithm were number of lists number of observers average number of lists per observer median distance from the observer s home median number of species per list and two rarity scores which describe a the average rarity of species listed at those locations and b the propensity for the locations to host particularly rare species all analyses were conducted in r r core team 2016 using package factoextra kassambara and mundt 2016 2 3 stage 3 models of site selection we aimed to predict the locations at which birdtrack users create lists we achieved this by characterising the environments that are typical for sites with lists the multinomial response variable was whether a site was cluster 1 cluster 2 or had no lists we associated this response with a number of environmental variables these variables were mostly summarised within 3 km 3 km squares and were standardised before modelling the covariates described characteristics of landcover 25 variables geography easting northing elevation housing density postcode density at five spatial scales roads total road length distance to nearest road and nature reserves combinations of bird reserves nature reserves and designated sites preliminary analyses revealed that parametric models did not sufficiently characterise the relationship between the environment and the response therefore we used a generalized boosted regression tree gbrt for this model because it enables a wide variety of non parametric relationships a large number of interactions between variables and can accommodate a large number of potentially correlated variables the regression tree identifies non parametric relationships between the predictors and the probability of the categorical responses these relationships can be more difficult to interpret than standard parametric models but here we were more concerned with good descriptions of the patterns than an understanding of the environmental relationships we wanted to validate the models with independent data that were not included in the model training we therefore removed approximately 25 of the locations in the uk to ensure a more rigorous test of the environmental relationships fourcade et al 2018 we divided great britain into 100 km 100 km squares and systematically selected one in every 4 squares fig s1 data within these 25 of squares were removed prior to modelling and were used to validate the resulting model by removing large squares we ensure that validation cannot be driven by small scale spatial autocorrelation hochachka et al 2010 we used the model built using 75 of the squares to predict the locations of lists in the 25 of squares we used area under the curve auc and the true skill statistic tss to compare these predictions to the observed locations of lists in the 25 validation set the multinomial gbrt models were fitted in the r package gbm ridgeway 2013 we used the gbrt model to estimate the probability of at least one birdtrack list from each 1 km square in great britain see appendix a for further details of the model covariates and parameters 2 4 stage 4 species distribution models 2 4 1 birdtrack species distributions to estimate the occurrence of each species within a 1 km square we used occupancy models mackenzie et al 2002 we wanted to compare the models using birdtrack data to models using data from the bird atlas 2007 11 balmer et al 2013 hereafter the atlas so we selected birdtrack observations that fell within the atlas breeding season monitoring period april july 2008 2011 occupancy modelling relies on multiple visits to the same location as repeat visits we used visits by the same observer to the same location 1 km square we selected any observer location combination that had at least one visit in the breeding season sites with only one visit do not contribute to the estimate of detectability but they do contribute to the estimate of occupancy the resultant birdtrack dataset april july 2008 2011 had 31 911 lists from 13 279 unique location observer combinations across 10 023 distinct locations each birdtrack list was located within a 1 km 1 km square and as covariates of occupancy we summarised information from the 3 km 3 km surrounding square the rationale for this was firstly that observations could be from outside the boundaries of the 1 km square and secondly that birds move around the landscape into nearby environments using environmental data from the 3 km square will therefore increase the accuracy of the environmental information relative to the bird observations but reduces the precision the environmental covariates used were geographic location easting and northing island group mean elevation jarvis et al 2008 the area of 27 different landcover types morton et al 2011 total seasonal rainfall met office 2016 and seasonal mean temperature met office 2016 the equation defining the occupancy ψ was l o g i t ψ ˆ k α 0 g 1 4 α g i s l a n d g k α 5 e l e v a t i

estimated coefficients islandgk is a binary variable with 1 if location k is within island group g scilly orkney shetland outer hebrides and 0 otherwise elevationk is the mean elevation within location k eastingk and northingk are the central geographic coordinates of location k on the uk os grid system areahk is the area of landcover h in location k rainfallsk is the total rainfall in season s at location k and tempsk is the mean temperature in season s at location k as covariates of detectability we used duration of the observation period for the list a quadratic function of day and a quadratic function of time the equation defining the detectability p was l o g i t p ˆ i λ 0 λ 1 d u r a t i o n i λ 2 d a y i λ 3 d a y i 2 λ 4 t i m e i λ 5 t i m e i 2 where pi is the detectability of list i λ are estimated coefficients durationi is the duration of the list in hours dayi is the day of the year that the list was conducted and timei is the start time of the list in decimal hours to conform with standard analyses of unstructured citizen science data we did not account for variation in participant expertise in the detectability model an assumption of occupancy modelling is that the occurrence of a species presence absence at a site does not change during the period of sampling however during april july we expect that the presence of many species will change due to mortality productivity and migratory movements although this violates the assumption of closure of a standard occupancy model this assumption can be relaxed as long as the estimated parameters are interpreted correctly mackenzie and royle 2005 and where appropriate covariates that describe the patterns of variation are added to the model kéry et al 2010 we allow for temporal changes in occupancy by the quadratic relationship with day in the detectability part of the model therefore any seasonal changes in occupancy will be assigned to seasonal variation in detectability we therefore interpret the estimated occupancy as the occupancy from the part of the breeding season with highest occupancy combining data across four years also involves the assumption that occurrence did not change among years we therefore interpret estimated occupancy as the species occupancy in the year with highest occupancy and this estimate will be robust if sampling sites were selected randomly in each year if a species had a rapid change in occupancy and sampling was temporally and spatially non random for example all northern sites in year 1 then combining across years could produce a biased estimate of the distribution therefore an assumption of our models is that no species were affected by rapid change in distribution and strongly biased spatio temporal sampling we used the information on probability of sampling to account for the spatially biased data within the occupancy model for the standard models we used a maximum likelihood occupancy model from r package unmarked fiske and chandler 2011 for each species we ran a second occupancy model where we included a likelihood weighting based on the probability of sampling estimated at any location that was calculated as described in stage 3 of this paper we adapted the code in package unmarked to include a weighting that multiplied each data point visit by a given weight in the likelihood based on sampling probability weightings were the reciprocals of the estimated probabilities of locations having a list in order to account for differences in sampling intensities in different environments each weighting was therefore specific to a given spatial location k and did not vary with visit using this procedure each list from a sparsely surveyed environment contributes more to the likelihood than a list from densely surveyed environments two models were produced for each species an unweighted model and a weighted model we expect the unweighted model to be biased towards the environments with more birdtrack lists predictions of occupancy were made for each 1 km square in great britain with covariate data these estimated occupancy rates b ˆ l s for 1 km 1 km square l and species s were accumulated across each 10 km 10 km square for each 10 km 10 km square l and species s we calculated the average estimated occupancy b ˆ l s i e the mean of the estimated occupancy of species s in each constituent 1 km square b ˆ l s 1 100 1 100 b ˆ l l s 2 4 2 atlas species distribution models to validate the distribution models from birdtrack data we constructed similar distribution models from atlas data the atlas used experienced citizen scientists standardised survey methods and crucially had even coverage across the whole country reducing the impact of spatial bias and site selection we used data for the breeding season and across great britain which included 58 285 1 h visits to 18 736 2 km 2 km squares tetrads this atlas dataset contained data from considerably more locations than the birdtrack dataset and had even coverage across 10 km 10 km squares fig 2 we followed a very similar approach for modelling the atlas data to that taken with the birdtrack data to ensure comparable methodology as above the model results were aggregated to the metric of average occupancy within each 10 km 10 km square l for each species s al s see appendix a for further model details 2 4 3 comparing distributions from birdtrack and atlas data in order to assess the quality of the distributions produced from birdtrack we made the assumption that the occupancy models produced from atlas data are the closest estimate we can achieve to true occupancy distributions using this analytical approach and with these species the standardised and spatially intensive sampling for the atlas represents one of the highest quality ecological datasets available across a region there were some species for which atlas occupancy models did not produce reliable results and we removed these from the suite of species for comparison keeping those with auc 0 80 which was 138 of the 159 species modelled for each of these 138 species we calculated the difference in mean estimated occupancy in each 10 km 10 km square from the two birdtrack occupancy models unweighted and weighted and the atlas occupancy model d l s b ˆ l s a ˆ l s where dl s is the difference between the estimated occupancy from the birdtrack and atlas distribution models for location l 10 km 10 km square and species s we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the differences between birdtrack and atlas distributions across all species for each 10 km 10 km square dl these results will tell us on average across all species whether birdtrack data lead to biased estimates in particular locations for each species we also calculated the average deviation between birdtrack and atlas distributions across all 10 km squares ds to assess how absolute sample size was a factor in the estimated atlas and birdtrack distributions we compared the birdtrack sample size for each species with the average deviation for each species mean ds we also compared the birdtrack sample size for each 10 km square with the average deviation for each 10 km square averaged across species mean dl these results will tell us on average across all locations whether volume of birdtrack data affect the degree of bias in estimates for particular species 3 results 3 1 stage 1 data selection after filtering the year round birdtrack dataset was comprised of 170 723 lists and over 3 7 million observations of bird species in great britain during 2007 2011 table s1 3 2 stage 2 site categorisation we categorised sites with lists into two clusters cluster 1 sites comprised 19 of all the sites with lists and they were characterised by higher site rarity scores and higher median distance from home postcodes of observers figs s5 s7 this suggests that cluster 1 sites have a more interesting bird assemblage and that observers will travel further to visit these locations there were many cluster 1 sites on the coast and in less populated areas fig s9 conversely this suggests that cluster 2 sites are visited for convenience of travel and generally have a less interesting bird assemblage 3 3 stage 3 models of site selection we associated environmental covariates with the probability that locations were in cluster 1 cluster 2 and or had no lists there were seven variables that had high relative influence in determining whether a site was cluster 1 cluster 2 or had no lists three landcover variables suburban land improved grassland and landcover diversity two house density variables 5 km and 25 km radii density of roads and altitude all of the reserve variables and most of the landcover variables had a low relative influence on probability of a birdtrack list the model performed moderately well against the validation data from the removed 100 km 100 km squares with the validation data auc 0 78 and tss 0 39 with the modelled data auc 0 82 and tss 0 48 the similarity between model performance in the modelled data and validation data suggests that spatial autocorrelation did not have a large effect on the model using the model from stage 3 we predicted the probability that each location 1 km squre would be either a cluster 1 or a cluster 2 site this is the equivalent to calculating the probability that the site has a list all 1 km squares had a probability of a list between 0 and 0 5 with most sites having a low probability fig 1 3 4 stage 4 species distribution models we present an example of one species distribution marsh harrier circus aeruginosus fig 2 this species has a relatively restricted breeding distribution within great britain the unweighted model shows a large predicted population in the scottish highlands where there are few birdtrack lists and the modelled environmental relationships have extrapolated to a population in the highlands the distribution from the weighted model does not have a predicted population in the highlands and closely matches the distribution from atlas data this positive effect of weighting by the probability of lists is evident in a number of other species however there were species for which the weighting had no effect or a negative effect producing a predicted distribution that was a worse match to the distribution from atlas data in appendix b we present eight species that demonstrate a range of responses to the weighting and a range of agreement between the distributions estimated from birdtrack and atlas data averaging across all 138 species birdtrack distributions had positively biased occupancy estimates in the scottish highlands fig 3 the birdtrack distributions also had negatively biased occupancy estimates in coastal locations the models that were weighted by birdtrack sampling probability had less positive bias in the scottish highlands but slightly greater negative bias around the coastal squares fig 3 the standard deviation of differences between species was highest in the scottish highlands and this remained the case when using the weighted birdtrack models fig 3 overall weighting by the probability of sampling increased the accuracy of the estimated occupancies across species 3b is less pink than 3a but did not improve precision 3d has similar dark grey area to 3c the average difference between estimated occupancy from birdtrack and atlas distributions was higher in squares with few birdtrack observations and was reduced in the weighted models which was evident in the scottish highlands fig 4 at sites with a very high number of birdtrack observations there was a propensity for the birdtrack occupancy to be negatively biased which was evident in coastal sites although the median difference was still zero fig 4 across species the average difference at a given location was relatively small however within species average differences were higher suggesting some species had positive biased occupancy estimates in many locations whilst other species had negatively biased occupancy estimates in many locations from the total of 138 species 87 had an average difference less than 0 05 and 124 species less than 0 10 these numbers rose only slightly to 91 and 126 with the weighted models for 65 species the weighted models were closer to the atlas distributions and for 73 species the unweighted models were closer to the atlas distributions the median difference between the closeness of weighted and unweighted models to the atlas distributions was 0 00 demonstrating roughly equal number of species had improvements and deteriorations by adding the model weights the median absolute difference was 0 01 demonstrating that changes were in general very small with the addition of the weights there was no clear pattern in species positive observations in relation to bias of estimates fig 4 therefore at this scale and with these data and species the accuracy of birdtrack models was not directly related to number of positive observations 4 discussion we have demonstrated an analytical approach to model spatial bias in citizen science data and to account for this spatial bias in species distribution models on average weighting by sampling density improved the accuracy but not the precision of estimated species occurrence however there were species specific differences for some species the weighting improved the estimated occupancy and for others it made the estimates worse the variation across species was not closely predicted by the species rarity in surveys given the strong spatial biases evident in birdtrack site selection it is notable that there is not a larger effect on estimated species distributions we suggest three reasons for this firstly spatial bias would mainly lead to problems if there was non stationarity in environmental relationships we expect that on the scale of great britain there is consistency in environmental relationships secondly although there is strong spatial bias the birdtrack dataset is relatively large and even in poorly surveyed areas there is a reasonable sample size thirdly there is relatively good coverage of environmental space which reduces the impact of spatial bias higa et al 2014 kadmon et al 2004 the scottish highlands are an exception to both the second and third reasons here they have low sampling intensity and there are several environmental variables that have extreme values in this region leading to relatively novel environmental space with respect to the rest of great britain fig s11 we expect that the poor coverage of these novel environmental spaces has reduced the accuracy and precision of estimated species distributions in this area locally weighted regression or spatially localised models will naturally adapt to large scale bias and non stationarity fink et al 2010 fotheringham et al 2003 however these modelling structures will also tend towards poor estimation when situations two and three occur small sample size and poor coverage of environmental space and they will still be susceptible to small scale spatial bias in site selection several previous studies also found that accounting for spatial bias did not have a large effect on estimated distributions beck et al 2014 higa et al 2014 kadmon et al 2004 although there was not a large effect of spatial bias in this study we argue that spatial bias is an important consideration in many analyses of citizen science data particularly those at large spatial scales and where there are substantial differences in sampling intensity between habitats for example it may be more critical when overall sampling density is lower el gabbas and dormann 2017 we expect that the effect of spatial bias on estimated trends could be substantial isaac et al 2014 kamp et al 2016 zbinden et al 2014 due to strong spatial patterns in population trends massimino et al 2015 spatial differences in population trend are likely to be much larger than spatial differences in environmental relationships and are likely to vary within smaller geographic scales the greatest benefit of weighting data by sampling density appeared in predictions for regions with the lowest densities of data for 90 of species the distributions from birdtrack data were close to the atlas distributions with an average difference in estimated occupancy of less than 0 10 however although there was agreement on this broad scale averaging across the country for each species there were notable spatial patterns in the biases averaging across species for different areas of the country the scottish highlands had higher bias and lower precision than the rest of the country the weightings reduced the bias pati et al 2011 but did not affect the precision this suggests that estimates of occupancy from the scottish highlands are not accurate within species which is also evident from some individual species maps appendix b estimates of species distributions from birdtrack data had a negative bias around many coastal sites this may be because different observers visit different locations birdwatchers vary in their expertise kelling et al 2015 and those with different expertise may visit different types of sites which can lead to bias in estimated species distributions johnston et al 2018 coastal sites often have high species diversity and attract rare species which makes them attractive to birdwatchers boakes et al 2010 booth et al 2011 tulloch et al 2013 these sites would be expected to attract less experienced birdwatchers at a higher rate than other sites giving the participant pool at these sites a lower average experience if less experienced birdwatchers are not as skilled at detecting and identifying birds the lower average experience would give these sites a negative estimated occupancy using birdtrack data overall greater attention should be given to discriminating the quality of species distributions between regions sites visited by citizen scientists could be categorised into two groups one cluster of sites had more unusual bird species reported and observers travelled further to visit these sites this suggests that observers will incur a greater cost i e travel time and costs to visit a site with a more interesting bird assemblage kolstoe and cameron 2017 these results concur with previous studies that demonstrate observers show a bias towards rare threatened or attractive species boakes et al 2010 dennis et al 2006 greenwood 2007 tulloch and szabo 2012 and that birdwatchers are willing to travel further to see rare species booth et al 2011 in addition a number of studies have found that there are higher densities of observations in urban areas botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 presumably due to proximity to the residences of the majority of observers dennis and thomas 2000 many of these studies involve bird records and it is unclear how many of these biases might also apply to other taxa reddy and dávalos 2003 models of site selection associated environmental covariates with the presence of a submitted list and separate relationships were estimated for locations from the two clusters across both clusters habitat and accessibility were important in determining the probability of a list the habitat variables that had high relative influence for determining the probability of a list were suburban improved grassland and landcover diversity areas with high suburban landcover are often accessible to many observers but contain more biodiversity than the truly urban areas areas with a high diversity of landcover will often provide a greater range of species in a small area which would be attractive to many birdwatchers tulloch et al 2013 kolstoe and cameron 2017 the accessibility variables with high relative influence were road density altitude and housing density within 25 km radius and 5 km radius although the 5 km radius may also describe aspects of habitat a wide range of taxa have demonstrated higher rates of sampling near roads botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 kadmon et al 2004 keller and scallan 1999 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 in great britain altitude is strongly linked to accessibility as higher altitude locations are usually more difficult to access housing density likely describes the accessibility of a site to local observers altogether the road density altitude and housing density all represent the accessibility of sites the accessibility of sites is more strongly associated with the location of sites in cluster 2 which are nearer to observers homes and have more common bird assemblages figs s6 s7 s9 we did not find that any of the reserve variables were important for determining the probability of a list this result contrasts with many previous studies that have found higher density of sampling within protected areas boakes et al 2010 botts et al 2011 freitag et al 1998 reddy and dávalos 2003 tulloch et al 2013 in great britian there are a large number of bird reserves nature reserves and designated sites even within a single category e g bird reserves there is a very wide range of site characteristics some bird reserves are small patches of woodland whilst others have diverse habitat a diverse community of birds and facilities such as a shop and café we suggest that this wide range of reserve attributes for each reserve category will reduce the effect of the reserve variables in the model additionally in great britain the difference between reserves and non reserve areas might be less stark than in some other countries 5 conclusions overall we demonstrate that spatially biased citizen science data can be used to produce accurate estimates of species distributions which show consistent bias across species only in locations with both low sampling density and unique environments accounting for the spatial bias with weights led to an overall reduction in bias in this region with poor estimation but no increase in precision these results demonstrate the utility of large citizen science datasets for estimating species distributions despite the strong spatial bias in site selection the approaches set out in this paper provide a methodology that can be applied to the validation and spatial modelling of other citizen science datasets however with other datasets regions species or analytical approaches the effects of spatial bias are likely to be different and we therefore urge caution in directly applying these results to other situations without further testing credit authorship contribution statement alison johnston

24880,ecological citizen science data are rapidly growing in availability and use in ecology and conservation many citizen science projects have the flexibility for participants to select where they survey resulting in more participants but also spatially biased data it is important to assess the extent to which these spatially biased data can provide reliable estimates of species distributions here we quantify the extent of site selection bias in a citizen science project and the implications of this spatial bias in species distribution models using data from the birdtrack citizen science project in great britain from 2007 to 2011 we modelled the spatial bias of data submissions we next produced species occupancy models for 138 bird species and assessed the impact of accounting for spatial bias we compared the distributions to those produced using unbiased data from an atlas survey from the same region and time period averaging across 138 species models with spatially biased data produced accurate and precise estimates of species occupancy for most locations in great britain however these distributions were both less accurate and less precise in the scottish highlands showing on average a positive bias accounting for the spatially biased sampling with weights led to on average greater accuracy in the scottish highlands but did not increase precision this region is both distinct in environmental characteristics and has a low density of observations making it difficult to characterise environmental relationships with species occupancy accounting for the spatially biased sampling did not affect average accuracy or precision throughout most of the country spatially biased citizen science data can be used to estimate species occupancy in regions with stationary environmental relationships and good sampling across environmental space the reliability of estimated species distributions from spatially biased data should be further validated and tested under a range of different scenarios keywords birdtrack citizen science occupancy models preferential sampling spatial bias species distribution models 1 introduction datasets collected by citizen scientists are increasingly being used to answer a wide range of ecological questions partly due to their cost effectiveness relative to professional surveys powney and isaac 2015 silvertown 2009 ecological citizen science programmes range widely in geographic scope from a single island e g white et al 2015 to global e g newson et al 2016 sullivan et al 2009 in species scope from single species e g howard and davis 2009 to all species e g karns et al 2006 and from highly structured methods e g harris et al 2016 newson et al 2015 to completely unstructured data collection e g pocock et al 2015 unstructured surveys that allow participants substantial flexibility in location and style of survey will often attract a large number of participants with a wide range of skill and expertise kelling et al 2015 pocock et al 2017 however this flexibility results in participants choosing sites they enjoy visiting and this introduces spatial bias into the resulting data in these flexible and unstructured surveys citizen scientists select sites that they visit based on one or several criteria observers may record from particular sites because they are easily accessible either near to their home dennis and thomas 2000 luck 2007 or close to roads and paths botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 kadmon et al 2004 keller and scallan 1999 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 tiago et al 2017 alternatively they may select sites for ecological reasons selecting protected areas boakes et al 2010 botts et al 2011 freitag et al 1998 reddy and dávalos 2003 tulloch et al 2013 sites with a high species diversity dennis and thomas 2000 hijmans et al 2000 prendergast et al 1993 tulloch et al 2013 or sites with expected presence of a particularly interesting species boakes et al 2010 booth et al 2011 greenwood 2007 tulloch et al 2013 tulloch and szabo 2012 in reality each citizen scientist will likely consider several of these factors and the importance of each factor will vary among participants booth et al 2011 tulloch and szabo 2012 however we expect there will be common patterns among individuals in factors determining site selection aggregating across all participants these site selection preferences can lead to strong spatial biases in recording locations bird et al 2014 dickinson et al 2010 mair and reute 2016 furthermore such spatial bias is likely to be particularly strong when survey guidelines are flexible and therefore the participants comprise a large number of people with a broad range of skills and motivations geldmann et al 2016 in analyses of citizen science data it is important to consider the impact of spatial bias which can lead to biased estimates of species distributions boakes et al 2010 conn et al 2013 yang et al 2013 site selection bias can be put into two broad categories 1 biases that are independent of the response variable and 2 biases that are correlated with the species response diggle et al 2010 biases in category 1 will lead to inferred environmental relationships between species and habitat that are dominated by regions with more surveys however these category 1 biases can often be separated from the response given the independence between the response and the bias biases in category 2 can cause problems because the inferred environmental relationships are confounded with the spatial bias in site selection for example many observers may choose to survey wetland habitat that is highly correlated with the presence of wetland species this spatial bias is more challenging to deal with because it is harder to separate the bias and the response in citizen science surveys with a larger scope than a single species observers are likely to target a variety of sites with high species richness dennis and thomas 2000 prendergast et al 1993 which may be correlated with but not directly related to the occurrence of any individual species when estimating species distributions from presence only data it is important that the spatial bias of presence only data match the spatial bias among the selected pseudo absence data for this reason models for presence only data have a longer history of addressing spatial bias because it is critical to account for the difference between species absence and lack of sampling effort beck et al 2014 fithian et al 2015 mair and reute 2016 phillips et al 2009 a common method to account for spatial bias is to generate pseudo absences with the same spatial bias as the presence data e g higa et al 2014 phillips and dudík 2008 where it is possible to statistically characterise the mechanisms of spatial bias this process will generate a dataset of presences and pseudo absences that are all from the same spatial process when dealing with detection non detection data or presence absence data the non detections are already generated with the same process of spatial bias as the detections therefore the dataset is already at the point that many correction methods target for presence only data however even with this situation there is potential for further impacts of spatial bias for example relationships between species occurrence and environment can vary across space zuckerberg et al 2016 when the detection non detection data are spatially biased then the inferred relationships will be dominated by the locations or habitats that contribute the most data in this paper we examine the effects of such spatial bias where the non detections are already generated with the same process as the detections two main analytical approaches have been used to account for spatial bias in detection non detection data first spatial filtering can reduce the spatial bias by selecting a subset of data that has a more even spatial distribution araújo and guisan 2006 spatial filtering improves the spatial evenness of the data but at the cost of reducing the sample size spatial filtering is effective at reducing a predominance of data from certain regions by reducing the larger scale spatial bias however it will usually not reduce smaller scale bias caused by people selecting certain habitats spatial filtering often has only a small effect on ecological conclusions beck et al 2014 geldmann et al 2016 kadmon et al 2004 a second option is to estimate the probabilities of site selection based on environmental covariates and then use these probabilities to adjust or balance the empirical distribution of the covariates in practice these probabilities are either incorporated as model weights rosenbaum and rubin 1983 or used to produce a post hoc stratification to correct the analysis van turnhout et al 2008 when the site selection process can be assumed to be independent of the species response category 2 biases theoretical results show that using weights can eliminate bias heckmann 1979 the use of weighting methods to address this problem has been studied in a number of disciplines including in statistics where the weights are known as propensity scores guo and fraser 2014 and in machine learning where the problem is known as covariate shift sugiyama and kawanabe 2012 a third emerging option for spatially biased data is to jointly model the site selection process and the ecological response which is an extension of the second option conn et al 2016 diggle et al 2010 pati et al 2011 here we characterise spatial bias in site selection in birdtrack a flexible citizen science scheme and quantify the impact on species distributions of accounting for this bias we model the process of site selection bias and produce a statistical description of the spatial bias preliminary analyses revealed there were many covariates associated with the spatial bias and that the relationships could not be adequately described by a simple model this precluded option three the joint distribution and observation model therefore we modelled spatial bias using a flexible machine learning approach and used the predictions to weight subsequent species distribution models option two above we quantified the differences in predictive performance of estimated species distributions when we accounted for the spatial bias in site selection we validated the models against high quality data with minimal spatial bias and identified situations where inference with spatially biased data is less reliable 2 methods our methods comprise four analytical stages in stage 1 we describe the birdtrack data used for the analysis in stage 2 we classify locations 1 km squares into two categories based on how popular they are to visit in stage 3 we model the probability of a birdtrack list in each location using a variety of environmental variables in stage 4 we use occupancy models to quantify the distributions of 138 species we run one standard model and one model using the results from stage 3 as weights further details of the variables and models are provided in appendix a we compare the results of the occupancy models to models produced using a standardised and unbiased dataset from the same time period 2 1 stage 1 data selection the main dataset for the analysis was birdtrack a citizen science project in which participants collect records of species they detected at given locations the data collection protocol is relaxed and many participants contribute to this project representing a wide range of motivations skill knowledge and behaviour in this study we used a subset of the full dataset which included records of bird species recorded in great britain between 2007 2011 we used only complete lists in which observers reported all the species they were able to detect and identify and we converted counts of birds to a detection non detection response variable we also applied a number of other data filters in order to produce a more standardised and consistent dataset see appendix a for details 2 2 stage 2 site classification we wanted to understand the environmental factors that determine the types of locations from which birdtrack users submit lists however we expected that there would be considerable heterogeneity in the reasons that birdtrack users decide to visit certain locations for example one location may be near to their home whilst another might have a good variety of habitats and another may often host rare birds these different types of sites are likely to be associated with different environmental features in this stage we wanted to identify different types of sites using a clustering algorithm the data showed strong evidence of clustering hopkin s statistic 0 07 hopkins 1954 and the silhouette method suggested there were two clusters kaufman and rousseeuw 1990 we therefore used a k means clustering algorithm haritgan and wong 1979 to split the locations into two clusters based on seven covariates describing the popularity of a site the covariates for each site 1 km square used in the clustering algorithm were number of lists number of observers average number of lists per observer median distance from the observer s home median number of species per list and two rarity scores which describe a the average rarity of species listed at those locations and b the propensity for the locations to host particularly rare species all analyses were conducted in r r core team 2016 using package factoextra kassambara and mundt 2016 2 3 stage 3 models of site selection we aimed to predict the locations at which birdtrack users create lists we achieved this by characterising the environments that are typical for sites with lists the multinomial response variable was whether a site was cluster 1 cluster 2 or had no lists we associated this response with a number of environmental variables these variables were mostly summarised within 3 km 3 km squares and were standardised before modelling the covariates described characteristics of landcover 25 variables geography easting northing elevation housing density postcode density at five spatial scales roads total road length distance to nearest road and nature reserves combinations of bird reserves nature reserves and designated sites preliminary analyses revealed that parametric models did not sufficiently characterise the relationship between the environment and the response therefore we used a generalized boosted regression tree gbrt for this model because it enables a wide variety of non parametric relationships a large number of interactions between variables and can accommodate a large number of potentially correlated variables the regression tree identifies non parametric relationships between the predictors and the probability of the categorical responses these relationships can be more difficult to interpret than standard parametric models but here we were more concerned with good descriptions of the patterns than an understanding of the environmental relationships we wanted to validate the models with independent data that were not included in the model training we therefore removed approximately 25 of the locations in the uk to ensure a more rigorous test of the environmental relationships fourcade et al 2018 we divided great britain into 100 km 100 km squares and systematically selected one in every 4 squares fig s1 data within these 25 of squares were removed prior to modelling and were used to validate the resulting model by removing large squares we ensure that validation cannot be driven by small scale spatial autocorrelation hochachka et al 2010 we used the model built using 75 of the squares to predict the locations of lists in the 25 of squares we used area under the curve auc and the true skill statistic tss to compare these predictions to the observed locations of lists in the 25 validation set the multinomial gbrt models were fitted in the r package gbm ridgeway 2013 we used the gbrt model to estimate the probability of at least one birdtrack list from each 1 km square in great britain see appendix a for further details of the model covariates and parameters 2 4 stage 4 species distribution models 2 4 1 birdtrack species distributions to estimate the occurrence of each species within a 1 km square we used occupancy models mackenzie et al 2002 we wanted to compare the models using birdtrack data to models using data from the bird atlas 2007 11 balmer et al 2013 hereafter the atlas so we selected birdtrack observations that fell within the atlas breeding season monitoring period april july 2008 2011 occupancy modelling relies on multiple visits to the same location as repeat visits we used visits by the same observer to the same location 1 km square we selected any observer location combination that had at least one visit in the breeding season sites with only one visit do not contribute to the estimate of detectability but they do contribute to the estimate of occupancy the resultant birdtrack dataset april july 2008 2011 had 31 911 lists from 13 279 unique location observer combinations across 10 023 distinct locations each birdtrack list was located within a 1 km 1 km square and as covariates of occupancy we summarised information from the 3 km 3 km surrounding square the rationale for this was firstly that observations could be from outside the boundaries of the 1 km square and secondly that birds move around the landscape into nearby environments using environmental data from the 3 km square will therefore increase the accuracy of the environmental information relative to the bird observations but reduces the precision the environmental covariates used were geographic location easting and northing island group mean elevation jarvis et al 2008 the area of 27 different landcover types morton et al 2011 total seasonal rainfall met office 2016 and seasonal mean temperature met office 2016 the equation defining the occupancy ψ was l o g i t ψ ˆ k α 0 g 1 4 α g i s l a n d g k α 5 e l e v a t i

estimated coefficients islandgk is a binary variable with 1 if location k is within island group g scilly orkney shetland outer hebrides and 0 otherwise elevationk is the mean elevation within location k eastingk and northingk are the central geographic coordinates of location k on the uk os grid system areahk is the area of landcover h in location k rainfallsk is the total rainfall in season s at location k and tempsk is the mean temperature in season s at location k as covariates of detectability we used duration of the observation period for the list a quadratic function of day and a quadratic function of time the equation defining the detectability p was l o g i t p ˆ i λ 0 λ 1 d u r a t i o n i λ 2 d a y i λ 3 d a y i 2 λ 4 t i m e i λ 5 t i m e i 2 where pi is the detectability of list i λ are estimated coefficients durationi is the duration of the list in hours dayi is the day of the year that the list was conducted and timei is the start time of the list in decimal hours to conform with standard analyses of unstructured citizen science data we did not account for variation in participant expertise in the detectability model an assumption of occupancy modelling is that the occurrence of a species presence absence at a site does not change during the period of sampling however during april july we expect that the presence of many species will change due to mortality productivity and migratory movements although this violates the assumption of closure of a standard occupancy model this assumption can be relaxed as long as the estimated parameters are interpreted correctly mackenzie and royle 2005 and where appropriate covariates that describe the patterns of variation are added to the model kéry et al 2010 we allow for temporal changes in occupancy by the quadratic relationship with day in the detectability part of the model therefore any seasonal changes in occupancy will be assigned to seasonal variation in detectability we therefore interpret the estimated occupancy as the occupancy from the part of the breeding season with highest occupancy combining data across four years also involves the assumption that occurrence did not change among years we therefore interpret estimated occupancy as the species occupancy in the year with highest occupancy and this estimate will be robust if sampling sites were selected randomly in each year if a species had a rapid change in occupancy and sampling was temporally and spatially non random for example all northern sites in year 1 then combining across years could produce a biased estimate of the distribution therefore an assumption of our models is that no species were affected by rapid change in distribution and strongly biased spatio temporal sampling we used the information on probability of sampling to account for the spatially biased data within the occupancy model for the standard models we used a maximum likelihood occupancy model from r package unmarked fiske and chandler 2011 for each species we ran a second occupancy model where we included a likelihood weighting based on the probability of sampling estimated at any location that was calculated as described in stage 3 of this paper we adapted the code in package unmarked to include a weighting that multiplied each data point visit by a given weight in the likelihood based on sampling probability weightings were the reciprocals of the estimated probabilities of locations having a list in order to account for differences in sampling intensities in different environments each weighting was therefore specific to a given spatial location k and did not vary with visit using this procedure each list from a sparsely surveyed environment contributes more to the likelihood than a list from densely surveyed environments two models were produced for each species an unweighted model and a weighted model we expect the unweighted model to be biased towards the environments with more birdtrack lists predictions of occupancy were made for each 1 km square in great britain with covariate data these estimated occupancy rates b ˆ l s for 1 km 1 km square l and species s were accumulated across each 10 km 10 km square for each 10 km 10 km square l and species s we calculated the average estimated occupancy b ˆ l s i e the mean of the estimated occupancy of species s in each constituent 1 km square b ˆ l s 1 100 1 100 b ˆ l l s 2 4 2 atlas species distribution models to validate the distribution models from birdtrack data we constructed similar distribution models from atlas data the atlas used experienced citizen scientists standardised survey methods and crucially had even coverage across the whole country reducing the impact of spatial bias and site selection we used data for the breeding season and across great britain which included 58 285 1 h visits to 18 736 2 km 2 km squares tetrads this atlas dataset contained data from considerably more locations than the birdtrack dataset and had even coverage across 10 km 10 km squares fig 2 we followed a very similar approach for modelling the atlas data to that taken with the birdtrack data to ensure comparable methodology as above the model results were aggregated to the metric of average occupancy within each 10 km 10 km square l for each species s al s see appendix a for further model details 2 4 3 comparing distributions from birdtrack and atlas data in order to assess the quality of the distributions produced from birdtrack we made the assumption that the occupancy models produced from atlas data are the closest estimate we can achieve to true occupancy distributions using this analytical approach and with these species the standardised and spatially intensive sampling for the atlas represents one of the highest quality ecological datasets available across a region there were some species for which atlas occupancy models did not produce reliable results and we removed these from the suite of species for comparison keeping those with auc 0 80 which was 138 of the 159 species modelled for each of these 138 species we calculated the difference in mean estimated occupancy in each 10 km 10 km square from the two birdtrack occupancy models unweighted and weighted and the atlas occupancy model d l s b ˆ l s a ˆ l s where dl s is the difference between the estimated occupancy from the birdtrack and atlas distribution models for location l 10 km 10 km square and species s we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the differences between birdtrack and atlas distributions across all species for each 10 km 10 km square dl these results will tell us on average across all species whether birdtrack data lead to biased estimates in particular locations for each species we also calculated the average deviation between birdtrack and atlas distributions across all 10 km squares ds to assess how absolute sample size was a factor in the estimated atlas and birdtrack distributions we compared the birdtrack sample size for each species with the average deviation for each species mean ds we also compared the birdtrack sample size for each 10 km square with the average deviation for each 10 km square averaged across species mean dl these results will tell us on average across all locations whether volume of birdtrack data affect the degree of bias in estimates for particular species 3 results 3 1 stage 1 data selection after filtering the year round birdtrack dataset was comprised of 170 723 lists and over 3 7 million observations of bird species in great britain during 2007 2011 table s1 3 2 stage 2 site categorisation we categorised sites with lists into two clusters cluster 1 sites comprised 19 of all the sites with lists and they were characterised by higher site rarity scores and higher median distance from home postcodes of observers figs s5 s7 this suggests that cluster 1 sites have a more interesting bird assemblage and that observers will travel further to visit these locations there were many cluster 1 sites on the coast and in less populated areas fig s9 conversely this suggests that cluster 2 sites are visited for convenience of travel and generally have a less interesting bird assemblage 3 3 stage 3 models of site selection we associated environmental covariates with the probability that locations were in cluster 1 cluster 2 and or had no lists there were seven variables that had high relative influence in determining whether a site was cluster 1 cluster 2 or had no lists three landcover variables suburban land improved grassland and landcover diversity two house density variables 5 km and 25 km radii density of roads and altitude all of the reserve variables and most of the landcover variables had a low relative influence on probability of a birdtrack list the model performed moderately well against the validation data from the removed 100 km 100 km squares with the validation data auc 0 78 and tss 0 39 with the modelled data auc 0 82 and tss 0 48 the similarity between model performance in the modelled data and validation data suggests that spatial autocorrelation did not have a large effect on the model using the model from stage 3 we predicted the probability that each location 1 km squre would be either a cluster 1 or a cluster 2 site this is the equivalent to calculating the probability that the site has a list all 1 km squares had a probability of a list between 0 and 0 5 with most sites having a low probability fig 1 3 4 stage 4 species distribution models we present an example of one species distribution marsh harrier circus aeruginosus fig 2 this species has a relatively restricted breeding distribution within great britain the unweighted model shows a large predicted population in the scottish highlands where there are few birdtrack lists and the modelled environmental relationships have extrapolated to a population in the highlands the distribution from the weighted model does not have a predicted population in the highlands and closely matches the distribution from atlas data this positive effect of weighting by the probability of lists is evident in a number of other species however there were species for which the weighting had no effect or a negative effect producing a predicted distribution that was a worse match to the distribution from atlas data in appendix b we present eight species that demonstrate a range of responses to the weighting and a range of agreement between the distributions estimated from birdtrack and atlas data averaging across all 138 species birdtrack distributions had positively biased occupancy estimates in the scottish highlands fig 3 the birdtrack distributions also had negatively biased occupancy estimates in coastal locations the models that were weighted by birdtrack sampling probability had less positive bias in the scottish highlands but slightly greater negative bias around the coastal squares fig 3 the standard deviation of differences between species was highest in the scottish highlands and this remained the case when using the weighted birdtrack models fig 3 overall weighting by the probability of sampling increased the accuracy of the estimated occupancies across species 3b is less pink than 3a but did not improve precision 3d has similar dark grey area to 3c the average difference between estimated occupancy from birdtrack and atlas distributions was higher in squares with few birdtrack observations and was reduced in the weighted models which was evident in the scottish highlands fig 4 at sites with a very high number of birdtrack observations there was a propensity for the birdtrack occupancy to be negatively biased which was evident in coastal sites although the median difference was still zero fig 4 across species the average difference at a given location was relatively small however within species average differences were higher suggesting some species had positive biased occupancy estimates in many locations whilst other species had negatively biased occupancy estimates in many locations from the total of 138 species 87 had an average difference less than 0 05 and 124 species less than 0 10 these numbers rose only slightly to 91 and 126 with the weighted models for 65 species the weighted models were closer to the atlas distributions and for 73 species the unweighted models were closer to the atlas distributions the median difference between the closeness of weighted and unweighted models to the atlas distributions was 0 00 demonstrating roughly equal number of species had improvements and deteriorations by adding the model weights the median absolute difference was 0 01 demonstrating that changes were in general very small with the addition of the weights there was no clear pattern in species positive observations in relation to bias of estimates fig 4 therefore at this scale and with these data and species the accuracy of birdtrack models was not directly related to number of positive observations 4 discussion we have demonstrated an analytical approach to model spatial bias in citizen science data and to account for this spatial bias in species distribution models on average weighting by sampling density improved the accuracy but not the precision of estimated species occurrence however there were species specific differences for some species the weighting improved the estimated occupancy and for others it made the estimates worse the variation across species was not closely predicted by the species rarity in surveys given the strong spatial biases evident in birdtrack site selection it is notable that there is not a larger effect on estimated species distributions we suggest three reasons for this firstly spatial bias would mainly lead to problems if there was non stationarity in environmental relationships we expect that on the scale of great britain there is consistency in environmental relationships secondly although there is strong spatial bias the birdtrack dataset is relatively large and even in poorly surveyed areas there is a reasonable sample size thirdly there is relatively good coverage of environmental space which reduces the impact of spatial bias higa et al 2014 kadmon et al 2004 the scottish highlands are an exception to both the second and third reasons here they have low sampling intensity and there are several environmental variables that have extreme values in this region leading to relatively novel environmental space with respect to the rest of great britain fig s11 we expect that the poor coverage of these novel environmental spaces has reduced the accuracy and precision of estimated species distributions in this area locally weighted regression or spatially localised models will naturally adapt to large scale bias and non stationarity fink et al 2010 fotheringham et al 2003 however these modelling structures will also tend towards poor estimation when situations two and three occur small sample size and poor coverage of environmental space and they will still be susceptible to small scale spatial bias in site selection several previous studies also found that accounting for spatial bias did not have a large effect on estimated distributions beck et al 2014 higa et al 2014 kadmon et al 2004 although there was not a large effect of spatial bias in this study we argue that spatial bias is an important consideration in many analyses of citizen science data particularly those at large spatial scales and where there are substantial differences in sampling intensity between habitats for example it may be more critical when overall sampling density is lower el gabbas and dormann 2017 we expect that the effect of spatial bias on estimated trends could be substantial isaac et al 2014 kamp et al 2016 zbinden et al 2014 due to strong spatial patterns in population trends massimino et al 2015 spatial differences in population trend are likely to be much larger than spatial differences in environmental relationships and are likely to vary within smaller geographic scales the greatest benefit of weighting data by sampling density appeared in predictions for regions with the lowest densities of data for 90 of species the distributions from birdtrack data were close to the atlas distributions with an average difference in estimated occupancy of less than 0 10 however although there was agreement on this broad scale averaging across the country for each species there were notable spatial patterns in the biases averaging across species for different areas of the country the scottish highlands had higher bias and lower precision than the rest of the country the weightings reduced the bias pati et al 2011 but did not affect the precision this suggests that estimates of occupancy from the scottish highlands are not accurate within species which is also evident from some individual species maps appendix b estimates of species distributions from birdtrack data had a negative bias around many coastal sites this may be because different observers visit different locations birdwatchers vary in their expertise kelling et al 2015 and those with different expertise may visit different types of sites which can lead to bias in estimated species distributions johnston et al 2018 coastal sites often have high species diversity and attract rare species which makes them attractive to birdwatchers boakes et al 2010 booth et al 2011 tulloch et al 2013 these sites would be expected to attract less experienced birdwatchers at a higher rate than other sites giving the participant pool at these sites a lower average experience if less experienced birdwatchers are not as skilled at detecting and identifying birds the lower average experience would give these sites a negative estimated occupancy using birdtrack data overall greater attention should be given to discriminating the quality of species distributions between regions sites visited by citizen scientists could be categorised into two groups one cluster of sites had more unusual bird species reported and observers travelled further to visit these sites this suggests that observers will incur a greater cost i e travel time and costs to visit a site with a more interesting bird assemblage kolstoe and cameron 2017 these results concur with previous studies that demonstrate observers show a bias towards rare threatened or attractive species boakes et al 2010 dennis et al 2006 greenwood 2007 tulloch and szabo 2012 and that birdwatchers are willing to travel further to see rare species booth et al 2011 in addition a number of studies have found that there are higher densities of observations in urban areas botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 presumably due to proximity to the residences of the majority of observers dennis and thomas 2000 many of these studies involve bird records and it is unclear how many of these biases might also apply to other taxa reddy and dávalos 2003 models of site selection associated environmental covariates with the presence of a submitted list and separate relationships were estimated for locations from the two clusters across both clusters habitat and accessibility were important in determining the probability of a list the habitat variables that had high relative influence for determining the probability of a list were suburban improved grassland and landcover diversity areas with high suburban landcover are often accessible to many observers but contain more biodiversity than the truly urban areas areas with a high diversity of landcover will often provide a greater range of species in a small area which would be attractive to many birdwatchers tulloch et al 2013 kolstoe and cameron 2017 the accessibility variables with high relative influence were road density altitude and housing density within 25 km radius and 5 km radius although the 5 km radius may also describe aspects of habitat a wide range of taxa have demonstrated higher rates of sampling near roads botts et al 2011 hijmans et al 2000 kadmon et al 2004 keller and scallan 1999 mair and reute 2016 reddy and dávalos 2003 in great britain altitude is strongly linked to accessibility as higher altitude locations are usually more difficult to access housing density likely describes the accessibility of a site to local observers altogether the road density altitude and housing density all represent the accessibility of sites the accessibility of sites is more strongly associated with the location of sites in cluster 2 which are nearer to observers homes and have more common bird assemblages figs s6 s7 s9 we did not find that any of the reserve variables were important for determining the probability of a list this result contrasts with many previous studies that have found higher density of sampling within protected areas boakes et al 2010 botts et al 2011 freitag et al 1998 reddy and dávalos 2003 tulloch et al 2013 in great britian there are a large number of bird reserves nature reserves and designated sites even within a single category e g bird reserves there is a very wide range of site characteristics some bird reserves are small patches of woodland whilst others have diverse habitat a diverse community of birds and facilities such as a shop and café we suggest that this wide range of reserve attributes for each reserve category will reduce the effect of the reserve variables in the model additionally in great britain the difference between reserves and non reserve areas might be less stark than in some other countries 5 conclusions overall we demonstrate that spatially biased citizen science data can be used to produce accurate estimates of species distributions which show consistent bias across species only in locations with both low sampling density and unique environments accounting for the spatial bias with weights led to an overall reduction in bias in this region with poor estimation but no increase in precision these results demonstrate the utility of large citizen science datasets for estimating species distributions despite the strong spatial bias in site selection the approaches set out in this paper provide a methodology that can be applied to the validation and spatial modelling of other citizen science datasets however with other datasets regions species or analytical approaches the effects of spatial bias are likely to be different and we therefore urge caution in directly applying these results to other situations without further testing credit authorship contribution statement alison johnston

24881,mediterranean islands are widely recognized as biodiversity hotspots with a long history of human activities shaping multi functional landscapes socioeconomic and environmental factors are among the most important factors driving the creation of diverse landscapes with a high supply of ecosystem services es however these factors along with climate change could also have irreversible consequences on local ecosystems thus this study aimed to reveal the importance of socio ecological factors in shaping es bundles to manage natural resources efficiently and enhance human well being using the ionian islands as a case study we explored the relationships among multiple es including their supply and demand indicators we identified bundles of es to distinguish regions in which supply and demand exhibit different characteristics an ensemble machine learning method random forest rf was used to identify the most important socio ecological variables out of 17 tested that contribute to es bundles our results produced five bundles of es supply and six bundles of es demand the most important variables for the distribution of es supply bundles were landscape heterogeneity elevation slope landscape connectivity and population in comparison variables representing elevation slope and population were among the most important variables contributing to es demand bundles rf exhibited both good classification and predictability which was supported by the accuracy measures our findings demonstrated that research on es should account for underlying socio ecological drivers that influence the supply and demand of es to improve our understanding of the possible impacts of future management decisions regarding the diverse mediterranean landscapes of the ionian islands keywords ecosystem services socio ecological factors predictive mapping random forest landscape planning ionian islands 1 introduction the capacity for ecosystems to provide specific ecosystem services es depends on the interactions between biophysical characteristics and human presence gonzalez ollauri and mickovski 2017 reyers et al 2013 these interactions generate distinct sets of es across diverse landscapes in the form of es bundles bennett et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 however human demand as expressed by their activities often creates antagonistic relationships in the supply of multiple es furthermore a drop in the provision of es might contribute to biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecological quality which in turn threaten human well being lyu et al 2018 understanding how different social and ecological factors shape the delivery of es is of primary importance to achieve effective landscape policy and management consequently identifying the importance of various social and ecological drivers for es bundles especially across different landscapes has been gaining increasing attention dittrich et al 2017 lyu et al 2019 meacham et al 2016 schirpke et al 2019 spake et al 2017 the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 defines drivers as natural or human centered factors that directly or indirectly cause changes to an ecosystem direct drivers clearly influence ecosystem processes whereas indirect drivers influence ecosystem processes through altering at least one direct driver to meet the demand for an enhanced understanding of patterns in es advanced computational statistical methods are being increasingly used such as machine learning ml algorithms in general there are two types of ml approaches supervised and unsupervised learning which are achieved using various techniques such techniques include tree based methods artificial neural networks support vector machines genetic algorithm fuzzy inference systems and bayesian methods thessen 2016 willcock et al 2018 decision tree learning is the most popular ml technique used for ecological modeling because it predicts the value of one or several dependent variables debeljak and džeroski 2011 random forest rf is an ensemble of decision trees and is designed to produce accurate predictions through building a set of randomized un pruned decision trees standard classification or regression trees carts breiman 2001 since 2006 many researchers have demonstrated the ability of rf to outperform traditional statistical methods and other ml methods in earth science and ecology applications cutler et al 2007 kampichler et al 2010 mi et al 2017 prasad et al 2006 shearman et al 2019 furthermore rf follows specific rules for tree growing tree combination self testing and post processing it is also robust to overfitting and is considered more stable in the presence of outliers and in very high dimensional parameter spaces than other ml algorithms sarica et al 2017 because of the good predictive ability of rf it is now frequently used to identify the factors driving various environmental processes for example su et al 2018 applied rf to analyze the drivers spatial distribution and risk trends of fires in a forest city of china zaimes et al 2019 used an rf model to show how changes to the vegetation in a riparian forest in greece were linked to environmental variables to understand landscape productivity and changes to vegetation southworth et al 2018 used rf to show how social and biophysical variables drive spatial heterogeneity socio ecological variables are also used in es assessments for instance meacham et al 2016 evaluated different theories of human impact on the pattern of multiple es similarly schirpke et al 2019 used rf to identify important socio ecological drivers in the distribution of es bundles among the variables used to explain the distribution of es land use status and population density were considered the most important in another study the importance of es and biodiversity were assessed in terms of their spatial covariance with society s socio economic profile eigenbrod et al 2017 in all cases rf proved to be a powerful tool for overcoming various challenges that emerge from the variation in ecosystem type and the scale of analysis i e from local and country scaled to highly heterogeneous multi national landscapes mediterranean islands are widely recognized as biodiversity hotspots that have a long history of human activities shaping their multi functional landscapes balzan et al 2018 martín lópez et al 2016 vogiatzakis et al 2016 socioeconomic and environmental factors are among the most important factors driving the creation of these diverse landscapes which also have a high supply of es geri et al 2010 kefalas et al 2019 petanidou et al 2008 however socioeconomic and environmental factors along with climate change might have irreversible consequences on local ecosystems kefalas et al 2018 thus this study aimed to reveal the importance of socio ecological factors in shaping es bundles on the ionian islands through an ensemble ml method specifically we aimed to identify coherent groups of es supply and demand at the landscape scale and determine how different drivers influence the spatial distribution of es bundles our results are expected to facilitate an improved understanding of the importance of sustainably managing natural resources to enhance human well being 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region of ionian islands is located in western greece and is in the east part of the ionian sea fig 1 it encompasses four island complexes each of which contains a main island namely corfu lefkada kefalonia and zakynthos the local climate is mediterranean consisting of mild humid winters and warm dry summers agriculture and tourism are among the most important sectors sustaining the economy of ionian islands where croplands especially olive orchards cover approximately 36 of land kefalas et al 2018 despite intense human pressure mass tourism intensive agriculture and frequent fire events forests and woodlands occupy a large extent of the ionian islands 31 forested areas kefalas et al 2019 the study area supports a population of 207 855 people concentrated in urban and lowland regions lorilla et al 2019 overall the ionian islands are characterized by diverse ecosystems with high natural and cultural value facilitating the delivery of es lorilla et al 2018 2 2 data preparation and analysis the es studied were chosen so as to reflect in a balanced way the supply and demand in one hand and a representative mix of es relevant to the area both in social and environmental terms in the other therefore this study focused on six es including three provisioning services food provision fp livestock provision lp plant based resources pr two regulating and maintenance services climate regulation cr maintenance of nursery populations and habitats ns and one cultural service recreation rc data availability and the feasibility of data manipulation were also important criteria in the selection of specific indicators and mapping models agricultural activities including both crops and livestock production contribute to the livelihoods of rural populations providing income and to some extent covering household needs in this sense food provisioning services in the context of reliance on the agricultural sector play a crucial role in the rural economy of small islands balzan et al 2018 climate regulation can support the provision of natural resources and therefore ensure the delivery of other essential services although the relevant mechanisms operate at much higher geographic scales it is a matter of high importance throughout the globe as carbon sequestration is a process that can be meaningfully assessed at various scales recreation in the form of eco tourism depends on the highly valued by tourists and locals naturalness of landscapes census data reveal that rural communities of the ionian islands use biomass as their main source of heating purposes however insufficient management of timber extraction may reduce forest diversity which in turn risk the integrity of ecosystem functioning finally the ionian islands encompass 14 protected areas included in the natura 2000 network while intense human pressure may negatively affect the ability of sensitive ecosystems to maintain nursery populations and habitats the significance of mediterranean islands as biodiversity hotspots also greatly exceeds their geographical borders information on es supply and demand have been delineated by previous studies conducted on the ionian islands lorilla et al 2018 lorilla et al 2019 in this study lp supply and demand pr demand and ns demand were added to provide six es supply and six es demand indicators for lp we used grazing land cover types as the supply indicator and livestock animals as the demand indicator assuming that the number of reared animals could be used to express the demand of society for livestock provision syrbe and grunewald 2017 demand for plant based energy resources was estimated using social data on the percentage of households consuming biomass for heating purposes for ns we used the percentage of land under any protection policy assuming that protected areas have high demand for conservation and maintenance of biodiversity and es which can maintain human well being palomo et al 2011 table 1 provides an overview all of the indicators that were used to map supply and demand of the selected services es were mapped at a pixel resolution of 30 m except for those using data from socioeconomic censuses which were only available at the level of municipal districts to identify the relationships between es and socio ecological factors all variables were aggregated to a common spatial unit municipality level given by the hellenic statistical authority 2011 in which we estimated the average value using the r package spatialeco version 1 2 0 evans and ram 2015 the initial dataset included 278 administrative units for the ionian islands from which three municipalities representing three small islets were excluded from the analysis due to missing es and socio ecological data 2 2 1 selection of socio ecological variables based on the published literature we selected 26 predictor variables related to human influence environmental parameters and landscape structure a correlation analysis spearman s ρ was run in order to detect strongly correlated pairs of variables in 10 cases high ρ values were found and only one variable was retained a total of 17 variables was retained and thus formed the basis of the subsequent analyses table 2 also appendix table s1 the rationale behind the choice of variables was to create a balanced mix of social and environmental variables reflecting representative aspects of the local es while ensuring data availability the demographic population density employment rate and artificial infrastructure variables hotel density factory density and road density were selected for their impact on ecological degradation as a result of socioeconomic and urban development meacham et al 2016 human population growth has been associated with substantial land use changes which in turn directly affect the supply of es elmhagen et al 2015 also along with population growth increasing employment rates is an index of economic activity which is associated both with enhanced material flows infrastructure development such as touristic accommodations and roads place high pressure on ecosystems by taking up space through sealing and thus inhibiting ecosystem functions and generating high demand for food water supply water usage and wastewater discharges kefalas et al 2019 pinto et al 2013 plieninger et al 2016 climate conditions directly affect natural ecosystems and the services they provide impacting human well being key climatic parameters that affect ecological systems include annual mean temperature and precipitation nelson et al 2006 the selection of topographic factors elevation slope was supported by the assumption that the isolation and accessibility of land constrain the distribution of human activities and their impact on local ecosystems kefalas et al 2019 meacham et al 2016 along with the aforementioned variables aspect constitutes a key topographic feature that affects soil and microclimate which in turn influence the composition of vegetation and therefore determines the supply of es bennie et al 2006 yapp et al 2010 zhu et al 2019 landscape structure and configuration resulting from complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors as well as land use choices made by society have a significant influence on the supply of es and hence human well being herrero jáuregui et al 2019 mitchell et al 2015 in this study we calculated metrics of fragmentation np division connectivity pd contag iji and heterogeneity shdi pr at the landscape level landscape fragmentation has shown negative effects on es supply whilst landscape connectivity is expected to substantially influence the provision of es mitchell et al 2013 2015 in parallel understanding the relationships between landscape heterogeneity and the provisioning of es within different landscapes is critical for future land management turner et al 2013 this aspect is particularly important for mediterranean landscapes that are highly mosaic in nature due to both rugged terrain and historical land use detsis et al 2010 kefalas et al 2019 2 2 2 identifying bundles and predictor variables of es each es map was standardized to a scale between 0 and 1 based on the minimum and maximum values higher values correspond to greater magnitude of services the framework for identifying predictor variables and their importance in forming es bundles consisted of two main parts the bundle identification framework and the random forest model fig 2 following lorilla et al 2018 the bundle identification framework was used to distinguish bundles of es supply and demand first we performed spearman correlation tests on pairs of es supply and es demand to reveal the relationship among all services the strength of the relationship was determined using correlation coefficients which were classified into three levels cui et al 2019 strong relationship ρ 0 5 moderate relationship 0 5 ρ 0 3 and week relationship ρ 0 3 second principal component analysis pca was performed to identify es variability explained by the pc axes the two analyses were used to evaluate the relationships among es in terms of synergies and trade offs at the landscape level third ward s hierarchical clustering method along with euclidean distance was used to create sets of es that spatially overlapped in a certain way within a given area i e es bundles the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette method which computes the average silhouette of observations for different values of clusters kaufman and rousseeuw 2008 this measure delineated five optimal clusters for es supply and six optimal clusters for demand the categorization of the study area in es bundles was used as the dependent variable in the rf models because we aimed to explain the distribution of five and six es bundles i e categorical data we employed the classification rf model over the regression rf model which can only be applied to continuous data a random forest is a classifier consisting of a collection of tree structured classifiers h x θ k k 1 where the θ k are independent identically distributed random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at input x definition from breiman 2001 when employing an rf model the first step involves creating training sets called bootstraps from a random resampling of the original dataset observations of the original dataset that do not occur in a bootstrap sample are called out of bag oob observations cutler et al 2007 we created the training dataset from 70 of randomly selected samples of the initial dataset 184 municipalities while the remaining 30 consisted of the test dataset 91 municipalities the rf algorithm consists of the main model and the prediction model the main rf model was applied to the training dataset and was used to identify the importance of predictor variables in the classification of the study area in specific bundles the prediction model was applied using the results of the main rf model to evaluate the accuracy of using socio ecological variables to predict es bundles in the test dataset the second step is to prepare the rf model properly when building rf there are three tuning parameters of interest catucci and scardi 2020 1 the number of randomly selected predictors at each tree mtry 2 the minimum number of records contained in leaf to stop splitting nodesize 3 and the number of trees ntrees careful tuning of these parameters can prevent extended computations with little gain in error reduction segal 2003 breiman 2001 showed that by setting the nodesize parameter to 1 the model produces good accuracy for the other two parameters mtry and ntrees we tested different values and the ones with the highest accuracy were selected as more appropriate for use in the rf model the tests were applied separately for the outputs of es supply bundles and es demand bundles thus the parameters for the supply rf model differed to those of the demand rf model table s2 because multiple selections for ntrees showed the same level of accuracy we estimated the multi roc curve to select the number of trees this measure facilitated the selection of the optimal number of trees with the highest ability to distinguish es bundles the third step consists of running the rf model to obtain the oob error rate and the plot showing variable importance oob samples are used to calculate an unbiased error rate eliminating the need for cross validation prasad et al 2006 the concept of variable importance is an implicit selection feature performed by rf with a random subspace methodology it is assessed by the gini impurity criterion index the gini index is a measure of the prediction power of variables in regression or classification based on the principle of impurity reduction it is non parametric and therefore does not rely on data belonging to a particular type of distribution for a given training set t selecting one case municipality at random and allocating it to bundle bi the gini index is written as pal 2005 g i n i j i f c i t t f c j t t where f ci t t is the probability that the selected case belonging to class bi the gini index should be maximized thus a low gini i e a greater decrease in gini indicates that a particular predictor is more important in separating data into classes the gini index can be used to rank the importance of predictor variables for a classification problem in ml it is essential to measure the performance of a classification problem while the oob estimator is commonly considered as an acceptable proxy of the performance of an rf model for multi class classification problems the auc roc area under the curve receiver operating characteristics should be employed as an alternative performance measure fawcett 2006 hand and till 2001 probst and boulesteix 2018 therefore we also estimated the multi class auc roc to reveal the classification capability of the selected variables roc is a probability curve while auc represents the degree or measure of separability auc values range from 0 5 to 1 0 where values between 0 50 and 0 70 indicate low model accuracy between 0 70 and 0 90 indicate moderate model accuracy and over 0 90 indicate high model accuracy therefore an auc value of 1 0 indicates a high capability of the model to recognize different classes nemes and hartel 2010 in ecological studies models with an auc value greater than 0 8 are considered to have good classification accuracy humphries et al 2018 the final step is to evaluate the rf model and make the prediction the prediction is applied on the test dataset using the rf model the outputs of the prediction model are the confusion matrix which indicates the correctly classified bundles and the accuracy of the prediction in addition we also estimated the auc roc for each es bundle maps were created using the free and open source geographic information system qgis madeira version 3 4 3 all data analyses were conducted in the software r version 3 5 0 and r studio version 1 1 453 the r packages used to identify es bundles consisted of rgdal version 1 4 6 bivand et al 2019 hmisc version 4 2 0 harrell and dunpont 2019 factoextra version 1 0 5 kassambara and mundt 2017 factominer version 1 42 husson et al 2019 tidyverse version 1 2 1 wickham 2017 and cluster version 2 1 0 rousseeuw et al 2019 the rf model and auc roc tests were implemented in the r packages randomforest version 4 6 14 liaw and wiener 2018 caret version 6 0 84 kuhn 2019 and proc version 1 15 3 robin et al 2019 3 results the spatial distribution of es for both supply and demand showed variation across the study area and among services fig s1 s2 in general the supply of most es presented different patterns to demand except for fp and lp for which supply and demand overlapped spatially high values of cr and rc supply were evident in mountainous and naturally vegetated regions while high demand for these services were located in urbanized municipalities pr and ns did not exhibit any specific patterns in all cases higher es supply extended over large regions whereas higher es demand was concentrated in few municipalities see demand for lp pr ns and rc fig s2 3 1 es relationships correlation tests showed variation in the direction and strength of es relationships table 3 es supply pairs had the highest number of strong correlations four highly correlated pairs fp and lp mostly had negative relationships indicating that these services inhibit the presence of other es the supply of ns showed non significant correlations with other es from all categories except for lp with which it had a moderately positive relationship ρ 0 30 in comparison rc exhibited significantly strong positive relationships with pr and cr and a moderately negative relationship with fp in contrast only weak and moderate correlations were found in the demand for all es the demand for ns expressed by the amount of protected areas had negative and positive relationship with the demand for fp and lp respectively unsurprisingly demand for cr and rc showed a positive relationship as both demands are related to the presence of people out of the 36 supply demand es pairs 75 were significantly correlated with 18 low correlated pairs six moderately correlated pairs and three highly correlated pairs the spatial mismatch between the distribution of supply and demand for most es pr cr ns rc was also validated by their correlations which indicated weak negative correlations ρ 0 25 in comparison the relationship between supply and demand of fp and lp showed strong ρ 0 93 and moderate ρ 0 36 positive correlations respectively other strong correlations in supply demand pairs were those of lp supply fp demand and pr supply lp demand with both pairs having a negative relationship similar results were obtained by the pca fig 3 the first two axes explained 49 of total es variability table s2 and fig s3 with two main gradients the first horizontal axis shows a gradient from natural vegetation mostly meadows to agricultural regions the former presented a supply of lp and demand for ns and lp while the latter were characterized by both the supply and demand of fp in comparison the second vertical axis shows a gradient from urban regions to highly natural areas mostly forests the former had a high demands for cr and rc while the latter was characterized by a high supply of rc cr and pr beyond the first two axes pc1 and pc2 pc3 and pc4 with eigenvalues over 1 explained 12 7 and 10 7 respectively of es variability with a 72 cumulative percentage of variance 3 2 identification of es bundles cluster analysis indicated five bundles for es supply and six bundles for es demand fig 4 a for both es supply and demand some islands did not present the full set of supply or demand bundles for example four out of five supply bundles and four out of six demand bundles were identified for kefalonia out of the es supply bundles s4 representing olive orchards contained the highest number of municipalities 27 followed by s5 24 and s3 21 representing highly natural vegetation and mixed ecosystems respectively however s5 covered 31 of the region followed by s1 21 representing sparsely vegetated areas with low es supply and s3 20 characterized by the provision of multiple es fig 4b and table 4 the cropland related bundle s2 characterized by high food provisioning service was the smallest in terms of the number of municipalities and percentage of land area by contrast the other agricultural bundle s4 had high supply values for most es fp pr ns and rc the positive relationship among pr cr and rc that was revealed by the correlations and pca seemed to form bundle s5 which was mainly located in areas with natural vegetation high landscape heterogeneity and high es supply the distribution of es demand separated the study area into two large bundles and four smaller bundles bundles d2 representing agricultural areas mixed with natural vegetation and d3 representing rural communities had the highest extent 87 542 and 49 101 ha respectively as well as the highest number of municipalities 99 and 88 municipalities respectively both bundles d2 and d3 had the lowest values of most es demands out of all bundles fig 4b lefkada and zakynthos represented smaller island complexes and included the two smallest bundles d5 and d6 these two bundles each covered 9 of land and contained six mostly mountainous municipalities with demand for livestock activities d5 and plant based resources d6 the urban bundle of es demand d1 was characterized by high human population low elevation and flat relief and had the highest demand for rc followed by fp demand for cr did not characterize any es demand bundle 3 3 predictors of es bundle distribution we applied the rf algorithm to predict the distribution of es supply and demand bundles using 17 socio economic and ecological variables during the step by step implementation of the rf model we selected the most accurate mtry and ntree values tables s2 the results of these tests structured the rf model of es supply with 600 trees and nine predictors sampled for each tree for es demand the rf model was applied using 1000 trees and two predictor variables sampled for each tree the rf analysis correctly classified 64 1 of es supply bundles in the training dataset 70 random sample when considering each es supply bundle the accuracy of classification was higher for the three largest bundles 73 69 and 68 for s5 s3 and s4 and lower for s1 32 which contained 14 of all municipalities despite variability in the accuracy of each supply bundle the individual auc roc curves revealed a classification capability of 80 94 fig 5 furthermore the multi class auc measure showed that the variables used to classify the formed es supply bundles had 90 9 capability overall for es demand the rf model correctly classified 56 of the original bundles resulting in a high classification error rate over 80 for bundles d1 d4 d5 and d6 however bundles d2 and d3 which included 60 of the municipalities on the ionian island were classified correctly with an accuracy of 74 6 and 77 0 respectively in addition multi class auc showed that the rf model for es demand bundles had a classification capability of 79 6 with individual auc roc curve values ranging between 84 7 and 87 5 fig 5 the most important variables for the distribution of es supply bundles were elevation slope landscape heterogeneity shdi landscape connectivity contag and population fig 6 in comparison variables representing elevation slope and population were among the most important for es demand bundles to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the 17 socio ecological variables we applied the rf model to the remaining 30 randomly selected municipalities table 5 the rf model correctly predicted 69 2 of the supply bundles and 58 2 of the demand bundles the rf supply model performed best with respect to bundles s3 and s4 but performed poorly for bundle s1 bundle s3 was characterized by low population size steep slopes and high landscape diversity by contrast s4 contained less elevated areas with higher population size and greater landscape connectivity fig s4 high prediction accuracy was also obtained for demand bundles d2 and d3 the most populated demand bundle see d1 in fig s5 was predicted with an accuracy reaching 60 and 85 based on the rf prediction model and auc roc respectively in contrast bundles d4 d6 had low to zero prediction capability due to the small number of municipalities present in these bundles 22 municipalities in total 4 discussion exploring the associations between es and different socio ecological characteristics offers insights on how important factors contribute to the integrity of the natural environment which is essential for effective landscape planning chen et al 2020 with this knowledge landscape planners and decision makers can identify ecologically vulnerable areas and immediately act to mitigate further deterioration stakeholders recognize the landscape as a relevant scale for interacting with different government agencies zheng et al 2019 in addition administrative boundaries in our case municipal districts are suitable for identifying socio ecological systems in a landscape because management decisions at this level influence the provision and consumption of es raudsepp hearne et al 2010 schirpke et al 2019 however the effect of scale on the analysis of multiple es has been discussed by previous studies dou et al 2018 grêt regamey et al 2014 raudsepp hearne and peterson 2016 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2017 nevertheless a landscape based es assessment that focuses on the socioeconomic and ecological context constitutes a useful framework for balancing the supply and demand of es and for encouraging sustainability in political decisions 4 1 es associations on the supply side most studies have demonstrated trade offs between provisioning and regulating services while regulating and cultural services mostly exhibit synergistic relationships maes et al 2012 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 turner et al 2014 similar results were found in the relationships among es on the ionian islands where the supply of food and livestock mostly exhibited trade offs with the supply of other regulating and cultural services this pattern indicates the low capacity of field crops excluding tree crops and grassland dominated landscapes to deliver multiple es lorilla et al 2018 in comparison the value of highly natural areas in the provision of regulating and cultural es which has been highlighted in previous studies goldenberg et al 2017 explains the synergistic relationship of recreation with climate regulation and plant based resources in our study on the demand side strong correlations were not revealed among es the strongest correlation was obtained for the moderate relationship between the demands for climate regulation and recreation which are connected to the presence of people in urban and rural areas baró et al 2015 lorilla et al 2019 other moderate correlations were obtained in the relationships of nursery with food and livestock provision thus in addition to maintaining natural ecosystems lopoukhine et al 2019 protected areas might be characterized by the high demand of livestock animals to carry out grazing activity if carefully planned livestock farming under a sustainable regime could meet both biodiversity protection and the strengthening of rural communities garnett et al 2013 malek et al 2018 when connecting the supply and demand of es only food and livestock provision exhibited synergies between supply and demand while plant based resources climate regulation nursery and recreation showed trade off relationships thus spatial similarities appear to exist on one side and spatial mismatches on the other lorilla et al 2019 schirpke et al 2019 obtained similar results in which the supply of fuel wood carbon sequestration and outdoor recreation were negatively correlated with their demand indicators the supply of livestock provision exhibited strong negative relationship with the demand for food provision thus grazing activities tend to be mostly situated in regions away from lowland agricultural landscapes such as mountains blondel et al 2010 kefalas et al 2018 4 2 distribution of es bundles and predicting factors five bundles of es supply were delineated in the study area including one low vegetated bundle two agricultural bundles one mixed bundle and one bundle characterized by natural vegetation in line with previous studies conducted in other areas of the mediterranean basin baró et al 2017 quintas soriano et al 2019 zoderer et al 2019 and europe mouchet et al 2017 queiroz et al 2015 turner et al 2014 es formed similar sets of bundles in which urban areas croplands and forests were clearly distinguished thus the characterization of es bundles follows a general pattern regardless of study area turner et al 2014 our results demonstrated that bundles dominated by highly natural areas s5 followed by agroforest areas s4 had a high supply of multiple es supporting previous findings nieto romero et al 2014 in comparison all es demand bundles were characterized by high demand for different es which contrasted the findings of schirpke et al 2019 who documented high demands for multiple es in a single bundle different human activities and ecological processes directly or indirectly affect the configuration of landscapes on mediterranean islands altering the delivery of es aretano et al 2013 balzan et al 2018 tzanopoulos and vogiatzakis 2011 supporting previous studies socio economic and ecological characteristics represent important factors for the formation of es their associations and or their bundles al assaf et al 2016 dittrich et al 2017 huntsinger and oviedo 2014 kabaya et al 2019 lyu et al 2019 mouchet et al 2014 in particular the predictor variables selected to explain es bundles had good accuracy as indicated by the multi class auc values 0 91 for supply and 0 80 for demand in addition the individual auc values for each es bundle presented good to almost perfect classification accuracy demonstrating the discriminatory power of the predictors and rf in explaining es bundles under specific socio ecological conditions previous studies that also used rf to explore the impact of different drivers on es obtained high model accuracy meacham et al 2016 schirpke et al 2019 thus ensemble ml techniques are highly reliable for es assessments based on the rf model the 17 socio economic and ecological factors explained the bundles of es supply which had high synergistic relationships among the estimated es supporting previous studies highly diverse landscapes with mixed ecosystems facilitated synergies among multiple es and hence the supply of a high number of es queiroz et al 2015 an example of this was the mixed ecosystems supply bundle s3 however landscape heterogeneity alone does not imply the supply of multiple es crouzat et al 2015 because it is the composition of vegetation that determines the capacity of ecosystems to provide services yapp et al 2010 for example in the highly natural bundle s5 landscape diversity had the lowest value out of all of the es supply bundles thus homogeneous forests and shrubs positively affect multiple regulating and recreational services felipe lucia et al 2018 in addition agroforest ecosystems provide essential es including food climate regulation and recreation especially when there is a variety of croplands e g olive groves vineyards and arable land lorilla et al 2019 2018 in contrast landscape structure did not explain or predict es demand as most metrics except for number of patches and patch density showed no differences among bundles for both supply and demand population size played a major role in explaining and predicting es bundles specifically population density in the first demand bundle d1 which included the three main towns of corfu lefkada and kefalonia was significantly higher than the other bundles this result reaffirmed that hotspots of es demand are situated in urban and rural areas geijzendorffer et al 2015 in parallel cold spots of es supply exhibited higher population size lorilla et al 2019 similar results though not statistically significant were obtained for the variables of hotel factory and road density previous studies demonstrated that rf improves accuracy compared to other supervised learning methods archer and kimes 2008 because it addresses certain issues such as highly correlated variables and reduces model overfitting strobl et al 2008 this explained the exclusive importance of population density out of all of the socio economic variables another important variable that strongly contributed to the distribution of es bundles was topography including slope and elevation for instance the bundles of es supply presented a general pattern in which three bundles s1 s3 and s5 had higher elevation and steeper slopes while two bundles s2 and s4 had a flatter terrain topography strongly facilitated the identification of regions where specific landscape processes occur on the ionian islands and therefore where land use change might influence es kefalas et al 2019 interestingly slope and elevation represented important predictors of es demand thus topography appears to indicate the location of demands for specific es services e g mountainous or lowlands for example demand for plant based resources expressed as the use of biomass for heating purposes was higher in bundle d6 thus people located in mountainous regions might have a greater need for biomass based heating sources due to the environmental conditions that characterize such areas freppaz et al 2004 the modelling framework followed here provided a comprehensive picture of the contribution of social characteristics environmental conditions and landscape structure to the spatial distribution of es supply and demand although such factors have been reported to affect ecosystem functions and processes few studies have explored the drivers of es supply and demand altogether schirpke et al 2019 sun et al 2020 going beyond the standard procedures to assess the complex relationship between a bundle of es and its determinants our results can guide the operationalization of the es concept in practice in addition the high prediction accuracy demonstrated by the rf model and socio ecological variables offers a baseline of predicting the es supply and demand subject to the dynamic nature of mediterranean ecosystems integrating the different aspects of a functioning socio ecological system cutting edge statistical methods and the es framework can provide further insights into the search for achieving a balance between natural ecosystems and human well being 5 conclusions this study revealed important factors contributing to the distribution of multiple es at the landscape level in which management decisions are more likely to be taken furthermore our findings demonstrate that research on es should incorporate the underlying socio ecological drivers that influence the supply and demand of es to improve our understanding of how future management decisions might impact the diverse mediterranean ecosystems of the ionian islands in particular landscape heterogeneity and connectivity represented important predictors of es bundles located in natural and agricultural areas in contrast urban areas which were strongly linked to es demand were explained by population density also topographic factors such as slope and elevation contributed towards identifying where es bundles tend to be located the ionian islands and in general the mediterranean basin constitute a complex landscape with high biodiversity and cultural value therefore future studies are needed to elucidate the optimal balance between the social and natural environment such knowledge could provide important information for stakeholders and public agencies allowing them to develop sustainable landscape management and planning to safeguard ecological

24881,mediterranean islands are widely recognized as biodiversity hotspots with a long history of human activities shaping multi functional landscapes socioeconomic and environmental factors are among the most important factors driving the creation of diverse landscapes with a high supply of ecosystem services es however these factors along with climate change could also have irreversible consequences on local ecosystems thus this study aimed to reveal the importance of socio ecological factors in shaping es bundles to manage natural resources efficiently and enhance human well being using the ionian islands as a case study we explored the relationships among multiple es including their supply and demand indicators we identified bundles of es to distinguish regions in which supply and demand exhibit different characteristics an ensemble machine learning method random forest rf was used to identify the most important socio ecological variables out of 17 tested that contribute to es bundles our results produced five bundles of es supply and six bundles of es demand the most important variables for the distribution of es supply bundles were landscape heterogeneity elevation slope landscape connectivity and population in comparison variables representing elevation slope and population were among the most important variables contributing to es demand bundles rf exhibited both good classification and predictability which was supported by the accuracy measures our findings demonstrated that research on es should account for underlying socio ecological drivers that influence the supply and demand of es to improve our understanding of the possible impacts of future management decisions regarding the diverse mediterranean landscapes of the ionian islands keywords ecosystem services socio ecological factors predictive mapping random forest landscape planning ionian islands 1 introduction the capacity for ecosystems to provide specific ecosystem services es depends on the interactions between biophysical characteristics and human presence gonzalez ollauri and mickovski 2017 reyers et al 2013 these interactions generate distinct sets of es across diverse landscapes in the form of es bundles bennett et al 2009 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 however human demand as expressed by their activities often creates antagonistic relationships in the supply of multiple es furthermore a drop in the provision of es might contribute to biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecological quality which in turn threaten human well being lyu et al 2018 understanding how different social and ecological factors shape the delivery of es is of primary importance to achieve effective landscape policy and management consequently identifying the importance of various social and ecological drivers for es bundles especially across different landscapes has been gaining increasing attention dittrich et al 2017 lyu et al 2019 meacham et al 2016 schirpke et al 2019 spake et al 2017 the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 defines drivers as natural or human centered factors that directly or indirectly cause changes to an ecosystem direct drivers clearly influence ecosystem processes whereas indirect drivers influence ecosystem processes through altering at least one direct driver to meet the demand for an enhanced understanding of patterns in es advanced computational statistical methods are being increasingly used such as machine learning ml algorithms in general there are two types of ml approaches supervised and unsupervised learning which are achieved using various techniques such techniques include tree based methods artificial neural networks support vector machines genetic algorithm fuzzy inference systems and bayesian methods thessen 2016 willcock et al 2018 decision tree learning is the most popular ml technique used for ecological modeling because it predicts the value of one or several dependent variables debeljak and džeroski 2011 random forest rf is an ensemble of decision trees and is designed to produce accurate predictions through building a set of randomized un pruned decision trees standard classification or regression trees carts breiman 2001 since 2006 many researchers have demonstrated the ability of rf to outperform traditional statistical methods and other ml methods in earth science and ecology applications cutler et al 2007 kampichler et al 2010 mi et al 2017 prasad et al 2006 shearman et al 2019 furthermore rf follows specific rules for tree growing tree combination self testing and post processing it is also robust to overfitting and is considered more stable in the presence of outliers and in very high dimensional parameter spaces than other ml algorithms sarica et al 2017 because of the good predictive ability of rf it is now frequently used to identify the factors driving various environmental processes for example su et al 2018 applied rf to analyze the drivers spatial distribution and risk trends of fires in a forest city of china zaimes et al 2019 used an rf model to show how changes to the vegetation in a riparian forest in greece were linked to environmental variables to understand landscape productivity and changes to vegetation southworth et al 2018 used rf to show how social and biophysical variables drive spatial heterogeneity socio ecological variables are also used in es assessments for instance meacham et al 2016 evaluated different theories of human impact on the pattern of multiple es similarly schirpke et al 2019 used rf to identify important socio ecological drivers in the distribution of es bundles among the variables used to explain the distribution of es land use status and population density were considered the most important in another study the importance of es and biodiversity were assessed in terms of their spatial covariance with society s socio economic profile eigenbrod et al 2017 in all cases rf proved to be a powerful tool for overcoming various challenges that emerge from the variation in ecosystem type and the scale of analysis i e from local and country scaled to highly heterogeneous multi national landscapes mediterranean islands are widely recognized as biodiversity hotspots that have a long history of human activities shaping their multi functional landscapes balzan et al 2018 martín lópez et al 2016 vogiatzakis et al 2016 socioeconomic and environmental factors are among the most important factors driving the creation of these diverse landscapes which also have a high supply of es geri et al 2010 kefalas et al 2019 petanidou et al 2008 however socioeconomic and environmental factors along with climate change might have irreversible consequences on local ecosystems kefalas et al 2018 thus this study aimed to reveal the importance of socio ecological factors in shaping es bundles on the ionian islands through an ensemble ml method specifically we aimed to identify coherent groups of es supply and demand at the landscape scale and determine how different drivers influence the spatial distribution of es bundles our results are expected to facilitate an improved understanding of the importance of sustainably managing natural resources to enhance human well being 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region of ionian islands is located in western greece and is in the east part of the ionian sea fig 1 it encompasses four island complexes each of which contains a main island namely corfu lefkada kefalonia and zakynthos the local climate is mediterranean consisting of mild humid winters and warm dry summers agriculture and tourism are among the most important sectors sustaining the economy of ionian islands where croplands especially olive orchards cover approximately 36 of land kefalas et al 2018 despite intense human pressure mass tourism intensive agriculture and frequent fire events forests and woodlands occupy a large extent of the ionian islands 31 forested areas kefalas et al 2019 the study area supports a population of 207 855 people concentrated in urban and lowland regions lorilla et al 2019 overall the ionian islands are characterized by diverse ecosystems with high natural and cultural value facilitating the delivery of es lorilla et al 2018 2 2 data preparation and analysis the es studied were chosen so as to reflect in a balanced way the supply and demand in one hand and a representative mix of es relevant to the area both in social and environmental terms in the other therefore this study focused on six es including three provisioning services food provision fp livestock provision lp plant based resources pr two regulating and maintenance services climate regulation cr maintenance of nursery populations and habitats ns and one cultural service recreation rc data availability and the feasibility of data manipulation were also important criteria in the selection of specific indicators and mapping models agricultural activities including both crops and livestock production contribute to the livelihoods of rural populations providing income and to some extent covering household needs in this sense food provisioning services in the context of reliance on the agricultural sector play a crucial role in the rural economy of small islands balzan et al 2018 climate regulation can support the provision of natural resources and therefore ensure the delivery of other essential services although the relevant mechanisms operate at much higher geographic scales it is a matter of high importance throughout the globe as carbon sequestration is a process that can be meaningfully assessed at various scales recreation in the form of eco tourism depends on the highly valued by tourists and locals naturalness of landscapes census data reveal that rural communities of the ionian islands use biomass as their main source of heating purposes however insufficient management of timber extraction may reduce forest diversity which in turn risk the integrity of ecosystem functioning finally the ionian islands encompass 14 protected areas included in the natura 2000 network while intense human pressure may negatively affect the ability of sensitive ecosystems to maintain nursery populations and habitats the significance of mediterranean islands as biodiversity hotspots also greatly exceeds their geographical borders information on es supply and demand have been delineated by previous studies conducted on the ionian islands lorilla et al 2018 lorilla et al 2019 in this study lp supply and demand pr demand and ns demand were added to provide six es supply and six es demand indicators for lp we used grazing land cover types as the supply indicator and livestock animals as the demand indicator assuming that the number of reared animals could be used to express the demand of society for livestock provision syrbe and grunewald 2017 demand for plant based energy resources was estimated using social data on the percentage of households consuming biomass for heating purposes for ns we used the percentage of land under any protection policy assuming that protected areas have high demand for conservation and maintenance of biodiversity and es which can maintain human well being palomo et al 2011 table 1 provides an overview all of the indicators that were used to map supply and demand of the selected services es were mapped at a pixel resolution of 30 m except for those using data from socioeconomic censuses which were only available at the level of municipal districts to identify the relationships between es and socio ecological factors all variables were aggregated to a common spatial unit municipality level given by the hellenic statistical authority 2011 in which we estimated the average value using the r package spatialeco version 1 2 0 evans and ram 2015 the initial dataset included 278 administrative units for the ionian islands from which three municipalities representing three small islets were excluded from the analysis due to missing es and socio ecological data 2 2 1 selection of socio ecological variables based on the published literature we selected 26 predictor variables related to human influence environmental parameters and landscape structure a correlation analysis spearman s ρ was run in order to detect strongly correlated pairs of variables in 10 cases high ρ values were found and only one variable was retained a total of 17 variables was retained and thus formed the basis of the subsequent analyses table 2 also appendix table s1 the rationale behind the choice of variables was to create a balanced mix of social and environmental variables reflecting representative aspects of the local es while ensuring data availability the demographic population density employment rate and artificial infrastructure variables hotel density factory density and road density were selected for their impact on ecological degradation as a result of socioeconomic and urban development meacham et al 2016 human population growth has been associated with substantial land use changes which in turn directly affect the supply of es elmhagen et al 2015 also along with population growth increasing employment rates is an index of economic activity which is associated both with enhanced material flows infrastructure development such as touristic accommodations and roads place high pressure on ecosystems by taking up space through sealing and thus inhibiting ecosystem functions and generating high demand for food water supply water usage and wastewater discharges kefalas et al 2019 pinto et al 2013 plieninger et al 2016 climate conditions directly affect natural ecosystems and the services they provide impacting human well being key climatic parameters that affect ecological systems include annual mean temperature and precipitation nelson et al 2006 the selection of topographic factors elevation slope was supported by the assumption that the isolation and accessibility of land constrain the distribution of human activities and their impact on local ecosystems kefalas et al 2019 meacham et al 2016 along with the aforementioned variables aspect constitutes a key topographic feature that affects soil and microclimate which in turn influence the composition of vegetation and therefore determines the supply of es bennie et al 2006 yapp et al 2010 zhu et al 2019 landscape structure and configuration resulting from complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors as well as land use choices made by society have a significant influence on the supply of es and hence human well being herrero jáuregui et al 2019 mitchell et al 2015 in this study we calculated metrics of fragmentation np division connectivity pd contag iji and heterogeneity shdi pr at the landscape level landscape fragmentation has shown negative effects on es supply whilst landscape connectivity is expected to substantially influence the provision of es mitchell et al 2013 2015 in parallel understanding the relationships between landscape heterogeneity and the provisioning of es within different landscapes is critical for future land management turner et al 2013 this aspect is particularly important for mediterranean landscapes that are highly mosaic in nature due to both rugged terrain and historical land use detsis et al 2010 kefalas et al 2019 2 2 2 identifying bundles and predictor variables of es each es map was standardized to a scale between 0 and 1 based on the minimum and maximum values higher values correspond to greater magnitude of services the framework for identifying predictor variables and their importance in forming es bundles consisted of two main parts the bundle identification framework and the random forest model fig 2 following lorilla et al 2018 the bundle identification framework was used to distinguish bundles of es supply and demand first we performed spearman correlation tests on pairs of es supply and es demand to reveal the relationship among all services the strength of the relationship was determined using correlation coefficients which were classified into three levels cui et al 2019 strong relationship ρ 0 5 moderate relationship 0 5 ρ 0 3 and week relationship ρ 0 3 second principal component analysis pca was performed to identify es variability explained by the pc axes the two analyses were used to evaluate the relationships among es in terms of synergies and trade offs at the landscape level third ward s hierarchical clustering method along with euclidean distance was used to create sets of es that spatially overlapped in a certain way within a given area i e es bundles the optimal number of clusters was determined by the silhouette method which computes the average silhouette of observations for different values of clusters kaufman and rousseeuw 2008 this measure delineated five optimal clusters for es supply and six optimal clusters for demand the categorization of the study area in es bundles was used as the dependent variable in the rf models because we aimed to explain the distribution of five and six es bundles i e categorical data we employed the classification rf model over the regression rf model which can only be applied to continuous data a random forest is a classifier consisting of a collection of tree structured classifiers h x θ k k 1 where the θ k are independent identically distributed random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at input x definition from breiman 2001 when employing an rf model the first step involves creating training sets called bootstraps from a random resampling of the original dataset observations of the original dataset that do not occur in a bootstrap sample are called out of bag oob observations cutler et al 2007 we created the training dataset from 70 of randomly selected samples of the initial dataset 184 municipalities while the remaining 30 consisted of the test dataset 91 municipalities the rf algorithm consists of the main model and the prediction model the main rf model was applied to the training dataset and was used to identify the importance of predictor variables in the classification of the study area in specific bundles the prediction model was applied using the results of the main rf model to evaluate the accuracy of using socio ecological variables to predict es bundles in the test dataset the second step is to prepare the rf model properly when building rf there are three tuning parameters of interest catucci and scardi 2020 1 the number of randomly selected predictors at each tree mtry 2 the minimum number of records contained in leaf to stop splitting nodesize 3 and the number of trees ntrees careful tuning of these parameters can prevent extended computations with little gain in error reduction segal 2003 breiman 2001 showed that by setting the nodesize parameter to 1 the model produces good accuracy for the other two parameters mtry and ntrees we tested different values and the ones with the highest accuracy were selected as more appropriate for use in the rf model the tests were applied separately for the outputs of es supply bundles and es demand bundles thus the parameters for the supply rf model differed to those of the demand rf model table s2 because multiple selections for ntrees showed the same level of accuracy we estimated the multi roc curve to select the number of trees this measure facilitated the selection of the optimal number of trees with the highest ability to distinguish es bundles the third step consists of running the rf model to obtain the oob error rate and the plot showing variable importance oob samples are used to calculate an unbiased error rate eliminating the need for cross validation prasad et al 2006 the concept of variable importance is an implicit selection feature performed by rf with a random subspace methodology it is assessed by the gini impurity criterion index the gini index is a measure of the prediction power of variables in regression or classification based on the principle of impurity reduction it is non parametric and therefore does not rely on data belonging to a particular type of distribution for a given training set t selecting one case municipality at random and allocating it to bundle bi the gini index is written as pal 2005 g i n i j i f c i t t f c j t t where f ci t t is the probability that the selected case belonging to class bi the gini index should be maximized thus a low gini i e a greater decrease in gini indicates that a particular predictor is more important in separating data into classes the gini index can be used to rank the importance of predictor variables for a classification problem in ml it is essential to measure the performance of a classification problem while the oob estimator is commonly considered as an acceptable proxy of the performance of an rf model for multi class classification problems the auc roc area under the curve receiver operating characteristics should be employed as an alternative performance measure fawcett 2006 hand and till 2001 probst and boulesteix 2018 therefore we also estimated the multi class auc roc to reveal the classification capability of the selected variables roc is a probability curve while auc represents the degree or measure of separability auc values range from 0 5 to 1 0 where values between 0 50 and 0 70 indicate low model accuracy between 0 70 and 0 90 indicate moderate model accuracy and over 0 90 indicate high model accuracy therefore an auc value of 1 0 indicates a high capability of the model to recognize different classes nemes and hartel 2010 in ecological studies models with an auc value greater than 0 8 are considered to have good classification accuracy humphries et al 2018 the final step is to evaluate the rf model and make the prediction the prediction is applied on the test dataset using the rf model the outputs of the prediction model are the confusion matrix which indicates the correctly classified bundles and the accuracy of the prediction in addition we also estimated the auc roc for each es bundle maps were created using the free and open source geographic information system qgis madeira version 3 4 3 all data analyses were conducted in the software r version 3 5 0 and r studio version 1 1 453 the r packages used to identify es bundles consisted of rgdal version 1 4 6 bivand et al 2019 hmisc version 4 2 0 harrell and dunpont 2019 factoextra version 1 0 5 kassambara and mundt 2017 factominer version 1 42 husson et al 2019 tidyverse version 1 2 1 wickham 2017 and cluster version 2 1 0 rousseeuw et al 2019 the rf model and auc roc tests were implemented in the r packages randomforest version 4 6 14 liaw and wiener 2018 caret version 6 0 84 kuhn 2019 and proc version 1 15 3 robin et al 2019 3 results the spatial distribution of es for both supply and demand showed variation across the study area and among services fig s1 s2 in general the supply of most es presented different patterns to demand except for fp and lp for which supply and demand overlapped spatially high values of cr and rc supply were evident in mountainous and naturally vegetated regions while high demand for these services were located in urbanized municipalities pr and ns did not exhibit any specific patterns in all cases higher es supply extended over large regions whereas higher es demand was concentrated in few municipalities see demand for lp pr ns and rc fig s2 3 1 es relationships correlation tests showed variation in the direction and strength of es relationships table 3 es supply pairs had the highest number of strong correlations four highly correlated pairs fp and lp mostly had negative relationships indicating that these services inhibit the presence of other es the supply of ns showed non significant correlations with other es from all categories except for lp with which it had a moderately positive relationship ρ 0 30 in comparison rc exhibited significantly strong positive relationships with pr and cr and a moderately negative relationship with fp in contrast only weak and moderate correlations were found in the demand for all es the demand for ns expressed by the amount of protected areas had negative and positive relationship with the demand for fp and lp respectively unsurprisingly demand for cr and rc showed a positive relationship as both demands are related to the presence of people out of the 36 supply demand es pairs 75 were significantly correlated with 18 low correlated pairs six moderately correlated pairs and three highly correlated pairs the spatial mismatch between the distribution of supply and demand for most es pr cr ns rc was also validated by their correlations which indicated weak negative correlations ρ 0 25 in comparison the relationship between supply and demand of fp and lp showed strong ρ 0 93 and moderate ρ 0 36 positive correlations respectively other strong correlations in supply demand pairs were those of lp supply fp demand and pr supply lp demand with both pairs having a negative relationship similar results were obtained by the pca fig 3 the first two axes explained 49 of total es variability table s2 and fig s3 with two main gradients the first horizontal axis shows a gradient from natural vegetation mostly meadows to agricultural regions the former presented a supply of lp and demand for ns and lp while the latter were characterized by both the supply and demand of fp in comparison the second vertical axis shows a gradient from urban regions to highly natural areas mostly forests the former had a high demands for cr and rc while the latter was characterized by a high supply of rc cr and pr beyond the first two axes pc1 and pc2 pc3 and pc4 with eigenvalues over 1 explained 12 7 and 10 7 respectively of es variability with a 72 cumulative percentage of variance 3 2 identification of es bundles cluster analysis indicated five bundles for es supply and six bundles for es demand fig 4 a for both es supply and demand some islands did not present the full set of supply or demand bundles for example four out of five supply bundles and four out of six demand bundles were identified for kefalonia out of the es supply bundles s4 representing olive orchards contained the highest number of municipalities 27 followed by s5 24 and s3 21 representing highly natural vegetation and mixed ecosystems respectively however s5 covered 31 of the region followed by s1 21 representing sparsely vegetated areas with low es supply and s3 20 characterized by the provision of multiple es fig 4b and table 4 the cropland related bundle s2 characterized by high food provisioning service was the smallest in terms of the number of municipalities and percentage of land area by contrast the other agricultural bundle s4 had high supply values for most es fp pr ns and rc the positive relationship among pr cr and rc that was revealed by the correlations and pca seemed to form bundle s5 which was mainly located in areas with natural vegetation high landscape heterogeneity and high es supply the distribution of es demand separated the study area into two large bundles and four smaller bundles bundles d2 representing agricultural areas mixed with natural vegetation and d3 representing rural communities had the highest extent 87 542 and 49 101 ha respectively as well as the highest number of municipalities 99 and 88 municipalities respectively both bundles d2 and d3 had the lowest values of most es demands out of all bundles fig 4b lefkada and zakynthos represented smaller island complexes and included the two smallest bundles d5 and d6 these two bundles each covered 9 of land and contained six mostly mountainous municipalities with demand for livestock activities d5 and plant based resources d6 the urban bundle of es demand d1 was characterized by high human population low elevation and flat relief and had the highest demand for rc followed by fp demand for cr did not characterize any es demand bundle 3 3 predictors of es bundle distribution we applied the rf algorithm to predict the distribution of es supply and demand bundles using 17 socio economic and ecological variables during the step by step implementation of the rf model we selected the most accurate mtry and ntree values tables s2 the results of these tests structured the rf model of es supply with 600 trees and nine predictors sampled for each tree for es demand the rf model was applied using 1000 trees and two predictor variables sampled for each tree the rf analysis correctly classified 64 1 of es supply bundles in the training dataset 70 random sample when considering each es supply bundle the accuracy of classification was higher for the three largest bundles 73 69 and 68 for s5 s3 and s4 and lower for s1 32 which contained 14 of all municipalities despite variability in the accuracy of each supply bundle the individual auc roc curves revealed a classification capability of 80 94 fig 5 furthermore the multi class auc measure showed that the variables used to classify the formed es supply bundles had 90 9 capability overall for es demand the rf model correctly classified 56 of the original bundles resulting in a high classification error rate over 80 for bundles d1 d4 d5 and d6 however bundles d2 and d3 which included 60 of the municipalities on the ionian island were classified correctly with an accuracy of 74 6 and 77 0 respectively in addition multi class auc showed that the rf model for es demand bundles had a classification capability of 79 6 with individual auc roc curve values ranging between 84 7 and 87 5 fig 5 the most important variables for the distribution of es supply bundles were elevation slope landscape heterogeneity shdi landscape connectivity contag and population fig 6 in comparison variables representing elevation slope and population were among the most important for es demand bundles to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the 17 socio ecological variables we applied the rf model to the remaining 30 randomly selected municipalities table 5 the rf model correctly predicted 69 2 of the supply bundles and 58 2 of the demand bundles the rf supply model performed best with respect to bundles s3 and s4 but performed poorly for bundle s1 bundle s3 was characterized by low population size steep slopes and high landscape diversity by contrast s4 contained less elevated areas with higher population size and greater landscape connectivity fig s4 high prediction accuracy was also obtained for demand bundles d2 and d3 the most populated demand bundle see d1 in fig s5 was predicted with an accuracy reaching 60 and 85 based on the rf prediction model and auc roc respectively in contrast bundles d4 d6 had low to zero prediction capability due to the small number of municipalities present in these bundles 22 municipalities in total 4 discussion exploring the associations between es and different socio ecological characteristics offers insights on how important factors contribute to the integrity of the natural environment which is essential for effective landscape planning chen et al 2020 with this knowledge landscape planners and decision makers can identify ecologically vulnerable areas and immediately act to mitigate further deterioration stakeholders recognize the landscape as a relevant scale for interacting with different government agencies zheng et al 2019 in addition administrative boundaries in our case municipal districts are suitable for identifying socio ecological systems in a landscape because management decisions at this level influence the provision and consumption of es raudsepp hearne et al 2010 schirpke et al 2019 however the effect of scale on the analysis of multiple es has been discussed by previous studies dou et al 2018 grêt regamey et al 2014 raudsepp hearne and peterson 2016 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2017 nevertheless a landscape based es assessment that focuses on the socioeconomic and ecological context constitutes a useful framework for balancing the supply and demand of es and for encouraging sustainability in political decisions 4 1 es associations on the supply side most studies have demonstrated trade offs between provisioning and regulating services while regulating and cultural services mostly exhibit synergistic relationships maes et al 2012 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 turner et al 2014 similar results were found in the relationships among es on the ionian islands where the supply of food and livestock mostly exhibited trade offs with the supply of other regulating and cultural services this pattern indicates the low capacity of field crops excluding tree crops and grassland dominated landscapes to deliver multiple es lorilla et al 2018 in comparison the value of highly natural areas in the provision of regulating and cultural es which has been highlighted in previous studies goldenberg et al 2017 explains the synergistic relationship of recreation with climate regulation and plant based resources in our study on the demand side strong correlations were not revealed among es the strongest correlation was obtained for the moderate relationship between the demands for climate regulation and recreation which are connected to the presence of people in urban and rural areas baró et al 2015 lorilla et al 2019 other moderate correlations were obtained in the relationships of nursery with food and livestock provision thus in addition to maintaining natural ecosystems lopoukhine et al 2019 protected areas might be characterized by the high demand of livestock animals to carry out grazing activity if carefully planned livestock farming under a sustainable regime could meet both biodiversity protection and the strengthening of rural communities garnett et al 2013 malek et al 2018 when connecting the supply and demand of es only food and livestock provision exhibited synergies between supply and demand while plant based resources climate regulation nursery and recreation showed trade off relationships thus spatial similarities appear to exist on one side and spatial mismatches on the other lorilla et al 2019 schirpke et al 2019 obtained similar results in which the supply of fuel wood carbon sequestration and outdoor recreation were negatively correlated with their demand indicators the supply of livestock provision exhibited strong negative relationship with the demand for food provision thus grazing activities tend to be mostly situated in regions away from lowland agricultural landscapes such as mountains blondel et al 2010 kefalas et al 2018 4 2 distribution of es bundles and predicting factors five bundles of es supply were delineated in the study area including one low vegetated bundle two agricultural bundles one mixed bundle and one bundle characterized by natural vegetation in line with previous studies conducted in other areas of the mediterranean basin baró et al 2017 quintas soriano et al 2019 zoderer et al 2019 and europe mouchet et al 2017 queiroz et al 2015 turner et al 2014 es formed similar sets of bundles in which urban areas croplands and forests were clearly distinguished thus the characterization of es bundles follows a general pattern regardless of study area turner et al 2014 our results demonstrated that bundles dominated by highly natural areas s5 followed by agroforest areas s4 had a high supply of multiple es supporting previous findings nieto romero et al 2014 in comparison all es demand bundles were characterized by high demand for different es which contrasted the findings of schirpke et al 2019 who documented high demands for multiple es in a single bundle different human activities and ecological processes directly or indirectly affect the configuration of landscapes on mediterranean islands altering the delivery of es aretano et al 2013 balzan et al 2018 tzanopoulos and vogiatzakis 2011 supporting previous studies socio economic and ecological characteristics represent important factors for the formation of es their associations and or their bundles al assaf et al 2016 dittrich et al 2017 huntsinger and oviedo 2014 kabaya et al 2019 lyu et al 2019 mouchet et al 2014 in particular the predictor variables selected to explain es bundles had good accuracy as indicated by the multi class auc values 0 91 for supply and 0 80 for demand in addition the individual auc values for each es bundle presented good to almost perfect classification accuracy demonstrating the discriminatory power of the predictors and rf in explaining es bundles under specific socio ecological conditions previous studies that also used rf to explore the impact of different drivers on es obtained high model accuracy meacham et al 2016 schirpke et al 2019 thus ensemble ml techniques are highly reliable for es assessments based on the rf model the 17 socio economic and ecological factors explained the bundles of es supply which had high synergistic relationships among the estimated es supporting previous studies highly diverse landscapes with mixed ecosystems facilitated synergies among multiple es and hence the supply of a high number of es queiroz et al 2015 an example of this was the mixed ecosystems supply bundle s3 however landscape heterogeneity alone does not imply the supply of multiple es crouzat et al 2015 because it is the composition of vegetation that determines the capacity of ecosystems to provide services yapp et al 2010 for example in the highly natural bundle s5 landscape diversity had the lowest value out of all of the es supply bundles thus homogeneous forests and shrubs positively affect multiple regulating and recreational services felipe lucia et al 2018 in addition agroforest ecosystems provide essential es including food climate regulation and recreation especially when there is a variety of croplands e g olive groves vineyards and arable land lorilla et al 2019 2018 in contrast landscape structure did not explain or predict es demand as most metrics except for number of patches and patch density showed no differences among bundles for both supply and demand population size played a major role in explaining and predicting es bundles specifically population density in the first demand bundle d1 which included the three main towns of corfu lefkada and kefalonia was significantly higher than the other bundles this result reaffirmed that hotspots of es demand are situated in urban and rural areas geijzendorffer et al 2015 in parallel cold spots of es supply exhibited higher population size lorilla et al 2019 similar results though not statistically significant were obtained for the variables of hotel factory and road density previous studies demonstrated that rf improves accuracy compared to other supervised learning methods archer and kimes 2008 because it addresses certain issues such as highly correlated variables and reduces model overfitting strobl et al 2008 this explained the exclusive importance of population density out of all of the socio economic variables another important variable that strongly contributed to the distribution of es bundles was topography including slope and elevation for instance the bundles of es supply presented a general pattern in which three bundles s1 s3 and s5 had higher elevation and steeper slopes while two bundles s2 and s4 had a flatter terrain topography strongly facilitated the identification of regions where specific landscape processes occur on the ionian islands and therefore where land use change might influence es kefalas et al 2019 interestingly slope and elevation represented important predictors of es demand thus topography appears to indicate the location of demands for specific es services e g mountainous or lowlands for example demand for plant based resources expressed as the use of biomass for heating purposes was higher in bundle d6 thus people located in mountainous regions might have a greater need for biomass based heating sources due to the environmental conditions that characterize such areas freppaz et al 2004 the modelling framework followed here provided a comprehensive picture of the contribution of social characteristics environmental conditions and landscape structure to the spatial distribution of es supply and demand although such factors have been reported to affect ecosystem functions and processes few studies have explored the drivers of es supply and demand altogether schirpke et al 2019 sun et al 2020 going beyond the standard procedures to assess the complex relationship between a bundle of es and its determinants our results can guide the operationalization of the es concept in practice in addition the high prediction accuracy demonstrated by the rf model and socio ecological variables offers a baseline of predicting the es supply and demand subject to the dynamic nature of mediterranean ecosystems integrating the different aspects of a functioning socio ecological system cutting edge statistical methods and the es framework can provide further insights into the search for achieving a balance between natural ecosystems and human well being 5 conclusions this study revealed important factors contributing to the distribution of multiple es at the landscape level in which management decisions are more likely to be taken furthermore our findings demonstrate that research on es should incorporate the underlying socio ecological drivers that influence the supply and demand of es to improve our understanding of how future management decisions might impact the diverse mediterranean ecosystems of the ionian islands in particular landscape heterogeneity and connectivity represented important predictors of es bundles located in natural and agricultural areas in contrast urban areas which were strongly linked to es demand were explained by population density also topographic factors such as slope and elevation contributed towards identifying where es bundles tend to be located the ionian islands and in general the mediterranean basin constitute a complex landscape with high biodiversity and cultural value therefore future studies are needed to elucidate the optimal balance between the social and natural environment such knowledge could provide important information for stakeholders and public agencies allowing them to develop sustainable landscape management and planning to safeguard ecological

24882,development of joint species distribution models allows for improved and simultaneous estimates of various metrics for evaluating spatio temporal patterns in multi population dynamics as essential tools for promoting ecosystem management and conservation however such tools are rarely used to simultaneously evaluate the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple fisheries targeted populations in an ecosystem this study aims to fill this gap with a case study of the bohai sea in china a joint dynamic species distribution model was developed to estimate the distributions of 13 major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea using data from bottom trawl surveys conducted in spring during 2014 to 2018 we calculated the spatial ranges i e the distance within which correlation coefficients between locations are always larger than 10 for spatial variation and spatio temporal variation in species specific densities of this fished community the model based density estimates for these populations were used to calculate the mean center of density effective area occupied and total abundance index for each population by year results showed that the spatial ranges were respectively 84 km and 94 km for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the distributions of targeted populations suggesting large variability in the community structure at a distance 100 km fish populations showed larger fluctuations in the mean center of density and effective area occupied than crustaceans and cephalopods while most of the 13 populations tended to shift northeastward to deeper waters over the five years additionally 12 of the 13 populations showed a sharp increase in total abundance in the spring of 2017 under the force of increasingly conservational fisheries management since 2017 in 2018 the total abundance indices remained high for most fish populations but showed an abrupt decrease for all six of the invertebrate populations these results indicate that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified ecosystem could differ in their responses to habitat changes management or other human activities in a rapid manner suggesting a demand for adaptive fisheries management at system scale for degraded declining ecosystems worldwide keywords joint species distribution model simultaneous evaluation spatio temporal dynamics multi population 1 introduction fish crustaceans and cephalopods are major sources of marine fisheries catches in many of the world s ecosystems understanding spatio temporal dynamics of major fisheries targeted populations within an ecosystem context is essential for promoting sustainable management of fisheries resources at fishery and ecosystem scales conventional population dynamics in fisheries science usually focus on temporal dynamics in population abundance recruitment and sustainable yield which have long been the mainstay of fisheries stock assessments hilborn and walters 1992 recently spatial dynamics among fish populations i e time varying spatial patterns in the distribution and abundance has attracted extensive consideration guan et al 2017 thorson et al 2016b as most marine fish populations have complex spatial structures kritzer and sale 2004 and often show distributional shifts in response to climate induced habitat changes intense fishing or other anthropogenic influences e g ames 2004 nye et al 2009 ames and lichter 2013 hayden et al 2015 a variety of metrics remain in use for evaluating spatio temporal dynamics of fished populations most commonly relative abundance indices habitat area mean center of density boundaries of distribution abundance and habitat associations e g mean or median temperatures depth range and area occupied nye et al 2009 perry et al 2005 swain and benoît 2006 traditional estimation of these metrics generally makes direct use of arithmetic means from fishery independent survey data which cannot account for potential impacts of spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort pinsky et al 2013 swain and benoît 2006 these metrics can now be estimated more precisely and accurately by hindcasting density distributions of target populations from single species distribution models based on survey data cao et al 2017 guan et al 2017 thorson et al 2016b in this context the development of a joint species distribution model would enable improved and simultaneous estimates of spatio temporal dynamic metrics for multiple fishery populations in a given ecosystem hitherto such model based estimates have not been made despite the availability of a new spatial factor analysis sfa tool which has become well established for estimating joint species distributions thorson 2019 thorson et al 2015 fisheries management involving ecosystem based approaches requires simultaneous evaluation of spatio temporal dynamics for multiple populations in an ecosystem ocean warming as a significant phenomenon of climate change has impacted marine primary productivity biodiversity and fisheries in different regions worldwide e g cheung et al 2010 leitão et al 2018 liang et al 2018 wabnitz et al 2018 moreover abrupt changes in species abundance community composition and trophic organization as the consequences of environmental forcing fishing or invasive species have occurred in multiple marine ecosystems including the southern and northern benguela cury and shannon 2004 heymans and tomczak 2016 the gulf of alaska heymans et al 2007 the gulf of maine zhang and chen 2007 and the baltic sea kotta et al 2018 this suggests that fisheries management should move towards a more effective ecosystem based approach emphasizing the importance of simultaneously understanding spatio temporal dynamics for major fisheries targeted populations the bohai sea is the only enclosed sea in china with an average water depth of 18 m and freshwater discharges into three major coastal bays i e liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay from more than 40 rivers fig 1 it occupies a region within the large yellow sea marine ecosystem in which the mean sea surface temperature sst rose by 0 67 c during 1982 2006 belkin 2009 this rate of warming is much higher than the global mean rate over the same period belkin 2009 moreover with the general acceleration of ocean warming cheng et al 2019 rapid warming continues in the bohai sea especially during the months of may and august fig 2 fishing effort has increased exponentially in the bohai sea since the 1950s and its curtailment has become critical because coastal bays inside this ecosystem are crucial spawning and nursery grounds for various fish and invertebrate populations of the yellow sea and the bohai sea liu et al 1990 under the combined impact of human activities and climatic changes fishery resources in this ecosystem have shown declines in biomass species richness and diversity since the early 2000s jin 2004 zhang et al 2007 after 2009 all fisheries except those using monofilament gill nets or jigs were prohibited in the bohai sea from june 1st to september 1st each year to protect spawning adults and improve population recruitment as most fished populations in this ecosystem breed during the period from may to july this summer fishing moratorium is believed to have contributed to consistently high annual production among non selective capture fisheries in the bohai sea in the 2010s in light of its effectiveness since 2017 this seasonal suspension of fishing activities has been extended by one month starting from may 1st annually meanwhile the total output control policy for marine capture fisheries in china mandates an annual decrease in production by at least 5 for each coastal province from 2015 to 2020 ministry of agriculture 2017 the bohai sea has become a well known example of a marine ecosystem characterized by increased net primary production but reduced fisheries productivity a simplified depauperate food web with major food chains becoming shorter or broken and energy transfer through the food web now primarily dependent on detritus jin 2004 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2007 we present a case study of the bohai sea ecosystem that simultaneously evaluates the spatio temporal dynamics of 13 major fisheries targeted populations during their peak spawning periods i e may to june of 2014 2018 implications of changes in spatio temporal dynamics are discussed from ecological climatic induced change and fisheries management perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey data we identified 13 biomass dominant populations of key exploited species in the bohai sea which included seven fish species four crustacean species and two species of cephalopods table 1 of these species black rockfish s schlegelii and sand shrimp c affinis prefer colder waters than the others only two such cold water species are identified as similar species are few in this warm temperate ecosystem these identified species are representative enough to evaluate the hypothesis that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified ecosystem differ in their responses to habitat changes management or other human activities in a rapid manner data were obtained from annual bottom trawl surveys conducted by yellow sea fisheries research institute ysfri in the bohai sea during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 these surveys were confined to daylight hours and followed a fixed station sampling design with one station at each intersection of grid of 0 25 in longitude x 0 25 in latitude the same pair of bottom trawlers with identical gear types and consistent sampling protocols were used in these surveys to maintain consistent catchability over time this pair of bottom trawlers are general fishing vessels with an engine power of around 200 horsepower and trawl nets of the same commercial size specifically the trawl nets have a cod end mesh size of 2 cm a headline height of 5 6 m and a distance of 22 6 m between wings in addition the coverage of these surveys generally extended over most of the bohai sea except for inshore waters that are often occupied by stationary fishing devices or not deep enough for bottom trawling of survey vessels the study area fig 1 was restricted to ensure common coverage of the annual surveys at most stations the trawl nets were towed at an average speed of 3 knots for 60 min in accordance with the survey design exceptions occurred at some nearshore stations where time was reduced to 30 min to avoid collisions with other fishing boats or stationary fishing devices this variation in tow duration is calibrated in the model by accounting for the area swept per tow for each station catches of nektonic species were separated by species and individuals in each sample were counted and weighed catch per trawl by species in number and biomass were recorded on the spot along with the depth temperature and salinity at the beginning and end of each shot data used in this study were catches per trawl in biomass bi kg for each of the 13 identified populations for a total of 210 successful trawls undertaken within the study area as well as spatial information i e the universal transverse mercator utm coordinates at the beginning and ending locations for each trawl 2 2 joint dynamic species distribution model a joint dynamic species distribution model thorson et al 2016a 2015 was developed to simultaneously estimate the distribution of the 13 populations in the bohai sea spanning the spring seasons of 2014 2018 this is a two stage model where the probability distribution for survey catch rate i e catch per area swept bi bi wi data for the ith sample is decomposed into two components or sub models representing i the probability of non zero catches p si ci ti for species ci at location si in year ti and ii the expected catch rate λ si ci ti given that species ci is captured therefore we specify p r b i 1 p s i c i t i p s i c i t i g a m m a b σ c 2 λ s i c i t i σ c 2 i f b i 0 i f b i 0 where wi denotes the area swept in km2 for sample i gamma x α β is a gamma probability distribution function for value x given a shape parameter of α and a scale parameter of β and σc is the coefficient of variance for positive catch rate which varies among species for each trawl we used the utm coordinates at the beginning and ending locations to calculate the trawling distance and then multiplied it by the distance between wings of the trawl net to estimate the area swept area swept was then included in the model to account for differences in trawling durations positive catch rate data for fishes are usually considered as approximating lognormal or gamma distributions thorson 2019 in this study the model with gamma distributions aic 367 74 fitted the positive catch rate data better for the 13 targeted species when compared to that with lognormal distributions aic 535 11 in each sub model spatial factor analysis sfa was utilized to model variations in p si ci ti or λ si ci ti sfa uses a reduced number of latent unobserved variables to represent unobserved environmental and biotic variables in a large number of species thorson et al 2015 each latent variable is estimated as a gaussian random field that varies over space such that nearby locations are averagely more similar than geographically distant locations therefore the modeling explains species distributions via latent variables instead of measured environmental or biotic variables theoretically the number of latent variables can be any non negative integer no larger than 13 i e the number of species in the model of this study there are three latent variables representing spatial spatio temporal variation in probability of non zero catches and positive catch rate model with two latent variables does not fit the data well as it explains much less of the spatio temporal variation in the distributions of targeted populations in addition models with more than three latent variables do not converge because they have more covariance parameters to estimate and our sampling data are insufficient to enable this estimation specifically we approximated variations in p si ci ti using a logit linked linear predictor l o g i t p s i c i t i β 1 c i t i f 1 3 l ω 1 c i f ω 1 s i f f 1 3 l ε 1 c i f ε 1 s i f t i where β 1 ci ti is an intercept for species ci and year ti ω 1 si f represents spatial variation that is constant over time at location si for latent variable f of three latent variables representing spatial variation and l ω1 ci f denotes the loadings matrix generating spatial covariation among species for this linear predictor similarly ɛ1 si f ti stands for spatio temporal variation that varies among modeled time intervals for each of three latent variables and l ɛ1 ci f denotes the loadings matrix that generates spatio temporal covariation for this predictor in addition expected catch rates λ si ci ti were approximated with a log linked linear predictor log λ s i c i t i β 2 c i t i f 1 3 l ω 2 c i f ω 2 s i f where the variables and parameters are defined similarly as above except replacing subscript 1 with 2 the spatio temporal component was removed from this sub model after initial trials as it hindered model convergence for this joint dynamic species distribution model we divided up the study area within the bohai sea into small patches using 50 nodes generated based on the spatial distribution of all trawls through the k means method hartigan and wong 1979 the location of sample i in the model was simply determined as the location of its closest node i e si the model was fitted and validated using the vast package thorson and barnett 2017 in the r program subsequently we used this model to estimate density distributions of the 13 populations in the study area during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 the predicted density in kg km2 of species c at location s at year t was estimated as follow d s c t p s c t λ s c t 2 3 evaluating spatio temporal dynamics based on estimated parameters of the joint dynamic species distribution model we calculated the spatial ranges i e the distance within which correlation coefficients between locations are always larger than 10 for spatial variation and spatio temporal variation in species specific densities of this community to evaluate spatio temporal variability in the community structure thorson et al 2016a a small spatial range indicates that spatial or spatio temporal variation at a given site is only predictive of variation at nearby sites within the range in other words a small spatial range suggests considerable heterogeneity in community structure at small scale we calculated the mean center and standard deviational ellipse of density distribution in longitude and latitude effective area occupied and total abundance index annually for each of the 13 aforementioned populations to evaluate respective spatio temporal dynamics of their spawning populations based on their estimated density distributions from the joint dynamic species distribution

summaries of the estimated latent variables including the average spatial distribution and the loadings of various species on each variable for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the probabilities of non zero catches hereinafter referred to as probnon zero and spatial variation in positive catch rates hereinafter referred to as rate b 0 are presented respectively in figs 3 5 the first latent variable representing spatial variation in probnon zero captures 70 3 of total explained variance it is highest at intermediate depths in the central basin and lowest at the southwestern shelf of the bohai sea fig 3 this latent variable has stronger positive associations with a cold water fish s schlegelii and two cephalopods i e l japonica and s birostrata and is negatively associated with s taty and a digitalis fig 3 the second latent variable for spatial variation in probnon zero is lowest in the laizhou bay relatively higher in the bohai bay and highest in the liaodong bay of the bohai sea fig 3 this latent variable is highly associated with two cold water species i e s schlegelii and c affinis and a small pelagic fish population t kammalensis which generally inhabits waters shallower than 20 m fig 3 the third latent variable is generally higher along the shelf of the bohai sea and lowest at the central deep basin fig 3 this latent variable has a strong positive association with an abundance rich crustacean population o oratoria and is negatively associated with another crustacean population a digitalis fig 3 the first latent variable for spatio temporal variation in probnon zero captures 48 8 of the total explained variance it has higher values at the mouths of the bohai bay and the laizhou bay and on the south of the liaodong bay fig 4 this latent variable has a strong negative association with a digitalis and is positively associated with j grypotus t kammalensis c stigmatiasi s schlegelii and a japonicus fig 4 the second latent variable is highest at the mouth of liaodong bay and has relatively stronger associations with four invertebrate populations i e a japonicus a digitalis l japonica and s birostrata fig 4 the third latent variable has highest values around the southern portion of the bohai strait with shallower depths which is negatively associated with c affinis and l japonica fig 4 the first latent variable representing spatial variation in rate b 0 captures 59 4 of total explained variance this latent variable has a strong positive association with o oratoria with relatively higher values in the laizhou bay and lowest values at deep waters to the northwest of the bohai sea strait fig 5 the second latent variable is much higher in the most southern and central parts of the bohai sea where there are large amounts of freshwater discharges from the yellow river and the luan river fig 5 this latent variable appears strongly associated with c stigmatias the third latent variable only accounts for 13 5 of total explained variance with highest values at the laizhou bay fig 5 the spatial ranges are respectively 84 km and 94 km for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the distributions of the 13 major fisheries targeted populations in the bohai sea this suggests that spatial or annual variation at a given site is only predictive of variation at sites within 84 km or 94 km in other words there is large variability in fish community structure at distances greater than 100 km implying instability in community structure at a coarse scale for most of the 13 populations in the bohai sea mean center of density in their respective distributions appeared to shift toward the northeast during the spring periods of 2014 2018 fig 6 they were estimated with generally small standard deviational ellipses except for s schlegelii and c stigmatias fig 6 fish populations show larger fluctuations in the mean center of density than populations of crustaceans and cephalopods fig 6 similarly the effective area occupied fluctuated more intensely for fish compared to crustaceans and cephalopods and their estimates were generally precise with small standard errors 0 5 except for s schlegelii fig 7 in addition total abundance indices for the 13 fish and invertebrate populations show large variabilities during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 fig 7 they were mostly estimated with small standard errors except for s schlegelii specifically 12 of the 13 populations except e japonicus exhibited a sharp increase in total abundance during the spring of 2017 fig 7 interestingly the total abundance indices in 2018 remained high for most teleost populations except one cold water species s schlegelii but showed an abrupt decrease for all six of the invertebrate populations fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation and implications of spatio temporal dynamics bathymetric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the bohai sea explain the strong associations of the spatial distributions of the latent variables for spatial spatio temporal variation in probnon zero or rate b 0 with the spatial patterns of the coastal bays and the central basin the three coastal bays in the bohai sea are shallow in depth with direct freshwater discharges from different rivers the entrance of the bohai sea is in the northeast and connects to the waters of the yellow sea through a narrow and relatively deep 30 m strait fig 1 therefore the exchange between the bohai sea and the yellow sea is weak these geographic characteristics result in weak hydrologic connectivity and large spatial variations in fished community composition at different coastal bays and the central basin within the bohai sea liu et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2017 this study indicates smaller spatial ranges than 100 km for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the distributions of the 13 major fisheries targeted populations in the bohai sea as a contrast the spatial ranges are respectively 1987 km and 343 km for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the demersal finfish and invertebrate community of the bering sea thorson et al 2016a this comparison suggests large variability in the community structure of fishery resources at coarse scales within the bohai sea which may be related to high spatial variations in environmental conditions freshwater discharges into the coastal bays inside the bohai sea differ in source river and the amount of flux and hydrological connectivity between bays is likely insufficient for persistent spatial homogeneity among major environmental controls e g temperature and salinity for species distribution at coarse or larger scales yu et al 2018 moreover the bohai sea ecosystem has undergone severe degradation under the combined impacts from climate change and intense human activities after china s reform and opening up of commercial enterprise starting in 1978 jin 2004 zhang et al 2015 it is possible that a resultant suppression of natural food web dynamics could have weakened biotic controls on the distributions of fished populations increasing spatial variability in their community structure in an environment with high spatio temporal variations in addition it is hard to identify major cause s for the observation that most of the 13 fisheries targeted populations have tended to shift northeastward to deeper waters fig 1 during the annual spawning season i e spring of 2014 to 2018 as the bohai sea has been under the combined impact of climate change escalation in fishing effort and other human activities for decades ocean warming might help to explain these distributional shifts to deeper waters with relatively lower temperatures in the bohai sea since rapid warming has occurred in the bohai sea in may from 2002 2018 fig 2 regardless of causes these distributional changes could challenge the fidelity of specific spawning grounds for major fish populations liu et al 1990 thereby affecting fisheries productivity in the bohai sea ecosystem this study illustrates that fish populations generally show larger fluctuations in the distributional metrics i e mean center of density and effective area occupied than the six crustacean and cephalopod populations in the bohai sea figs 6 and 7 this is understandable as crustaceans are generally less mobile than fish in addition one of the two cephalopod species l japonica appears to be a local population in the bohai sea and yellow sea without any long distance migratory behavior qiu 1986 the other cephalopod species s birostrata is smaller in size with caudal lengths ranging from 7 to 18 mm and mainly feeds on smaller decapods yang and tan 2000 we thus consider these two cephalopods as poor swimmers and suggest that major crustacean and cephalopod populations in the bohai sea might be incapable of shifting their distributions fast enough to respond to habitat changes this indicates that fisheries targeted populations that differ in biological characteristics could have different vulnerabilities to habitat changes induced by either climate change or human activities even at a very localized scale moreover our study suggests that recent fisheries management strategies in the bohai sea could benefit fisheries resource conservation as 12 of the 13 populations except e japonicus showed sharp increases in their total abundance indices in the spring of 2017 and most populations of fish species maintained high abundances in the spring of 2018 fig 7 firstly the annual catch in this area declined by approximately 5 per year after 2015 mainly under the force of the mandatory reduction in production required by the total output control policy moa 2017 secondly the summer fishing moratorium has been extended by one month in this ecosystem since 2017 additionally the abrupt decreases in abundance for invertebrate populations in 2018 might be explained by increased predation arising from an increase in fish abundance fig 7 decline in the population abundance of the cold water fish species s schlegelii in 2018 might be attributed to warmer temperatures in the ecosystem fig 2 this study further implies that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified marine ecosystem could rapidly respond to conservation and management strategies with negligible time lags one explanation for this rapid response could be that major fish and invertebrate populations that remain after intense fishing are generally those occupying lower trophic levels which have relatively short life histories as is the case for the bohai sea ecosystem wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 2007 another potential explanation for the quick responses is that predatory fish populations at high trophic levels have been largely depleted by fishing in such ecosystems and need more time to recover due to their longer life history liberating major populations at low trophic levels from top down controls otherwise major fish and invertebrate populations left in a simplified ecosystem can differ in their responses to conservation and management strategies as shown in this study especially under conditions of climatic change thereby causing changes in species composition interactions among species and community structure and function such changes could bring a simplified ecosystem to a less stable state and make it difficult to forecast to where the ecosystem as a whole and its exploited populations will move in terms of its overall status therefore it is critically important to promote simultaneous evaluations of the spatio temporal dynamics in major fisheries targeted populations for adaptive management of a simplified or declining ecosystem 4 2 data limitations in this study only five years data with a sample size of 210 trawls were used to model and predict density distributions of 13 fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea in a spatio temporal manner the low sample size precludes high spatial resolution for the estimated densities and may have reduced the precision of estimated densities and derived metrics i e mean center of density effective area occupied and total abundance index moreover the number of species that can be included in the model is limited by the sample size because an increase in species number generally increases model complexity and therefore requires more sampling data to satisfy the estimation of additional parameters thorson 2019 the spatial factor analysis approach can greatly reduce model complexity thorson et al 2016a which facilitated the modeling of 13 populations with limited sampling data in this study in addition the number of nodes i e 50 used to divide the study area into small patches 305 2547 km2 might have some impact on the spatial range estimation the impact should be limited as such a coarse spatial scale provides enough resolution for estimating the spatial ranges in this study for all the 50 nodes their nearest neighbor distances range from 8 78 km to 33 99 km with an average value at 22 46 km all these nodes have at least seven neighbors and 90 of them have at least 10 neighbors within the distance of 100 km as a contrast the estimated spatial ranges are respectively 84 km and 94 km at a larger spatial scale for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the modeled species distributions sensitivity analysis has not been conducted on the number of nodes to evaluate its impact on the spatial range estimation because a small sample size of 210 trawls hinders the set of effectively more nodes e g 100 or 150 and effectively fewer nodes e g 25 could not provide enough resolution for estimating the spatial ranges furthermore although we only evaluated five years spatio temporal dynamics for the 13 major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea due to data limitations the variance estimates with the spatio temporal dynamic metrics were generally small therefore it should be acceptable to discuss the implications of these population dynamics for ecological processes i e variability in community structure population responses to conservation and management strategies that usually only become apparent over a relatively longer timescale it is out of the reach of this study to identify major cause s for spatio temporal patterns in targeted populations dynamics given the short time series of fishery independent surveys this case study focuses on emphasizing the importance of simultaneously evaluating the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple populations within an ecosystem and thereby suggesting a demand for adaptive fisheries management at system scale especially for degraded or declining ecosystems worldwide overall the results of this study suggest that major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea show large spatial variability in community structure and have responded to habitat changes overfishing or other human activities differently these populations also differ in their responses to conservation and management strategies in a rapid manner possibly because they are in now a simplified or depauperate ecosystem collectively these population characteristics warrant adaptive fisheries management to achieve a more effective ecosystem approach under the combined impact of climatic change and human activities in the bohai sea although our study focuses on a local marine ecosystem the methods can be readily applied to simultaneously evaluate the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple populations in other ecosystems worldwide

24882,development of joint species distribution models allows for improved and simultaneous estimates of various metrics for evaluating spatio temporal patterns in multi population dynamics as essential tools for promoting ecosystem management and conservation however such tools are rarely used to simultaneously evaluate the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple fisheries targeted populations in an ecosystem this study aims to fill this gap with a case study of the bohai sea in china a joint dynamic species distribution model was developed to estimate the distributions of 13 major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea using data from bottom trawl surveys conducted in spring during 2014 to 2018 we calculated the spatial ranges i e the distance within which correlation coefficients between locations are always larger than 10 for spatial variation and spatio temporal variation in species specific densities of this fished community the model based density estimates for these populations were used to calculate the mean center of density effective area occupied and total abundance index for each population by year results showed that the spatial ranges were respectively 84 km and 94 km for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the distributions of targeted populations suggesting large variability in the community structure at a distance 100 km fish populations showed larger fluctuations in the mean center of density and effective area occupied than crustaceans and cephalopods while most of the 13 populations tended to shift northeastward to deeper waters over the five years additionally 12 of the 13 populations showed a sharp increase in total abundance in the spring of 2017 under the force of increasingly conservational fisheries management since 2017 in 2018 the total abundance indices remained high for most fish populations but showed an abrupt decrease for all six of the invertebrate populations these results indicate that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified ecosystem could differ in their responses to habitat changes management or other human activities in a rapid manner suggesting a demand for adaptive fisheries management at system scale for degraded declining ecosystems worldwide keywords joint species distribution model simultaneous evaluation spatio temporal dynamics multi population 1 introduction fish crustaceans and cephalopods are major sources of marine fisheries catches in many of the world s ecosystems understanding spatio temporal dynamics of major fisheries targeted populations within an ecosystem context is essential for promoting sustainable management of fisheries resources at fishery and ecosystem scales conventional population dynamics in fisheries science usually focus on temporal dynamics in population abundance recruitment and sustainable yield which have long been the mainstay of fisheries stock assessments hilborn and walters 1992 recently spatial dynamics among fish populations i e time varying spatial patterns in the distribution and abundance has attracted extensive consideration guan et al 2017 thorson et al 2016b as most marine fish populations have complex spatial structures kritzer and sale 2004 and often show distributional shifts in response to climate induced habitat changes intense fishing or other anthropogenic influences e g ames 2004 nye et al 2009 ames and lichter 2013 hayden et al 2015 a variety of metrics remain in use for evaluating spatio temporal dynamics of fished populations most commonly relative abundance indices habitat area mean center of density boundaries of distribution abundance and habitat associations e g mean or median temperatures depth range and area occupied nye et al 2009 perry et al 2005 swain and benoît 2006 traditional estimation of these metrics generally makes direct use of arithmetic means from fishery independent survey data which cannot account for potential impacts of spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort pinsky et al 2013 swain and benoît 2006 these metrics can now be estimated more precisely and accurately by hindcasting density distributions of target populations from single species distribution models based on survey data cao et al 2017 guan et al 2017 thorson et al 2016b in this context the development of a joint species distribution model would enable improved and simultaneous estimates of spatio temporal dynamic metrics for multiple fishery populations in a given ecosystem hitherto such model based estimates have not been made despite the availability of a new spatial factor analysis sfa tool which has become well established for estimating joint species distributions thorson 2019 thorson et al 2015 fisheries management involving ecosystem based approaches requires simultaneous evaluation of spatio temporal dynamics for multiple populations in an ecosystem ocean warming as a significant phenomenon of climate change has impacted marine primary productivity biodiversity and fisheries in different regions worldwide e g cheung et al 2010 leitão et al 2018 liang et al 2018 wabnitz et al 2018 moreover abrupt changes in species abundance community composition and trophic organization as the consequences of environmental forcing fishing or invasive species have occurred in multiple marine ecosystems including the southern and northern benguela cury and shannon 2004 heymans and tomczak 2016 the gulf of alaska heymans et al 2007 the gulf of maine zhang and chen 2007 and the baltic sea kotta et al 2018 this suggests that fisheries management should move towards a more effective ecosystem based approach emphasizing the importance of simultaneously understanding spatio temporal dynamics for major fisheries targeted populations the bohai sea is the only enclosed sea in china with an average water depth of 18 m and freshwater discharges into three major coastal bays i e liaodong bay bohai bay and laizhou bay from more than 40 rivers fig 1 it occupies a region within the large yellow sea marine ecosystem in which the mean sea surface temperature sst rose by 0 67 c during 1982 2006 belkin 2009 this rate of warming is much higher than the global mean rate over the same period belkin 2009 moreover with the general acceleration of ocean warming cheng et al 2019 rapid warming continues in the bohai sea especially during the months of may and august fig 2 fishing effort has increased exponentially in the bohai sea since the 1950s and its curtailment has become critical because coastal bays inside this ecosystem are crucial spawning and nursery grounds for various fish and invertebrate populations of the yellow sea and the bohai sea liu et al 1990 under the combined impact of human activities and climatic changes fishery resources in this ecosystem have shown declines in biomass species richness and diversity since the early 2000s jin 2004 zhang et al 2007 after 2009 all fisheries except those using monofilament gill nets or jigs were prohibited in the bohai sea from june 1st to september 1st each year to protect spawning adults and improve population recruitment as most fished populations in this ecosystem breed during the period from may to july this summer fishing moratorium is believed to have contributed to consistently high annual production among non selective capture fisheries in the bohai sea in the 2010s in light of its effectiveness since 2017 this seasonal suspension of fishing activities has been extended by one month starting from may 1st annually meanwhile the total output control policy for marine capture fisheries in china mandates an annual decrease in production by at least 5 for each coastal province from 2015 to 2020 ministry of agriculture 2017 the bohai sea has become a well known example of a marine ecosystem characterized by increased net primary production but reduced fisheries productivity a simplified depauperate food web with major food chains becoming shorter or broken and energy transfer through the food web now primarily dependent on detritus jin 2004 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2007 we present a case study of the bohai sea ecosystem that simultaneously evaluates the spatio temporal dynamics of 13 major fisheries targeted populations during their peak spawning periods i e may to june of 2014 2018 implications of changes in spatio temporal dynamics are discussed from ecological climatic induced change and fisheries management perspectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey data we identified 13 biomass dominant populations of key exploited species in the bohai sea which included seven fish species four crustacean species and two species of cephalopods table 1 of these species black rockfish s schlegelii and sand shrimp c affinis prefer colder waters than the others only two such cold water species are identified as similar species are few in this warm temperate ecosystem these identified species are representative enough to evaluate the hypothesis that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified ecosystem differ in their responses to habitat changes management or other human activities in a rapid manner data were obtained from annual bottom trawl surveys conducted by yellow sea fisheries research institute ysfri in the bohai sea during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 these surveys were confined to daylight hours and followed a fixed station sampling design with one station at each intersection of grid of 0 25 in longitude x 0 25 in latitude the same pair of bottom trawlers with identical gear types and consistent sampling protocols were used in these surveys to maintain consistent catchability over time this pair of bottom trawlers are general fishing vessels with an engine power of around 200 horsepower and trawl nets of the same commercial size specifically the trawl nets have a cod end mesh size of 2 cm a headline height of 5 6 m and a distance of 22 6 m between wings in addition the coverage of these surveys generally extended over most of the bohai sea except for inshore waters that are often occupied by stationary fishing devices or not deep enough for bottom trawling of survey vessels the study area fig 1 was restricted to ensure common coverage of the annual surveys at most stations the trawl nets were towed at an average speed of 3 knots for 60 min in accordance with the survey design exceptions occurred at some nearshore stations where time was reduced to 30 min to avoid collisions with other fishing boats or stationary fishing devices this variation in tow duration is calibrated in the model by accounting for the area swept per tow for each station catches of nektonic species were separated by species and individuals in each sample were counted and weighed catch per trawl by species in number and biomass were recorded on the spot along with the depth temperature and salinity at the beginning and end of each shot data used in this study were catches per trawl in biomass bi kg for each of the 13 identified populations for a total of 210 successful trawls undertaken within the study area as well as spatial information i e the universal transverse mercator utm coordinates at the beginning and ending locations for each trawl 2 2 joint dynamic species distribution model a joint dynamic species distribution model thorson et al 2016a 2015 was developed to simultaneously estimate the distribution of the 13 populations in the bohai sea spanning the spring seasons of 2014 2018 this is a two stage model where the probability distribution for survey catch rate i e catch per area swept bi bi wi data for the ith sample is decomposed into two components or sub models representing i the probability of non zero catches p si ci ti for species ci at location si in year ti and ii the expected catch rate λ si ci ti given that species ci is captured therefore we specify p r b i 1 p s i c i t i p s i c i t i g a m m a b σ c 2 λ s i c i t i σ c 2 i f b i 0 i f b i 0 where wi denotes the area swept in km2 for sample i gamma x α β is a gamma probability distribution function for value x given a shape parameter of α and a scale parameter of β and σc is the coefficient of variance for positive catch rate which varies among species for each trawl we used the utm coordinates at the beginning and ending locations to calculate the trawling distance and then multiplied it by the distance between wings of the trawl net to estimate the area swept area swept was then included in the model to account for differences in trawling durations positive catch rate data for fishes are usually considered as approximating lognormal or gamma distributions thorson 2019 in this study the model with gamma distributions aic 367 74 fitted the positive catch rate data better for the 13 targeted species when compared to that with lognormal distributions aic 535 11 in each sub model spatial factor analysis sfa was utilized to model variations in p si ci ti or λ si ci ti sfa uses a reduced number of latent unobserved variables to represent unobserved environmental and biotic variables in a large number of species thorson et al 2015 each latent variable is estimated as a gaussian random field that varies over space such that nearby locations are averagely more similar than geographically distant locations therefore the modeling explains species distributions via latent variables instead of measured environmental or biotic variables theoretically the number of latent variables can be any non negative integer no larger than 13 i e the number of species in the model of this study there are three latent variables representing spatial spatio temporal variation in probability of non zero catches and positive catch rate model with two latent variables does not fit the data well as it explains much less of the spatio temporal variation in the distributions of targeted populations in addition models with more than three latent variables do not converge because they have more covariance parameters to estimate and our sampling data are insufficient to enable this estimation specifically we approximated variations in p si ci ti using a logit linked linear predictor l o g i t p s i c i t i β 1 c i t i f 1 3 l ω 1 c i f ω 1 s i f f 1 3 l ε 1 c i f ε 1 s i f t i where β 1 ci ti is an intercept for species ci and year ti ω 1 si f represents spatial variation that is constant over time at location si for latent variable f of three latent variables representing spatial variation and l ω1 ci f denotes the loadings matrix generating spatial covariation among species for this linear predictor similarly ɛ1 si f ti stands for spatio temporal variation that varies among modeled time intervals for each of three latent variables and l ɛ1 ci f denotes the loadings matrix that generates spatio temporal covariation for this predictor in addition expected catch rates λ si ci ti were approximated with a log linked linear predictor log λ s i c i t i β 2 c i t i f 1 3 l ω 2 c i f ω 2 s i f where the variables and parameters are defined similarly as above except replacing subscript 1 with 2 the spatio temporal component was removed from this sub model after initial trials as it hindered model convergence for this joint dynamic species distribution model we divided up the study area within the bohai sea into small patches using 50 nodes generated based on the spatial distribution of all trawls through the k means method hartigan and wong 1979 the location of sample i in the model was simply determined as the location of its closest node i e si the model was fitted and validated using the vast package thorson and barnett 2017 in the r program subsequently we used this model to estimate density distributions of the 13 populations in the study area during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 the predicted density in kg km2 of species c at location s at year t was estimated as follow d s c t p s c t λ s c t 2 3 evaluating spatio temporal dynamics based on estimated parameters of the joint dynamic species distribution model we calculated the spatial ranges i e the distance within which correlation coefficients between locations are always larger than 10 for spatial variation and spatio temporal variation in species specific densities of this community to evaluate spatio temporal variability in the community structure thorson et al 2016a a small spatial range indicates that spatial or spatio temporal variation at a given site is only predictive of variation at nearby sites within the range in other words a small spatial range suggests considerable heterogeneity in community structure at small scale we calculated the mean center and standard deviational ellipse of density distribution in longitude and latitude effective area occupied and total abundance index annually for each of the 13 aforementioned populations to evaluate respective spatio temporal dynamics of their spawning populations based on their estimated density distributions from the joint dynamic species distribution

summaries of the estimated latent variables including the average spatial distribution and the loadings of various species on each variable for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the probabilities of non zero catches hereinafter referred to as probnon zero and spatial variation in positive catch rates hereinafter referred to as rate b 0 are presented respectively in figs 3 5 the first latent variable representing spatial variation in probnon zero captures 70 3 of total explained variance it is highest at intermediate depths in the central basin and lowest at the southwestern shelf of the bohai sea fig 3 this latent variable has stronger positive associations with a cold water fish s schlegelii and two cephalopods i e l japonica and s birostrata and is negatively associated with s taty and a digitalis fig 3 the second latent variable for spatial variation in probnon zero is lowest in the laizhou bay relatively higher in the bohai bay and highest in the liaodong bay of the bohai sea fig 3 this latent variable is highly associated with two cold water species i e s schlegelii and c affinis and a small pelagic fish population t kammalensis which generally inhabits waters shallower than 20 m fig 3 the third latent variable is generally higher along the shelf of the bohai sea and lowest at the central deep basin fig 3 this latent variable has a strong positive association with an abundance rich crustacean population o oratoria and is negatively associated with another crustacean population a digitalis fig 3 the first latent variable for spatio temporal variation in probnon zero captures 48 8 of the total explained variance it has higher values at the mouths of the bohai bay and the laizhou bay and on the south of the liaodong bay fig 4 this latent variable has a strong negative association with a digitalis and is positively associated with j grypotus t kammalensis c stigmatiasi s schlegelii and a japonicus fig 4 the second latent variable is highest at the mouth of liaodong bay and has relatively stronger associations with four invertebrate populations i e a japonicus a digitalis l japonica and s birostrata fig 4 the third latent variable has highest values around the southern portion of the bohai strait with shallower depths which is negatively associated with c affinis and l japonica fig 4 the first latent variable representing spatial variation in rate b 0 captures 59 4 of total explained variance this latent variable has a strong positive association with o oratoria with relatively higher values in the laizhou bay and lowest values at deep waters to the northwest of the bohai sea strait fig 5 the second latent variable is much higher in the most southern and central parts of the bohai sea where there are large amounts of freshwater discharges from the yellow river and the luan river fig 5 this latent variable appears strongly associated with c stigmatias the third latent variable only accounts for 13 5 of total explained variance with highest values at the laizhou bay fig 5 the spatial ranges are respectively 84 km and 94 km for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the distributions of the 13 major fisheries targeted populations in the bohai sea this suggests that spatial or annual variation at a given site is only predictive of variation at sites within 84 km or 94 km in other words there is large variability in fish community structure at distances greater than 100 km implying instability in community structure at a coarse scale for most of the 13 populations in the bohai sea mean center of density in their respective distributions appeared to shift toward the northeast during the spring periods of 2014 2018 fig 6 they were estimated with generally small standard deviational ellipses except for s schlegelii and c stigmatias fig 6 fish populations show larger fluctuations in the mean center of density than populations of crustaceans and cephalopods fig 6 similarly the effective area occupied fluctuated more intensely for fish compared to crustaceans and cephalopods and their estimates were generally precise with small standard errors 0 5 except for s schlegelii fig 7 in addition total abundance indices for the 13 fish and invertebrate populations show large variabilities during the spring periods of 2014 to 2018 fig 7 they were mostly estimated with small standard errors except for s schlegelii specifically 12 of the 13 populations except e japonicus exhibited a sharp increase in total abundance during the spring of 2017 fig 7 interestingly the total abundance indices in 2018 remained high for most teleost populations except one cold water species s schlegelii but showed an abrupt decrease for all six of the invertebrate populations fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation and implications of spatio temporal dynamics bathymetric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the bohai sea explain the strong associations of the spatial distributions of the latent variables for spatial spatio temporal variation in probnon zero or rate b 0 with the spatial patterns of the coastal bays and the central basin the three coastal bays in the bohai sea are shallow in depth with direct freshwater discharges from different rivers the entrance of the bohai sea is in the northeast and connects to the waters of the yellow sea through a narrow and relatively deep 30 m strait fig 1 therefore the exchange between the bohai sea and the yellow sea is weak these geographic characteristics result in weak hydrologic connectivity and large spatial variations in fished community composition at different coastal bays and the central basin within the bohai sea liu et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2017 this study indicates smaller spatial ranges than 100 km for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the distributions of the 13 major fisheries targeted populations in the bohai sea as a contrast the spatial ranges are respectively 1987 km and 343 km for spatial and spatio temporal variations in the demersal finfish and invertebrate community of the bering sea thorson et al 2016a this comparison suggests large variability in the community structure of fishery resources at coarse scales within the bohai sea which may be related to high spatial variations in environmental conditions freshwater discharges into the coastal bays inside the bohai sea differ in source river and the amount of flux and hydrological connectivity between bays is likely insufficient for persistent spatial homogeneity among major environmental controls e g temperature and salinity for species distribution at coarse or larger scales yu et al 2018 moreover the bohai sea ecosystem has undergone severe degradation under the combined impacts from climate change and intense human activities after china s reform and opening up of commercial enterprise starting in 1978 jin 2004 zhang et al 2015 it is possible that a resultant suppression of natural food web dynamics could have weakened biotic controls on the distributions of fished populations increasing spatial variability in their community structure in an environment with high spatio temporal variations in addition it is hard to identify major cause s for the observation that most of the 13 fisheries targeted populations have tended to shift northeastward to deeper waters fig 1 during the annual spawning season i e spring of 2014 to 2018 as the bohai sea has been under the combined impact of climate change escalation in fishing effort and other human activities for decades ocean warming might help to explain these distributional shifts to deeper waters with relatively lower temperatures in the bohai sea since rapid warming has occurred in the bohai sea in may from 2002 2018 fig 2 regardless of causes these distributional changes could challenge the fidelity of specific spawning grounds for major fish populations liu et al 1990 thereby affecting fisheries productivity in the bohai sea ecosystem this study illustrates that fish populations generally show larger fluctuations in the distributional metrics i e mean center of density and effective area occupied than the six crustacean and cephalopod populations in the bohai sea figs 6 and 7 this is understandable as crustaceans are generally less mobile than fish in addition one of the two cephalopod species l japonica appears to be a local population in the bohai sea and yellow sea without any long distance migratory behavior qiu 1986 the other cephalopod species s birostrata is smaller in size with caudal lengths ranging from 7 to 18 mm and mainly feeds on smaller decapods yang and tan 2000 we thus consider these two cephalopods as poor swimmers and suggest that major crustacean and cephalopod populations in the bohai sea might be incapable of shifting their distributions fast enough to respond to habitat changes this indicates that fisheries targeted populations that differ in biological characteristics could have different vulnerabilities to habitat changes induced by either climate change or human activities even at a very localized scale moreover our study suggests that recent fisheries management strategies in the bohai sea could benefit fisheries resource conservation as 12 of the 13 populations except e japonicus showed sharp increases in their total abundance indices in the spring of 2017 and most populations of fish species maintained high abundances in the spring of 2018 fig 7 firstly the annual catch in this area declined by approximately 5 per year after 2015 mainly under the force of the mandatory reduction in production required by the total output control policy moa 2017 secondly the summer fishing moratorium has been extended by one month in this ecosystem since 2017 additionally the abrupt decreases in abundance for invertebrate populations in 2018 might be explained by increased predation arising from an increase in fish abundance fig 7 decline in the population abundance of the cold water fish species s schlegelii in 2018 might be attributed to warmer temperatures in the ecosystem fig 2 this study further implies that major fish and invertebrate populations in a simplified marine ecosystem could rapidly respond to conservation and management strategies with negligible time lags one explanation for this rapid response could be that major fish and invertebrate populations that remain after intense fishing are generally those occupying lower trophic levels which have relatively short life histories as is the case for the bohai sea ecosystem wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 2007 another potential explanation for the quick responses is that predatory fish populations at high trophic levels have been largely depleted by fishing in such ecosystems and need more time to recover due to their longer life history liberating major populations at low trophic levels from top down controls otherwise major fish and invertebrate populations left in a simplified ecosystem can differ in their responses to conservation and management strategies as shown in this study especially under conditions of climatic change thereby causing changes in species composition interactions among species and community structure and function such changes could bring a simplified ecosystem to a less stable state and make it difficult to forecast to where the ecosystem as a whole and its exploited populations will move in terms of its overall status therefore it is critically important to promote simultaneous evaluations of the spatio temporal dynamics in major fisheries targeted populations for adaptive management of a simplified or declining ecosystem 4 2 data limitations in this study only five years data with a sample size of 210 trawls were used to model and predict density distributions of 13 fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea in a spatio temporal manner the low sample size precludes high spatial resolution for the estimated densities and may have reduced the precision of estimated densities and derived metrics i e mean center of density effective area occupied and total abundance index moreover the number of species that can be included in the model is limited by the sample size because an increase in species number generally increases model complexity and therefore requires more sampling data to satisfy the estimation of additional parameters thorson 2019 the spatial factor analysis approach can greatly reduce model complexity thorson et al 2016a which facilitated the modeling of 13 populations with limited sampling data in this study in addition the number of nodes i e 50 used to divide the study area into small patches 305 2547 km2 might have some impact on the spatial range estimation the impact should be limited as such a coarse spatial scale provides enough resolution for estimating the spatial ranges in this study for all the 50 nodes their nearest neighbor distances range from 8 78 km to 33 99 km with an average value at 22 46 km all these nodes have at least seven neighbors and 90 of them have at least 10 neighbors within the distance of 100 km as a contrast the estimated spatial ranges are respectively 84 km and 94 km at a larger spatial scale for spatial and spatio temporal variation in the modeled species distributions sensitivity analysis has not been conducted on the number of nodes to evaluate its impact on the spatial range estimation because a small sample size of 210 trawls hinders the set of effectively more nodes e g 100 or 150 and effectively fewer nodes e g 25 could not provide enough resolution for estimating the spatial ranges furthermore although we only evaluated five years spatio temporal dynamics for the 13 major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea due to data limitations the variance estimates with the spatio temporal dynamic metrics were generally small therefore it should be acceptable to discuss the implications of these population dynamics for ecological processes i e variability in community structure population responses to conservation and management strategies that usually only become apparent over a relatively longer timescale it is out of the reach of this study to identify major cause s for spatio temporal patterns in targeted populations dynamics given the short time series of fishery independent surveys this case study focuses on emphasizing the importance of simultaneously evaluating the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple populations within an ecosystem and thereby suggesting a demand for adaptive fisheries management at system scale especially for degraded or declining ecosystems worldwide overall the results of this study suggest that major fish and invertebrate populations in the bohai sea show large spatial variability in community structure and have responded to habitat changes overfishing or other human activities differently these populations also differ in their responses to conservation and management strategies in a rapid manner possibly because they are in now a simplified or depauperate ecosystem collectively these population characteristics warrant adaptive fisheries management to achieve a more effective ecosystem approach under the combined impact of climatic change and human activities in the bohai sea although our study focuses on a local marine ecosystem the methods can be readily applied to simultaneously evaluate the spatio temporal dynamics of multiple populations in other ecosystems worldwide

24883,over the last two decades major changes in abundance and population characteristics of alewife alosa pseudoharengus an anadromous herring species have been observed along the us atlantic coast loss of spawning habitat bycatch mortality in the directed pelagic fisheries increased predation mortality by rebounding predators such as striped bass changes in water flow and temperature affecting recruitment success changes in ocean thermal habitat and direct and indirect effects of changes in zooplankton community have been expounded by different researchers as putative hypotheses for population changes in alewife unfortunately long term concurrently measured time series of regional factors and direct measures of biological processes needed to elucidate underlying causes are severely lacking for alewife therefore we developed calibrated and validated a mechanistic spatially explicit full life cycle simulation model that can be used to explore population responses of alewife to various exogeneous drivers daily processes such as spawning recruitment mortality exploitation predation and movements are generated by using empirically derived deterministic and stochastic relationships and time series of environmental data linked to specific life stages we demonstrate the use of the model as an investigative tool by simulating three hypotheses and comparing model results to observed trends in alewife populations from southern new england keywords alewife life history simulation 1 introduction alewife alosa pseudoharengus is an ecologically important migratory anadromous herring species that ranges along the atlantic coast from labrador to south carolina loesch 1987 alewife spend most of their life at sea but enter freshwater in spring to spawn primarily in lakes and ponds after spawning alewife adults exit the freshwater system and are presumed to move offshore and northward to summer feeding grounds the large scale movement makes them important forage for many marine and freshwater fish predators such as striped bass morone saxatilis cod gadus morhua and yellow perch perca flavescens loesch 1987 as well as birds dalton et al 2009 in addition they are a key link in the transfer of nutrients between freshwater to marine systems mullen et al 1986 walters et al 2009 diaz et al 2019 over the last two decades major changes in abundance and population characteristics of alewife have been observed along the us atlantic coast schimdt et al 2003 asmfc 2017 in southern new england dramatic increases in run abundances of alewife occurred during the 1980s and 1990s but precipitous declines occurred after 2000 fig 1 a nelson et al 2011 davis and schultz 2009 in addition declines in mean body size fig 1b and mean age fig 1c of alewife have been observed in massachusetts rivers since the 1980s and currently are about 20 25 mm smaller than in the past nelson et al 2011 asmfc 2017 concurrently increases in total mortality and decreases in recruiting age classes have been noted fig 1d nelson et al 2011 asmfc 2017 researchers have expounded many hypotheses to explain the observed changes in population characteristics hall et al 2012 suggested that historical loss of spawning habitat and productivity due to damming of rivers has decreased the resiliency of alewife populations to increases in mortality sources such as harvesting direct in river harvest has varied over time but currently occurs only in maine and a handful of other locations with approved management plans asmfc 2017 moratoriums limit direct harvest throughout much of the species range however the occurrences of large incidental catches bycatch of alewife in atlantic herring clupea harengus and atlantic mackerel scomber scombrus fisheries off southern new england during fall and winter cournane et al 2013 have been identified by many asmfc 2012 hasselman et al 2016 palkovacs et al 2013 as a potential cause of changes in abundances increased predation mortality by rebounding predator populations like striped bass morone saxatilis and double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auritus have been suggested as a major cause as well dalton et al 2009 davis et al 2012 savoy and crecco 1995 schmidt et al 2003 other putative causes include variability in water temperature and flow affecting recruitment success tommasi et al 2015 changes in ocean thermal habitat lynch et al 2015 nye et al 2009 and direct and indirect effects of changes in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition kane 2011 pershing et al 2005 as a result of climate change with many factors potentially affecting growth and survival the complex nature of interactions between biotic and environmental factors and regional differences in some of those factors such as bycatch hasselman et al 2016 it seems unlikely that a single factor is responsible for the observed changes in alewife populations unfortunately long term concurrently measured time series of regional factors and direct measures of biological processes e g egg survival predation rates etc needed to elucidate underlying causes are severely lacking for alewife in the absence of long term datasets one method commonly used to understand complex biological and environmental relationships in natural systems is simulation modeling through simulation population responses to changes in hypothesized causal mechanisms can be explored and evaluated with models of population dynamics archambault et al 2018 watermeyer et al 2018 zeug et al 2012 such models allow researchers to conceptualize describe and analyze population behavior and ask what if questions about the real system because alewife populations are under the influence of multiple environmental predator and anthropogenic pressures at all life stages exploration of causal factors requires the development of a life cycle model that incorporates relationships between the stressors and population dynamics in this paper we present a comprehensive mechanistic spatially explicit full life cycle simulation model for predicting population responses of alewife the model is the first of its kind as processes such as spawning recruitment mortality exploitation predation and movements are generated by using empirically derived deterministic and stochastic relationships and time series of environmental data are linked to specific life stages in addition we validate the model by comparing predictions to data from published and unpublished studies not used in model calibration and show a detailed analysis of model sensitivities further we demonstrate how the model may be used as an investigative tool for exploring hypotheses related to population changes in alewife 2 methodology 2 1 general model description the simulation model developed in r r development core team 2016 is empirically based and incorporates egg yolk sac larval post larval young of the year juvenile immature fish of age 1 and greater and adult mature stages of alewife although the amount of detail varies among stages the population structure is sex specific length platoon goodyear 1989 2002 and age based meaning groups of individuals of a particular sex length platoon and age are followed through time over a daily time step the platoon based structure is an intermediate stance between all individuals of the same age progressing identically age based model and every individual have its own life path individual based model the model is specified to represent the regional ocean estuary river and lake sex female and male maturity and length differences in population dynamics fig 2 a the model was developed to differentiate among habitats such that different causes of mortality and changes in productivity can be examined specifically in the ocean juveniles and adults grow and die due to length related natural mortality and can experience size selective seasonal bycatch mortality from the bottom trawl and mid water trawl atlantic herring fisheries mature adults migrate to lake spawning habitat through estuary and river systems where they can experience in river harvest and undergo temperature dependent batch spawning in the lake once spawning is completed adults return to the ocean depending on the duration spent in each system fig 2a the sub model for age 0 dynamics is more detailed fig 2b daily batches of eggs laid by all spawning individuals on the same day are followed through time temperature determines development of egg and yolk sac stages first feeding post larvae experience initial carrying capacity mortality and length based natural mortality occurs thereafter in the post larval young of the year yoy stage a bioenergetics model is used to grow length platoons using area temperatures as input and platoons emigrate based on size temperature and rainfall duration of time spent in river and estuary is dependent on swimming speed and system length all yoy are moved to the ocean region by january 1 of the following year 2 2 juvenile adult sub model in this section we provide full details of the model processes for the juvenile adult sub model all functional relationships are empirically based and were taken from literature or estimated from unpublished field data descriptions of indexes are listed in table 1 definitions of mathematical symbols are given

components of juvenile and adult subgroups were defined as having nine ages last age is a plus group and one hundred length platoons in each age the number of length platoons was selected to obtain similar length frequency statistics mean standard deviation and percentiles as an individual based model that used identical growth rates 2 2 2 population dynamics the number of individuals n of juvenile and adult fish is modeled using an exponential decay equation specific to each region while in the ocean the number of fish surviving to the start of day d is dependent on bycatch mortality f and natural mortality m during day d 1 eq ja 1 length dependent daily bycatch mortality is calculated from annual instantaneous bycatch mortality user specified proportions representing monthly fractions of the fishing pattern and the number of days in a month the daily f is further sub divided in two fleet specific daily bycatch mortalities based on landings ratios derived from massachusetts division of marine fisheries madmf port sampling of the atlantic herring fisheries eq ja 2 length dependent fleet specific daily f is calculated by multiplying fleet specific daily f and fleet specific selectivity at length values developed by using an equilibrium model and observed bycatch lengths supplementary document section 1 natural mortality experienced by fishes is often related to body size or weight pepin 1991 lorenzen 1996 for alewife we developed an equation to predict daily m from length that is used for all juvenile and adult fish regardless of sex or region the lorenzen 1996 weight based m equation was altered to predict annual mortality from length by substituting a weight length equation for alewife sampled as bycatch eq ja 3 length dependent daily m is calculated by dividing the estimated annual m from length by the days in a year 365 migrating adult fish experience the same natural mortality rate while in estuary river and lake systems but additional harvest and predation mortality can occur in the river regional multipliers δ are available in eqs ja 1 ja 4 and ja 5 to adjust rates up or down if required in the simulation regional multipliers of 1 0 are used to obtain a baseline annual m of about 0 6 for ages 5 8 similar to gibson and myers 2003 2 2 3 growth the body length of platoon p on day d is calculated from body length at the start of day d 1 and the daily growth increment l eq ja 6 l is calculated from the annual growth increment formulation of the von bertalanffy equation quinn and deriso 1999 eq ja 7 and a sine function that generates the fraction of annual growth that occurs on a given day of the year eq ja 8 because alewife exhibit sexually dimorphic growth rates separate growth equations for female and male alewife were derived supplementary document section 2 2 2 4 movement of mature fish to estuary based on the university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography fish trawl survey https web uri edu fishtrawl mature alewife appear to enter an estuary during late february early march to move mature fish from the ocean to the estuary region the day of movement es is selected from a uniform distribution appendix a all mature fish move together at the beginning of the selected day 2 2 5 movement of mature fish to river mature fish move through the freshwater system into river and lake and return using prior knowledge of temperature swimming speed ν and system length and estimated spawning duration is determined when a platoon enters the lake the number of fish that move into the river and those that remain in the estuary at the beginning of day d are calculated according to eqs ja 9 and ja 10 respectively where θd is the fraction migrating on day d the mechanisms controlling when and how many alewife enter a river are unknown therefore θd is simulated over time for a given year the start day of a run is the day on which the average of the current daily temperature and temperatures from the prior four days is 9 5 c this method was developed to obtain start days within the ranges observed in the monument river ma e g sheppard and bednarski 2015 the peak day and length of a run are selected randomly from uniform distributions run peak day 114 137 run length 63 87 days the start peak and end days are input parameters to a triangle distribution eq ja 11 and auto correlated errors are added to the probabilities to mimic the fluctuating run trends observed in the monument river eq ja 12 the initial probabilities p d s are standardized to 1 eq ja 13 to ensure that all fish move into the river by the end of the run θd is determined sequentially following eq ja 14 the duration spent in the river rdur is determined by the river length swimming speed and average body length eq ja 15 2 2 6 movement of mature adults from river to lake the day of lake entry for each migrant group is calculated as the river entry day plus the time spent by the group in the river and the entire group of fish moves together on that day 2 2 7 duration spent in lake the duration that a group spends in the lake sdur depends on when it enters during the run kissel 1974 the duration is generated from an exponential equation fitted to kissel 1974 data eq ja 16 and random deviates eq ja 17 are added to mimic the distributions of durations 2 2 8 reproduction for a group of fish entering the lake spawning activity commences on the day when the lake temperature reaches a minimum temperature threshold 10 5 c fay et al 1983 if a group of fish arrives before the minimum threshold is reached the first day of spawning is registered as the day when the minimum threshold is reached if a group of fish arrives after the minimum threshold is reached the first day of spawning spday is selected randomly from 4 to 8 days after lake entry as long as lake duration is 8 days otherwise the first spawning day is the day of lake entry the number of spawning events is determined by dividing the days spent in the lake by the average number of days between spawned egg batches bdur the next spawning event is determined by bdur 1 d day of spawning spawning occurs at the beginning of the day and the total number of eggs spawned by a group on a given day ed is calculated by eq ja 18 using literature values and a weight length equation eq ja 19 2 2 9 lake emigration the day on which adult moves out of the lake is calculated as lake entry day plus the number of days spent in the lake 2 2 10 river and estuary emigration the day on which movement to the estuary occurs is calculated as the river entry day plus rdur the day on which movement to the ocean occurs is calculated as the river exit day plus the time spent in the estuary edur edur is calculated by using the same equation for rdur except estuary length a user specified parameter that can be adjusted to retain fish longer is used eq ja 15 any fish remaining in the estuary are automatically moved to the ocean on day 1 of the following year 2 2 11 juvenile maturation on day 1 of each year a fraction of juveniles in each platoon is matured according to sex specific proportion mature at length

first created by using the minimum and maximum observed lengths of post larval alewife eq ey 11 density frequencies from a log normal distribution are generated using the mean of log transformed length and standard deviation of log values eq ey 12 and then the number of post larvae is assigned across length bins by randomly sampling from a multinomial distribution parameterized with

the exponential decay model with a stage multiplier eq ey 15 where mpost is length dependent daily instantaneous natural mortality eq ey 16 natural mortality for fish 22 mm total length tl is dependent on length and water temperature whereas it is only length dependent for fish 22 mm tl these relationships were developed from and calibrated with published literature values full details in supplementary document section 10 2 4 4 growth in lake the body length of platoon p on day d is calculated from body length at the start of day d 1 and the daily growth increment derived by using the alewife bioenergetics model of stewart and binkowski 1986 with improvements by klumb et al 2003 this model is based on an energy balance equation b c r s er u where b is the daily increase in body weight c is daily consumption r is energy lost through metabolism s is energy lost to specific dynamic action er is energy lost in egestion and u is energy lost in excretion the definitions of symbols and the equations governing the functional relationships are given in tables 6 and 7 respectively parameter values are listed in appendix c daily consumption and standard metabolism are the only temperature dependent processes in the model in the growth sub model length of platoon p is first converted to weight using length weight equations depending on body length eq be 1 daily consumption

rainfall the first day of emigration can begin when the body length of any platoon exceeds the user specified migration size the end day of emigration is randomly picked to occur between day 304 and day 334 the number of fish that emigrate at the beginning of day d is calculated according to eq ey 17 in table 5 and the fraction emigrating is determined using temperature and rainfall relationships

ocean mortality is calculated following eq ey 16 2 4 8 growth in river estuary and ocean daily growth in the river estuary and ocean is calculated by using the bioenergetics sub model the daily temperature from each region and the optimal temperature body size relationship 2 5 global sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of model outputs to input parameters were explored by using the method of morris 1991 this global sensitivity method was used to identify parameters with a range of negligible to strong impacts in addition the morris method identifies linear and nonlinear effects the morris method consists of several randomized one at a time experiments in which the effect of a parameter on the model output is assessed while keeping the other parameters constant van houwelingen et al 2011 the first step is to randomly draw a set of starting values within defined ranges of possible values for all input parameters running the model using these initial starting values and saving the model output the second step changes the value of one parameter by a random interval all other parameter values are those from the last run and the model output is then compared the previous run for comparison the elementary effect of the ith ee input parameter is calculated by e e i x t y x t y x t 1 δ i where y is the model output variable of interest t is the current run and i is the random change interval based on p 4 see van houwelingen et al 2011 for more details the process is repeated for the remaining variables the entire procedure is repeated r times r 10 in this paper each time with a different set of initial starting values the total number of runs needed for the analysis are r n 1 where n is the number of parameters the mean μ absolute mean μ and standard deviation σ are then calculated for the ith input parameter by μ i j 1 r e e i j r μ i j 1 r e e i j r σ i j 1 r e e i j μ i 2 r the interpretation of a parameter s effect is based on the coupled μ and σ values low μ and σ values imply a parameter has a low impact on the model output high μ and low σ imply a parameter has high linear impacts on the model low μ and high σ values imply a parameter has high nonlinear impacts on the model and high μ and high σ values imply a parameter has high nonlinear impacts on the model and or strong interactions with other parameters loubiere et al 2016 we explored the sensitivity of only seventy five parameters because valid minimum maximum ranges could not be derived for some given lack of literature e g the temperature function parameters used in the bioenergetics model or changes in individual parameters could not be examined independently e g the polynomial relationship parameters between hatching success and temperature without producing non sensical values the list of parameters with corresponding ranges for the uniform distributions are provided in table d 1 ranges were derived mainly from literature but when lacking ranges were also derived from standard error estimates 2 se of parameters e g male and female von bertalanffy growth or from within a biologically realistic range based on our best judgement e g p for each run the model was initialized with an equilibrium population of juveniles and adults full details in supplementary document section 14 the model was then run for 30 years duration population reaches equilibrium with new parameters using regional temperature and rainfall data from 1962 1992 obtained from various data sources or developed from air temperature for the region of narragansett bay through southern massachusetts full details in supplementary document sections 15 17 the last year s derived values of run size mean length of adults in the river sex ratio on the run egg abundance yoy cumulative river abundance and age 1 mean length on january 1 were recorded and used to examine input parameter sensitivities 2 6 model validation confidence in the performance of the model may be evaluated in terms of its ability as a predictive tool balci 1998 to validate model results we compared predicted dates of run starts sex specific mean ages on the run ranges of days of first hatching and mean total length of age1 fish in spring to published and unpublished field observations not used in the calibration of the model the model was run 50 times with only baseline natural mortality and temperature and rainfall data from 1962 2016 and the mean and 95th percentiles of the outputs were used for comparison 2 7 exploration of hypotheses of population changes to demonstrate the model s potential to explore factors that may have caused historical changes in alewife population characteristics we investigated three spatial mortality hypotheses historical responses were caused by 1 in river harvest only 2 in river striped bass predation and harvest and 3 ocean by catch in the atlantic herring fishery and in river harvest we expect population responses to differ among these hypotheses because most of the population is vulnerable to incidental capture in the ocean region whereas only immigrating mature adults are vulnerable to predation by striped bass in the river region time series of mortality rates attributed to each component were created from existing data in river exploitation rates from the monument river nelson et al 2011 were used to represent the fraction of adults harvested in the river system no harvest was assumed after 2005 because a moratorium in massachusetts has been in place since striped bass prey on migrating river herring e g davis et al 2012 predation mortality rates were associated with the river region and represented the daily fraction of the adults eaten in the river system values were derived from data on striped bass abundance and estimates of instantaneous total mortality from a statistical escapement at age model bycatch mortality rates representing the fraction of ocean population harvested by incidental capture were similarly derived by using new england atlantic herring fishery landings see section 18 of supplementary document for full details for each scenario the model was run 75 times runtime 65 hours with intel i7 6700 cpu 3 40 ghz for 55 years with water surface temperature and rainfall for years 1962 2016 trends related to climate change are evident in the time series supplemental document section 15 17 the model was initialized at the start of each run with the equilibrium population of juveniles and adults described above 3 results 3 1 global sensitivity results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is highly non linear and there are strong interactions among parameters fig 3 the top twenty parameters based on μ that play a significant role in the magnitude of fluctuations in model output are shown in table 8 the run size and mean length of adults on the run are sensitive primarily to changes in parameters from the bioenergetics sub model juvenile adult mortality equations post larvae yoy mortality and adult maturity table 8 the run sex ratio is most sensitive to changes in the p proportion used to split yoy into sexes and maturity and bioenergetics model parameters table 8 egg abundance is most sensitive to parameter changes in the bioenergetics model juvenile adult mortality equation and post larvae yoy mortality equation abundance of yoy is very sensitive to changes in lake carrying capacity post larvae yoy mortality and bioenergetics model parameters table 8 the mean length of age 1 fish on january 1 is sensitive primarily to changes in the bioenergetics model parameters table 8 3 2 model validation fig 4 shows the model output and data from published and unpublished field data model predictions of run starts matched well ranges of run starts observed in the parker river massachusetts during 1972 1978 cole et al 1976 cole et al 1978 in the annaquatucket river rhode island during 1971 and 1972 richkus 1974 and in multiple massachusetts systems monitored in 2014 rosset et al 2017 fig 4a the predicted mean age of female and male alewife during 1972 1978 agreed well with observed mean ages in the parker river cole et al 1976 cole et al 1978 fig 4b the range of model predictions of the first day of hatching was similar to those observed in field studies yako 1998 iafrate and oliviera 2008 devine 2017 fig 4c the model predicted well the mean lengths and 95 length percentiles of age 1 alewife compared to length data recorded in the ma dmf trawl survey and atlantic herring bycatch sampling during 2012 2016 fig 4d overall the model produced realistic trends and ranges of population characteristics observed historically 3 3 exploration of hypotheses of population changes generally harvest mortality has changed in an inverse relationship to recently dominant striped bass predation and bycatch mortality fig 5 all hypotheses produced similar trends in run size mean length and mean age through 1990 but changes in population characteristics were larger under hypotheses 2 in river harvest plus striped bass mortality and 3 in river harvest plus bycatch mortality because of higher combined mortalities fig 6 the largest decline in run size occurred when bycatch mortality was present but the simulated decline began much earlier 1991 than was observed in monument river fig 6 under hypotheses 2 and 3 the model simulated declines in mean total length starting in 1991 which was close to observed start years 1989 1990 but similar magnitudes in body size reduction 20 30 mm tl as observed in the monument river were not reproduced fig 6 the model under hypotheses 2 and 3 predicted declines in mean age of females and the trends and magnitudes under each hypothesis partially matched the trends and magnitudes observed in the monument river fig 6 4 discussion we have developed calibrated and validated a full life cycle model for alewife for evaluating hypotheses of potential causal factors affecting population dynamics key features of the model are that it 1 is structured sufficiently to provide realistic dynamics without being individually based 2 includes the full life cycle 3 includes a realistic growth model for yoy alewife 4 includes environmental drivers that are known to influence growth survival and migration processes during the first year of life 5 has a generalized spatial structure and 6 incorporates exploitation and predation this model should improve alewife restoration efforts by providing a tool to better understand factors influencing demographic trends and the consequences of potential management actions or environmental change the model is the first of its kind for alewife and is an advancement towards understanding the impact of exogeneous factors on the population dynamics of alewife however it is generic and is not a complete representation of all processes that may affect alewife population dynamics for example there are currently no links between prey abundance and growth of juvenile adults and yoy alewife or coupling between adult ocean migration and environmental variables in some aspects we had to develop methods that would simulate trends in population characteristics similar to those observed in the field without understanding underlying processes in other aspects processes had to be simplified or left out and many parameters were assumed constant because of lack of data as data become available additional details of underlying dynamics may be easily added given the flexible sub model structures and coding in the r language we have demonstrated the power of the model to explore population responses by simulating three hypotheses concerning spatial exploitation and predation under these simple hypotheses the model did predict similar trends in population characteristics as those observed historically in southern new england runs but the timing and or magnitudes of change were not always replicated this is not surprising given the limited hypotheses examined these results stress the fact that the reasons for the dramatic changes observed in the field are likely more complex to that end the model has the ability to evaluate complex hypotheses if sufficient data are available representing the specific aspects of growth and survival in a system the population consequences of management actions pertaining to juvenile adult alewife and its predators can be simulated through the link with mortality the effects of climate change expected to be a major stressor on alewife populations hare et al 2016 lynch et al 2015 on population responses could be examined because water temperature is directly coupled to the start of adult migration spawning initiation egg hatching rate yolk sac absorption growth mortality and emigration of post larval yoy stages while rainfall is linked to emigration of yoy for instance if forecasts of water temperatures are available the consequences of temperature related changes in reproductive processes e g earlier spawning times and or hatching times on dynamics that can impact future recruitment e g lowerre barbieri et al 1998 could be explored similarly if forecasts of rainfall are available the consequences of potential changes in yoy emigration timing as rainfall changes on similar dynamics and resulting processes could be examined the sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameters in the model are those associated with the post larvae yoy bioenergetics growth model and the juvenile adult yoy mortality relationships it is important that those parameters have a low degree of uncertainty associated with them to allow for accurate prediction unfortunately measures of uncertainty are not available for most parameters used in the model because many authors did not include statistics associated with model parameters e g stewart et al 1983 although some did include information on model fit e g r2 pepin 1991 appendix d for parameters with measures of uncertainty e g coefficients of variation precision appears reasonably high cvs 20 in most cases the lack of measures of uncertainty for many parameters does not mean the model predictions will be inaccurate stewart et al 1983 showed the bioenergetics model produces realistic growth predictions and will likely do so under a wide range of scenarios because most parameters were determined through laboratory studies in addition the pr relationships and ω2 were calibrated to field observations of post larvae and yoy sizes and predictions were validated against data not used in the calibration fig 4d similarly we are confident that the mortality relationships will also produce realistic values because they were calibrated to literature based observations of survival there are many biotic and environmental drivers affecting productivity of young alewife while in freshwater system kosa and mather 2001 yako et al 2002 based on the sensitivity analysis results the model outputs reflecting system productivity e g yoy abundance were most affected by changes in parameters of the growth and mortality components including the carrying capacity parameter although we developed components of the relationship from limited data in reality they are simple and generic it is unlikely that more detailed lake specific predictions of production could be made unless data on important abiotic and environmental drivers are known for each system ultimately lake specific differences in drivers will result in varying levels of production that will determine individual population resilience to anthropogenic and environmental stressors a benefit of creating an empirically based life cycle model is learning where gaps in our current knowledge of biological processes and population dynamics are more detailed information on alewife population dynamics are needed at all life stages some areas of necessity include alewife specific egg and yolk sac mortality rates relationships between yoy growth and prey and environmental and physiological influences that affect adult immigration and yoy emigration some of the biggest gaps in our knowledge pertain to the times yoy and adults spend in an estuary and ocean for yoy there is some general information on growth and broad habitat use between freshwater and estuarine environments turner and limburg 2012 turner and limburg 2016 however no information exists on the duration spent in an estuary prey species eaten in estuaries and the ocean spatial distribution mortality and movement patterns that would help improve our understanding of yoy dynamics and allow us to enter more detail into the model for adults general migration patterns are assumed north into the gulf of maine after spawning south to waters south of cape cod in the winter munroe 2002 but details on movements and spatial distribution for individual stocks or regional groups are needed to help resolve a multitude of fishery and climate change impacts asmfc 2012 hasselman et al 2016 hare et al 2016 lynch et al 2015 palkovacs et al 2013 this is particularly important since migration routes will influence the exposure of alewife to fisheries impacts over space and time bethoney et al 2017 over the past ten years alewife have been the focus of two endangered species act listing determinations a benchmark stock assessment and stock assessment update the resounding conclusion of all of these examinations is that status determination management and recovery of this species is hindered by a lack of data and tools this model represents a significant step forward in our ability to understand alewife population dynamics and should improve restoration efforts still until deeper understanding of underlying processes and long term time series of environmental and biological measures are available it may be impossible to identify primary factors responsible for the historical changes in alewife populations new technologies including bio logging e g dean et al 2017 and additional data collected across the life cycle will be key to closing the data gaps and making alewife assessment and

24883,over the last two decades major changes in abundance and population characteristics of alewife alosa pseudoharengus an anadromous herring species have been observed along the us atlantic coast loss of spawning habitat bycatch mortality in the directed pelagic fisheries increased predation mortality by rebounding predators such as striped bass changes in water flow and temperature affecting recruitment success changes in ocean thermal habitat and direct and indirect effects of changes in zooplankton community have been expounded by different researchers as putative hypotheses for population changes in alewife unfortunately long term concurrently measured time series of regional factors and direct measures of biological processes needed to elucidate underlying causes are severely lacking for alewife therefore we developed calibrated and validated a mechanistic spatially explicit full life cycle simulation model that can be used to explore population responses of alewife to various exogeneous drivers daily processes such as spawning recruitment mortality exploitation predation and movements are generated by using empirically derived deterministic and stochastic relationships and time series of environmental data linked to specific life stages we demonstrate the use of the model as an investigative tool by simulating three hypotheses and comparing model results to observed trends in alewife populations from southern new england keywords alewife life history simulation 1 introduction alewife alosa pseudoharengus is an ecologically important migratory anadromous herring species that ranges along the atlantic coast from labrador to south carolina loesch 1987 alewife spend most of their life at sea but enter freshwater in spring to spawn primarily in lakes and ponds after spawning alewife adults exit the freshwater system and are presumed to move offshore and northward to summer feeding grounds the large scale movement makes them important forage for many marine and freshwater fish predators such as striped bass morone saxatilis cod gadus morhua and yellow perch perca flavescens loesch 1987 as well as birds dalton et al 2009 in addition they are a key link in the transfer of nutrients between freshwater to marine systems mullen et al 1986 walters et al 2009 diaz et al 2019 over the last two decades major changes in abundance and population characteristics of alewife have been observed along the us atlantic coast schimdt et al 2003 asmfc 2017 in southern new england dramatic increases in run abundances of alewife occurred during the 1980s and 1990s but precipitous declines occurred after 2000 fig 1 a nelson et al 2011 davis and schultz 2009 in addition declines in mean body size fig 1b and mean age fig 1c of alewife have been observed in massachusetts rivers since the 1980s and currently are about 20 25 mm smaller than in the past nelson et al 2011 asmfc 2017 concurrently increases in total mortality and decreases in recruiting age classes have been noted fig 1d nelson et al 2011 asmfc 2017 researchers have expounded many hypotheses to explain the observed changes in population characteristics hall et al 2012 suggested that historical loss of spawning habitat and productivity due to damming of rivers has decreased the resiliency of alewife populations to increases in mortality sources such as harvesting direct in river harvest has varied over time but currently occurs only in maine and a handful of other locations with approved management plans asmfc 2017 moratoriums limit direct harvest throughout much of the species range however the occurrences of large incidental catches bycatch of alewife in atlantic herring clupea harengus and atlantic mackerel scomber scombrus fisheries off southern new england during fall and winter cournane et al 2013 have been identified by many asmfc 2012 hasselman et al 2016 palkovacs et al 2013 as a potential cause of changes in abundances increased predation mortality by rebounding predator populations like striped bass morone saxatilis and double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auritus have been suggested as a major cause as well dalton et al 2009 davis et al 2012 savoy and crecco 1995 schmidt et al 2003 other putative causes include variability in water temperature and flow affecting recruitment success tommasi et al 2015 changes in ocean thermal habitat lynch et al 2015 nye et al 2009 and direct and indirect effects of changes in zooplankton and phytoplankton composition kane 2011 pershing et al 2005 as a result of climate change with many factors potentially affecting growth and survival the complex nature of interactions between biotic and environmental factors and regional differences in some of those factors such as bycatch hasselman et al 2016 it seems unlikely that a single factor is responsible for the observed changes in alewife populations unfortunately long term concurrently measured time series of regional factors and direct measures of biological processes e g egg survival predation rates etc needed to elucidate underlying causes are severely lacking for alewife in the absence of long term datasets one method commonly used to understand complex biological and environmental relationships in natural systems is simulation modeling through simulation population responses to changes in hypothesized causal mechanisms can be explored and evaluated with models of population dynamics archambault et al 2018 watermeyer et al 2018 zeug et al 2012 such models allow researchers to conceptualize describe and analyze population behavior and ask what if questions about the real system because alewife populations are under the influence of multiple environmental predator and anthropogenic pressures at all life stages exploration of causal factors requires the development of a life cycle model that incorporates relationships between the stressors and population dynamics in this paper we present a comprehensive mechanistic spatially explicit full life cycle simulation model for predicting population responses of alewife the model is the first of its kind as processes such as spawning recruitment mortality exploitation predation and movements are generated by using empirically derived deterministic and stochastic relationships and time series of environmental data are linked to specific life stages in addition we validate the model by comparing predictions to data from published and unpublished studies not used in model calibration and show a detailed analysis of model sensitivities further we demonstrate how the model may be used as an investigative tool for exploring hypotheses related to population changes in alewife 2 methodology 2 1 general model description the simulation model developed in r r development core team 2016 is empirically based and incorporates egg yolk sac larval post larval young of the year juvenile immature fish of age 1 and greater and adult mature stages of alewife although the amount of detail varies among stages the population structure is sex specific length platoon goodyear 1989 2002 and age based meaning groups of individuals of a particular sex length platoon and age are followed through time over a daily time step the platoon based structure is an intermediate stance between all individuals of the same age progressing identically age based model and every individual have its own life path individual based model the model is specified to represent the regional ocean estuary river and lake sex female and male maturity and length differences in population dynamics fig 2 a the model was developed to differentiate among habitats such that different causes of mortality and changes in productivity can be examined specifically in the ocean juveniles and adults grow and die due to length related natural mortality and can experience size selective seasonal bycatch mortality from the bottom trawl and mid water trawl atlantic herring fisheries mature adults migrate to lake spawning habitat through estuary and river systems where they can experience in river harvest and undergo temperature dependent batch spawning in the lake once spawning is completed adults return to the ocean depending on the duration spent in each system fig 2a the sub model for age 0 dynamics is more detailed fig 2b daily batches of eggs laid by all spawning individuals on the same day are followed through time temperature determines development of egg and yolk sac stages first feeding post larvae experience initial carrying capacity mortality and length based natural mortality occurs thereafter in the post larval young of the year yoy stage a bioenergetics model is used to grow length platoons using area temperatures as input and platoons emigrate based on size temperature and rainfall duration of time spent in river and estuary is dependent on swimming speed and system length all yoy are moved to the ocean region by january 1 of the following year 2 2 juvenile adult sub model in this section we provide full details of the model processes for the juvenile adult sub model all functional relationships are empirically based and were taken from literature or estimated from unpublished field data descriptions of indexes are listed in table 1 definitions of mathematical symbols are given

components of juvenile and adult subgroups were defined as having nine ages last age is a plus group and one hundred length platoons in each age the number of length platoons was selected to obtain similar length frequency statistics mean standard deviation and percentiles as an individual based model that used identical growth rates 2 2 2 population dynamics the number of individuals n of juvenile and adult fish is modeled using an exponential decay equation specific to each region while in the ocean the number of fish surviving to the start of day d is dependent on bycatch mortality f and natural mortality m during day d 1 eq ja 1 length dependent daily bycatch mortality is calculated from annual instantaneous bycatch mortality user specified proportions representing monthly fractions of the fishing pattern and the number of days in a month the daily f is further sub divided in two fleet specific daily bycatch mortalities based on landings ratios derived from massachusetts division of marine fisheries madmf port sampling of the atlantic herring fisheries eq ja 2 length dependent fleet specific daily f is calculated by multiplying fleet specific daily f and fleet specific selectivity at length values developed by using an equilibrium model and observed bycatch lengths supplementary document section 1 natural mortality experienced by fishes is often related to body size or weight pepin 1991 lorenzen 1996 for alewife we developed an equation to predict daily m from length that is used for all juvenile and adult fish regardless of sex or region the lorenzen 1996 weight based m equation was altered to predict annual mortality from length by substituting a weight length equation for alewife sampled as bycatch eq ja 3 length dependent daily m is calculated by dividing the estimated annual m from length by the days in a year 365 migrating adult fish experience the same natural mortality rate while in estuary river and lake systems but additional harvest and predation mortality can occur in the river regional multipliers δ are available in eqs ja 1 ja 4 and ja 5 to adjust rates up or down if required in the simulation regional multipliers of 1 0 are used to obtain a baseline annual m of about 0 6 for ages 5 8 similar to gibson and myers 2003 2 2 3 growth the body length of platoon p on day d is calculated from body length at the start of day d 1 and the daily growth increment l eq ja 6 l is calculated from the annual growth increment formulation of the von bertalanffy equation quinn and deriso 1999 eq ja 7 and a sine function that generates the fraction of annual growth that occurs on a given day of the year eq ja 8 because alewife exhibit sexually dimorphic growth rates separate growth equations for female and male alewife were derived supplementary document section 2 2 2 4 movement of mature fish to estuary based on the university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography fish trawl survey https web

distribution appendix a all mature fish move together at the beginning of the selected day 2 2 5 movement of mature fish to river mature fish move through the freshwater system into river and lake and return using prior knowledge of temperature swimming speed ν and system length and estimated spawning duration is determined when a platoon enters the lake the number of fish that move into the river and those that remain in the estuary at the beginning of day d are calculated according to eqs ja 9 and ja 10 respectively where θd is the fraction migrating on day d the mechanisms controlling when and how many alewife enter a river are unknown therefore θd is simulated over time for a given year the start day of a run is the day on which the average of the current daily temperature and temperatures from the prior four days is 9 5 c this method was developed to obtain start days within the ranges observed in the monument river ma e g sheppard and bednarski 2015 the peak day and length of a run are selected randomly from uniform distributions run peak day 114 137 run length 63 87 days the start peak and end days are input parameters to a triangle distribution eq ja 11 and auto correlated errors are added to the probabilities to mimic the fluctuating run trends observed in the monument river eq ja 12 the initial probabilities p d s are standardized to 1 eq ja 13 to ensure that all fish move into the river by the end of the run θd is determined sequentially following eq ja 14 the duration spent in the river rdur is determined by the river length swimming speed

in the river and the entire group of fish moves together on that day 2 2 7 duration spent in lake the duration that a group spends in the lake sdur depends on when it enters during the run kissel 1974 the duration is generated from an exponential equation fitted to kissel 1974 data eq ja 16 and random deviates eq ja 17 are added to mimic the distributions of durations 2 2 8 reproduction for a group of fish entering the lake spawning activity commences on the day when the lake temperature reaches a minimum temperature threshold 10 5 c fay et al 1983 if a group of fish arrives before the minimum threshold is reached the first day of spawning is registered as the day when the minimum threshold is reached if a group of fish arrives after the minimum threshold is reached the first day of spawning spday is selected randomly from 4 to 8 days after lake entry as long as lake duration is 8 days otherwise the first spawning day is the day of lake entry the number of spawning events is determined by dividing the days spent in the lake by the average number of days between spawned egg batches bdur the next spawning event is determined by bdur 1 d day of spawning spawning occurs at the beginning of the day and the total number of eggs spawned by a group on a given day ed is calculated by eq ja 18 using literature values and a weight length equation eq ja 19 2 2 9 lake emigration

using the same equation for rdur except estuary length a user specified parameter that can be adjusted to retain fish longer is used eq ja 15 any fish remaining in the estuary are automatically moved

alewife bioenergetics model of stewart and binkowski 1986 with improvements by klumb et al 2003 this model is based on an energy balance equation b c r s er u where b is the daily increase in body weight c is daily consumption r is energy lost through metabolism s is energy lost to specific dynamic action er is energy lost in egestion and u is energy lost in excretion the definitions of symbols and the equations governing the functional relationships are given in tables 6 and 7 respectively parameter values are listed in appendix c daily consumption and standard metabolism are the only temperature dependent processes in the model in the growth sub model length of platoon p is first converted to weight using length weight equations depending on body length eq be 1 daily consumption joules g 1 d 1 by platoon p is then calculated following eq be 2 where cmax is the maximum specific feeding rate g g 1 d 1 dependent on size eq be 3 edp is the prey energy density joules g 1 calculated from prey specific energy densities for the average stomach contents of alewife post larvae in cohen 1976 pr is the proportion of maximum consumption dependent on body length and abundance eqs be 4 and be 5 and f td is the temperature dependence function for cold water species thornton and lessem 1978 eqs be 6 be 12 the pr and length lp relationships eq be 4 were developed and calibrated to obtain length ranges described in several published studies and unpublished field data from massachusetts and rhode island sampling programs that occurred in rivers lakes estuaries and ocean waters full details in supplementary document section11 a relationship between slope of the pr relationship and number of young on a given day was further developed to simulate density dependent growth eq be 5 full details in supplementary document section12 regional growth multipliers are included and the estuary region multiplier ω2 is set to 1 40 to match size data of young of the year alewife from narragansett bay rhode island respiration is calculated through a standard metabolism body weight relationship activity multiplier and a temperature dependence function eq be 13 where rp

daily body weight increase is derived via eqs be 20 be 22 the energy density ed joules g 1 of alewife to convert joules to grams is calculated from seasonal relationships between ed and body length eq be 22 to obtain the daily change in length weight is converted to length by using length weight equations eq be 23 because the observed daily lake temperature may not match the temperature actually selected by the young alewives an optimal temperature length relationship is used to replace the observed lake temperature usually measured at the surface when it exceeds the optimal temperature eq be 24 this assumes yoy are actively seeking optimal temperatures 2 4 5 emigration from lake based on results of gahagan et al 2010 movement of yoy from the lake is dependent on body size temperature and rainfall the first day of emigration can begin when the body length of any platoon exceeds the user specified migration size the end day of emigration is randomly picked to occur between day 304 and day 334 the number of fish that emigrate at the beginning of day d is calculated according to eq ey 17 in table 5 and the fraction emigrating is determined using temperature and rainfall relationships developed from raw data of gahagan et al 2010 eqs ey 18 ey 20 full details in supplementary document section 13 number of fish remaining in the lake is determined by eq ey 21 2 4 6 movement from river

the ocean region on january 1 of the following year and the yoy become immature age 1 fish numbers are split between sexes using a constant proportion of females p 2 4 7 mortality in river estuary and ocean mortality is calculated following eq ey 16 2 4 8 growth in river estuary and ocean daily growth in the river estuary and ocean is calculated by using the bioenergetics sub model the daily temperature from each region and the optimal temperature body size relationship 2 5 global sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of model outputs to input parameters were explored by using the method of morris 1991 this global sensitivity method was used to identify parameters with a range of negligible to strong impacts in addition the morris method identifies linear and nonlinear effects the morris method consists of several randomized one at a time experiments in which the effect of a parameter on the model output is assessed while keeping the other parameters constant van houwelingen et al 2011 the first step is to randomly draw a set of starting values within defined ranges of possible values for all input parameters running the model using these initial starting values and saving the model output the second step changes the value of one parameter by a random interval all other parameter values are those from the last run and the model output is then compared the previous run for comparison the elementary effect of the ith ee input parameter is calculated by e e i x t y x t y x t 1 δ i where y is the model output variable of interest t is the current run and i is the random change interval based on p 4 see van houwelingen et al 2011 for more details the process is repeated for the remaining variables the entire procedure is repeated r times r 10 in this paper each time with a different set of initial starting values the total number of runs needed for the analysis are r n 1 where n is the number of parameters the mean μ absolute mean μ and standard deviation σ are then calculated for the ith input parameter by μ i j 1 r e e i j r μ i j 1 r e e i j r σ i j 1 r e e i j μ i 2 r the interpretation of a parameter s effect is based on the coupled μ and σ values low μ and σ values imply a parameter has a low impact on the model output high μ and low σ imply a parameter has high linear impacts on the model low μ and high σ values imply a parameter has high nonlinear impacts on the model and high μ and high σ values imply a parameter has high nonlinear impacts on the model and or strong interactions with other parameters loubiere et al 2016 we explored the sensitivity of only seventy five parameters because valid minimum maximum ranges could not be derived for some given lack of literature e g the temperature function parameters used in the bioenergetics model or changes in individual parameters could not be examined independently e g the polynomial relationship parameters between hatching success and temperature without producing non sensical values the list of parameters with corresponding ranges for the uniform distributions are provided in table d 1 ranges were derived mainly from literature but when lacking ranges were also derived from standard error estimates 2 se of parameters e g male and female von bertalanffy growth or from within a biologically realistic range based on our best judgement e g p for each run the model was initialized with an equilibrium population of juveniles and adults full details in supplementary document section 14 the model was then run for 30 years duration population reaches equilibrium with new parameters using regional temperature and rainfall data from 1962 1992 obtained from various data sources or developed from air temperature for the region of narragansett bay through southern massachusetts full details in supplementary document sections 15 17 the last year s derived values of run size mean length of adults in the river sex ratio on the run egg abundance yoy cumulative river abundance and age 1 mean length on january 1 were recorded and used to examine input parameter sensitivities 2 6 model validation confidence in the performance of the model may be evaluated in terms of its ability as a predictive tool balci 1998 to validate model results we compared predicted dates of run starts sex specific mean ages on the run ranges of days of first hatching and mean total length of age1 fish in spring to published and unpublished field observations not used in the calibration of the model the model was run 50 times with only baseline natural mortality and temperature and rainfall data from 1962 2016 and the mean and 95th percentiles of the outputs were used for comparison 2 7 exploration of hypotheses of population changes to demonstrate the model s potential to explore factors that may have caused historical changes in alewife population characteristics we investigated three spatial mortality hypotheses historical responses were caused by 1 in river harvest only 2 in river striped bass predation and harvest and 3 ocean by catch in the atlantic herring fishery and in river harvest we expect population responses to differ among these hypotheses because most of the population is vulnerable to incidental capture in the ocean region whereas only immigrating mature adults are vulnerable to predation by striped bass in the river region time series of mortality rates attributed to each component were created from existing data in river exploitation rates from the monument river nelson et al 2011 were used to represent the fraction of adults harvested in the river system no harvest was assumed after 2005 because a moratorium in massachusetts has been in place since striped bass prey on migrating river herring e g davis et al 2012 predation mortality rates were associated with the river region and represented the daily fraction of the adults eaten in the river system values were derived from data on striped bass abundance and estimates of instantaneous total mortality from a statistical escapement at age model bycatch mortality rates representing the fraction of ocean population harvested by incidental capture were similarly derived by using new england atlantic herring fishery landings see section 18 of supplementary document for full details for each scenario the model was run 75 times runtime 65 hours with intel i7 6700 cpu 3 40 ghz for 55 years with water surface temperature and rainfall for years 1962 2016 trends related to climate change are evident in the time series supplemental document section 15 17 the model was initialized at the start of each run with the equilibrium population of juveniles and adults described above 3 results 3 1 global sensitivity results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is highly non linear and there are strong interactions among parameters fig 3 the top twenty parameters based on μ that play a significant role in the magnitude of fluctuations in model output are shown in table 8 the run size and mean length of adults on the run are sensitive primarily to changes in parameters from the bioenergetics sub model juvenile adult mortality equations post larvae yoy mortality and adult maturity table 8 the run sex ratio is most sensitive to changes in the p proportion used to split yoy into sexes and maturity and bioenergetics model parameters table 8 egg abundance is most sensitive to parameter changes in the bioenergetics model juvenile adult mortality equation and post larvae yoy mortality equation abundance of yoy is very sensitive to changes in lake carrying capacity post larvae yoy mortality and bioenergetics model parameters table 8 the mean length of age 1 fish on january 1 is sensitive primarily to changes in the bioenergetics model parameters table 8 3 2 model validation fig 4 shows the model output and data from published and unpublished field data model predictions of run starts matched well ranges of run starts observed in the parker river massachusetts during 1972 1978 cole et al 1976 cole et al 1978 in the annaquatucket river rhode island during 1971 and 1972 richkus 1974 and in multiple massachusetts systems monitored in 2014 rosset et al 2017 fig 4a the predicted mean age of female and male alewife during 1972 1978 agreed well with observed mean ages in the parker river cole et al 1976 cole et al 1978 fig 4b the range of model predictions of the first day of hatching was similar to those observed in field studies yako 1998 iafrate and oliviera 2008 devine 2017 fig 4c the model predicted well the mean lengths and 95 length percentiles of age 1 alewife compared to length data recorded in the ma dmf trawl survey and atlantic herring bycatch sampling during 2012 2016 fig 4d overall the model produced realistic trends and ranges of population characteristics observed historically 3 3 exploration of hypotheses of population changes generally harvest mortality has changed in an inverse relationship to recently dominant striped bass predation and bycatch mortality fig 5 all hypotheses produced similar trends in run size mean length and mean age through 1990 but changes in population characteristics were larger under hypotheses 2 in river harvest plus striped bass mortality and 3 in river harvest plus bycatch mortality because of higher combined mortalities fig 6 the largest decline in run size occurred when bycatch mortality was present but the simulated decline began much earlier 1991 than was observed in monument river fig 6 under hypotheses 2 and 3 the model simulated declines in mean total length starting in 1991 which was close to observed start years 1989 1990 but similar magnitudes in body size reduction 20 30 mm tl as observed in the monument river were not reproduced fig 6 the model under hypotheses 2 and 3 predicted declines in mean age of females and the trends and magnitudes under each hypothesis partially matched the trends and magnitudes observed in the monument river fig 6 4 discussion we have developed calibrated and validated a full life cycle model for alewife for evaluating hypotheses of potential causal factors affecting population dynamics key features of the model are that it 1 is structured sufficiently to provide realistic dynamics without being individually based 2 includes the full life cycle 3 includes a realistic growth model for yoy alewife 4 includes environmental drivers that are known to influence growth survival and migration processes during the first year of life 5 has a generalized spatial structure and 6 incorporates exploitation and predation this model should improve alewife restoration efforts by providing a tool to better understand factors influencing demographic trends and the consequences of potential management actions or environmental change the model is the first of its kind for alewife and is an advancement towards understanding the impact of exogeneous factors on the population dynamics of alewife however it is generic and is not a complete representation of all processes that may affect alewife population dynamics for example there are currently no links between prey abundance and growth of juvenile adults and yoy alewife or coupling between adult ocean migration and environmental variables in some aspects we had to develop methods that would simulate trends in population characteristics similar to those observed in the field without understanding underlying processes in other aspects processes had to be simplified or left out and many parameters were assumed constant because of lack of data as data become available additional details of underlying dynamics may be easily added given the flexible sub model structures and coding in the r language we have demonstrated the power of the model to explore population responses by simulating three hypotheses concerning spatial exploitation and predation under these simple hypotheses the model did predict similar trends in population characteristics as those observed historically in southern new england runs but the timing and or magnitudes of change were not always replicated this is not surprising given the limited hypotheses examined these results stress the fact that the reasons for the dramatic changes observed in the field are likely more complex to that end the model has the ability to evaluate complex hypotheses if sufficient data are available representing the specific aspects of growth and survival in a system the population consequences of management actions pertaining to juvenile adult alewife and its predators can be simulated through the link with mortality the effects of climate change expected to be a major stressor on alewife populations hare et al 2016 lynch et al 2015 on population responses could be examined because water temperature is directly coupled to the start of adult migration spawning initiation egg hatching rate yolk sac absorption growth mortality and emigration of post larval yoy stages while rainfall is linked to emigration of yoy for instance if forecasts of water temperatures are available the consequences of temperature related changes in reproductive processes e g earlier spawning times and or hatching times on dynamics that can impact future recruitment e g lowerre barbieri et al 1998 could be explored similarly if forecasts of rainfall are available the consequences of potential changes in yoy emigration timing as rainfall changes on similar dynamics and resulting processes could be examined the sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameters in the model are those associated with the post larvae yoy bioenergetics growth model and the juvenile adult yoy mortality relationships it is important that those parameters have a low degree of uncertainty associated with them to allow for accurate prediction unfortunately measures of uncertainty are not available for most parameters used in the model because many authors did not include statistics associated with model parameters e g stewart et al 1983 although some did include information on model fit e g r2 pepin 1991 appendix d for parameters with measures of uncertainty e g coefficients of variation precision appears reasonably high cvs 20 in most cases the lack of measures of uncertainty for many parameters does not mean the model predictions will be inaccurate stewart et al 1983 showed the bioenergetics model produces realistic growth predictions and will likely do so under a wide range of scenarios because most parameters were determined through laboratory studies in addition the pr relationships and ω2 were calibrated to field observations of post larvae and yoy sizes and predictions were validated against data not used in the calibration fig 4d similarly we are confident that the mortality relationships will also produce realistic values because they were calibrated to literature based observations of survival there are many biotic and environmental drivers affecting productivity of young alewife while in freshwater system kosa and mather 2001 yako et al 2002 based on the sensitivity analysis results the model outputs reflecting system productivity e g yoy abundance were most affected by changes in parameters of the growth and mortality components including the carrying capacity parameter although we developed components of the relationship from limited data in reality they are simple and generic it is unlikely that more detailed lake specific predictions of production could be made unless data on important abiotic and environmental drivers are known for each system ultimately lake specific differences in drivers will result in varying levels of production that will determine individual population resilience to anthropogenic and environmental stressors a benefit of creating an empirically based life cycle model is learning where gaps in our current knowledge of biological processes and population dynamics are more detailed information on alewife population dynamics are needed at all life stages some areas of necessity include alewife specific egg and yolk sac mortality rates relationships between yoy growth and prey and environmental and physiological influences that affect adult immigration and yoy emigration some of the biggest gaps in our knowledge pertain to the times yoy and adults spend in an estuary and ocean for yoy there is some general information on growth and broad habitat use between freshwater and estuarine environments turner and limburg 2012 turner and limburg 2016 however no information exists on the duration spent in an estuary prey species eaten in estuaries and the ocean spatial distribution mortality and movement patterns that would help improve our understanding of yoy dynamics and allow us to enter more detail into the model for adults general migration patterns are assumed north into the gulf of maine after spawning south to waters south of cape cod in the winter munroe 2002 but details on movements and spatial distribution for individual stocks or regional groups are needed to help resolve a multitude of fishery and climate change impacts asmfc 2012 hasselman et al 2016 hare et al 2016 lynch et al 2015 palkovacs et al 2013 this is particularly important since migration routes will influence the exposure of alewife to fisheries impacts over space and time bethoney et al 2017 over the past ten years alewife have been the focus of two endangered species act listing determinations a benchmark stock assessment and stock assessment update the resounding conclusion of all of these examinations is that status determination management and recovery of this species is hindered by a lack of data and tools this model represents a significant step forward in our ability to understand alewife population dynamics and should improve restoration efforts still until deeper understanding of underlying processes and long term time series of environmental and biological measures are available it may be impossible to identify primary factors responsible for the historical changes in alewife populations new technologies including bio logging e g dean et al 2017 and additional data collected across the life cycle will be key to closing the data gaps and making alewife assessment and

24884,we integrated a widely used forest growth and management model the forest vegetation simulator with the fsim large wildfire simulator to study how management policies affected future wildfire over 50 years on a 1 3 million ha study area comprised of a us national forest and adjacent lands the model leverages decades of research and development on the respective forest growth and wildfire simulation models and their integration creates a strategic forest landscape model that has a high degree of transparency in the existing user communities the study area has been targeted for forest restoration investments in response to wildland fires that are increasingly impacting ecological conditions conservation areas amenity values and surrounding communities we simulated three alternative spatial investment priorities and three levels of management intensity area treated over a 50 year timespan and measured the response in terms of area burned fire severity wildland urban interface exposure and timber production we found that the backlog of areas in need of restoration on the national forest could be eliminated in 20 years when the treatment rate was elevated to a maximum of 3 the current level however higher rates of treatments early in the simulation created a future need to address the rapid buildup of fuels associated with understory shrub and tree regeneration restoration treatments over time had a large effect on fire severity on average reducing potential flame length by up to 26 for the study area within the first 20 years whereas reductions in area burned were relatively small although wildfire contributed to reducing flame length over time area burned was only 16 of the total disturbed area managed and burned with prescribed fire under the 3 management intensity interactions among spatial treatment scenarios and treatment intensities were minimal although inter annual variability was extreme with the coefficient of variation in burned area exceeding 200 we also observed simulated fires that exceeded four times the historically recorded fire size fire regime variability has manifold significance since very large fires can homogenize fuels and eliminate clumpy stand structure that historically reduced fire size and maintained landscape resiliency we discuss specific research needs to better understand future wildfire activity and the relative influence of climate fuels fire feedbacks and management to achieve fire resiliency goals on western us fire frequent forests keywords forest restoration forest landscape model wildfire simulation forest vegetation simulator fsim 1 introduction forest landscape models flms are important tools used to address a wide range of forest management policy tradeoffs on public and private forests shifley et al 2017 here we narrow our definition of flms to systems that at a minimum can model forest growth succession management and major disturbances wildfire insects pathogens at large scales e g 50 000 ha several recent studies using flms have examined the effects of forest and fuels management on future wildfire activity carbon water yield resiliency and other forest attributes barros et al 2017 hurteau et al 2019 o donnell et al 2018 spies et al 2017 studying longer term e g 20 years dynamics between management and disturbances can reveal important ecosystem tipping points feedbacks and unintended consequences of management activities halofsky et al 2014 spies et al 2014 that are difficult to otherwise detect most recently applications of flms have provided insights on the potential effects of management on future fire and forest composition under a range of climate change scenarios lucash et al 2018 many of these studies in the us have used portions of the large 76 million ha national forest network as study areas where wildfires are increasingly impacting ecosystem services and burning into adjacent developed areas despite the growing number of studies flms are substantially underutilized as scenario planning tools to craft forest policy in response to changing climate and disturbances existing studies sample a small portion of the physiographic conditions both in the us and globally moreover the inherent complexity of modelling forest and fuel management systems under a highly stochastic background of wildfire activity contributes to contradictory findings among studies forest restoration programs on public and private lands in the us are funded in excess of 1 billion usd per year yet there lacks a definitive set of case studies that identify long term forest management options and priorities to achieve specific goals prioritizing forest management options is a complex tradeoff problem where multiple and conflicting objectives must be balanced under economic and social constraints barros et al 2019 pohjanmies et al 2019 spies et al 2017 investments to improve flm frameworks and conduct further case studies can play an important role in advancing collaborative planning butler et al 2015 peterson et al 2003 and pave the way for efficient ecological restoration investment strategies in many forest systems noss et al 2009 one essential part of advancing the application of flms for scenario planning is improving model transparency to stakeholders and other scientists for instance some models abstract landscapes into development states gaps cohorts fire regimes and other strata that represent average conditions that may not exist in real landscapes this simplification has been necessary due to a shortage of detailed inventory information at landscape scales and computational constraints however with the development and broader application of imputation methods detailed stand level forest inventory and fuel data are now widely available landfire 2013a riley et al 2016 these new data make it feasible to scale up well developed high resolution forest stand simulation models that leverage decades of development and application by researchers and practitioners one such model is the forest vegetation simulator fvs crookston and dixon 2005 an individual tree growth model that inputs actual stand inventory data populations of trees and simulates a wide range of forest management actions for most major us tree species forest types and stand conditions the model can be used to simulate forest stand growth succession carbon insect outbreaks economics and stand scale wildfire the model has seen wide application in the field for stand growth and management and significant investments in development crookston and havis 2002 havis and crookston 2008 keyser and keyser 2017 rathbun et al 2012 teck et al 1997 but has not yet been leveraged to build a fully functional flm the potential to extend fvs to landscapes is made possible with the fvs parallel processing extension fvs ppe crookston and stage 1991 which provides for coordinated landscape modelling by processing stands in parallel i e reading a stand inventory for the landscape and then pausing each time step to spatially re prioritize management using internal or external algorithms and data fvs ppe was used to dynamically prioritize and constrain landscape management activities to examine management impacts on carbon old growth and northern spotted owl strix occidentalis caurina habitat ager et al 2007a b ager et al 2010 finney et al 2007 linked fvs ppe to a spatial treatment optimization algorithm to demonstrate the importance of strategically locating fuel treatments to reduce fire spread however none of these studies incorporated wildfire as an endogenous disturbance agent that changed forest conditions over time another modelling system that has not been leveraged for flms is the family of fire simulation models developed by usda forest service researchers e g farsite flammap fsim and fspro ager et al 2011 finney 2006 finney et al 2011 noonan wright et al 2011 riley et al 2018 these models are widely used in the us and abroad to model large fire occurrence spread intensity and suppression and to assess the effects of restoration and fuels management on fire behavior in particular the fsim model finney et al 2011 has been used for numerous assessments of wildfire exposure and risk haas et al 2013 despite the wide application and significant investments in these respective systems neither has been integrated into an flm with one recent exception where the underlying fire behavior code library brittain 2017 was integrated into the envision agent based flm ager et al 2018 barros et al 2017 spies et al 2017 in this study we describe the development and application of a new flm lsim which integrates the aforementioned fvs crookston and dixon 2005 with fsim finney et al 2011 lsim has the functionality to simulate spatially coordinated forest management over time under a background of large stochastic wildfires using submodels that have undergone decades of field application this is in contrast to other flms that have yet to be used to guide site specific management activities as part of forest and fuels management on national forests the lsim model provides a platform to simulate detailed prescriptions developed by silviculturalists in the field e g rathbun et al 2012 as part of forest landscape management projects we applied the model to the deschutes national forest in central oregon usa to study how accelerated forest restoration might affect future wildfire area burned fire severity fire exposure to the wildland urban interface wui and commercial timber production the forest has a history of large fires that are increasingly impacting conservation amenity values and developed areas and extensive forest management and restoration programs are underway aimed at reducing fire impacts we discuss future application of flms to address wildfire management and conservation policy issues on public wildlands in the western us 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprises 1 336 176 ha that include a mix of public and private lands composed mostly of the 696 538 ha deschutes national forest dnf and a 10 km buffer outside the dnf proclaimed boundary that includes lands managed by the fremont winema national forest confederated tribes of warm springs state of oregon and the bureau of land management fig 1 we added a 10 km buffer to eliminate edge effects on simulated wildfires the dnf is currently partitioned into 18 planning areas fig 1 and treatments within these areas are regulated by the dnf land and resource management plan usda forest service 1990 the northwest forest plan usda and usdi 1994 and pacfish henderson et al 2005 stands available for treatment hereafter manageable areas correspond to 55 of the dnf and are within the general forest matrix and deer habitat designations while the untreatable stands are primarily designated as wilderness intensive recreation and a variety of other special management designations private inholdings and wui in the study area account for 121 000 ha and 63 140 ha respectively we used the wui boundary mapped by the interagency central oregon fire management service and the state of oregon the wui is primarily located along the northeast boundary of the dnf and in the central southern portion of the study area fig 1 the study area sits along the eastern slope of the cascade range in central oregon with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 and well drained soils developed on lava plains climate is semiarid mean annual precipitation is about 20 cm and mean annual temperature is about 9 c the east west edaphic and topographic gradients exert a strong influence on vegetation types and distribution the dnf is diverse and encompasses wet subalpine and mixed conifer mountain forests on the steeper slopes of the cascades and dry mixed conifer dry pine and semi arid juniper woodlands on more gently sloping topography at a lower elevation the study area contains extensive forestlands with lodgepole pine pinus contorta ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii white fir abies concolor and mountain hemlock tsuga mertensiana with cooler wet subalpine forest abies spp to the west and semi arid juniper juniperus occidentalis woodlands and arid shrublands to the east about 24 of the study area contains dry mixed conifer forests with lesser amounts of high elevation forests 15 ponderosa pine 13 and wet mixed conifer 13 forests juniper and lodgepole pine forests combined cover about 18 with the remaining lands consisting of arid shrub steppe and non vegetated areas 17 much of the lower elevation forested area has dense understories as a result of fire suppression and partial harvest during the 20th century that removed many of the large fire resistant ponderosa pine and douglas fir despite an increase over the last decade in thinning and underburning activities aimed to promote fire resiliency merschel et al 2014 fire history in the area is extensive with an average of 342 ignitions per year between 1992 and 2013 which burned an average of 6689 ha per year short 2017 although area burned per year is highly variable ranging from 49 to 48 873 ha wildfire activity has seen a significant jump in the past decade with several large fires in the study area including the b b complex fire in 2003 36 733 ha sunnyside turnoff in 2013 21 448 ha and the pole creek fire in 2012 10 843 ha 2 2 overview of lsim model components 2 2 1 forest vegetation modelling system lsim simulates vegetation succession and management using the forest vegetation simulator fvs crookston 2005 fvs is a distance independent individual tree model that uses empirical growth relationships to model stand development and mortality the unit of simulation is a homogeneous stand polygon that is described by inventory data on tree density by species and size along with broader site information including elevation aspect and ecotype crookston and dixon 2005 there are 22 variants of the model that cover all the major forested regions in the us the model is widely used in research and in operations to design silvicultural treatments crookston and havis 2002 havis and crookston 2008 keyser and keyser 2017 many fvs extensions have been developed including stand scale modelling of carbon forest economics fuels and fire behavior see table 1 in crookston and dixon 2005 a geospatial arcmap interface to fvs is available and provides point click functionality to execute fvs and view projected inventory data in the stand using the stand visualization system within arcmap ager et al 2011 the source code for fvs is freely available in the public domain and the model has been modified for use in other countries robinson and monserud 2003 fvs is executed using an ascii keyword file that identifies the source file with inventory data a battery of simulation parameters on the site condition simulation period and instructions for management actions if any although a large number of simulation parameters can be specified for a single stand simulation the model can be run with less than 10 keyword statements the keyword file is accompanied by an ascii file or microsoft access database containing inventory data the inventory file specifies trees per hectare species and size for each stratum in the stand further details are provided below for specific modelling functionality lsim uses a specific version of fvs created by crookston and stage 1991 to behave as a landscape model where groups of stands are processed in parallel through time rather than in a serial fashion where the simulation over time is completed one stand at a time this version the parallel processing extension fvs ppe processes a set of stands for a given time period and then pauses execution to allow for exogenous programs to execute and provide information for the next cycle in our implementation these programs included spatial algorithms to prioritize stands for management and fire intensity for stands that burned in a wildfire as described below in lsim existing fvs calculations of tree growth mortality and other aspects of forest dynamics were left intact but several modifications to the underlying fvs ppe code were necessary to improve performance and scalability these modifications made it feasible to simulate 50 year scenarios for large landscapes 600 000 ha in less than an hour our modifications were built out of open fvs source code revision 11 20 13 for fvs ppe and the southern oregon and northeast california variant of fvs keyser 2008 modifications to the fvs ppe included 1 removing the limit on the number of stands to simulate 2 multi threading to allow the use of multiple processors 3 storing data in ram to improve between cycle processing 4 replacement of the original fvs fuel model logic with a user defined customized logic and 5 multi scale prioritization ranging from stand to planning area level 2 2 2 fire modelling we incorporated a fire simulation submodel by linking in the fsim large fire simulator finney et al 2011 fsim simulates large fire events in contrast to stand scale fire behavior modelled in the fvs ffe and uses the minimum time travel mtt algorithm where rates of fire spread are predicted by semi empirical fire behavior equations rothermel 1972 scott and reinhardt 2001 and crown fire is modelled after wagner 1977 and rothermel 1991 the mtt algorithm calculates fire spread by identifying the shortest travel time among nodes of a gridded lattice finney 2002 this method minimizes distortion to fire shapes compared to spread models that use cellular automata or contagion algorithms a binary raster stack is used to store landscape attributes describing surface and canopy fuels and topography section 2 3 4 supplementary appendix c fig c1 fsim simulates daily fire activity over a fire season using empirical relationships between energy release component erc finney et al 2011 and fire activity probability spread containment erc has been shown in multiple studies to be a strong driver of fire ignition spread and containment ager et al 2018 finney et al 2011 prior to the simulation relationships between erc and fire probability are calculated in firefamily bradshaw and mccormick 2000 using empirical weather data obtained from remote automated weather stations western regional climate center 2014 and historical records of area burned short 2015 these estimates are stored in a parameters file fdist for fsim the same program is used to estimate time series parameters to describe seasonal trends autocorrelation and daily standard deviation in erc using daily raws weather data supplementary appendix c fig c2 daily data on wind speed and fuel moisture are generated as well finney et al 2011 fig 3 wind is modelled in fsim using a joint probability distribution of speed and direction the data are sampled from the afternoon hours for each month from monthly distributions these estimates are also stored in the fdist parameters file at execution the program iterates though the fire season one day at a time using the erc fire probability model to determine if there is an ignition and daily weather inputs and fuels in the location of the ignition to determine fire spread the fire spreads according to daily weather until contained according to a containment model supplementary appendix c fig c3 the containment model predicts effective suppression using historical relationships between containment success and daily erc values finney et al 2009 outputs from the fire simulation include a perimeter shapefile and flame length raster grids for the study area 2 2 3 integrating fsim and fvs integrating fsim and fvs i e lsim required a wrapper to sequence their execution over time and transfer data between the programs at specified time intervals fig 2 we used five year intervals instead of annual fire simulations to improve model performance associated with building the fuels landscape files at each 5 year cycle lsim pauses the vegetation modelling translates the forest inventory information in fvs to a binary raster stack formatted as required by fsim and then executes fsim to simulate five seasons of fires supplementary appendix c fig 3 when the wildfire simulation is complete wildfire behavior for each pixel is passed back to fvs overlaid with the stand polygon layer and the inventory is adjusted for wildfire impacts figs 2 and 3 the specific methods used for calculating fire effects on tree mortality are described in section 2 3 6 below the execution of fvs is then resumed for the next cycle this same method was employed in prior studies to calculate tree mortality from landscape fire simulation models ager et al 2010 2 3 model parameters 2 3 1 forest and fuels management we developed multipurpose stand prescriptions based on management practices on the dnf and implemented them using fvs keywords supplementary appendix a table a2 on the bulk of the dnf management is directed to restore low severity fire regimes by reducing surface and ladder fuels and retaining large fire resilient ponderosa pine and douglas fir prescriptions were specific to each of the major cover types on the dnf table 1 as determined from forest vegetation maps and supported by empirical studies as effective for reducing potential fire behavior stephens and moghaddas 2005 stephens et al 2009 simulated treatment actions included different combinations of thinning followed by surface fuel reduction treatment biomass removal pile burning or prescribed fire supplementary appendix a table a2 treatment actions were allocated based on cover type and variable species specific thresholds of trees ha 1 stand density index sdi or basal area time since fire and fuel loads prescribed fire parameters fuel moistures and wind speed were chosen to replicate typical fall prescribed burning on the dnf supplementary appendix c table c2 2 3 2 forest growth and mortality we modelled forest growth and mortality for each of 48 835 stands using the south central oregon and northeast california variant so of fvs described in detail in keyser 2008 different variants are used to reflect differences in tree growth mortality and volume models for different geographical regions the so variant uses data from forest inventories research plots silviculture stand assessments and tree plantation studies on public and private lands to derive growth relationships for 33 species keyser 2008 in fvs trees are grown in two different ways depending on the tree diameter for small trees dbh 7 62 cm growth is height driven height increments are predicted first for each species followed by diameter growth small tree diameter growth is predicted via several species using variant specific curves that predict diameter as a function of height by design in the so variant western juniper juniperus occidentalis trees of all diameters are always grown as small trees for large trees dbh 7 62 cm growth is driven by diameter with slightly different approaches depending on the stand location within the so variant region for the dnf diameter increments are predicted based on the periodic change in inside bark diameter as a function of habitat type plant association or site index location stand aspect slope and elevation stand crown competition factor crown to total tree height ratio and total basal area for trees that are larger than the subject tree dixon 2002 keyser 2008 height growth of large trees is estimated based on site index curves specific for each species keyser 2008 tree mortality in the so variant reflects background mortality and does not include increases in mortality from insects and pathogens modelling tree mortality from wildfire is described in section 2 3 6 the so variant estimates background and stand density related mortality based on sdi users can define the maximum sdi based on species species groups or use the variant default value stand density related mortality occurs when tree density is the primary agent of competition and mortality begins when stand sdi is 55 of the maximum sdi threshold for the stand when density related mortality occurs the number of trees that are estimated to die depends on the relationship between the stand sdi and maximum sdi threshold background mortality begins when the stand sdi is 55 of the maximum sdi threshold the number of trees that die from background mortality is calculated based on an equation that is species specific and accounts for the length of the cycle keyser 2008 once the total number of trees dying is estimated from either background or density related mortality mortality rates are dispersed to individual tree records this is done by selecting trees based on the individual tree s percentile in the basal area distribution adjusted by a species specific factor that accounts for the species tolerance keyser 2008 2 3 3 regeneration forest regeneration was modelled using a version of the blue mountains regeneration model robinson 2007 that was modified to include species unique to our study area supplementary appendix b the regeneration model was developed from extensive forest regeneration survey data obtained from the wallowa whitman national forest waw la grande ranger district regeneration models in fvs are typically developed using the event monitor extension crookston 1990 and keyword commands that add seedlings to stands after disturbances the model used logistic regression to predict the probability of regeneration based on site variables slope aspect elevation residual overstory canopy cover and basal area m2 by species in the stand the blue mountains regeneration model was incorporated into previous studies that examined 50 year management scenarios on the waw ager et al 2007b extensive testing was carried out as part of these latter studies using single stand simulations in fvs and the stand visualization system svs mcgaughey 2002 in this process forest and fuels management was simulated in fvs using a sample of ca 100 stands with varying conditions in terms of species and basal area the resulting stand images from svs over time 30 years were reviewed by silviculture staff in a subjective evaluation process and it was determined that the model performed well under a range of stand conditions providing reasonable estimates of regeneration for different stand types and treatments we adapted the blue mountains regeneration model supplementary appendix b for use on the dnf by cross walking species unique to the dnf with the closest analog in the blue mountains supplementary appendix b table b1 2 for example the ponderosa pine equations in the blue mountains were also used for sugar pine pinus lambertiana regeneration on the dnf we note that the dominant species ponderosa pine douglas fir grand fir are the same on the two national forests regeneration is added to the inventory at each cycle in a process where fvs writes an ascii output file containing current stand information for species specific trees ha 1 basal area and canopy closure and then executes the regeneration model the latter model computes regeneration counts by species then writes the information to an ascii file which is read by fvs and used to update the inventory record for each stand 2 3 4 landscape fuel dynamics surface fuel succession in fvs is handled by the fvs fire and fuels fire and fuels extension fvs ffe our system deviated from the original fvs ffe surface fuel model logic to account for temporal live fuel variability particularly in shrubby lifeforms on each lsim cycle fuel models are selected based on live woody load fuel bed depth plant association type hall 1998 time since disturbance and canopy cover supplementary appendix a fig a1 fuel models in the study area were a combination of the original set of thirteen fuel models anderson 1982 and the full set of 40 fuel models developed by scott and burgan 2005 surface fuel models for the portion of the study area within the dnf were modelled over time using custom fuel model logic supplementary appendix a fig a1 and outputs from processing the national forest inventory data through fvs ffe canopy fuels that described canopy cover canopy base height canopy bulk density and total stand height were also obtained from fvs ffe outputs for initial conditions and through time both surface and canopy fuels in the buffer around the study area and inholdings fig 1 were initially assigned with landfire 2008 rapid refresh fbfm40 data landfire 2013b other landscape inputs for fire modelling were also obtained from landfire and included elevation slope and aspect krasnow et al 2009 rollins 2009 after discussions with local fuels planners we chose a timber litter tl2 fuel model scott and burgan 2005 to represent treated stands 2 3 5 wildfire calibration as described above fsim requires local calibration to model daily fire occurrence and generate synthetic fire weather streams upon which ignition probabilities are estimated for this process we used a 20 year 1992 2011 weather record from the lava butte remote automated weather station western regional climate center 2014 located 5 km south of bend or and fire history from short 2015 these data were processed with firefamily bradshaw and mccormick 2000 to generate the fsim parameter files fdist and frisk supplementary appendix c fig c2 in this study we assumed random ignition locations within the study area although there are some ignition hotspots related to recreation use within the dnf ager et al 2018 and the fsim program can be used with ignition probability grids we had no basis to assume these hotspots would persist and affect large fire location over the 50 year simulation period 2 3 6 wildfire caused mortality wildfire caused tree mortality was predicted using fire behavior outputs fireline intensity fli from fsim and the stand fire modelling functionality in fvs fvs has the capability to model stand scale fire and predict mortality based on the first order fire effects model fofem reinhardt et al 2008 the process requires flame length scorch height and percentage crown fraction burned for each stand supplementary appendix c table c1 first fireline intensity grids from fsim were converted to flame length m using byram s equation with wilson 1980 modification i b i r 60 12 6 r σ where ir kw m 1 is the fireline intensity r is the surface fire spread rate m min 1 and σ is the surface area to volume ratio of the fuel bed m 1 scorch height sht was calculated as sht 3 2808 6 026 pow fl 3 2808 1 4466 we then estimated crown percentage burned based on the scorch height relative to the critical flame length for crowning we then simulated a fire using fvs and the above parameters specifically we used the flameadjust keyword to set the fire parameters and simulated a fire with the fvs simfire keyword additional parameters for the fire included windspeed of 30 kph fuel moistures as outlined in supplementary appendix c table c2 and air temperature of 23 9 c these latter parameters were held constant for each stand if polygons were partially burned we assumed they burned in entirety using a 50 cutoff as determined by the number of burned pixels 2 4 forest management scenarios we implemented three treatment priorities to prioritize planning areas and select stands for treatment that reflect existing management practices on the dnf treatment priorities addressed key management issues related to wildfire threats to the adjacent wui distwui fire resiliency and forest restoration firesev and economic potential econ from commercial thinning the objectives of the treatment priorities table 2 were to treat stands 1 closer to the wui 2 with higher potential fire severity and 3 higher volume respectively distance to the wui was calculated for each stand based on the shortest distance between the stand s centroid and the nearest wui polygon potential fire severity versus that from a simulated wildfire in fsim was estimated for each stand using fvs ffe s potfmort function which returns potential severe fire mortality as a percentage of total basal area assuming a wind speed of 32 km hr 1 and fuel moistures of 4 4 5 10 15 70 for 1 h 10 h 100 h 1000 h duff and live fuels respectively live fuels are separated into two classes for fuel moisture purposes live woody and live herbaceous basal area of trees 53 cm dbh those that can be harvested based on dnf harvest prescriptions was the priority metric for econ and was calculated for each stand based on merchantable volume reported by fvs each treatment priority was designed to test the expected effect on a given response variable table 2 prioritizing distance to wui was expected to reduce area burned in the wui targeting areas with high potential mortality was expected to both reduce wildfire caused mortality and potential flame length finally treating stands with the highest basal area was expected to maximize timber volume and reduce volume killed by wildfire these three prioritization criteria were implemented at three different levels 36 000 ha per five year cycle 72 000 ha per five year cycle and 108 000 ha per five year cycle corresponding to current 1 doubling 2 and tripling 3 the current treatment target on the dnf respectively note that the actual treatment intensity may or may not have met the target dependent on the availability of stands that met the treatment threshold based on management practices on the dnf the combination of a treatment priority distwui firesev econ with a treatment level 1 2 3 is referred to as a scenario resulting in a total of nine simulation scenarios 2 5 simulation sequence and response metrics we simulated scenarios in five year time steps over 50 years hereafter referred to as a cycle the sequence of activities including management growth and mortality regeneration wildfire and wildfire effects is shown in fig 2 in each cycle five years of management followed by five years of wildfire were simulated the latter as predicted by the fsim model each scenario was executed over 30 replicates to capture variability in wildfire impacts response variables associated with each prioritization metric are shown in table 2 for each scenario we examined the spatial arrangement of area treated and summarized area treated area burned volume harvested and volume killed by wildfire we quantified cumulative area burned over time in the wui for each scenario to provide a measure of potential fire behavior at the landscape scale we calculated potential flame length the latter describes the expected flame length if the entire study area burned under a predefined set of fire weather potential flame length provides a response to the effect of treatments for the whole study area whereas area burned over time can only capture the effect of treatments when they are intersected by a simulated fire we calculated potential flame length by post processing fuels landscapes at the end of each lsim cycle with a command line version of flammap brittain 2017 using a southwest wind azimuth and wind speed of 29 km h 1 3 results 3 1 treatment location treatments clustered in different locations for each of the three treatment priorities with firesev treatments allocated along the east and west side of the dnf and econ mostly focusing on the east side fig 4 the distwui priority resulted in a pattern that initially placed treatments near the wui but over time spread away from the wui as closer areas that were eligible to treat decreased fig 5 thus the distwui priority generated the desired treatment pattern increasing treatment levels led to greater area being treated but maintained the spatial restrictions to treating within planning areas thus reflecting typical management on real landscapes 3 2 area treated the average area treated for each treatment priority was 0 8 1 1 4 2 and 1 4 3 of the total land base i e both managed and unmanaged lands fig 6 at the lowest treatment level this corresponded to seven times more area treated than burned the latter corresponds to approximately 0 2 of the total land base with minor variations among priorities and treatment levels under the 1 treatment intensity all scenarios met the annual treatment target throughout the duration of the simulated 50 year period however when treatment levels were doubled and tripled the treatment rates dropped as the area eligible for treatment was reduced below the treatment target eligible stands could no longer meet treatment targets around year 25 for all 2 scenarios and approximately 5 years earlier for the 3 scenarios similar results showing a shortage of areas to treat under accelerated restoration scenarios were found by barros et al 2017 for the same study area but using a different landscape simulation model simulated area treated varied among replicates within scenario particularly under higher treatment targets for the econ priority fig 6 variability in the area treated among replicates had two causes 1 the effect of wildfires on stand treatment priorities and 2 the alteration of landscape conditions over time in relation to the metrics for each of the three specific priorities because the spatial distribution of treatments was different among the three metrics the potential for fire treatment interactions depended on whether a particular scenario concentrated or scattered treatments fig 5 3 3 area burned variability in annual area burned differed among both replicates and years and between scenarios the coefficient of variation cv among replicates in total area burned across the simulation period averaged 31 compared to an interannual cv of 223 comparison with the area burned from historical fires between 1990 2012 shows similar interannual variability fig 7 the replicates varied in terms of the timing and location of fire events the map of fire perimeters by decade during one simulation for the firesev 1x scenario fig 8 showed that fires are generally distributed throughout the landscape and do not show marked change in size over the simulation period despite fuel treatments the distwui priority was more effective at reducing area burned in the wui than alternative scenarios but differences between distwui and alternative priorities under 1 and 2 were small fig 9 reduction in area burned in the wui was more effective under 3 corresponding to a 10 reduction in area burned percentage area burned for the manageable and non manageable land base showed a larger effect for the former compared to the latter fig 10 non manageable lands were those that were placed into reserves according to the dnf forest plan the reduction in area burned for the non manageable lands demonstrates a shadow effect of the treatments it occurred primarily under the firesev and distwui priorities because treatment placement resulted in more treated stands on the east side of the dnf adjacent to non manageable lands fig 4 temporal trends in area burned were slight or nonexistent over the 50 year simulation suggesting that at current fire levels the combined changes in vegetation and fuels from succession and management were not sufficient to change overall fire activity within the study area fig 10 however landscape fire resilience measured as a decrease in potential flame length increased on manageable lands fig 11 during the first decade and remained stable for the remainder of the simulation time whereas in non manageable lands flame length remained the same throughout the 50 year period this result is surprising because it suggests that vegetation succession and fuel accumulation on non manageable areas are not contributing to increasing flame lengths in addition all prioritization scenarios resulted in the same reduction in flame length on treated lands contrary to what we hypothesized this suggests that at comparable treatment levels the alternative prioritization scenarios achieved landscape conditions that resulted in similar potential flame lengths allowing for tradeoffs in other landscape services and values 3 4 volume harvested and volume killed by fire average volume harvested per hectare increased over time and was higher for 1 than for 2 and 3 across all priorities because thinning out the smaller trees allowed larger trees to continue to grow at an increased rate fig 12 under 1 more trees were left to grow across the landscape than in 2 and 3 comparatively once a stand was thinned it became unavailable for harvest until the basal area increased which allowed the remaining trees to grow in the interim this resulted in increased volume over time as stands that were thinned became available for harvest the distwui priority showed a more stable harvest volume per hectare throughout the trajectory because it did not target high volume stands specifically so stands that were added to meet the area target had an increasingly lower stand density in the firesev and econ priorities standing merchantable volume killed by wildfire increased over time in non manageable areas fig 13 in treatable areas volume killed by fire on a per hectare basis was more or less constant with a slight increase in year 30 4 discussion we found that accelerating forest and fuels management led to non linear changes in landscape conditions that stabilized after 20 30 years when the backlog of areas to treat under current thresholds was eliminated however accelerating treatments created a pulse of early seral forests that required treatments later in the simulation management treatments had a strong effect on potential fire intentsity reducing potential flame length for the entire study area on averge by up to 26 within the first 20 years by contrast reductions in fire activity as measured by area burned were relatively small which was surprising given that we assumed simulated treatments would substantially reduce fuels and fire spread the lack of effect is partly because 60 of the dnf is in reserves where mechanical treatments are prohibited thus ensuring ample fuels for new ignitions to burn without encountering either treatments or past fire footprints where fuels are reduced we did note however that fire activity on non manageable areas was affected by treatment intensity in the manageable areas thus creating a spillover effect between adjacent treated and non treated landscapes large reserves occur on all western us national forests covering between 30 60 of their total area and include wilderness roadless and other conservation and amenity reserves where mechanical management is prohibited another explanation is that the re treatment cycle relative to the rate of fuels succession was inadequate to maintain landscapes with low to moderate spread rates rapid succession of herbaceous and brush fuels within the study area has been well documented dyrness and youngberg 1966 as well as increased flammability from needle drape on bitterbrush purshia tridentata a key observation from the study is the substantial inter annual variability in area burned illustrating the possibility of alternative future landscape conditions under the same management policy the interannual coefficient of variation cv exceeded 200 and was almost 10 fold larger than the inter replicate cv our estimate from simulation was very close to inter annual variability in the historical record 1992 2009 236 we expected lower inter replicate variability since variation in area burned is averaged over the simulation period for each replicate the importance of variability versus the mean area burned is often overlooked and is important since landscape response to fire events is nonlinear with fire size high variation in area burned can accelerate landscape change and set the stage for larger future fires via fuel homogenization hessburg et al 2016 in other words resilient forests can absorb the effects of many small fires better than fewer larger ones churchill et al 2013 and presumably this is why clumpy spatial structure in fire prone forests is a key factor in resiliency thus inter annual variance in fire size is perhaps as important as the mean area burned given similar intensities in terms of landscape change the substantial inter annual and inter replicate variability we observed in the model is not often reported nor observed in other landscape simulation studies differences among the spatial treatment strategies were minor compared to treatment intensity meaning that location was less important than area treated this finding was most surprising for the wui scenario where treatments targeted areas near wui over the simulation period we estimated that fires will burn through 30 40 of the total wui area including re burning wui area burned for the wui scenario was reduced from 35 to 28 between the 1 and 3 management strategies a small difference compared to simulation studies with static landscapes and similar focus on treatments ager et al 2016 scott et al 2016 the lack of differences was in part caused by overlapping treatment locations among the spatial strategies fig 4 where over time project areas rotate through much of the same area this study resulted in a new landscape modelling system that leverages decades of forest service research and development by virtue of its coupling with fvs the model has immediate potential applications in a range of studies concerning the combined and independent effects of fire and management on fire regimes feedbacks stand structure forest patch size distributions carbon wildfire habitat amenity protection and economics the model can be adapted to any forested region in the us using the 20 existing fvs extensions the lsim model is not limited to small landscapes e g thousands of hectares as reported for the underlying fvs ppe in a recent review of flms shifley et al 2017 lsim provides a landscape framework to replicate detailed silvicultural modelling as provided for in the fvs prescription keywords the wildfire simulation submodel fsim is widely used for planning and risk assessment in the us haas et al 2013 integrating existing models like fvs and fsim that have respective user communities and prior management application helps convey a high degree of transparency to agency managers and scientists which is a key step to further advance the application of forest landscape models for ecological restoration spies et al 2014 enhancements to lsim includes fire weather that incorporates projected climate change using energy release component data from future climate scenarios projected by the global circulation models in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 abatzoglou and brown 2012 climate induced changes in vegetation can also be modelled with lsim via the fvs climate change extension crookston 2014 crookston et al 2010 one key advantage of lsim over perhaps all other flms is the assimilation of the fvs economics extension martin 2009 which provides for detailed financial analyses of wood products and revenues from forest and fuels management economic factors are the primary limiting factor in ecological restoration programs in the western us barbour et al 2008 stephens et al 2016 due to low value of wood products in many areas with overstocked stands and high fire risk ager et al 2017 estimating revenue from logging activities requires simulating the harvesting process where trees are bucked into logs and each log is valued based on species and small end diameter martin 2009 log values by species and size are available from local and national reporting agencies bber 2019b likewise logging fuel treatment and hauling costs are widely available from empirical data or harvest cost models bber 2019a fried et al 2016 net revenue from management activities can be calculated by subtracting harvesting and hauling costs from log values wider application of financial analyses to prioritize restoration treatments can help improve the efficiency of restoration efforts by pinpointing where timber revenues are positive and treatments are needed to reduce risks and hazards ager et al 2017 for instance our results showed that higher levels of harvest activities i e 3x resulted in as much as a 150 drop in the volume per hectare of harvested material compared with lower levels of harvest fig 12 meaning that areas that could potentially pay for high cost restoration treatments e g fuel mastication rapidly diminish as area treated increases these results suggest a non linear cost of restoration as management activities are accelerated in terms of area treated landscape modelling of forest management activities on us public forestlands is a complicated multiscale prioritization problem that is only approximated in other landscape models for instance it is possible that some studies allocate treatment in a given time step throughout the study area e g syphard et al 2011 rather than our process of replicating the current practice of implementing planning areas 5000 30 000 ha one at a time and sequencing the planning areas according to management priorities stand level prescriptions are also complex in that they are typically multi year sequences of mechanical thinning surface fuels mastication piling and prescribed fire all tuned to local stand structure species composition and fire regime to meet multiple forest health resiliency and fire management objectives churchill et al 2013 cochran et al 1994 haugo et al 2015 o hara et al 2010 all of these activities are governed by site specific directions in forest plans that specify a wide range of forest management constraints ager et al 2016 ringo et al 2015 studies that simulate decades of prescribed fire as the only landscape treatment hurteau et al 2016 krofcheck et al 2017 are unrealistic on national forests where federal laws mandate commercial harvest to fund restoration and contribute to rural economies moreover prescribed fire has both operational constraints and highly variable effects on tree mortality including impacts on large trees which makes it difficult to schedule on large landscapes over time further advances in landscape modelling and additional case studies will provide information that can help landowners and managers understand how divergent management intensities and spatial strategies can potentially change current wildfire trajectories over time these models can also be used to reinforce the uncertainty associated with wildfire management policies by illustrating how highly stochastic wildfire events can mask progress towards a management goal enhancing these models to include agent based decision frameworks spies et al 2014 and climate change hulse et al 2016 can contribute to improved risk governance systems by disentangling the relative

24884,we integrated a widely used forest growth and management model the forest vegetation simulator with the fsim large wildfire simulator to study how management policies affected future wildfire over 50 years on a 1 3 million ha study area comprised of a us national forest and adjacent lands the model leverages decades of research and development on the respective forest growth and wildfire simulation models and their integration creates a strategic forest landscape model that has a high degree of transparency in the existing user communities the study area has been targeted for forest restoration investments in response to wildland fires that are increasingly impacting ecological conditions conservation areas amenity values and surrounding communities we simulated three alternative spatial investment priorities and three levels of management intensity area treated over a 50 year timespan and measured the response in terms of area burned fire severity wildland urban interface exposure and timber production we found that the backlog of areas in need of restoration on the national forest could be eliminated in 20 years when the treatment rate was elevated to a maximum of 3 the current level however higher rates of treatments early in the simulation created a future need to address the rapid buildup of fuels associated with understory shrub and tree regeneration restoration treatments over time had a large effect on fire severity on average reducing potential flame length by up to 26 for the study area within the first 20 years whereas reductions in area burned were relatively small although wildfire contributed to reducing flame length over time area burned was only 16 of the total disturbed area managed and burned with prescribed fire under the 3 management intensity interactions among spatial treatment scenarios and treatment intensities were minimal although inter annual variability was extreme with the coefficient of variation in burned area exceeding 200 we also observed simulated fires that exceeded four times the historically recorded fire size fire regime variability has manifold significance since very large fires can homogenize fuels and eliminate clumpy stand structure that historically reduced fire size and maintained landscape resiliency we discuss specific research needs to better understand future wildfire activity and the relative influence of climate fuels fire feedbacks and management to achieve fire resiliency goals on western us fire frequent forests keywords forest restoration forest landscape model wildfire simulation forest vegetation simulator fsim 1 introduction forest landscape models flms are important tools used to address a wide range of forest management policy tradeoffs on public and private forests shifley et al 2017 here we narrow our definition of flms to systems that at a minimum can model forest growth succession management and major disturbances wildfire insects pathogens at large scales e g 50 000 ha several recent studies using flms have examined the effects of forest and fuels management on future wildfire activity carbon water yield resiliency and other forest attributes barros et al 2017 hurteau et al 2019 o donnell et al 2018 spies et al 2017 studying longer term e g 20 years dynamics between management and disturbances can reveal important ecosystem tipping points feedbacks and unintended consequences of management activities halofsky et al 2014 spies et al 2014 that are difficult to otherwise detect most recently applications of flms have provided insights on the potential effects of management on future fire and forest composition under a range of climate change scenarios lucash et al 2018 many of these studies in the us have used portions of the large 76 million ha national forest network as study areas where wildfires are increasingly impacting ecosystem services and burning into adjacent developed areas despite the growing number of studies flms are substantially underutilized as scenario planning tools to craft forest policy in response to changing climate and disturbances existing studies sample a small portion of the physiographic conditions both in the us and globally moreover the inherent complexity of modelling forest and fuel management systems under a highly stochastic background of wildfire activity contributes to contradictory findings among studies forest restoration programs on public and private lands in the us are funded in excess of 1 billion usd per year yet there lacks a definitive set of case studies that identify long term forest management options and priorities to achieve specific goals prioritizing forest management options is a complex tradeoff problem where multiple and conflicting objectives must be balanced under economic and social constraints barros et al 2019 pohjanmies et al 2019 spies et al 2017 investments to improve flm frameworks and conduct further case studies can play an important role in advancing collaborative planning butler et al 2015 peterson et al 2003 and pave the way for efficient ecological restoration investment strategies in many forest systems noss et al 2009 one essential part of advancing the application of flms for scenario planning is improving model transparency to stakeholders and other scientists for instance some models abstract landscapes into development states gaps cohorts fire regimes and other strata that represent average conditions that may not exist in real landscapes this simplification has been necessary due to a shortage of detailed inventory information at landscape scales and computational constraints however with the development and broader application of imputation methods detailed stand level forest inventory and fuel data are now widely available landfire 2013a riley et al 2016 these new data make it feasible to scale up well developed high resolution forest stand simulation models that leverage decades of development and application by researchers and practitioners one such model is the forest vegetation simulator fvs crookston and dixon 2005 an individual tree growth model that inputs actual stand inventory data populations of trees and simulates a wide range of forest management actions for most major us tree species forest types and stand conditions the model can be used to simulate forest stand growth succession carbon insect outbreaks economics and stand scale wildfire the model has seen wide application in the field for stand growth and management and significant investments in development crookston and havis 2002 havis and crookston 2008 keyser and keyser 2017 rathbun et al 2012 teck et al 1997 but has not yet been leveraged to build a fully functional flm the potential to extend fvs to landscapes is made possible with the fvs parallel processing extension fvs ppe crookston and stage 1991 which provides for coordinated landscape modelling by processing stands in parallel i e reading a stand inventory for the landscape and then pausing each time step to spatially re prioritize management using internal or external algorithms and data fvs ppe was used to dynamically prioritize and constrain landscape management activities to examine management impacts on carbon old growth and northern spotted owl strix occidentalis caurina habitat ager et al 2007a b ager et al 2010 finney et al 2007 linked fvs ppe to a spatial treatment optimization algorithm to demonstrate the importance of strategically locating fuel treatments to reduce fire spread however none of these studies incorporated wildfire as an endogenous disturbance agent that changed forest conditions over time another modelling system that has not been leveraged for flms is the family of fire simulation models developed by usda forest service researchers e g farsite flammap fsim and fspro ager et al 2011 finney 2006 finney et al 2011 noonan wright et al 2011 riley et al 2018 these models are widely used in the us and abroad to model large fire occurrence spread intensity and suppression and to assess the effects of restoration and fuels management on fire behavior in particular the fsim model finney et al 2011 has been used for numerous assessments of wildfire exposure and risk haas et al 2013 despite the wide application and significant investments in these respective systems neither has been integrated into an flm with one recent exception where the underlying fire behavior code library brittain 2017 was integrated into the envision agent based flm ager et al 2018 barros et al 2017 spies et al 2017 in this study we describe the development and application of a new flm lsim which integrates the aforementioned fvs crookston and dixon 2005 with fsim finney et al 2011 lsim has the functionality to simulate spatially coordinated forest management over time under a background of large stochastic wildfires using submodels that have undergone decades of field application this is in contrast to other flms that have yet to be used to guide site specific management activities as part of forest and fuels management on national forests the lsim model provides a platform to simulate detailed prescriptions developed by silviculturalists in the field e g rathbun et al 2012 as part of forest landscape management projects we applied the model to the deschutes national forest in central oregon usa to study how accelerated forest restoration might affect future wildfire area burned fire severity fire exposure to the wildland urban interface wui and commercial timber production the forest has a history of large fires that are increasingly impacting conservation amenity values and developed areas and extensive forest management and restoration programs are underway aimed at reducing fire impacts we discuss future application of flms to address wildfire management and conservation policy issues on public wildlands in the western us 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprises 1 336 176 ha that include a mix of public and private lands composed mostly of the 696 538 ha deschutes national forest dnf and a 10 km buffer outside the dnf proclaimed boundary that includes lands managed by the fremont winema national forest confederated tribes of warm springs state of oregon and the bureau of land management fig 1 we added a 10 km buffer to eliminate edge effects on simulated wildfires the dnf is currently partitioned into 18 planning areas fig 1 and treatments within these areas are regulated by the dnf land and resource management plan usda forest service 1990 the northwest forest plan usda and usdi 1994 and pacfish henderson et al 2005 stands available for treatment hereafter manageable areas correspond to 55 of the dnf and are within the general forest matrix and deer habitat designations while the untreatable stands are primarily designated as wilderness intensive recreation and a variety of other special management designations private inholdings and wui in the study area account for 121 000 ha and 63 140 ha respectively we used the wui boundary mapped by the interagency central oregon fire management service and the state of oregon the wui is primarily located along the northeast boundary of the dnf and in the central southern portion of the study area fig 1 the study area sits along the eastern slope of the cascade range in central oregon with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 and well drained soils developed on lava plains climate is semiarid mean annual precipitation is about 20 cm and mean annual temperature is about 9 c the east west edaphic and topographic gradients exert a strong influence on vegetation types and distribution the dnf is diverse and encompasses wet subalpine and mixed conifer mountain forests on the steeper slopes of the cascades and dry mixed conifer dry pine and semi arid juniper woodlands on more gently sloping topography at a lower elevation the study area contains extensive forestlands with lodgepole pine pinus contorta ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii white fir abies concolor and mountain hemlock tsuga mertensiana with cooler wet subalpine forest abies spp to the west and semi arid juniper juniperus occidentalis woodlands and arid shrublands to the east about 24 of the study area contains dry mixed conifer forests with lesser amounts of high elevation forests 15 ponderosa pine 13 and wet mixed conifer 13 forests juniper and lodgepole pine forests combined cover about 18 with the remaining lands consisting of arid shrub steppe and non vegetated areas 17 much of the lower elevation forested area has dense understories as a result of fire suppression and partial harvest during the 20th century that removed many of the large fire resistant ponderosa pine and douglas fir despite an increase over the last decade in thinning and underburning activities aimed to promote fire resiliency merschel et al 2014 fire history in the area is extensive with an average of 342 ignitions per year between 1992 and 2013 which burned an average of 6689 ha per year short 2017 although area burned per year is highly variable ranging from 49 to 48 873 ha wildfire activity has seen a significant jump in the past decade with several large fires in the study area including the b b complex fire in 2003 36 733 ha sunnyside turnoff in 2013 21 448 ha and the pole creek fire in 2012 10 843 ha 2 2 overview of lsim model components 2 2 1 forest vegetation modelling system lsim simulates vegetation succession and management using the forest vegetation simulator fvs crookston 2005 fvs is a distance independent individual tree model that uses empirical growth relationships to model stand development and mortality the unit of simulation is a homogeneous stand polygon that is described by inventory data on tree density by species and size along with broader site information including elevation aspect and ecotype crookston and dixon 2005 there are 22 variants of the model that cover all the major forested regions in the us the model is widely used in research and in operations to design silvicultural treatments crookston and havis 2002 havis and crookston 2008 keyser and keyser 2017 many fvs extensions have been developed including stand scale modelling of carbon forest economics fuels and fire behavior see table 1 in crookston and dixon 2005 a geospatial arcmap interface to fvs is available and provides point click functionality to execute fvs and view projected inventory data in the stand using the stand visualization system within arcmap ager et al 2011 the source code for fvs is freely available in the public domain and the model has been modified for use in other countries robinson and monserud 2003 fvs is executed using an ascii keyword file that identifies the source file with inventory data a battery of simulation parameters on the site condition simulation period and instructions for management actions if any although a large number of simulation parameters can be specified for a single stand simulation the model can be run with less than 10 keyword statements the keyword file is accompanied by an ascii file or microsoft access database containing inventory data the inventory file specifies trees per hectare species and size for each stratum in the stand further details are provided below for specific modelling functionality lsim uses a specific version of fvs created by crookston and stage 1991 to behave as a landscape model where groups of stands are processed in parallel through time rather than in a serial fashion where the simulation over time is completed one stand at a time this version the parallel processing extension fvs ppe processes a set of stands for a given time period and then pauses execution to allow for exogenous programs to execute and provide information for the next cycle in our implementation these programs included spatial algorithms to prioritize stands for management and fire intensity for stands that burned in a wildfire as described below in lsim existing fvs calculations of tree growth mortality and other aspects of forest dynamics were left intact but several modifications to the underlying fvs ppe code were necessary to improve performance and scalability these modifications made it feasible to simulate 50 year scenarios for large landscapes 600 000 ha in less than an hour our modifications were built out of open fvs source code revision 11 20 13 for fvs ppe and the southern oregon and northeast california variant of fvs keyser 2008 modifications to the fvs ppe included 1 removing the limit on the number of stands to simulate 2 multi threading to allow the use of multiple processors 3 storing data in ram to improve between cycle processing 4 replacement of the original fvs fuel model logic with a user defined customized logic and 5 multi scale prioritization ranging from stand to planning area level 2 2 2 fire modelling we incorporated a fire simulation submodel by linking in the fsim large fire simulator finney et al 2011 fsim simulates large fire events in contrast to stand scale fire behavior modelled in the fvs ffe and uses the minimum time travel mtt algorithm where rates of fire spread are predicted by semi empirical fire behavior equations rothermel 1972 scott and reinhardt 2001 and crown fire is modelled after wagner 1977 and rothermel 1991 the mtt algorithm calculates fire spread by identifying the shortest travel time among nodes of a gridded lattice finney 2002 this method minimizes distortion to fire shapes compared to spread models that use cellular automata or contagion algorithms a binary raster stack is used to store landscape attributes describing surface and canopy fuels and topography section 2 3 4 supplementary appendix c fig c1 fsim simulates daily fire activity over a fire season using empirical relationships between energy release component erc finney et al 2011 and fire activity probability spread containment erc has been shown in multiple studies to be a strong driver of fire ignition spread and containment ager et al 2018 finney et al 2011 prior to the simulation relationships between erc and fire probability are calculated in firefamily bradshaw and mccormick 2000 using empirical weather data obtained from remote automated weather stations western regional climate center 2014 and historical records of area burned short 2015 these estimates are stored in a parameters file fdist for fsim the same program is used to estimate time series parameters to describe seasonal trends autocorrelation and daily standard deviation in erc using daily raws weather data supplementary appendix c fig c2 daily data on wind speed and fuel moisture are generated as well finney et al 2011 fig 3 wind is modelled in fsim using a joint probability distribution of speed and direction the data are sampled from the afternoon hours for each month from monthly distributions these estimates are also stored in the fdist parameters file at execution the program iterates though the fire season one day at a time using the erc fire probability model to determine if there is an ignition and daily weather inputs and fuels in the location of the ignition to determine fire spread the fire spreads according to daily weather until contained according to a containment model supplementary appendix c fig c3 the containment model predicts effective suppression using historical relationships between containment success and daily erc values finney et al 2009 outputs from the fire simulation include a perimeter shapefile and flame length raster grids for the study area 2 2 3 integrating fsim and fvs integrating fsim and fvs i e lsim required a wrapper to sequence their execution over time and transfer data between the programs at specified time intervals fig 2 we used five year intervals instead of annual fire simulations to improve model performance associated with building the fuels landscape files at each 5 year cycle lsim pauses the vegetation modelling translates the forest inventory information in fvs to a binary raster stack formatted as required by fsim and then executes fsim to simulate five seasons of fires supplementary appendix c fig 3 when the wildfire simulation is complete wildfire behavior for each pixel is passed back to fvs overlaid with the stand polygon layer and the inventory is adjusted for wildfire impacts figs 2 and 3 the specific methods used for calculating fire effects on tree mortality are described in section 2 3 6 below the execution of fvs is then resumed for the next cycle this same method was employed in prior studies to calculate tree mortality from landscape fire simulation models ager et al 2010 2 3 model parameters 2 3 1 forest and fuels management we developed multipurpose stand prescriptions based on management practices on the dnf and implemented them using fvs keywords supplementary appendix a table a2 on the bulk of the dnf management is directed to restore low severity fire regimes by reducing surface and ladder fuels and retaining large fire resilient ponderosa pine and douglas fir prescriptions were specific to each of the major cover types on the dnf table 1 as determined from forest vegetation maps and supported by empirical studies as effective for reducing potential fire behavior stephens and moghaddas 2005 stephens et al 2009 simulated treatment actions included different combinations of thinning followed by surface fuel reduction treatment biomass removal pile burning or prescribed fire supplementary appendix a table a2 treatment actions were allocated based on cover type and variable species specific thresholds of trees ha 1 stand density index sdi or basal area time since fire and fuel loads prescribed fire parameters fuel moistures and wind speed were chosen to replicate typical fall prescribed burning on the dnf supplementary appendix c table c2 2 3 2 forest growth and mortality we modelled forest growth and mortality for each of 48 835 stands using the south central oregon and northeast california variant so of fvs described in detail in keyser 2008 different variants are used to reflect differences in tree growth mortality and volume models for different geographical regions the so variant uses data from forest inventories research plots silviculture stand assessments and tree plantation studies on public and private lands to derive growth relationships for 33 species keyser 2008 in fvs trees are grown in two different ways depending on the tree diameter for small trees dbh 7 62 cm growth is height driven height increments are predicted first for each species followed by diameter growth small tree diameter growth is predicted via several species using variant specific curves that predict diameter as a function of height by design in the so variant western juniper juniperus occidentalis trees of all diameters are always grown as small trees for large trees dbh 7 62 cm growth is driven by diameter with slightly different approaches depending on the stand location within the so variant region for the dnf diameter increments are predicted based on the periodic change in inside bark diameter as a function of habitat type plant association or site index location stand aspect slope and elevation stand crown competition factor crown to total tree height ratio and total basal area for trees that are larger than the subject tree dixon 2002 keyser 2008 height growth of large trees is estimated based on site index curves specific for each species keyser 2008 tree mortality in the so variant reflects background mortality and does not include increases in mortality from insects and pathogens modelling tree mortality from wildfire is described in section 2 3 6 the so variant estimates background and stand density related mortality based on sdi users can define the maximum sdi based on species species groups or use the variant default value stand density related mortality occurs when tree density is the primary agent of competition and mortality begins when stand sdi is 55 of the maximum sdi threshold for the stand when density related mortality occurs the number of trees that are estimated to die depends on the relationship between the stand sdi and maximum sdi threshold background mortality begins when the stand sdi is 55 of the maximum sdi threshold the number of trees that die from background mortality is calculated based on an equation that is species specific and accounts for the length of the cycle keyser 2008 once the total number of trees dying is estimated from either background or density related mortality mortality rates are dispersed to individual tree records this is done by selecting trees based on the individual tree s percentile in the basal area distribution adjusted by a species specific factor that accounts for the species tolerance keyser 2008 2 3 3 regeneration forest regeneration was modelled using a version of the blue mountains regeneration model robinson 2007 that was modified to include species unique to our study area supplementary appendix b the regeneration model was developed from extensive forest regeneration survey data obtained from the wallowa whitman national forest waw la grande ranger district regeneration models in fvs are typically developed using the event monitor extension crookston 1990 and keyword commands that add seedlings to stands after disturbances the model used logistic regression to predict the probability of regeneration based on site variables slope aspect elevation residual overstory canopy cover and basal area m2 by species in the stand the blue mountains regeneration model was incorporated into previous studies that examined 50 year management scenarios on the waw ager et al 2007b extensive testing was carried out as part of these latter studies using single stand simulations in fvs and the stand visualization system svs mcgaughey 2002 in this process forest and fuels management was simulated in fvs using a sample of ca 100 stands with varying conditions in terms of species and basal area the resulting stand images from svs over time 30 years were reviewed by silviculture staff in a subjective evaluation process and it was determined that the model performed well under a range of stand conditions providing reasonable estimates of regeneration for different stand types and treatments we adapted the blue mountains regeneration model supplementary appendix b for use on the dnf by cross walking species unique to the dnf with the closest analog in the blue mountains supplementary appendix b table b1 2 for example the ponderosa pine equations in the blue mountains were also used for sugar pine pinus lambertiana regeneration on the dnf we note that the dominant species ponderosa pine douglas fir grand fir are the same on the two national forests regeneration is added to the inventory at each cycle in a process where fvs writes an ascii output file containing current stand information for species specific trees ha 1 basal area and canopy closure and then executes the regeneration model the latter model computes regeneration counts by species then writes the information to an ascii file which is read by fvs and used to update the inventory record for each stand 2 3 4 landscape fuel dynamics surface fuel succession in fvs is handled by the fvs fire and fuels fire and fuels extension fvs ffe our system deviated from the original fvs ffe surface fuel model logic to account for temporal live fuel variability particularly in shrubby lifeforms on each lsim cycle fuel models are selected based on live woody load fuel bed depth plant association type hall 1998 time since disturbance and canopy cover supplementary appendix a fig a1 fuel models in the study area were a combination of the original set of thirteen fuel models anderson 1982 and the full set of 40 fuel models developed by scott and burgan 2005 surface fuel models for the portion of the study area within the dnf were modelled over time using custom fuel model logic supplementary appendix a fig a1 and outputs from processing the national forest inventory data through fvs ffe canopy fuels that described canopy cover canopy base height canopy bulk density and total stand height were also obtained from fvs ffe outputs for initial conditions and through time both surface and canopy fuels in the buffer around the study area and inholdings fig 1 were initially assigned with landfire 2008 rapid refresh fbfm40 data landfire 2013b other landscape inputs for fire modelling were also obtained from landfire and included elevation slope and aspect krasnow et al 2009 rollins 2009 after discussions with local fuels planners we chose a timber litter tl2 fuel model scott and burgan 2005 to represent treated stands 2 3 5 wildfire calibration as described above fsim requires local calibration to model daily fire occurrence and generate synthetic fire weather streams upon which ignition probabilities are estimated for this process we used a 20 year 1992 2011 weather record from the lava butte remote automated weather station western regional climate center 2014 located 5 km south of bend or and fire history from short 2015 these data were processed with firefamily bradshaw and mccormick 2000 to generate the fsim parameter files fdist and frisk supplementary appendix c fig c2 in this study we assumed random ignition locations within the study area although there are some ignition hotspots related to recreation use within the dnf ager et al 2018 and the fsim program can be used with ignition probability grids we had no basis to assume these hotspots would persist and affect large fire location over the 50 year simulation period 2 3 6 wildfire caused mortality wildfire caused tree mortality was predicted using fire behavior outputs fireline intensity fli from fsim and the stand fire modelling functionality in fvs fvs has the capability to model stand scale fire and predict mortality based on the first order fire effects model fofem reinhardt et al 2008 the process requires flame length scorch height and percentage crown fraction burned for each stand supplementary appendix c table c1 first fireline intensity grids from fsim were converted to flame length m using byram s equation with wilson 1980 modification i b i r 60 12 6 r σ where ir kw m 1 is the fireline intensity r is the surface fire spread rate m min 1 and σ is the surface area to volume ratio of the fuel bed m 1 scorch height sht was calculated as sht 3 2808 6 026 pow fl 3 2808 1 4466 we then estimated crown percentage burned based on the scorch height relative to the critical flame length for crowning we then simulated a fire using fvs and the above parameters specifically we used the flameadjust keyword to set the fire parameters and simulated a fire with the fvs simfire keyword additional parameters for the fire included windspeed of 30 kph fuel moistures as outlined in supplementary appendix c table c2 and air temperature of 23 9 c these latter parameters were held constant for each stand if polygons were partially burned we assumed they burned in entirety using a 50 cutoff as determined by the number of burned pixels 2 4 forest management scenarios we implemented three treatment priorities to prioritize planning areas and select stands for treatment that reflect existing management practices on the dnf treatment priorities addressed key management issues related to wildfire threats to the adjacent wui distwui fire resiliency and forest restoration firesev and economic potential econ from commercial thinning the objectives of the treatment priorities table 2 were to treat stands 1 closer to the wui 2 with higher potential fire severity and 3 higher volume respectively distance to the wui was calculated for each stand based on the shortest distance between the stand s centroid and the nearest wui polygon potential fire severity versus that from a simulated wildfire in fsim was estimated for each stand using fvs ffe s potfmort function which returns potential severe fire mortality as a percentage of total basal area assuming a wind speed of 32 km hr 1 and fuel moistures of 4 4 5 10 15 70 for 1 h 10 h 100 h 1000 h duff and live fuels respectively live fuels are separated into two classes for fuel moisture purposes live woody and live herbaceous basal area of trees 53 cm dbh those that can be harvested based on dnf harvest prescriptions was the priority metric for econ and was calculated for each stand based on merchantable volume reported by fvs each treatment priority was designed to test the expected effect on a given response variable table 2 prioritizing distance to wui was expected to reduce area burned in the wui targeting areas with high potential mortality was expected to both reduce wildfire caused mortality and potential flame length finally treating stands with the highest basal area was expected to maximize timber volume and reduce volume killed by wildfire these three prioritization criteria were implemented at three different levels 36 000 ha per five year cycle 72 000 ha per five year cycle and 108 000 ha per five year cycle corresponding to current 1 doubling 2 and tripling 3 the current treatment target on the dnf respectively note that the actual treatment intensity may or may not have met the target dependent on the availability of stands that met the treatment threshold based on management practices on the dnf the combination of a treatment priority distwui firesev econ with a treatment level 1 2 3 is referred to as a scenario resulting in a total of nine simulation scenarios 2 5 simulation sequence and response metrics we simulated scenarios in five year time steps over 50 years hereafter referred to as a cycle the sequence of activities including management growth and mortality regeneration wildfire and wildfire effects is shown in fig 2 in each cycle five years of management followed by five years of wildfire were simulated the latter as predicted by the fsim model each scenario was executed over 30 replicates to capture variability in wildfire impacts response variables associated with each prioritization metric are shown in table 2 for each scenario we examined the spatial arrangement of area treated and summarized area treated area burned volume harvested and volume killed by wildfire we quantified cumulative area burned over time in the wui for each scenario to provide a measure of potential fire behavior at the landscape scale we calculated potential flame length the latter describes the expected flame length if the entire study area burned under a predefined set of fire weather potential flame length provides a response to the effect of treatments for the whole study area whereas area burned over time can only capture the effect of treatments when they are intersected by a simulated fire we calculated potential flame length by post processing fuels landscapes at the end of each lsim cycle with a command line version of flammap brittain 2017 using a southwest wind azimuth and wind speed of 29 km h 1 3 results 3 1 treatment location treatments clustered in different locations for each of the three treatment priorities with firesev treatments allocated along the east and west side of the dnf and econ mostly focusing on the east side fig 4 the distwui priority resulted in a pattern that initially placed treatments near the wui but over time spread away from the wui as closer areas that were eligible to treat decreased fig 5 thus the distwui priority generated the desired treatment pattern increasing treatment levels led to greater area being treated but maintained the spatial restrictions to treating within planning areas thus reflecting typical management on real landscapes 3 2 area treated the average area treated for each treatment priority was 0 8 1 1 4 2 and 1 4 3 of the total land base i e both managed and unmanaged lands fig 6 at the lowest treatment level this corresponded to seven times more area treated than burned the latter corresponds to approximately 0 2 of the total land base with minor variations among priorities and treatment levels under the 1 treatment intensity all scenarios met the annual treatment target throughout the duration of the simulated 50 year period however when treatment levels were doubled and tripled the treatment rates dropped as the area eligible for treatment was reduced below the treatment target eligible stands could no longer meet treatment targets around year 25 for all 2 scenarios and approximately 5 years earlier for the 3 scenarios similar results showing a shortage of areas to treat under accelerated restoration scenarios were found by barros et al 2017 for the same study area but using a different landscape simulation model simulated area treated varied among replicates within scenario particularly under higher treatment targets for the econ priority fig 6 variability in the area treated among replicates had two causes 1 the effect of wildfires on stand treatment priorities and 2 the alteration of landscape conditions over time in relation to the metrics for each of the three specific priorities because the spatial distribution of treatments was different among the three metrics the potential for fire treatment interactions depended on whether a particular scenario concentrated or scattered treatments fig 5 3 3 area burned variability in annual area burned differed among both replicates and years and between scenarios the coefficient of variation cv among replicates in total area burned across the simulation period averaged 31 compared to an interannual cv of 223 comparison with the area burned from historical fires between 1990 2012 shows similar interannual variability fig 7 the replicates varied in terms of the timing and location of fire events the map of fire perimeters by decade during one simulation for the firesev 1x scenario fig 8 showed that fires are generally distributed throughout the landscape and do not show marked change in size over the simulation period despite fuel treatments the distwui priority was more effective at reducing area burned in the wui than alternative scenarios but differences between distwui and alternative priorities under 1 and 2 were small fig 9 reduction in area burned in the wui was more effective under 3 corresponding to a 10 reduction in area burned percentage area burned for the manageable and non manageable land base showed a larger effect for the former compared to the latter fig 10 non manageable lands were those that were placed into reserves according to the dnf forest plan the reduction in area burned for the non manageable lands demonstrates a shadow effect of the treatments it occurred primarily under the firesev and distwui priorities because treatment placement resulted in more treated stands on the east side of the dnf adjacent to non manageable lands fig 4 temporal trends in area burned were slight or nonexistent over the 50 year simulation suggesting that at current fire levels the combined changes in vegetation and fuels from succession and management were not sufficient to change overall fire activity within the study area fig 10 however landscape fire resilience measured as a decrease in potential flame length increased on manageable lands fig 11 during the first decade and remained stable for the remainder of the simulation time whereas in non manageable lands flame length remained the same throughout the 50 year period this result is surprising because it suggests that vegetation succession and fuel accumulation on non manageable areas are not contributing to increasing flame lengths in addition all prioritization scenarios resulted in the same reduction in flame length on treated lands contrary to what we hypothesized this suggests that at comparable treatment levels the alternative prioritization scenarios achieved landscape conditions that resulted in similar potential flame lengths allowing for tradeoffs in other landscape services and values 3 4 volume harvested and volume killed by fire average volume harvested per hectare increased over time and was higher for 1 than for 2 and 3 across all priorities because thinning out the smaller trees allowed larger trees to continue to grow at an increased rate fig 12 under 1 more trees were left to grow across the landscape than in 2 and 3 comparatively once a stand was thinned it became unavailable for harvest until the basal area increased which allowed the remaining trees to grow in the interim this resulted in increased volume over time as stands that were thinned became available for harvest the distwui priority showed a more stable harvest volume per hectare throughout the trajectory because it did not target high volume stands specifically so stands that were added to meet the area target had an increasingly lower stand density in the firesev and econ priorities standing merchantable volume killed by wildfire increased over time in non manageable areas fig 13 in treatable areas volume killed by fire on a per hectare basis was more or less constant with a slight increase in year 30 4 discussion we found that accelerating forest and fuels management led to non linear changes in landscape conditions that stabilized after 20 30 years when the backlog of areas to treat under current thresholds was eliminated however accelerating treatments created a pulse of early seral forests that required treatments later in the simulation management treatments had a strong effect on potential fire intentsity reducing potential flame length for the entire study area on averge by up to 26 within the first 20 years by contrast reductions in fire activity as measured by area burned were relatively small which was surprising given that we assumed simulated treatments would substantially reduce fuels and fire spread the lack of effect is partly because 60 of the dnf is in reserves where mechanical treatments are prohibited thus ensuring ample fuels for new ignitions to burn without encountering either treatments or past fire footprints where fuels are reduced we did note however that fire activity on non manageable areas was affected by treatment intensity in the manageable areas thus creating a spillover effect between adjacent treated and non treated landscapes large reserves occur on all western us national forests covering between 30 60 of their total area and include wilderness roadless and other conservation and amenity reserves where mechanical management is prohibited another explanation is that the re treatment cycle relative to the rate of fuels succession was inadequate to maintain landscapes with low to moderate spread rates rapid succession of herbaceous and brush fuels within the study area has been well documented dyrness and youngberg 1966 as well as increased flammability from needle drape on bitterbrush purshia tridentata a key observation from the study is the substantial inter annual variability in area burned illustrating the possibility of alternative future landscape conditions under the same management policy the interannual coefficient of variation cv exceeded 200 and was almost 10 fold larger than the inter replicate cv our estimate from simulation was very close to inter annual variability in the historical record 1992 2009 236 we expected lower inter replicate variability since variation in area burned is averaged over the simulation period for each replicate the importance of variability versus the mean area burned is often overlooked and is important since landscape response to fire events is nonlinear with fire size high variation in area burned can accelerate landscape change and set the stage for larger future fires via fuel homogenization hessburg et al 2016 in other words resilient forests can absorb the effects of many small fires better than fewer larger ones churchill et al 2013 and presumably this is why clumpy spatial structure in fire prone forests is a key factor in resiliency thus inter annual variance in fire size is perhaps as important as the mean area burned given similar intensities in terms of landscape change the substantial inter annual and inter replicate variability we observed in the model is not often reported nor observed in other landscape simulation studies differences among the spatial treatment strategies were minor compared to treatment intensity meaning that location was less important than area treated this finding was most surprising for the wui scenario where treatments targeted areas near wui over the simulation period we estimated that fires will burn through 30 40 of the total wui area including re burning wui area burned for the wui scenario was reduced from 35 to 28 between the 1 and 3 management strategies a small difference compared to simulation studies with static landscapes and similar focus on treatments ager et al 2016 scott et al 2016 the lack of differences was in part caused by overlapping treatment locations among the spatial strategies fig 4 where over time project areas rotate through much of the same area this study resulted in a new landscape modelling system that leverages decades of forest service research and development by virtue of its coupling with fvs the model has immediate potential applications in a range of studies concerning the combined and independent effects of fire and management on fire regimes feedbacks stand structure forest patch size distributions carbon wildfire habitat amenity protection and economics the model can be adapted to any forested region in the us using the 20 existing fvs extensions the lsim model is not limited to small landscapes e g thousands of hectares as reported for the underlying fvs ppe in a recent review of flms shifley et al 2017 lsim provides a landscape framework to replicate detailed silvicultural modelling as provided for in the fvs prescription keywords the wildfire simulation submodel fsim is widely used for planning and risk assessment in the us haas et al 2013 integrating existing models like fvs and fsim that have respective user communities and prior management application helps convey a high degree of transparency to agency managers and scientists which is a key step to further advance the application of forest landscape models for ecological restoration spies et al 2014 enhancements to lsim includes fire weather that incorporates projected climate change using energy release component data from future climate scenarios projected by the global circulation models in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 abatzoglou and brown 2012 climate induced changes in vegetation can also be modelled with lsim via the fvs climate change extension crookston 2014 crookston et al 2010 one key advantage of lsim over perhaps all other flms is the assimilation of the fvs economics extension martin 2009 which provides for detailed financial analyses of wood products and revenues from forest and fuels management economic factors are the primary limiting factor in ecological restoration programs in the western us barbour et al 2008 stephens et al 2016 due to low value of wood products in many areas with overstocked stands and high fire risk ager et al 2017 estimating revenue from logging activities requires simulating the harvesting process where trees are bucked into logs and each log is valued based on species and small end diameter martin 2009 log values by species and size are available from local and national reporting agencies bber 2019b likewise logging fuel treatment and hauling costs are widely available from empirical data or harvest cost models bber 2019a fried et al 2016 net revenue from management activities can be calculated by subtracting harvesting and hauling costs from log values wider application of financial analyses to prioritize restoration treatments can help improve the efficiency of restoration efforts by pinpointing where timber revenues are positive and treatments are needed to reduce risks and hazards ager et al 2017 for instance our results showed that higher levels of harvest activities i e 3x resulted in as much as a 150 drop in the volume per hectare of harvested material compared with lower levels of harvest fig 12 meaning that areas that could potentially pay for high cost restoration treatments e g fuel mastication rapidly diminish as area treated increases these results suggest a non linear cost of restoration as management activities are accelerated in terms of area treated landscape modelling of forest management activities on us public forestlands is a complicated multiscale prioritization problem that is only approximated in other landscape models for instance it is possible that some studies allocate treatment in a given time step throughout the study area e g syphard et al 2011 rather than our process of replicating the current practice of implementing planning areas 5000 30 000 ha one at a time and sequencing the planning areas according to management priorities stand level prescriptions are also complex in that they are typically multi year sequences of mechanical thinning surface fuels mastication piling and prescribed fire all tuned to local stand structure species composition and fire regime to meet multiple forest health resiliency and fire management objectives churchill et al 2013 cochran et al 1994 haugo et al 2015 o hara et al 2010 all of these activities are governed by site specific directions in forest plans that specify a wide range of forest management constraints ager et al 2016 ringo et al 2015 studies that simulate decades of prescribed fire as the only landscape treatment hurteau et al 2016 krofcheck et al 2017 are unrealistic on national forests where federal laws mandate commercial harvest to fund restoration and contribute to rural economies moreover prescribed fire has both operational constraints and highly variable effects on tree mortality including impacts on large trees which makes it difficult to schedule on large landscapes over time further advances in landscape modelling and additional case studies will provide information that can help landowners and managers understand how divergent management intensities and spatial strategies can potentially change current wildfire trajectories over time these models can also be used to reinforce the uncertainty associated with wildfire management policies by illustrating how highly stochastic wildfire events can mask progress towards a management goal enhancing these models to include agent based decision frameworks spies et al 2014 and climate change hulse et al 2016 can contribute to improved risk governance systems by disentangling the relative
