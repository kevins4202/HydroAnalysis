18925,mathematical models describing precipitation processes in one step need to be upgraded particle size distribution is a crucial variable and its inclusion in the modelling libraries is necessary if the technology wants to be optimized through simulation with this objective a mass based population balance model is presented in this contribution the model has been constructed using a stoichiometric matrix and a kinetic vector and using mass as the internal coordinate as it is usually done in wastewater treatment modelling identifiability of the parameters of the model was evaluated using a sensitivity and a collinearity analysis for six simulation case studies of struvite precipitation in addition parameters in the model were calibrated to represent data from two batch tests in the laboratory the results of the analysis showed that the identifiability of the parameters depends on the available experimental data and explored scenarios identifiability of the parameters could be the reason behind the shifting parameter values describing mechanisms of precipitation in the literature this contribution helps to understand the possibilities and limitations that the population balance model approach offer graphical abstract image 1 keywords population balance model struvite precipitation sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis 1 introduction struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the most interesting materials to recover from urban wastewater it is a slow release fertilizer that can be recovered in wastewater treatment plants wwtps main advantages of recovering struvite are 1 it reduces operational costs in wwtps associated with the maintenance of reactors and pipes due to blockage of phosphorous p salts 2 it fights global p scarcity and 3 it reduces eutrophication problems in receiving waterways some technologies have been recently developed that demonstrate the feasibility of the full scale process egle et al 2016 some of these technologies are based on the controlled precipitation of the product however most of them show significant differences in their operation depending on the characteristics of the product to be recovered and process restrictions continuous versus batch different hydraulic retention times etc tarragó et al 2016 the flourishment of recovery technologies and the differences in the operation among them reinforce the idea that this is an attractive process from the economic and environmental perspective that can still be optimized mathematical modelling and simulation have been proved as useful tools for the design and optimization of new and existing wwtps and their unit processes the precipitation process of struvite and other interesting materials have already been included in mathematical modelling and simulation libraries for wwtps lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2017 these modelling and simulation libraries known as plant wide models pwms combine information from the biological chemical and physicochemical processes in the plant with its economic performance and are able to predict the amount of obtained solid in the reactor based on the kinetic of precipitation and thermodynamics however although these models provide a relevant information about the amount of product obtained and their suitability and effects on the global wwtp behavior they present some limitations for the optimum design and operation of the technologies it is known that struvite performance as a fertilizer depends on the obtained particle size distribution psd tarragó et al 2016 this psd will be conditioned by the inner mechanisms of the precipitation primary nucleation homogeneous and heterogeneous secondary nucleation growth aggregation attrition or breakage of particles the weight of each mechanism in the obtained product is determined by the experimental conditions in the reactor namely ph supersaturation level mixing energy temperature and the presence of foreign ions in the precipitating solution le corre et al 2009 neither the information on the psd nor the inner mechanisms of the process are included in classic pwm approaches as this information is important for the design and optimization of element recovery reactors one step precipitation models have to be upgraded with new modelling frameworks for wastewater treatment modelling as the population balance model pbm the pbm can successfully describe the evolution in time and space of the distribution of properties of a group of discrete entities particles bubbles cells etc dispersed in a continuous phase it typically considers an additional internal coordinate which is some measure of the particles size it includes explicitly inner mechanisms of the precipitation process and is able to predict the evolution of a psd in a reactor the main equation of the pbm for a batch experiment can be expressed as galbraith 2011 1 n d t g n d l b l d l where n d is the population density l is the crystal length g is the size independent linear growth rate b is the birth function and d the death function the population density n defines the number of particles per volume unit n d within the size range l l dl 2 n d l d n d dl these equations are used to define a general case of the pbm when it is based on particle number the analytical resolution for the pbm is only possible for the simplest cases consequently numerical methods often involving some kind of discretization or decomposition of the main equation are used for its resolution costa et al 2007 the pbm is a widely accepted tool for precipitation process modelling in industrial crystallization however only recently has been used to represent wwtp unit processes nopens et al 2015 pbm has been proved to be successful to track changes in the psd in the struvite precipitation already galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 modelled psd and reactants consumption show good agreement between the experimental data and model results this evidences the great potential of the pbm for the correct prediction of the process and its optimization however there are two main aspects in the existing contributions that have to be addressed firstly pbm models have generally been defined using number of particles as the dependent variable of the process which is coherent with the model purposes but can lead to mass discontinuities hounslow et al 1988 although partially solved galbraith et al 2014 this problem would make them incompatible with conventional models used in the wastewater treatment framework which are mainly constructed on the basis of mass balances around the unit to be described iwa asm adm models for a successful implementation of pbm in wastewater treatment industry mass discontinuity must be avoided first using mass as internal coordinate automatically satisfies the mass balance scarlett 2002 in addition it allows to represent the mechanisms of the pbm as a dynamic mass balance for the elements forming the components in the system as it is usually done in standardized methodology for wastewater treatment modelling this approach was used to describe comminution sintering or granulation processes verkoeijen et al 2002 however those examples did not include the mechanisms of homogeneous nucleation and particle growth which are necessary to describe the mass transference occurring from the liquid phase to the solid phase moreover the aggregation was defined for constricted in space aggregation sastry and fuerstenau 1970 and a linearly partitioned size domain verkoeijen et al 2002 those considerations are not valid for a precipitation process where the solid concentration is small and a big range of sizes needs to be covered the second aspect is that obtained parameter values for the parameters defining inner mechanisms of the precipitation of struvite are very variable in the literature galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 mehta and batstone 2013 the same happens for other compounds too chen et al 2002 ruan et al 2016 mechanisms occur simultaneously and obtaining meaningful experimental data to attribute to each mechanism its real effect on the precipitation is difficult making calibration a very challenging issue in addition each author considers different model assumptions which has a direct effect on the calibrated parameter values for example some articles did not include aggregation in the mechanisms of precipitation hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 leaving growth as the only particle enlargement process in their model this will inevitably lead to different parameter values comparing to the authors that include aggregation even for the same experimental conditions and sampling method in addition many definitions for the kernels of the mechanisms have been used in the literature especially for aggregation and breakage hill and ng 2002 which leads again to different parameter values moreover the considered thermodynamic equilibrium rates the use of activity coefficients and the way they are obtained are other important reasons for these differences election of the constants governing these equilibrium equations have shown to have a considerable effect on the predicted precipitation potential barnes and bowers 2017 using mathematical analysis tools to evaluate the possibility of obtaining trustworthy parameter values will increase the confidence in the modelling framework the first objective of this contribution is to present a pbm scheme based on a mass balance approach where the mass is conserved and it is compatible with wastewater treatment models conventionally used for this issue the pbm was adapted to a conventional model structure in wastewater treatment modelling where mass of the crystal entities is used as the internal variable instead of particle number the second objective is to evaluate the theoretical parameter identifiability of the constructed model using model analysis tools as sensitivity analysis and a collinearity analysis this evaluation is helpful to understand the goodness of the modelling framework before any calibration procedure is followed to conclude the paper model parameters were adjusted heuristically to reproduce experimental data obtained in two laboratory tests as a preliminary illustration of the predictive capacity of the model 2 materials and methods in this section the information is divided in three subsections in subsection 2 1 a description of the presented model is given in subsection 2 2 the methodology followed to implement the analysis tools used to assess the identifiability of the parameters is detailed and in subsection 2 3 the experimental procedure followed to obtain the data to determine the value of the parameters of the model is described 2 1 precipitation model the model presented in this contribution describes the precipitation process of struvite the main reaction for this process is 3 m g 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 p o 4 6 h 2 o the mass transference process occurring in the reactor is defined by the pbm approach described below 2 1 1 population balance model the mathematical model presented here is a discretized population balance model dpbm where particle sizes are defined after partitioning the crystal size range in 30 bins each of the bins corresponds to spherical particles sized between 0 001 and 0 812 mm of radius the volume size defined for each bin is twice the previous one following a geometric partition of the size domain as a consequence psd in the model is a truly discrete discretization where only particles of size v 2v 4v etc exist being v the volume of the smallest spherical particle size considered the difference between the dpbm presented in this contribution and most of the pbms available in literature is the way in which particle particle and particle liquid interactions are defined in this study mass is used as the internal coordinate instead of using particle number each particle size bin is considered as a component in the model and its interaction with other components ions in the liquid and or other solid bins is described by the precipitation mechanisms and is based on the mass continuity of the components the ions considered are those employed in urban wastewater treatment models they have been defined using common wastewater equilibrium reactions as ion pairing and acid base reactions following guidelines and equations proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 and showed in table 1 the mechanisms of precipitation in this contribution homogeneous nucleation particle growth and aggregation of particles are defined using a petersen matrix for the stoichiometry and a vector of kinetics the kinetics of mechanisms are defined in a general way as power law functions dependent on supersaturation index si and kinetic rates and exponents 4 r k r s i n r where r is the rate of change of the mechanism k r is the kinetic rate of the r mechanism and n r is the exponent units of r and k r depend on the mechanism the si is calculated using the ion activity product iap of the species conforming the struvite and the solubility product of the salt 5 si log a m g 2 a n h 4 a p o 4 3 ks p stru where a i is the activity of ion i mol l and k s p s t r u is the solubility product of the salt many values for the solubility product have been reported in the literature doyle and parsons 2002 rahaman et al 2006 from the proposed values k s p s t r u 7 58 10 13 mol l 3 was used for all the simulations in this contribution as the pbm is mass based the model could be further extended with other reactions as liquid gas transfer other salts precipitation or other chemical reactions in a systematic and simple way in order to simulate struvite or other salt precipitation process in a reactor operated with real wastewater mechanisms not considered in this article such as breakage or secondary nucleation could be added too however this model accounts for the most important mechanisms maintaining a good compromise between relatively simple implementation and realistic results in the next subsections each mechanism is described in detail 2 1 2 nucleation homogeneous nucleation is the spontaneous creation of small entities from the liquid phase in the absence of other solid bodies these entities are in the edge of liquid and solid phase some of them re dissolve into liquid and others become the starting point of the precipitation it is uncertain how homogeneous nucleation happens however it is usually accepted that a sequence of bimolecular additions is the cause mullin 2001 the number of molecules present in a nucleus is considered to be between ten and several thousand this size range is considerably smaller than the minimum size measurable with typically available equipment and as a consequence the ones considered in the pbms in the literature in this contribution this smallest size has been arbitrarily chosen as r 0 001 mm following the example of galbraith galbraith et al 2014 the nucleation rate should be understood as the appearance rate of particles of the smallest size considered in the model this appearance is subjected in reality to nucleation and particle enlargement processes the assumption is considered valid as particles smaller than r 0 001 mm have a very small effect on the obtained crystal mass the created crystal mass of size r 0 001 mm is proportional to the reactants consumption as defined in the stoichiometry this appearance rate is defined as 6 b 0 k b s i n b v r where b 0 is the particle birth rate due to homogeneous nucleation nucleus day k b is the kinetic rate nucleus day m3 v r is the volume liquid in the reactor m3 and n b is the exponent mass change in the smallest sized bin due to nucleation is 7 x 1 t k b s i n b v r mes f 1 where x 1 is the mass of struvite g characterized as the smallest size in a certain time and m e s f 1 is the mass of struvite g in a single sphere of the smallest bin table 2 is the stoichiometry matrix for nucleation process 2 1 3 crystal growth once the nuclei stabilize precipitation occurs through particle enlargement processes particle growth and aggregation particle growth is the particle enlargement process where particles increase their size by consuming reactants the rate of change in the size of particles is defined as 8 g k g s i n g k g and n g are the kinetic rate mm d and exponent respectively in addition to the si the mass of a bin x i disappearing due to the growth rate from the i th to the i 1 th size x i t g i i 1 will be determined by the available crystal surface of the i th bin 9 x i t g i i 1 g a i t ρ where a i t is the area m2 of the i sized crystals at a certain time and ρ is the density g m3 of the crystal as the area is not a variable included in the model it has to be converted to a term depending on mass 10 a i t c w i t v r ρ l i l i 1 2 where c w i t is the concentration of i sized particles in g m3 and l i and l i 1 are the radius in mm of the i th and i 1 th bin respectively substituting a i t 11 x i t g i i 1 g c w i t v r l i l i 1 2 k g s i n g c w i t v r l i l i 1 2 as x i c w i t v r 12 x i t g i i 1 k g s i n g x i l i l i 1 2 the change in the total mass of the i th sized particles due to the growth mechanism will be the difference between the particles that grow from the previous bin to the considered bin and the particles that grow from the considered bin to the next 13 x i t g x i t g i 1 i m a s s g r o w i n g f r o m p r e v i o u s b i n x i t g i 1 i m a s s g r o w i n g t o n e x t b i n the definition of these steps and the interaction with the ions in the reaction is defined in table 3 2 1 4 aggregation aggregation is the particle enlargement process where the effective impact of two small crystals form a bigger one it is thought that some consumption of the dissolved ions is needed to create the bond between two colliding crystals hounslow et al 2001 the consumption due to the bond formation is assumed as negligible in the stoichiometry of this model and its effect is taken into account by making the aggregation kinetics proportional to the supersaturation index 14 β k a s i n a k a l d and n a are the size independent kinetic constant or kernel and the exponent respectively size independent aggregation kernels are the simplest and the ones with the best results bramley et al 1996 some studies suggest that the effectiveness of the impact could be related to the competing speed of the bond formation and the shear rate in the reactor hounslow et al 2013 2001 the impact of the shear rate is not considered in the equations of this pbm when considering a geometrically partitioned size spectrum a problem arises when modelling the collision of two spheres if the colliding particles have different volumes as an example v and 2v the model cannot represent the birth of the 3v sized sphere as this size is not defined to overcome this problem in this contribution the approach of hounslow for the discretization of the aggregation process hounslow et al 1988 is adapted to a mass based pbm the results of the approach are comparable to the results of other discretization types nopens et al 2005 and it has been successfully used to represent struvite aggregation galbraith et al 2014 the approach of hounslow is based on the idea that the entity of volume 3v formed experimentally will be fractioned in the model a fraction is upgraded to the next sized bin size 4v and another fraction stays in the biggest size of the colliding particles size 2v the development of the aggregation mechanism starts defining that the effective collision of particles of two different sizes i and j being j i is proportional to the number of entities present in the model 15 β n i n j for a mass based model this means 16 β x j x i mes f j mes f i where m e s f j g and m e s f i g are the mass of a j sized and i sized sphere respectively for the death term the mass of j size leaving the j th bin due to collisions with class i will be the number of this effective collisions multiplied by the mass in each j sphere 17 d x j dt β x j x i mes f j mes f i mes f j β x j x i mes f i analogously the mass of i size leaving the i th bin due to collisions with class j will be proportional to the effective collisions multiplied by the mass in the i th size bin as the sum of the mass of both particles will not be enough to obtain a particle of size i 1 it is consider that a part of the particle of size i passes to the i 1 bin whilst another part stays in i housnlow s approach to this end the mass leaving the i th bin is multiplied by a 2 j i factor 18 d x i dt 2 j i β x j x i mes f j mes f i mes f i 2 j i β x j x i mes f j this process is described in a diagram in fig 1 with this assumption and considering that for the birth term the mass of i 1 size formed due to collisions between particles in i th and j th class will be the sum of the mass leaving i and j classes due to collisions mass of the solids is automatically conserved during aggregation 19 d x i 1 dt d x i dt d x j dt combining equations 20 d x i 1 dt 2 j i β x j x i mes f j β x j x i mes f i β x j x i 2 j i

matrix for four general equations is shown in table 4 the aggregation process has been included analogously for all possible collisions occurring between all the bins defined in the model thus

precipitation until now an identifiability analysis of the kinetic rates and exponents defining the mechanisms described in subsection 2 1 was considered necessary prior to any calibration procedure this analysis was done in four steps first the model was implemented in west dhi simulation platform second six case studies in which all the mechanisms described in the model were expected to have some relevance were described third a quantification of the effect of each parameter on the model s outputs was done integrating a local sensitivity method into a global sampling method finally a collinearity analysis of the model was done so as to observe possible correlation effects between the parameters 2 2 1 case studies for the simulations performed in this contribution six different simulation case studies were defined in west dhi case studies a b and c were operated in batch mode with very high si and no seed material in contrast case studies d e and f corresponded to a continuous operation of a precipitation reactor with an initial seed loading all the simulations considered the reactors as completely stirred tank reactor cstr all the si provided correspond to the equilibrium value of the si that would be obtained if no reaction occurred in the reactors each of case studies a b and c was a cstr of 1 l capacity with an initial volume of 500 ml of a solution containing kh2po4 and nh4cl on it starting at simulation time t 0 s 150 ml of a solution containing mgcl2 6h2o were added in the first 10 s after that no more external perturbation was introduced in the system the difference among these scenarios were the initial concentrations of the species as included in table 5 for case studies d e and f a reactor of 11 4 l of capacity was used temperature was 21 c precipitation process started with the reactor full of a solution containing 0 228 mol l nh4cl and 0 114 mol l kh2po4 and 640 g of struvite seed material of average diameter of 185 μm starting at simulation time t 0 s 3 solutions entered the reactor with constant flows and continuously for 24 h the first solution was formed by kh2po4 and nh4cl the second one by mgcl2 6h2o and the third one by naoh for the three case studies the same flow of the solution formed by kh2po4 and nh4cl 0 3168 m3 day and the solution formed by mgcl2 6h2o 0 0253 m3 day were used the difference in the conditions of the simulations was achieved by changing the naoh dosing quantity 0 0265 m3 day 0 0132 m3 day and 0 0106 m3 day for cases d e and f respectively which affected the si in the reactor details can be found in table 6 the si in the reactor for cases d e and f were 2 04 1 19 and 0 65 respectively the precipitated solid was retained in the reactor during the process 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis the objective of running a sensitivity analysis is to verify how important each parameter is for the performance of the model usually it is employed to simplify overparameterized models in this contribution it is used to verify that in the parameter range chosen all the parameters and consequently the mechanisms play a role in the outputs as a previous step to the model calibration evaluated parameters and their ranges are included in table 7 choosing meaningful parameter values for the analysis is not straightforward as the variability in the kernels and values for them is big in the literature the ranges were chosen to cover zones that included values observed in the literature review galbraith et al 2014 mullin 2001 myerson 2001 triger et al 2012 and also based on previous simulations performed by the authors the sensitivity analysis can be done following a global sampling technique or a local analysis technique global sampling methods pick parameter sets in the previously defined hyperspace in order to run the simulation with them when enough simulations are done an idea of how the results of the simulation change depending on the values of the parameters can be obtained van griensven et al 2006 on the other hand local analysis techniques evaluate the impact of changing slightly the value of the parameters at a previously defined point in the parameter hyperspace this is especially useful when parameter values are known with some security brun et al 2001 considering the big uncertainty in the values of the kinetic parameters and in order to explore a large zone in the parameter hyperspace the sensitivity analysis was performed integrating a local analysis technique into a global sampling method this integration consists on repeating the local analysis in many randomly or systematically sampled points in this contribution the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method proposed by van griensven et al 2006 was used points were sampled using the lh scheme and local sensitivities were calculated using the oat method for the quantification of the effect of each parameter a little variation was introduced in the parameter of interest while the rest were maintained constant the difference on the outputs for the simulations with and without this variation were computed the result was the univocal variation on the model s outputs for the change in each parameter 25 s i j k 100 m θ 1 θ j 1 f i θ n m θ 1 θ j θ n m θ 1 θ j 1 f i θ n m θ 1 θ j θ n 2 where s i j k is the partial effect of the j th parameter on each i th output in the k th point f i is the small variation in the parameter and m refers to the model outputs note that the variation in the parameters is a fraction of the parameter value at the selected point the obtained value of the sensitivity is already normalized the operation was repeated for all the parameters being analyzed in each sampled point for the six different case studies p n 1 simulations of each case study were performed where p 300 was the total number of points of the hyperspace selected by the lh and n 6 the number of parameters therefore the influence of the six kinetic parameters used in the model was quantified using a total of 2100 runs for each of the six simulation case studies the result of this iterative operation is a tridimensional matrix a bidimensional matrix for each p sampled point with m number of outputs rows and n number of parameters columns the elements in these bidimensional matrixes are the partial effect of each parameter on each output s i j k the outputs used for the sensitivity analysis were ph and psd evolution during the simulated experiment for the a b and c case studies they were recorded every 10 s for the first 2 min of experiment because that was the most critical period and every minute for the next 18 min where little change is observed in the simulations for the d e and f case studies they were recorded every 10 min for the first 2 h and every hour for the next 22 h total influence of the parameter in each point δ k j was calculated averaging the effect for all the sampled outputs on a certain point 26 δ k j 1 p i 1 m s i j k 2 the averaged results formed a bidimensional matrix s named sensitivity matrix where each element was the averaged effect of the change of each parameter on each point s δ k j 2 2 3 collinearity analysis a set of parameters in a model is identifiable if it fulfils two conditions first the individual change in the parameters has to affect the model outputs second the change in one of the parameters cannot be compensated with an adequate change in another parameter brun et al 2001 from the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded which of the parameters have the biggest effect on the simulation outputs for the considered parameter bounds however it does not give any information on a possible correlation effect within the parameter set in order to assess possible compensation effects on the parameters a collinearity analysis was performed in the collinearity analysis parameters are usually organized in subsets these subsets have k parameters being k n the total number of parameters in the model the collinearity index of the parameters under study γ k was calculated as proposed in brun et al 2001 27 γ k 1 mi n β c 1 s k β c 1 λ k being s k the normalized matrix with the k parameters forming the subset under study β c is a vector of coefficients of length k and norm 1 and λ k the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix s k t s k parameter identifiability problems are found within the set under study when the limit in the collinearity index exceeds 15 brun et al 2002 or 20 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 as the identifiability of a parameter set depends on both the impact on the output of the change in the parameters and the linear independency of the subset an additional index was calculated the importance index ρ k considers both effects and it is calculated as brun et al 2001 28 ρ k det s t s 1 2 k a high sensitivity and a low collinearity will result in a high ρ k value for the subset which means a high identifiability the collinearity analysis was performed for all the points sampled with the lh for two types of parameter sets first all the parameters were analyzed in pairs to see if there were direct compensation effects between parameters in certain zones of the chosen range second the collinearity index and the importance index was calculated for the six parameters to find zones of the parameter range where all the parameters in the model are identifiable for the case studies used the parameter identifiability study was done combining matlab and west dhi the lh scheme was implemented in matlab and the values of the parameters picked for each run once these values were chosen the information was sent to the west simulation platform and the six case studies were reproduced the information about the outputs of the model was recorded from the west simulation and translated to matlab afterwards a perturbation of 1 was introduced in the first parameter and the simulations in west were repeated with the perturbed parameter set this operation was repeated for all the parameters under study the information of the outputs was used to calculate the sensitivities the collinearity index and the importance index fig 2 explains the steps followed 2 3 experimental set up experimental data for the determination of the parameter values was obtained from precipitation batch tests run in the laboratory the batch test were performed in a magnetically stirred cylindrical vessel the magnetic stirrer rotated at 300 rpm in all cases to ensure similar hydrodynamics in all runs 2 experimental conditions corresponding to simulation case studies a and b were used each of the conditions was run twice the objective was to analyze the effect of different initial si on the ph evolution and on the final psd in all the cases 500 ml of a dissolution prepared with a determined quantity of kh2po4 and nh4cl were left in a 1 l capacity vessel after that 150 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o solution were added in 10 s initial values of temperature ph concentrations and supersaturation calculated in west dhi are included in table 5 as can be observed initial concentration of species is significantly higher than those found in real wwtps this approach was followed for two reasons in order to obtain enough solid mass in the precipitation for the psd measurements and to experimentally analyze processes where the homogeneous nucleation is important each of the precipitation process was run for 20 min the information used for the determination of the kinetic rates and exponents was the evolution of ph and the final psd ph was measured every half second for the 20 min that the experiment lasted after the 20 min the experiment was stopped the precipitated solid was filtered and dried at 40 c for 96 h total mass of obtained solid was weighted and after that final psd was obtained measuring the dried solid in air suspension by laser diffraction using a sympatec h820 3 results the model presented in section 2 1 was assessed from an identifiability and predictive capacity point of view for this issue first the model was implemented in west dhi second different simulation scenarios were run to obtain meaningful results from the numeric analysis finally a parameter set was found that could represent well data from experiments performed in the laboratory results from those activities are included in this section 3 1 parameter identifiability module 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis results from the sensitivity analysis showed that all the parameters had some effect on the outputs the limit for considering a parameter non identifiable due to its low effect on the outputs is 1 1000 compared with the parameter with the biggest effect gábor et al 2017 this is a substantially smaller value than the result obtained in this study therefore all parameters were considered to play a role in the outputs the total effect of each parameter on the total output for all the points sampled δ k j was included in fig 3 as observed in fig 3 the parameters had different distribution of their sensitivity within the pre selected ranges it should be reminded that this sensitivity calculation only informed about the zone of the parameter range where each parameter affected the outputs not where it could represent experimental data with more accuracy in addition as the results of the sensitivity analysis could be biased by the values of the rest of the parameters more meaningful conclusions were obtained when the effect of the collinearity was considered however before that there were some tendencies that should be indicated attending the nucleation rate and exponent kr nucleation had a constant and relatively low effect on the outputs for all the range this result agreed with other studies where even for larger ranges of the parameter value the change in the nucleation constant had a little total effect hanhoun et al 2013 the sensitivity of the nucleation exponent was relatively high and increased with its value this could be explained by the fact that the case studies a b and c used in the simulations had high initial si and no seed material which are the experimental conditions where homogeneous nucleation is most favored as there is not initial crystal mass in the solution the homogeneous nucleation is the process that triggers the precipitation this will inevitably affect the evolution of the whole psd and not only the smallest size how fast particles are created will limit the consequent growth and aggregation of bigger particles as it will limit the available concentration of them therefore it will be an important mechanism for the evolution of the ph and psd on the other hand case studies d e and f had an initial seed loading and had relatively low si especially case study d in these conditions particle enlargement mechanisms should be dominant however formation of fines can still occur agrawal et al 2018 kr growth and growth exponent showed different tendencies the sensitivity of the kr growth is relatively constant for the whole range its value is nearly twice the value of the kr nucleation but it is significantly smaller than the sensitivities of the three exponents sensitivity of the growth exponent reached the highest sensitivity of the six parameters for its lowest values this highlighted the relevance of the process growth process is an important mechanism for different experimental conditions as it has a big effect on reactants consumption and consequently in the psd sensitivity of the growth exponent decreased when its value increased but it maintained a high sensitivity for the whole range considering the terms that define aggregation kr aggregation had a low and constant effect for all the parameter range on the other hand aggregation exponent presented higher average sensitivities as it increased however the dispersion of the values of the sensitivity was bigger than it was for other parameters having some of the high values of the aggregation exponent a big effect on the outputs and others a very small one this phenomenon needed further study and for that issue the effect of the aggregation exponent was analyzed for each case study individually and the results recorded in fig 4 from this analysis some ideas were obtained firstly there was a clear increase of the effect of the aggregation exponent as its value increased for the case studies a and b this effect could be explained in the model because a higher value of the aggregation exponent would mean a higher speed of aggregation for high si for the same concentration of particles therefore particles would get bigger faster at the initial steps of the precipitation without reactants consumption reducing the available surface area less surface area would mean less possibility to grow which would mean a slower precipitation a slower precipitation would maintain the si high for more time making the aggregation process important for a longer period of time however experimental evidence from the literature show that when reactors are operated unseeded and high si formation of fines governs the precipitation process rather than aggregation agrawal et al 2018 moreover aggregation is important when the reactor is seeded and works in continuous mode shih et al 2017 these favorable experimental conditions for aggregation are far from case studies a and b and are more similar to case studies d e and f where the trend of the sensitivity of the aggregation exponent is different it is bigger for low values from the analysis of the parameters of the aggregation two conclusions could be obtained the first one was that the effect of the aggregation exponent for the highest values seemed not to be able to represent correctly the mechanism as it gained relevance in case studies where it should not be important the second one was that for certain experimental conditions case studies d e and f the effect of the aggregation exponent can be important and therefore aggregation should always be considered when modelling crystallization processes 3 1 2 identifiability analysis the identifiability analysis finds possible correlations amongst the parameters under study as the objective of this analysis was to evaluate the possible interactions in the model all the parameters were considered however when the number of parameters increases it is difficult to see their real effect on the collinearity index therefore looking for direct compensation effects the collinearity index and the importance index was calculated first for each point sampled with the lh for every pair of the parameters afterwards the operation was repeated for the whole set of six parameters that describe the model 3 1 2 1 identifiability analysis for parameter pairs results of the maximum value of the collinearity index the maximum importance index and the minimum importance index for the analysis for parameter pairs were included in table 8 collinearity index values between 15 and 20 have been given as critical for parameter identifiability in the literature brun et al 2002 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 in this study there is a pair of parameters kr aggregation and aggregation exponent with its value above 15 the distribution of the collinearity index for that pair of parameters was included in fig 5 kr aggregation and aggregation exponent had collinearity problems for big values of the exponent for any value of the kr aggregation this agreed well with the sensitivity of kr aggregation which was low and constant for the whole range see fig 3 e and with the big variability of the sensitivity of the aggregation exponent for big values see fig 3 f in addition it showed that aggregation exponent is at least biased by other parameter this means that depending on the considered experimental conditions chosen for the calibration its estimation could not be possible more generally pair of parameters sharing mechanism pairs 1 and 10 or pair of parameters with the same relationship with si pairs 2 and 7 could have direct compensation problems if less simulation scenarios or data was used for the identifiability analysis for instance if only the information of the case studies a b and c was used the effect on the outputs could be compensated being the collinearity index up to 31 for growth exponent and nucleation exponent when both had big values especially growth exponent these two parameters determine the relationship of nucleation and growth with the si within the crystallization high values of nucleation exponent would lead to high values of concentration of the first bin very fast which would at the same time accelerate the growth from the first bin to the second the second to the third and so on high values of growth exponent would accelerate growth at high si too therefore for certain experimental conditions in this case case studies a b and c these parameters could be correlated even for a big amount of considered data as in the analysis a total of six case studies were considered this correlation was not a problem as the case studies represented experimental conditions where their effects could be distinguished results from the importance index for the parameter pairs see table 8 indicated that the pairs of parameters with the highest maximum importance index were the ones combining the three exponents and the growth rate this result agreed well with the values of the sensitivities which were lower for the other two parameters kr nucleation and kr aggregation big differences were found between the maximum and minimum value which remarks that the parameter identifiability largely depended on the parameter values 3 1 2 2 identifiability analysis for the six parameters results of the collinearity analysis of the whole parameter set stated that from the 300 sampled parameter combinations 251 had a collinearity index below the threshold of 15 as the six parameters can be involved in combinations with high collinearity index almost 15 or more finding a zone graphically with no collinearity issues that include the effect of all the parameters is not straightforward therefore the effect of the collinearity is included in the representation of the importance index the importance index combines information from the sensitivity and collinearity of the parameters fig 6 represented the importance index of the six parameters in two plots for the four parameters that led to parameter pairs with highest importance index the graphs clearly showed that low values of the growth exponent and the kr growth combined with high nucleation exponents led to parameter sets with a better identifiability fig 6 a effect of the aggregation exponent was not as clear fig 6 b this was a logical result as the aggregation exponent showed little average sensitivity for values below 2 fig 3 f and a high collinearity with the kr aggregation for high values fig 5 b from the obtained results it could be concluded that there were zones of parameter values with theoretical identifiability problems this could be even more problematic if less data or experimental scenarios were used as it is the usual case for pbm calibration the identifiability problem could explain the differences in the values of the parameters found in literature for calibrated pbms more than small changes in the structures of the pbm or the used solving method considering this a calibrated pbm should clearly indicate the limits of its application as it is possible that the parameters chosen are not general values but compensated among them for the case studies and or parameter values chosen in addition when using the models it should be considered that the parameter values can be good enough to represent a certain amount of data but it is not correct to consider the processes or parameters individually as they might be biased by the value of the rest of the parameters of the model on the other hand there were zones where the identifiability was possible for the data and case studies used some of the zones of the parameters with high identifiability mainly for the exponents were reasonable values according to classic precipitation theories this is important as enforces the idea that the pbm can explain the precipitation in a realistic way by including the main mechanisms in an explicit way 3 2 fitting the model to the experimental data based on the information obtained in the mathematical analysis conducted previously the parameters under study were adjusted to reproduce the data obtained from the experiments undertaken in the laboratory and explained in subsection 2 3 experimental results showed a sharp decay of the ph when the solutions contacted this is something expected due to the high si chosen for the experiments the obtained solid size was small as it tends to occur for high si fang et al 2016 fig 7 shows the average of the evolution of the ph and the final psd in the experiments obtained struvite mass was 7 6445 g for case a and 4 6601 g for case b for the adjustment values were chosen from the zone of the highest identifiability for those parameters that obtained a high value of the importance index in the previously conducted analysis exponents and kr growth kr nucleation and kr aggregation were parameters with lower identifiability and their effect is not as important on the outputs as that of the rest of the parameters once the most important parameters were fixed they were manipulated within the analyzed range in order to obtain a value that led to a reasonable similarity between the experimental data and the results from the simulations the nucleation exponent was fixed at 5 this value agrees with other contributions where it is stated that the exponent for secondary nucleation is often above 2 and the exponent for homogeneous nucleation is typically much higher myerson 2001 growth exponent was fixed at 2 growth exponent presented a high identifiability for zones in which its value was low in addition classic growth theories state that the value of the growth exponent is usually between 1 and 2 mullin 2001 moreover its value has been chosen between 1 and 3 for different definitions of the growth rate li et al 2003 regarding aggregation exponent as mentioned in subsection 3 1 high sensitivity found for its high values corresponded to unseeded very high si and batch simulation cases on the contrary the continuous case studies showed higher values of the sensitivity for lower values of the parameter in addition high values of aggregation exponent led to collinearity problems therefore it was decided to choose a value of 2 for the aggregation exponent out of the zone with collinearity problems this value is in consonance with the observations made by wójcik and jones 1997 that found a linear increase of the agglomeration kernel with the growth rate kr growth was selected in this contribution at 12 mm d slightly lower than the value of 18 mm d obtained in galbraith et al 2014 for the growth rate of struvite as explained above the parameters with the lowest impact in the outputs were adjusted at the end kr nucleation was fixed at 1013 nucleus m3 day this value is lower than the values obtained in galbraith et al 2014 and in triger et al 2012 however those values in the literature were obtained for significantly lower values of the nucleation exponent in galbraith et al 2014 or a different kernel in triger et al 2012 on the other hand kr aggregation was fixed at 10 5 l d lower value than the value obtained in galbraith et al 2014 however the exponent of the aggregation was calibrated at 5 259 in galbraith et al 2014 whereas in this contribution is fixed at 2 the fact that other contributions reported different exponent and kinetic rate values while maintaining a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental values highlighted that correlation may exist when calibrating a pbm and emphasized the idea that it is very difficult to compare parameter values between contributions values obtained for the parameters are recorded in table 9 it should be noted that the presented parameter values do not claim to be a perfect parameter set to describe the struvite precipitation process in every experimental condition as this is not an objective of this study however the values recorded in table 9 are considered a promising first step for further calibration when more experimental data is available fig 7 confronted the simulated ph evolution and final psd with the experimental values there was a small difference in the steady state for the ph value this difference is related with the chosen ksp the difference was in concordance when the obtained solid was compared in the experiments and the simulations 7 6445 g in the experiment and 7 7512 g in the simulation for case a and 4 6601 g in the experiment and 4 8868 g in the simulation for case b discrepancies in the psd between the experimental and simulated results were related with the low accuracy of the laser diffraction method to measure non spherical particles hanhoun et al 2013 in addition as the measurements were done with dry solid it is possible that some post drying agglomeration occurred resulting in bigger particles measured than the ones existing before the filtration 4 conclusion for the optimum design and operation of material recovery technologies based on precipitation conventional models used in the wastewater framework should be updated for example considering psd and the effect of some operational variables developments done in the paper have been focused on two main aspects 1 a new mass based pbm has been developed coherent in its structure with conventional wastewater treatment models and compatible with them the model has been described using the usual notation in wastewater treatment modelling stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector state variables are mass of components instead of number of particles which guarantees mass continuity the model proposed in this study included main precipitation mechanisms and common wastewater equilibrium reactions as ion pairing and acid base reactions moreover other reactions related to liquid gas transfers used in some precipitation technologies or even biological reactions could be easily incorporated if required the model constructed has been implemented successfully in west dhi simulation platform 2 the results obtained from the sensitivity and collinearity analysis demonstrate that all the parameters have some weight in the outputs and that there are large zones of the parameter values where the identifiability is possible therefore the structure of the model is considered valid however zones where correlation exists between the parameters were identified correlation effects could explain the variability in the parameter values found in the literature where less data is available for calibration than the one generated synthetically correlation effects of the parameters should be considered before calibrating a pbm finally the model has been experimentally verified and it demonstrated its capacity to reproduce some experiments performed in the laboratory with reasonable values of the parameters further research will include a more

18925,mathematical models describing precipitation processes in one step need to be upgraded particle size distribution is a crucial variable and its inclusion in the modelling libraries is necessary if the technology wants to be optimized through simulation with this objective a mass based population balance model is presented in this contribution the model has been constructed using a stoichiometric matrix and a kinetic vector and using mass as the internal coordinate as it is usually done in wastewater treatment modelling identifiability of the parameters of the model was evaluated using a sensitivity and a collinearity analysis for six simulation case studies of struvite precipitation in addition parameters in the model were calibrated to represent data from two batch tests in the laboratory the results of the analysis showed that the identifiability of the parameters depends on the available experimental data and explored scenarios identifiability of the parameters could be the reason behind the shifting parameter values describing mechanisms of precipitation in the literature this contribution helps to understand the possibilities and limitations that the population balance model approach offer graphical abstract image 1 keywords population balance model struvite precipitation sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis 1 introduction struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the most interesting materials to recover from urban wastewater it is a slow release fertilizer that can be recovered in wastewater treatment plants wwtps main advantages of recovering struvite are 1 it reduces operational costs in wwtps associated with the maintenance of reactors and pipes due to blockage of phosphorous p salts 2 it fights global p scarcity and 3 it reduces eutrophication problems in receiving waterways some technologies have been recently developed that demonstrate the feasibility of the full scale process egle et al 2016 some of these technologies are based on the controlled precipitation of the product however most of them show significant differences in their operation depending on the characteristics of the product to be recovered and process restrictions continuous versus batch different hydraulic retention times etc tarragó et al 2016 the flourishment of recovery technologies and the differences in the operation among them reinforce the idea that this is an attractive process from the economic and environmental perspective that can still be optimized mathematical modelling and simulation have been proved as useful tools for the design and optimization of new and existing wwtps and their unit processes the precipitation process of struvite and other interesting materials have already been included in mathematical modelling and simulation libraries for wwtps lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2017 these modelling and simulation libraries known as plant wide models pwms combine information from the biological chemical and physicochemical processes in the plant with its economic performance and are able to predict the amount of obtained solid in the reactor based on the kinetic of precipitation and thermodynamics however although these models provide a relevant information about the amount of product obtained and their suitability and effects on the global wwtp behavior they present some limitations for the optimum design and operation of the technologies it is known that struvite performance as a fertilizer depends on the obtained particle size distribution psd tarragó et al 2016 this psd will be conditioned by the inner mechanisms of the precipitation primary nucleation homogeneous and heterogeneous secondary nucleation growth aggregation attrition or breakage of particles the weight of each mechanism in the obtained product is determined by the experimental conditions in the reactor namely ph supersaturation level mixing energy temperature and the presence of foreign ions in the precipitating solution le corre et al 2009 neither the information on the psd nor the inner mechanisms of the process are included in classic pwm approaches as this information is important for the design and optimization of element recovery reactors one step precipitation models have to be upgraded with new modelling frameworks for wastewater treatment modelling as the population balance model pbm the pbm can successfully describe the evolution in time and space of the distribution of properties of a group of discrete entities particles bubbles cells etc dispersed in a continuous phase it typically considers an additional internal coordinate which is some measure of the particles size it includes explicitly inner mechanisms of the precipitation process and is able to predict the evolution of a psd in a reactor the main equation of the pbm for a batch experiment can be expressed as galbraith 2011 1 n d t g n d l b l d l where n d is the population density l is the crystal length g is the size independent linear growth rate b is the birth function and d the death function the population density n defines the number of particles per volume unit n d within the size range l l dl 2 n d l d n d dl these equations are used to define a general case of the pbm when it is based on particle number the analytical resolution for the pbm is only possible for the simplest cases consequently numerical methods often involving some kind of discretization or decomposition of the main equation are used for its resolution costa et al 2007 the pbm is a widely accepted tool for precipitation process modelling in industrial crystallization however only recently has been used to represent wwtp unit processes nopens et al 2015 pbm has been proved to be successful to track changes in the psd in the struvite precipitation already galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 modelled psd and reactants consumption show good agreement between the experimental data and model results this evidences the great potential of the pbm for the correct prediction of the process and its optimization however there are two main aspects in the existing contributions that have to be addressed firstly pbm models have generally been defined using number of particles as the dependent variable of the process which is coherent with the model purposes but can lead to mass discontinuities hounslow et al 1988 although partially solved galbraith et al 2014 this problem would make them incompatible with conventional models used in the wastewater treatment framework which are mainly constructed on the basis of mass balances around the unit to be described iwa asm adm models for a successful implementation of pbm in wastewater treatment industry mass discontinuity must be avoided first using mass as internal coordinate automatically satisfies the mass balance scarlett 2002 in addition it allows to represent the mechanisms of the pbm as a dynamic mass balance for the elements forming the components in the system as it is usually done in standardized methodology for wastewater treatment modelling this approach was used to describe comminution sintering or granulation processes verkoeijen et al 2002 however those examples did not include the mechanisms of homogeneous nucleation and particle growth which are necessary to describe the mass transference occurring from the liquid phase to the solid phase moreover the aggregation was defined for constricted in space aggregation sastry and fuerstenau 1970 and a linearly partitioned size domain verkoeijen et al 2002 those considerations are not valid for a precipitation process where the solid concentration is small and a big range of sizes needs to be covered the second aspect is that obtained parameter values for the parameters defining inner mechanisms of the precipitation of struvite are very variable in the literature galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 mehta and batstone 2013 the same happens for other compounds too chen et al 2002 ruan et al 2016 mechanisms occur simultaneously and obtaining meaningful experimental data to attribute to each mechanism its real effect on the precipitation is difficult making calibration a very challenging issue in addition each author considers different model assumptions which has a direct effect on the calibrated parameter values for example some articles did not include aggregation in the mechanisms of precipitation hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 leaving growth as the only particle enlargement process in their model this will inevitably lead to different parameter values comparing to the authors that include aggregation even for the same experimental conditions and sampling method in addition many definitions for the kernels of the mechanisms have been used in the literature especially for aggregation and breakage hill and ng 2002 which leads again to different parameter values moreover the considered thermodynamic equilibrium rates the use of activity coefficients and the way they are obtained are other important reasons for these differences election of the constants governing these equilibrium equations have shown to have a considerable effect on the predicted precipitation potential barnes and bowers 2017 using mathematical analysis tools to evaluate the possibility of obtaining trustworthy parameter values will increase the confidence in the modelling framework the first objective of this contribution is to present a pbm scheme based on a mass balance approach where the mass is conserved and it is compatible with wastewater treatment models conventionally used for this issue the pbm was adapted to a conventional model structure in wastewater treatment modelling where mass of the crystal entities is used as the internal variable instead of particle number the second objective is to evaluate the theoretical parameter identifiability of the constructed model using model analysis tools as sensitivity analysis and a collinearity analysis this evaluation is helpful to understand the goodness of the modelling framework before any calibration procedure is followed to conclude the paper model parameters were adjusted heuristically to reproduce experimental data obtained in two laboratory tests as a preliminary illustration of the predictive capacity of the model 2 materials and methods in this section the information is divided in three subsections in subsection 2 1 a description of the presented model is given in subsection 2 2 the methodology followed to implement the analysis tools used to assess the identifiability of the parameters is detailed and in subsection 2 3 the experimental procedure followed to obtain the data to determine the value of the parameters of the model is described 2 1 precipitation model the model presented in this contribution describes the precipitation process of struvite the main reaction for this process is 3 m g 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 p o 4 6 h 2 o the mass transference process occurring in the reactor is defined by the pbm approach described below 2 1 1 population balance model the mathematical model presented here is a discretized population balance model dpbm where particle sizes are defined after partitioning the crystal size range in 30 bins each of the bins corresponds to spherical particles sized between 0 001 and 0 812 mm of radius the volume size defined for each bin is twice the previous one following a geometric partition of the size domain as a consequence psd in the model is a truly discrete discretization where only particles of size v 2v 4v etc exist being v the volume of the smallest spherical particle size considered the difference between the dpbm presented in this contribution and most of the pbms available in literature is the way in which particle particle and particle liquid interactions are defined in this study mass is used as the internal coordinate instead of using particle number each particle size bin is considered as a component in the model and its interaction with other components ions in the liquid and or other solid bins is described by the precipitation mechanisms and is based on the mass continuity of the components the ions considered are those employed in urban wastewater treatment models they have been defined using common wastewater equilibrium reactions as ion pairing and acid base reactions following guidelines and equations proposed in lizarralde et al 2015 and showed in table 1 the mechanisms of precipitation in this contribution homogeneous nucleation particle growth and aggregation of particles are defined using a petersen matrix for the stoichiometry and a vector of kinetics the kinetics of mechanisms are defined in a general way as power law functions dependent on supersaturation index si and kinetic rates and exponents 4 r k r s i n r where r is the rate of change of the mechanism k r is the kinetic rate of the r mechanism and n r is the exponent units of r and k r depend on the mechanism the si is calculated using the ion activity product iap of the species conforming the struvite and the solubility product of the salt 5 si log a m g 2 a n h 4 a p o 4 3 ks p stru where a i is the activity of ion i mol l and k s p s t r u is the solubility product of the salt many values for the solubility product have been reported in the literature doyle and parsons 2002 rahaman et al 2006 from the proposed values k s p s t r u 7 58 10 13 mol l 3 was used for all the simulations in this contribution as the pbm is mass based the model could be further extended with other reactions as liquid gas transfer other salts precipitation or other chemical reactions in a systematic and simple way in order to simulate struvite or other salt precipitation process in a reactor operated with real wastewater mechanisms not considered in this article such as breakage or secondary nucleation could be added too however this model accounts for the most important mechanisms maintaining a good compromise between relatively simple implementation and realistic results in the next subsections each mechanism is described in detail 2 1 2 nucleation homogeneous nucleation is the spontaneous creation of small entities from the liquid phase in the absence of other solid bodies these entities are in the edge of liquid and solid phase some of them re dissolve into liquid and others become the starting point of the precipitation it is uncertain how homogeneous nucleation happens however it is usually accepted that a sequence of bimolecular additions is the cause mullin 2001 the number of molecules present in a nucleus is considered to be between ten and several thousand this size range is considerably smaller than the minimum size measurable with typically available equipment and as a consequence the ones considered in the pbms in the literature in this contribution this smallest size has been arbitrarily chosen as r 0 001 mm following the example of galbraith galbraith et al 2014 the nucleation rate should be understood as the appearance rate of particles of the smallest size considered in the model this appearance is subjected in reality to nucleation and particle enlargement processes the assumption is considered valid as particles smaller than r 0 001 mm have a very small effect on the obtained crystal mass the created crystal mass of size r 0 001 mm is proportional to the reactants consumption as defined in the stoichiometry this appearance rate is defined as 6 b 0 k b s i n b v r where b 0 is the particle birth rate due to homogeneous nucleation nucleus day k b is the kinetic rate nucleus day m3 v r is the volume liquid in the reactor m3 and n b is the exponent mass change in the smallest sized bin due to nucleation is 7 x 1 t k b s i n b v r mes f 1 where x 1 is the mass of struvite g characterized as the smallest size in a certain time and m e s f 1 is the mass of struvite g in a single sphere of the smallest bin table 2 is the stoichiometry matrix for nucleation process 2 1 3 crystal growth once the nuclei stabilize precipitation occurs through particle enlargement processes particle growth and aggregation particle growth is the particle enlargement process where particles increase their size by consuming reactants the rate of change in the size of particles is defined as 8 g k g s i n g k g and n g are the kinetic rate mm d and exponent respectively in addition to the si the mass of a bin x i disappearing due to the growth rate from the i th to the i 1 th size x i t g i i 1 will be determined by the available crystal surface of the i th bin 9 x i t g i i 1 g a i t ρ where a i t is the area m2 of the i sized crystals at a certain time and ρ is the density g m3 of the crystal as the area is not a variable included in the model it has to be converted to a term depending on mass 10 a i t c w i t v r ρ l i l i 1 2 where c w i t is the concentration of i sized particles in g m3 and l i and l i 1 are the radius in mm of the i th and i 1 th bin respectively substituting a i t 11 x i t g i i 1 g c w i t v r l i l i 1 2 k g s i n g c w i t v r l i l i 1 2 as x i c w i t v r 12 x i t g i i 1 k g s i n g x i l i l i 1 2 the change in the total mass of the i th sized particles due to the growth mechanism will be the difference between the particles that grow from the previous bin to the considered bin and the particles that grow from the considered bin to the next 13 x i t g x i t g i 1 i m a s s g r o w i n g f r o m p r e v i o u s b i n x i t g i 1 i m a s s g r o w i n g t o n e x t b i n the definition of these steps and the interaction with the ions in the reaction is defined in table 3 2 1 4 aggregation aggregation is the particle enlargement process where the effective impact of two small crystals form a bigger one it is thought that some consumption of the dissolved ions is needed to create the bond between two colliding crystals hounslow et al 2001 the consumption due to the bond formation is assumed as negligible in the stoichiometry of this model and its effect is taken into account by making the aggregation kinetics proportional to the supersaturation index 14 β k a s i n a k a l d and n a are the size independent kinetic constant or kernel and the exponent respectively size independent aggregation kernels are the simplest and the ones with the best results bramley et al 1996 some studies suggest that the effectiveness of the impact could be related to the competing speed of the bond formation and the shear rate in the reactor hounslow et al 2013 2001 the impact of the shear rate is not considered in the equations of this pbm when considering a geometrically partitioned size spectrum a problem arises when modelling the collision of two spheres if the colliding particles have different volumes as an example v and 2v the model cannot represent the birth of the 3v sized sphere as this size is not defined to overcome this problem in this contribution the approach of hounslow for the discretization of the aggregation process hounslow et al 1988 is adapted to a mass based pbm the results of the approach are comparable to the results of other discretization types nopens et al 2005 and it has been successfully used to represent struvite aggregation galbraith et al 2014 the approach of hounslow is based on the idea that the entity of volume 3v formed experimentally will be fractioned in the model a fraction is upgraded to the next sized bin size 4v and another fraction stays in the biggest size of the colliding particles size 2v the development of the aggregation mechanism starts defining that the effective collision of particles of two different sizes i and j being j i is proportional to the number of entities present in the model 15 β n i n j for a mass based model this means 16 β x j x i mes f j mes f i where m e s f j g and m e s f i g are the mass of a j sized and i sized sphere respectively for the death term the mass of j size leaving the j th bin due to collisions with class i will be the number of this effective collisions multiplied by the mass in each j sphere 17 d x j dt β x j x i mes f j mes f i mes f j β x j x i mes f i analogously the mass of i size leaving the i th bin due to collisions with class j will be proportional to the effective collisions multiplied by the mass in the i th size bin as the sum of the mass of both particles will not be enough to obtain a particle of size i 1 it is consider that a part of the particle of size i passes to the i 1 bin whilst another part stays in i housnlow s approach to this end the mass leaving the i th bin is multiplied by a 2 j i factor 18 d x i dt 2 j i β x j x i mes f j mes f i mes f i 2 j i β x j x i mes f j this process is described in a diagram in fig 1 with this assumption and considering that for the birth term the mass of i 1 size formed due to collisions between particles in i th and j th class will be the sum of the mass leaving i and j classes due to collisions mass of the solids is automatically conserved during aggregation 19 d x i 1 dt d x i dt d x j dt combining equations 20 d x i 1 dt 2 j i β x j x i mes f j β x j x i mes f i β x j x i 2 j i

precipitation until now an identifiability analysis of the kinetic rates and exponents defining the mechanisms described in subsection 2 1 was considered necessary prior to any calibration procedure this analysis was done in four steps first the model was implemented in west dhi simulation platform second six case studies in which all the mechanisms described in the model were expected to have some relevance were described third a quantification of the effect of each parameter on the model s outputs was done integrating a local sensitivity method into a global sampling method finally a collinearity analysis of the model was done so as to observe possible correlation effects between the parameters 2 2 1 case studies for the simulations performed in this contribution six different simulation case studies were defined in west dhi case studies a b and c were operated in batch mode with very high si and no seed material in contrast case studies d e and f corresponded to a continuous operation of a precipitation reactor with an initial seed loading all the simulations considered the reactors as completely stirred tank reactor cstr all the si provided correspond to the equilibrium value of the si that would be obtained if no reaction occurred in the reactors each of case studies a b and c was a cstr of 1 l capacity with an initial volume of 500 ml of a solution containing kh2po4 and nh4cl on it starting at simulation time t 0 s 150 ml of a solution containing mgcl2 6h2o were added in the first 10 s after that no more external perturbation was introduced in the system the difference among these scenarios were the initial concentrations of the species as included in table 5 for case studies d e and f a reactor of 11 4 l of capacity was used temperature was 21 c precipitation process started with the reactor full of a solution containing 0 228 mol l nh4cl and 0 114 mol l kh2po4 and 640 g of struvite seed material of average diameter of 185 μm starting at simulation time t 0 s 3 solutions entered the reactor with constant flows and continuously for 24 h the first solution was formed by kh2po4 and nh4cl the second one by mgcl2 6h2o and the third one by naoh for the three case studies the same flow of the solution formed by kh2po4 and nh4cl 0 3168 m3 day and the solution formed by mgcl2 6h2o 0 0253 m3 day were used the difference in the conditions of the simulations was achieved by changing the naoh dosing quantity 0 0265 m3 day 0 0132 m3 day and 0 0106 m3 day for cases d e and f respectively which affected the si in the reactor details can be found in table 6 the si in the reactor for cases d e and f were 2 04 1 19 and 0 65 respectively the precipitated solid was retained in the reactor during the process 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis the objective of running a sensitivity analysis is to verify how important each parameter is for the performance of the model usually it is employed to simplify overparameterized models in this contribution it is used to verify that in the parameter range chosen all the parameters and consequently the mechanisms play a role in the outputs as a previous step to the model calibration evaluated parameters and their ranges are included in table 7 choosing meaningful parameter values for the analysis is not straightforward as the variability in the kernels and values for them is big in the literature the ranges were chosen to cover zones that included values observed in the literature review galbraith et al 2014 mullin 2001 myerson 2001 triger et al 2012 and also based on previous simulations performed by the authors the sensitivity analysis can be done following a global sampling technique or a local analysis technique global sampling methods pick parameter sets in the previously defined hyperspace in order to run the simulation with them when enough simulations are done an idea of how the results of the simulation change depending on the values of the parameters can be obtained van griensven et al 2006 on the other hand local analysis techniques evaluate the impact of changing slightly the value of the parameters at a previously defined point in the parameter hyperspace this is especially useful when parameter values are known with some security brun et al 2001 considering the big uncertainty in the values of the kinetic parameters and in order to explore a large zone in the parameter hyperspace the sensitivity analysis was performed integrating a local analysis technique into a global sampling method this integration consists on repeating the local analysis in many randomly or systematically sampled points in this contribution the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method proposed by van griensven et al 2006 was used points were sampled using the lh scheme and local sensitivities were calculated using the oat method for the quantification of the effect of each parameter a little variation was introduced in the parameter of interest while the rest were maintained constant the difference on the outputs for the simulations with and without this variation were computed the result was the univocal variation on the model s outputs for the change in each parameter 25 s i j k 100 m θ 1 θ j 1 f i θ n m θ 1 θ j θ n m θ 1 θ j 1 f i θ n m θ 1 θ j θ n 2 where s i j k is the partial effect of the j th parameter on each i th output in the k th point f i is the small variation in the parameter and m refers to the model outputs note that the variation in the parameters is a fraction of the parameter value at the selected point the obtained value of the sensitivity is already normalized the operation was repeated for all the parameters being analyzed in each sampled point for the six different case studies p n 1 simulations of each case study were performed where p 300 was the total number of points of the hyperspace selected by the lh and n 6 the number of parameters therefore the influence of the six kinetic parameters used in the model was quantified using a total of 2100 runs for each of the six simulation case studies the result of this iterative operation is a tridimensional matrix a bidimensional matrix for each p sampled point with m number of outputs rows and n number of parameters columns the elements in these bidimensional matrixes are the partial effect of each parameter on each output s i j k the outputs used for the sensitivity analysis were ph and psd evolution during the simulated experiment for the a b and c case studies they were recorded every 10 s for the first 2 min of experiment because that was the most critical period and every minute for the next 18 min where little change is observed in the simulations for the d e and f case studies they were recorded every 10 min for the first 2 h and every hour for the next 22 h total influence of the parameter in each point δ k j was calculated averaging the effect for all the sampled outputs on a certain point 26 δ k j 1 p i 1 m s i j k 2 the averaged results formed a bidimensional matrix s named sensitivity matrix where each element was the averaged effect of the change of each parameter on each point s δ k j 2 2 3 collinearity analysis a set of parameters in a model is identifiable if it fulfils two conditions first the individual change in the parameters has to affect the model outputs second the change in one of the parameters cannot be compensated with an adequate change in another parameter brun et al 2001 from the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded which of the parameters have the biggest effect on the simulation outputs for the considered parameter bounds however it does not give any information on a possible correlation effect within the parameter set in order to assess possible compensation effects on the parameters a collinearity analysis was performed in the collinearity analysis parameters are usually organized in subsets these subsets have k parameters being k n the total number of parameters in the model the collinearity index of the parameters under study γ k was calculated as proposed in brun et al 2001 27 γ k 1 mi n β c 1 s k β c 1 λ k being s k the normalized matrix with the k parameters forming the subset under study β c is a vector of coefficients of length k and norm 1 and λ k the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix s k t s k parameter identifiability problems are found within the set under study when the limit in the collinearity index exceeds 15 brun et al 2002 or 20 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 as the identifiability of a parameter set depends on both the impact on the output of the change in the parameters and the linear independency of the subset an additional index was calculated the importance index ρ k considers both effects and it is calculated as brun et al 2001 28 ρ k det s t s 1 2 k a high sensitivity and a low collinearity will result in a high ρ k value for the subset which means a high identifiability the collinearity analysis was performed for all the points sampled with the lh for two types of parameter sets first all the parameters were analyzed in pairs to see if there were direct compensation effects between parameters in certain zones of the chosen range second the collinearity index and the importance index was calculated for the six parameters to find zones of the parameter range where all the parameters in the model are identifiable for the case studies used the parameter identifiability study was done combining matlab and west dhi the lh scheme was implemented in matlab and the values of the parameters picked for each run once these values were chosen the information was sent to the west simulation platform and the six case studies were reproduced the information about the outputs of the model was recorded from the west simulation and translated to matlab afterwards a perturbation of 1 was introduced in the first parameter and the simulations in west were repeated with the perturbed parameter set this operation was repeated for all the parameters under study the information of the outputs was used to calculate the sensitivities the collinearity index and the importance index fig 2 explains the steps followed 2 3 experimental set up experimental data for the determination of the parameter values was obtained from precipitation batch tests run in the laboratory the batch test were performed in a magnetically stirred cylindrical vessel the magnetic stirrer rotated at 300 rpm in all cases to ensure similar hydrodynamics in all runs 2 experimental conditions corresponding to simulation case studies a and b were used each of the conditions was run twice the objective was to analyze the effect of different initial si on the ph evolution and on the final psd in all the cases 500 ml of a dissolution prepared with a determined quantity of kh2po4 and nh4cl were left in a 1 l capacity vessel after that 150 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o solution were added in 10 s initial values of temperature ph concentrations and supersaturation calculated in west dhi are included in table 5 as can be observed initial concentration of species is significantly higher than those found in real wwtps this approach was followed for two reasons in order to obtain enough solid mass in the precipitation for the psd measurements and to experimentally analyze processes where the homogeneous nucleation is important each of the precipitation process was run for 20 min the information used for the determination of the kinetic rates and exponents was the evolution of ph and the final psd ph was measured every half second for the 20 min that the experiment lasted after the 20 min the experiment was stopped the precipitated solid was filtered and dried at 40 c for 96 h total mass of obtained solid was weighted and after that final psd was obtained measuring the dried solid in air suspension by laser diffraction using a sympatec h820 3 results the model presented in section 2 1 was assessed from an identifiability and predictive capacity point of view for this issue first the model was implemented in west dhi second different simulation scenarios were run to obtain meaningful results from the numeric analysis finally a parameter set was found that could represent well data from experiments performed in the laboratory results from those activities are included in this section 3 1 parameter identifiability module 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis results from the sensitivity analysis showed that all the parameters had some effect on the outputs the limit for considering a parameter non identifiable due to its low effect on the outputs is 1 1000 compared with the parameter with the biggest effect gábor et al 2017 this is a substantially smaller value than the result obtained in this study therefore all parameters were considered to play a role in the outputs the total effect of each parameter on the total output for all the points sampled δ k j was included in fig 3 as observed in fig 3 the parameters had different distribution of their sensitivity within the pre selected ranges it should be reminded that this sensitivity calculation only informed about the zone of the parameter range where each parameter affected the outputs not where it could represent experimental data with more accuracy in addition as the results of the sensitivity analysis could be biased by the values of the rest of the parameters more meaningful conclusions were obtained when the effect of the collinearity was considered however before that there were some tendencies that should be indicated attending the nucleation rate and exponent kr nucleation had a constant and relatively low effect on the outputs for all the range this result agreed with other studies where even for larger ranges of the parameter value the change in the nucleation constant had a little total effect hanhoun et al 2013 the sensitivity of the nucleation exponent was relatively high and increased with its value this could be explained by the fact that the case studies a b and c used in the simulations had high initial si and no seed material which are the experimental conditions where homogeneous nucleation is most favored as there is not initial crystal mass in the solution the homogeneous nucleation is the process that triggers the precipitation this will inevitably affect the evolution of the whole psd and not only the smallest size how fast particles are created will limit the consequent growth and aggregation of bigger particles as it will limit the available concentration of them therefore it will be an important mechanism for the evolution of the ph and psd on the other hand case studies d e and f had an initial seed loading and had relatively low si especially case study d in these conditions particle enlargement mechanisms should be dominant however formation of fines can still occur agrawal et al 2018 kr growth and growth exponent showed different tendencies the sensitivity of the kr growth is relatively constant for the whole range its value is nearly twice the value of the kr nucleation but it is significantly smaller than the sensitivities of the three exponents sensitivity of the growth exponent reached the highest sensitivity of the six parameters for its lowest values this highlighted the relevance of the process growth process is an important mechanism for different experimental conditions as it has a big effect on reactants consumption and consequently in the psd sensitivity of the growth exponent decreased when its value increased but it maintained a high sensitivity for the whole range considering the terms that define aggregation kr aggregation had a low and constant effect for all the parameter range on the other hand aggregation exponent presented higher average sensitivities as it increased however the dispersion of the values of the sensitivity was bigger than it was for other parameters having some of the high values of the aggregation exponent a big effect on the outputs and others a very small one this phenomenon needed further study and for that issue the effect of the aggregation exponent was analyzed for each case study individually and the results recorded in fig 4 from this analysis some ideas were obtained firstly there was a clear increase of the effect of the aggregation exponent as its value increased for the case studies a and b this effect could be explained in the model because a higher value of the aggregation exponent would mean a higher speed of aggregation for high si for the same concentration of particles therefore particles would get bigger faster at the initial steps of the precipitation without reactants consumption reducing the available surface area less surface area would mean less possibility to grow which would mean a slower precipitation a slower precipitation would maintain the si high for more time making the aggregation process important for a longer period of time however experimental evidence from the literature show that when reactors are operated unseeded and high si formation of fines governs the precipitation process rather than aggregation agrawal et al 2018 moreover aggregation is important when the reactor is seeded and works in continuous mode shih et al 2017 these favorable experimental conditions for aggregation are far from case studies a and b and are more similar to case studies d e and f where the trend of the sensitivity of the aggregation exponent is different it is bigger for low values from the analysis of the parameters of the aggregation two conclusions could be obtained the first one was that the effect of the aggregation exponent for the highest values seemed not to be able to represent correctly the mechanism as it gained relevance in case studies where it should not be important the second one was that for certain experimental conditions case studies d e and f the effect of the aggregation exponent can be important and therefore aggregation should always be considered when modelling crystallization processes 3 1 2 identifiability analysis the identifiability analysis finds possible correlations amongst the parameters under study as the objective of this analysis was to evaluate the possible interactions in the model all the parameters were considered however when the number of parameters increases it is difficult to see their real effect on the collinearity index therefore looking for direct compensation effects the collinearity index and the importance index was calculated first for each point sampled with the lh for every pair of the parameters afterwards the operation was repeated for the whole set of six parameters that describe the model 3 1 2 1 identifiability analysis for parameter pairs results of the maximum value of the collinearity index the maximum importance index and the minimum importance index for the analysis for parameter pairs were included in table 8 collinearity index values between 15 and 20 have been given as critical for parameter identifiability in the literature brun et al 2002 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 in this study there is a pair of parameters kr aggregation and aggregation exponent with its value above 15 the distribution of the collinearity index for that pair of parameters was included in fig 5 kr aggregation and aggregation exponent had collinearity problems for big values of the exponent for any value of the kr aggregation this agreed well with the sensitivity of kr aggregation which was low and constant for the whole range see fig 3 e and with the big variability of the sensitivity of the aggregation exponent for big values see fig 3 f in addition it showed that aggregation exponent is at least biased by other parameter this means that depending on the considered experimental conditions chosen for the calibration its estimation could not be possible more generally pair of parameters sharing mechanism pairs 1 and 10 or pair of parameters with the same relationship with si pairs 2 and 7 could have direct compensation problems if less simulation scenarios or data was used for the identifiability analysis for instance if only the information of the case studies a b and c was used the effect on the outputs could be compensated being the collinearity index up to 31 for growth exponent and nucleation exponent when both had big values especially growth exponent these two parameters determine the relationship of nucleation and growth with the si within the crystallization high values of nucleation exponent would lead to high values of concentration of the first bin very fast which would at the same time accelerate the growth from the first bin to the second the second to the third and so on high values of growth exponent would accelerate growth at high si too therefore for certain experimental conditions in this case case studies a b and c these parameters could be correlated even for a big amount of considered data as in the analysis a total of six case studies were considered this correlation was not a problem as the case studies represented experimental conditions where their effects could be distinguished results from the importance index for the parameter pairs see table 8 indicated that the pairs of parameters with the highest maximum importance index were the ones combining the three exponents and the growth rate this result agreed well with the values of the sensitivities which were lower for the other two parameters kr nucleation and kr aggregation big differences were found between the maximum and minimum value which remarks that the parameter identifiability largely depended on the parameter values 3 1 2 2 identifiability analysis for the six parameters results of the collinearity analysis of the whole parameter set stated that from the 300 sampled parameter combinations 251 had a collinearity index below the threshold of 15 as the six parameters can be involved in combinations with high collinearity index almost 15 or more finding a zone graphically with no collinearity issues that include the effect of all the parameters is not straightforward therefore the effect of the collinearity is included in the representation of the importance index the importance index combines information from the sensitivity and collinearity of the parameters fig 6 represented the importance index of the six parameters in two plots for the four parameters that led to parameter pairs with highest importance index the graphs clearly showed that low values of the growth exponent and the kr growth combined with high nucleation exponents led to parameter sets with a better identifiability fig 6 a effect of the aggregation exponent was not as clear fig 6 b this was a logical result as the aggregation exponent showed little average sensitivity for values below 2 fig 3 f and a high collinearity with the kr aggregation for high values fig 5 b from the obtained results it could be concluded that there were zones of parameter values with theoretical identifiability problems this could be even more problematic if less data or experimental scenarios were used as it is the usual case for pbm calibration the identifiability problem could explain the differences in the values of the parameters found in literature for calibrated pbms more than small changes in the structures of the pbm or the used solving method considering this a calibrated pbm should clearly indicate the limits of its application as it is possible that the parameters chosen are not general values but compensated among them for the case studies and or parameter values chosen in addition when using the models it should be considered that the parameter values can be good enough to represent a certain amount of data but it is not correct to consider the processes or parameters individually as they might be biased by the value of the rest of the parameters of the model on the other hand there were zones where the identifiability was possible for the data and case studies used some of the zones of the parameters with high identifiability mainly for the exponents were reasonable values according to classic precipitation theories this is important as enforces the idea that the pbm can explain the precipitation in a realistic way by including the main mechanisms in an explicit way 3 2 fitting the model to the experimental data based on the information obtained in the mathematical analysis conducted previously the parameters under study were adjusted to reproduce the data obtained from the experiments undertaken in the laboratory and explained in subsection 2 3 experimental results showed a sharp decay of the ph when the solutions contacted this is something expected due to the high si chosen for the experiments the obtained solid size was small as it tends to occur for high si fang et al 2016 fig 7 shows the average of the evolution of the ph and the final psd in the experiments obtained struvite mass was 7 6445 g for case a and 4 6601 g for case b for the adjustment values were chosen from the zone of the highest identifiability for those parameters that obtained a high value of the importance index in the previously conducted analysis exponents and kr growth kr nucleation and kr aggregation were parameters with lower identifiability and their effect is not as important on the outputs as that of the rest of the parameters once the most important parameters were fixed they were manipulated within the analyzed range in order to obtain a value that led to a reasonable similarity between the experimental data and the results from the simulations the nucleation exponent was fixed at 5 this value agrees with other contributions where it is stated that the exponent for secondary nucleation is often above 2 and the exponent for homogeneous nucleation is typically much higher myerson 2001 growth exponent was fixed at 2 growth exponent presented a high identifiability for zones in which its value was low in addition classic growth theories state that the value of the growth exponent is usually between 1 and 2 mullin 2001 moreover its value has been chosen between 1 and 3 for different definitions of the growth rate li et al 2003 regarding aggregation exponent as mentioned in subsection 3 1 high sensitivity found for its high values corresponded to unseeded very high si and batch simulation cases on the contrary the continuous case studies showed higher values of the sensitivity for lower values of the parameter in addition high values of aggregation exponent led to collinearity problems therefore it was decided to choose a value of 2 for the aggregation exponent out of the zone with collinearity problems this value is in consonance with the observations made by wójcik and jones 1997 that found a linear increase of the agglomeration kernel with the growth rate kr growth was selected in this contribution at 12 mm d slightly lower than the value of 18 mm d obtained in galbraith et al 2014 for the growth rate of struvite as explained above the parameters with the lowest impact in the outputs were adjusted at the end kr nucleation was fixed at 1013 nucleus m3 day this value is lower than the values obtained in galbraith et al 2014 and in triger et al 2012 however those values in the literature were obtained for significantly lower values of the nucleation exponent in galbraith et al 2014 or a different kernel in triger et al 2012 on the other hand kr aggregation was fixed at 10 5 l d lower value than the value obtained in galbraith et al 2014 however the exponent of the aggregation was calibrated at 5 259 in galbraith et al 2014 whereas in this contribution is fixed at 2 the fact that other contributions reported different exponent and kinetic rate values while maintaining a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental values highlighted that correlation may exist when calibrating a pbm and emphasized the idea that it is very difficult to compare parameter values between contributions values obtained for the parameters are recorded in table 9 it should be noted that the presented parameter values do not claim to be a perfect parameter set to describe the struvite precipitation process in every experimental condition as this is not an objective of this study however the values recorded in table 9 are considered a promising first step for further calibration when more experimental data is available fig 7 confronted the simulated ph evolution and final psd with the experimental values there was a small difference in the steady state for the ph value this difference is related with the chosen ksp the difference was in concordance when the obtained solid was compared in the experiments and the simulations 7 6445 g in the experiment and 7 7512 g in the simulation for case a and 4 6601 g in the experiment and 4 8868 g in the simulation for case b discrepancies in the psd between the experimental and simulated results were related with the low accuracy of the laser diffraction method to measure non spherical particles hanhoun et al 2013 in addition as the measurements were done with dry solid it is possible that some post drying agglomeration occurred resulting in bigger particles measured than the ones existing before the filtration 4 conclusion for the optimum design and operation of material recovery technologies based on precipitation conventional models used in the wastewater framework should be updated for example considering psd and the effect of some operational variables developments done in the paper have been focused on two main aspects 1 a new mass based pbm has been developed coherent in its structure with conventional wastewater treatment models and compatible with them the model has been described using the usual notation in wastewater treatment modelling stoichiometric matrix and kinetic vector state variables are mass of components instead of number of particles which guarantees mass continuity the model proposed in this study included main precipitation mechanisms and common wastewater equilibrium reactions as ion pairing and acid base reactions moreover other reactions related to liquid gas transfers used in some precipitation technologies or even biological reactions could be easily incorporated if required the model constructed has been implemented successfully in west dhi simulation platform 2 the results obtained from the sensitivity and collinearity analysis demonstrate that all the parameters have some weight in the outputs and that there are large zones of the parameter values where the identifiability is possible therefore the structure of the model is considered valid however zones where correlation exists between the parameters were identified correlation effects could explain the variability in the parameter values found in the literature where less data is available for calibration than the one generated synthetically correlation effects of the parameters should be considered before calibrating a pbm finally the model has been experimentally verified and it demonstrated its capacity to reproduce some experiments performed in the laboratory with reasonable values of the parameters further research will include a more

18926,concentration and fraction distribution of organics and heavy metals in municipal sludge treated by modified phosphogypsum and acetic acid signed as mpg hac were studied the results showed that mpg hac conditioning significantly produce synergistic enhancement effect to dissolution of unstable heavy metals wrapped in the stable colloid network simultaneously after conditioning about 45 16 of organics such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant was degraded thus dissociating large amount of active group which accelerated immobilization of dissolved heavy metals and weaken its toxicity in addition mpg with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals and transform them into residual fraction leading to a considerable decrease in their mobility risk level besides linear regression models showed that a strong oxidizability of sludge and destruction of colloidal network could greatly promote dissolution of unstable heavy metals simultaneously sludge oxidizability and organics degradation rate and disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances eps layer highly accelerate immobilization of unstable metals excepting cd environmental risk of cr

graphical abstract image 1 keywords municipal sludge heavy metals immobilization risk degradation 1 introduction significant amount of municipal sludge is generated in wastewater conditioning plant with increase of population density and acceleration of urbanization wang et al 2013 as a solid waste appropriate disposal of municipal sludge has been taken seriously due to its larger volume and toxic substances such as organic compounds macronutrients micronutrients organic micropollutants microorganisms microbial by products parasitic ova and heavy metals soobhany et al 2015 leng et al 2014 currently worldwide technologies such as landfill incineration land improvement and agricultural fertilizer application are used for municipal sludge disposal leng et al 2014 it was reported that incineration with high energy consumption was considered to be uneconomic and moreover air contamination will be caused leng et al 2014 besides landfill conditionings of municipal sludge greatly do harm to the water air and soil by discharging toxic leachate and stench soobhany et al 2015 in addition for land use presence of toxic substances including organic contaminants and heavy metals was proved to be harmful to the environment leng et al 2014 as a consequence removal of organics and heavy metals may be crucial to a safe reutilization of municipal sludge according to he et al 2017 presence of heavy metals will pose a threat to the ecological environment because of its higher concentration and strong mobility in environment tessier et al 1979 mentioned that fractions of heavy metals in environment contained exchangeable fraction f1 weak acid soluble fraction f2 reducible fraction f3 oxidizable fraction f4 and residual fraction f5 and furthermore exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction were regarded as the bioavailable metal fractions i e unstable fractions which can be absorbed by microbes and plants and finally concentrated in human body through food chain however in comparison with exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction reducible fraction and oxidizable fraction were relatively stable and residual fraction was the most stable and can very stably exist in the environment ure et al 1993 notably reduction of heavy metals concentration and converting from unstable fractions to stable fractions may do well in weakening heavy metals risk he et al 2017 up to now many technologies have been developed for removal of organic contaminants and heavy metals such as chemical extraction biological extraction electrokinetic process supercritical extraction chelation it was demonstrated that hydrothermal carbonization process could dissolve eps which is mainly composed of organics such as proteins polysaccharide and humic acid wrapped in sludge colloid network and reduce content of unstable heavy metals at high temperature liu et al 2018 in addition jin et al 2017 have suggested that addition of bamboo sawdust in the pyrolysis process of sludge could promote the degradation of organics and promote transformation of unstable fractions to stable fractions thus reducing environmental risk of heavy metals however many technologies cannot be used widely because of its high operation costs and unacceptable energy consumption what should be noted is that several chelate agents such as edta used for heavy metals conditioning will release toxic monomers into environment jin et al 2017 many researches have reported that chemical conditioning using inorganic substances for sludge could not only improve sludge dewaterability but also promote release of organics and unstable heavy metals wrapped in sludge dwyer et al 2009 he et al 2015 liu et al 2018 furthermore dwyer et al 2009 have mentioned that inorganic flocculants with porous structure may adsorb and sequester the unstable metal ions and transform them into the residual fraction meanwhile addition of acid or alkali will promote dissolution of exchangeable metals and weak acid soluble metals he et al 2017 in recent years several studies on using solid wastes to produce flocculant for sludge conditioning have been reported liu et al 2018 simultaneously inorganic materials could be obtained from those suitable solid wastes without paying thus it may be promising to use solid waste for sludge conditioning as a solid industrial waste phosphogypsum is found in the production process of phosphoric acid rashad 2014 rashad 2014 illustrated that massive mineral elements such as ca si and al which were proved to be responsible for skeleton construction in re flocculation process of sludge flocs were found in phosphogypsum moreover the mineral components and structure of phosphogypsum was proved to be beneficial to the preparation of sludge conditioning agent dai et al 2018a in this study cationic mpg was produced by phosphogypsum and octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride which could effectively load positive charges onto the surface of phosphogypsum dai et al 2018a meanwhile in view of the effect of acid on dissolution of heavy metals a technology combining with mpg and acetic acid may be effective in releasing organics and unstable heavy metals from sludge colloid network consequently objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the variation of organics which was represented using eps in sludge 2 analyze the effects of mpg hac on heavy metals in filtrate and filter cake 3 assess the mobility risk and potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sludge filter cake 4 validate the significance of organics on variations of heavy metals in treated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study sludge was from kunming wastewater conditioning plant kunming china besides concentration of raw sludge was 5 g l with a moisture content of 99 5 in addition water supply sludge was collected from kunming waterworks and industrial wastewater sludge was from the wastewater conditioning plant in majinpu industrial park of kunming respectively kunming china furthermore phosphogypsum was colleted from furui chemical of yuntianhua kunming china 2 2 experimental methods three groups of experiments signed as 1 2 and 3 were synchronously done in the experimental process at room temperature mpg and hac with different dosages were added into sludge samples forming the sludge agent mixture which was stirred at 500 rpm for 35 min and then the suspension was filtrated by a vacuum filter with vacuum range of 0 1 to 0 mpa in this experiment the filtration pressure was 0 075 mpa which was regulated with pressure valve and size of filter paper and brinell funnel was 12 5 cm and 10 cm respectively listed below were filtering steps 1 suspension was filtrated for 20 min to detect the compressibility of sludge and the filtrate was used to detect ph and oxidation reduction potential orp of sludge 2 suspension was filtrated for 20 min the filtrate and sludge filter cake were used for detection of heavy metals respectively 3 suspension was used for eps extraction in order to detect content of different types of eps and to investigate active groups in eps moreover volume of sludge sample was 100 ml in each experiment and dose of mpg hac was based on the mass of dry solids in sludge i e ds was for mpg and ml kgds was for hac 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge properties ph and orp of treated sludge were measured with the ph meter phs 3c leici shanghai china and the orp meter phs 2f leici shanghai china respectively dai et al 2018a 2 3 2 characterization methods 2 3 2 1 ft ir analysis of eps active groups in eps were analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectrometer alpha bruker germany the test conditions were as follows 1 signal to noise snr was 500 1 2 scan speed was 40 sheets s 3 resolution was 2 cm 1 and wavenumber range was 400 4000 cm 1 4 measure time was10s and integral number was 10 times 2 3 2 2 pore size distribution of mpg specific surface area and pore size distribution of mpg were measured using automatic specific surface area and pore size distribution analyzer autosorb1 iq mp quantachrome america mpg was degassed using a vacuum at 80 c for 5 h and then its pore size distribution was analyzed by measuring n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77k furthermore specific surface areas were calculated using the brunauer emmette teller bet equation 2 3 3 analyses on eps 2 3 3 1 extraction of eps multilayer structure of eps contains tightly bound eps tb eps which tightly surrounds the cells in the inner layer of stable system and loosely bound eps called as lb eps which is diffused from tb eps and forms the middle layer of eps and the outer layer soluble eps sb eps which is dispersed in the supernatant cao et al 2016 xiao et al 2016a according to he et al 2017 and chen 2013 extraction steps for different eps forms in sludge were as follows step one sb eps 50 ml of treated sludge was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then separated by centrifugation 5000 g 20 min then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the reagent bottle the solid residue was collected for the subsequent extractions step two lb eps the solid residue was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of 0 05 nacl solution and treated with ultrasonic at 20 khz for 20minites then shaken at 500 rpm for 10 min at ambient temperature and repeated the ultrasonic conditioning at 20 khz for 2minites finally the suspension was separated by centrifugation at 8000g for 20 min whereafter the supernatant was filtered through the 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the regent bottle similarly the solid residue was subjected to the extractions for tb eps step three tb eps 50 ml of 0 05 nacl solution was added to the solid residue in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and treated with ultrasonic at 20 khz for 30minites then heated in water bath at 60 c for 30 min finally the suspension was separated by centrifugation 12000g 20 min the supernatant was filtered through the 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the regent bottle 2 3 3 2 detection of eps content concentration of main components in eps generally containing proteins polysaccharides humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical were detected dai et al 2018a protein was measured by filon hydroxybenzene method with bovine serum albumin as the standard solution zhang et al 2014 polysaccharide were measured by anthrone colorimetry with a concentration of 100 μg ml of glucose solution as the standard solution chen 2013 wu et al 2014 and ye 1989 have mentioned that humic acid could be detected using an improved dichromate h2so4 titration and furthermore 4 754 g l of sucrose solution amounting to 2 mg organic carbon per milliliter was the standard solution phosphate radical and sulfate radical were determined using spectrophotometry ou et al 2011 chen 2013 moreover kh2po4 solution including 1 mg l of p was the standard solution for phosphate radical detection and additionally samples were diluted 100 times for accurate measurement with regard to determination of sulfate radical samples were condensed 100 times and moreover naso4 solution which including 1 mg of so4 2 per milliliter was the standard solution 2 3 4 determination of heavy metals in sludge concentration of cd cr cu pb and zn were measured by atomic bbsorption spectrophotometer varian aa240fs america while ni and as content were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes prodigy leeman labs america speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake was important to estimate the mobility risk of heavy metals in sludge thus it was necessary to extract different fractions of heavy metals from filter cake for detail analyses four step extraction method was performed to determine the metal fraction according to previous research tessier et al 1979 extraction steps for different forms of heavy metals in sludge filter cake were as follows tessier et al 1979 he et al 2017 step one exchangeable fraction f1 1 g of sludge sample was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 8 ml of 1 mol l mgcl2 solution and then shaken at 220 rpm for 1 h at room temperature the solid liquid mixture was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min then the supernatant was filtered through a filter membrane 0 45 μm and collected into the reagent bottle named metal f1 to detect the concentration of metal f1 moreover solid residue was collected for the subsequent extractions step two weak acid soluble fraction f2 the solid residue was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube centrifuge tubes containing 8 ml of 1 mol l naac solution and then shaken at 220 rpm for 5 h at room temperature the liquid and solid phase were separated by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min whereafter the suspension was filtered through filter membrane 0 45 μm similarly the solid residue was subjected to the subsequent extractions step three reducible fraction f3 20 ml of 0 04 mol l honh3cl solution and 25 mass percent hac were added into the solid residue the solid liquid mixture was shaken for 5 h at 85 3 c water bath then centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min and subsequently filtered the supernatant was collected into the metal f3 bottle and the solid residues were collected for the following extraction of f4 step four oxidizable fraction f4 3 ml of 0 02 mol l hno3 and 5 ml of 30 h2o2 was added into the solid residue collected in step three and then digested at 85 3 c water bath for 2 h another 3 ml of 30 h2o2 was introduced into the mixture and digested at 85 3 c water bath for 3 h shaking intermittently and then cooling on the bedstand it can be found volume of mixture was much smaller than before subsequently 5 ml of 3 2 mol l nh4ac solution was added into the mixture and then diluted to 20 ml with deionized water whereafter the mixture was shaken at 20 2 c for 30 min centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20minutes and then filtered the supernatant was collected into metal f4 bottle for metal analysis and the metal fraction of the solid residues was seen as the residual fraction step five residual fraction f5 metal f5 was digested according to routine method and the digested supernatant was collected for metal measurement 2 4 statistics analysis correlation analysis on 1 heavy metals reduction rate and major factors ph orp lb eps content and tb eps content and 2 heavy metals fraction variation and major factors orp lb eps content tb eps content and organics degradation rate were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mpg hac conditioning on sludge compressibility with a higher compressibility over 0 75 sludge particles can be easily compressed under filtration pressure of 0 035 mpa to 0 075 mpa then plugging filter holes and finally hindering water filtration nematallah et al 2016 according to skinner et al 2015 inorganic conditioners which have several mineral components such as si al ca etc could provide porous mesh like skeleton to sludge seek to form a larger stable and solid floc structure which cannot be compressed easily and can be separated from liquid phase in filtration process after mpg hac conditioning compressibility of sludge was reduced sharply fig s1 it was reported that shear modulus reflects the toughness and stiffness of material skeleton the higher the shear modulus is the greater the toughness and stiffness is chen 2013 he et al 2015 moreover shear modulus of main components generally including caso4 sio2 and al2o3 in mpg were analyzed using comsol multiphysics 5 2 to better explain the rigid structure of mpg with increasing of temperature shear modulus of caso4 sio2 and al2o3 decreased gradually fig 1 in 298 15k shear modulus of caso4 sio2 and al2o3 were 2 6 109pa 1 6 1011pa and 2 05 1011pa respectively thus compared with the experimental pressure of 3 5 104pa rigidity of mpg was enough to support the structure of sludge particles besides skeleton construction was proved to be effective in holding several tinny substances i e particles stable heavy metals etc and forming larger sludge flocs which was significant to immobilize heavy metals chen 2013 skinner et al 2015 moreover through investigating the pore size distribution of mpg found that the average pore radius was 21 22 nm total pore volume was 0 04358 cm3 g for pores smaller than 89 65 nm and surface area was 8 215 m2 g meanwhile almost all the pore sizes of mpg range from 2 nm to 50 nm fig s2 explaining that mpg was a kind of mesoporous material which could accommodate lots of sludge flocs and enhance the skeleton support for sludge particles michał and małgorzata 2015 3 2 redox properties of treated sludge with increasing of mpg hac dosage ph and orp of sludge rapidly varied fig 2 under conditioning ph was reduced from 7 14 to 3 92 and orp was increased from 158mv to 145mv fig 2 simultaneously mo et al 2015 have demonstrated that with acid addition which plays as a hydrolytic reagent for organics degradation organics will be hydrolyzed into several small molecules which would ionize some positive ions such as h ca2 mg2 etc or negative ions such as hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde quinone amino etc thus it was probably that hac could promote organics hydrolyzation thus increasing sludge redox properties dai et al 2018b and releasing active groups which could chelate heavy metals this opinion can be explained by orp variations generally value of orp shows the oxidizability of sludge and the more organics in sludge are degraded the higher the orp value is he et al 2015 dai et al 2018b after mpg hac conditioning orp increased gradually fig 2 which was in good agreement with the above analyses besides jin et al 2017 have reported that exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction of heavy metals could be dissolved into water phase at a lower ph and moreover higher orp would be propitious to unstable heavy metals migration 3 3 effects of mpg hac conditioning on eps in sludge 3 3 1 concentration change of sb eps lb eps and tb eps xiao et al 2016b have mentioned that multilayer structure of eps plays an important role in release of organics and heavy metals from stable colloid network with increasing of mpg hac dose lb eps concentration decreased obviously fig 3 b and total tb eps content was also gradually reduced fig 3 c it was reported that acids are toxic to cells which destroy cell structure kill them and promote release of intracellular substances such as organic polymers heavy metals microbial by products etc thus it was probably that hac could destroy tb eps wrapped around microbial cells leading to tb eps reduction however compared with raw sludge sb eps content also decreased after conditioning fig 3 a this further proved that macromolecular substances such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids released from lb eps tb eps and cells were degraded dai et al 2018b 3 3 2 degradation of organics in sludge for raw sludge total eps content was 181 72 mg gvss and content of total protein and total polysaccharide was 143 16 and 19 51 mg gvss respectively fig 3 indicating that proteins and polysaccharide were main components in eps after conditioning with 10 ds of mpg and 400ml kgds of hac about 45 16 of organics in sludge was reduced fig 4 a which illustrating that massive active groups were ionized from organics hydrolysis besides excessive addition will weaken degradation of organics due to its poor effect on release of eps fig 4 a it was reported that compared with polysaccharide proteins could significantly chelate heavy metals and accordingly form chelating precipitates thus sequestering the unstable heavy metals and transforming them into stable fractions therefore higher ratio of protein content to polysaccharide content value pn ps in supernatant may be important to immobilize unstable heavy metals furthermore fig 4 b showed that value of pn ps in sb eps was increased indicating that the chelating ability of sb eps to unstable heavy metals was enhanced after conditioning 3 3 3 active groups in sb eps an obvious variation of active groups can be observed in fig 5 active groups corresponding to the peaks in the ft ir spectrum were shown in table 1 apparently for raw sludge strong absorption peaks at 3630 and 1110 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of o h and c o respectively which confirmed existence of alcohol hydroxyl oh consonni et al 2016 in particular stretching vibration deformation vibration and bending vibration of n h were found at 3471 1626 and 701 cm 1 fig 5 respectively and moreover absorption peak of c n was observed at 1337 cm 1 showing the presence of amidocyanogen nh similarly carboxyl cooh was detected due to the observed absorption peaks of o h and c o at 2901 and 1714 1240 cm 1 fig 5 the results indicated that protein was contained in sb eps apart from alcohol hydroxyl amidocyanogen and carboxyl aldehyde group phenolic hydroxyl and quinonyl were also detected which probably suggest existence of polysaccharide and humic acid fig 5 table 1 balaji et al 2016 simultaneously peak area and peak height of active groups were larger and higher in treated sludge which illustrated that concentration of organics in sb eps was increased after conditioning generally active groups such as alcohol hydroxyl amidocyanogen carboxyl aldehyde group phenolic hydroxyl and quinonyl could chelate unstable heavy metals and transform them into the stable fraction ure et al 1993 dwyer et al 2009 3 4 migration and speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge under conditioning 3 4 1 migration and transformation of heavy metals in filtrate and filter cake for all metals the recovery rate was around 80 110 which represented the authenticity of obtained data he et al 2017 after conditioning heavy metals content in filtrate i e supernatant was largely increased and accordingly metals concentration in filter cake was reduced fig s3 this illustrated that mpg hac conditioning for sludge could release unstable heavy metals wrapped in the sludge colloid network into supernatant it was in good agreement with analyses of eps variation however when mpg dosage was more than 10 ds content of cu pb zn and as in sludge filter cake was increased fig s3 this is probably because that active groups in supernatant could chelate unstable heavy metals to form insoluble precipitates thus those unstable heavy metals were transferred to filter cake from filtrate and finally turned into stable metals nevertheless as mentioned earlier too many mpg hac addition may hinder heavy metals release from sludge particles which will not cause reduction of metals in filter cake tables shown in fig s3 indicated the content of metals from mpg particularly mpg would bring cu pb and zn into filtrate and filter cake and the increase of metals content caused by mpg was very tiny in comparison with the metal content in raw sludge fig s3 therefore it can be assumed that content of metal from mpg was negligible 3 4 2 speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake the fraction distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake differed greatly with each other under conditioning in raw sludge filter cake the main fraction of cd was reducible fraction which accounted for 54 95 of total cd fig 6 with increasing of agentia addition content of cd f3 and cd f4 were increased while content of cd f1 cd f2 and cd f5 decreased sharply this might indicate that with destruction of colloid network unstable heavy metals f1 and f2 were largely dissolved in supernatant leading to an increase in cd content in filtrate fig s3 a moreover with addition of hac more and more organics was degraded and then released active groups which can chelate soluble cd in filtrate to form cd f4 and transform them into filter cake thus enhancing cd f4 content in filter cake and reducing the proportion of cd f5 moreover proportion of cd f3 in filter cake was increased to 67 35 it was noted that higher orp will hinder release of reducible metals from colloid network jin et al 2017 therefore probably reduction of total cd in filter cake was caused by reduction of cd f1 and cd f2 fig 6 showed that the residual fraction was the primary fraction of cr pb and as in raw sludge filter cake which accounted for 69 99 38 33 and 33 08 respectively with increasing of mpg hac dosage content of exchangeable fraction weak acid soluble fraction and reducible fraction of cr pb and as decreased obviously while percentage of oxidizable fraction and residual fraction in filter cake increased accordingly fig 6 similarly degradation of organics promoted chelating reaction between soluble heavy metals and active groups thus improving the content of oxidizable metals in filter cake subsequently it was probably that several unstable heavy metals in supernatant can be absorbed by mpg and then be immobilized into its inner structure finally forming the residual metals and enhancing its proportion cu f5 accounted for 72 37 of total cu in raw sludge filter cake was the main fraction fig 6 with initial addition content of cu f1 cu f3 and cu f4 were increased and then decreased however cu f2 consistently decreased and cu f5 decreased firstly and then increased to 77 09 fig 6 the variation of cu f1 was abnormal compared to other metals this may be because cu f1 and cu f3 in colloid network was insensitive to little mpg hac dosage at first while at a later stage it was released into supernatant with increasing of combined addition besides it was probably that the chelating ability of active groups to soluble cu was weakened in presence of other metals thus reducing the percentage of cu f4 in filter cake for raw sludge the primary fraction of zn and ni was reducible fraction which accounted for 57 58 of total zn and 42 61 of total ni respectively fig 6 after conditioning exchangeable fraction weak acid soluble fraction and reducible fraction of them were dissolved in supernatant leading to content reduction in filter cake besides primary fraction of zn varied from reducible fraction to residual fraction accounted for 47 80 of total zn however reducible fraction was still the main ni fraction after conditioning equally percentage of stable fractions was improved due to the chelating reaction caused by organics in supernatant and adsorption of mpg to soluble metals 3 5 environmental risk evaluation currently landfill land improvement and agricultural fertilizer application are commonly used for municipal sludge disposal in order to avoid environmental pollution the environmental risk evaluation of heavy metals was probably necessary to determine the usability and toxicity of sludge in land use 3 5 1 mobility risk analysis mobility factor m f represents the mobility risk level of heavy metal the higher the value is the higher the risk level is he et al 2017 relationships between mobility factor and heavy metals fractions can be described as follows 1 m f f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 100 according to eq 1 a finding showed that m f was closely affected by exchangeable metals and weak acid soluble metals and the more f1 and f2 in sludge filer cake the higher the mobility risk of heavy metals in environment m f of heavy metals in treated sludge filter cake was shown in fig 7 excepting cu m f of all metals cd cr pb zn ni and as were reduced sharply with regard to cr and zn the risk level decreased from low risk to no risk after conditioning with increasing of combined addition risk level of ni was gradually reduced from medium risk to low risk and risk level of as was decreased from high risk to low risk respectively fig 7 besides m f value of pb and cd decreased from 8 48 to 0 82 to 3 23 and 0 44 showing that mobility risk of pb and cd was greatly weakened the results were probably because that 1 release of unstable heavy metals f1 and f2 from colloid network has increased the percentage of stable heavy metals f3 f4 and f5 in filter cake 2 in supernatant in the presence of hac several active groups produced from organics hydrolyzation could chelate unstable heavy metals to form precipitates which are organic bound heavy metals and are seen as the f4 metal and transfer them to filter cake finally immobilizing them in the form of f4 metal chen 2013 3 porous mpg may absorb those metals into the pores on mpg surface and transfer them to filter cake thus immobilizing them in the form of f3 metal which is inorganic bound heavy metals and is absorbed or co precipitated into sludge particles he et al 2015 4 in the re flocculation process of sludge flocs unstable heavy metals in supernatant were brought into the inner structure of sludge particles through floc scrolling and adsorption bridging and finally being immobilized in filter cake in the form of f5 metal residual heavy metals which is commonly found in primary and secondary silicate and other stable minerals in sludge ure et al 1993 consequently content of f3 metal f4 metal and f5 metal in filter cake was significantly increased as shown in fig 7 m f value of cd cr pb zn ni and as was obviously reduced with a lower mpg hac dosage however at the initial stage of conditioning variation of cu fraction was abnormal with increasing of agential addition m f value of cu gradually decreased and furthermore its risk level was maintained in no risk level consequently a conclusion could be made that mobility risk of heavy metals were reduced obviously under conditioning 3 5 2 potential ecological risk analysis according to jin et al 2017 the potential ecological risk index i r is used to assess the potential ecological risk level of total heavy metals in sludge furthermore ecological risk coefficient e r is used for ecological risk evaluation of single heavy metal xu et al 2008 relationships between i r and e r were as follows jin et al 2017 2 i r i 1 n e r i 3 e r i t r i c r i 4 c r i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 i where c r i is the contamination factor of single heavy metal t r i is the toxicity coefficient of individual heavy metal which here are cd 30 cr 2 cu 5 pb 5 zn 1 ni 5 and as 10 as shown in fig 8 a potential ecological risk of cr pb zn ni and as were reduced rapidly maintaining at a low level table 2 subsequently with single hac addition er value of cd decreased from 42 80 to 34 06 and its risk level was reduced from medium level to low level however combined conditioning will improve the risk level of cd fig 8 a the results indicated that single hac addition was beneficial to immobilization of cd rather than combined addition furthermore it was probably that higher dosage of mpg hac could greatly weaken potential ecological risk of cu this was in good agreement with analyses of variation of cu fraction fig 8 b showed that with combined addition ir of total metals in filter cake increased higher dosage leading to a higher risk level this might be caused by the variation of cd toxicity coefficient of which is 30 showing a higher toxicity to ecological environment than other heavy metals jin et al 2017 therefore by comparing mobility risk and potential ecological risk of heavy metals found that adding mpg hac could effectively weaken environmental risk of cr cu pb zn ni and as with regard to cd addition of mpg hac showed a higher efficiency in increasing proportion of cd f3 and cd f4 in filter cake thus mobility risk of cd was obviously mitigated while the potential ecological risk was increased 3 6 statistics analysis 3 6 1 relationships between ph orp lb eps and tb eps of sludge and heavy metals reduction as mentioned before acidity and eps have showed high efficiency in reduction of heavy metals in sludge filter cake in addition a strong positive correlation between heavy metals reduction rate rm and orp negative correlation between rm and ph lb eps content signed as clb eps and sb eps content ctb eps were observed respectively table s1 moreover multiple linear regression models which illustrated the relationships between rm and ph orp clb eps and ctb eps was established and proved to be independent table 3 in particular regression coefficient r2 for all models were 0 showing that relationships between rm and ph orp clb eps and ctb eps was completely linear not approximatively related simultaneously reduction rate of cu and zn were highly affected by those factors ph particularly compared to other heavy metals indicating that addition of hac could largely transform unstable metals into supernatant 3 6 2 correlation between heavy metals fraction and orp clb eps ctb eps and odr for all heavy metals excepting cu positive correlation between mf and clb eps ctb eps strong negative correlation between mf and orp organics degradation rate odr were found respectively table s2 correlation analysis between mf cu and those factors showed that there was no significant correlation between them table s2 the result indicated that the morphological change of cu was very complicated and was closely related with dosage of mpg and hac as noted before it took a higher dosage of more than 25 ds of mpg and more than 200ml kgds of hac to dissolve cu f1 and cu f2 from colloid network through statistical analysis found that multiple linear regression models which indicated the relationship between mf and orp clb eps and odr was established and proved to be independent table 4 particularly in doing statistical analysis ctb eps was seen as the excluded variable and thus being eliminated from model this illustrated that compared with other factors tb eps had no obvious effect on immobilization of heavy metals which was probably caused by its minimal release from colloid network besides he et al 2017 have mentioned that chelates of heavy metals produced by unstable metals and active groups can be used as the skeleton builder for sludge particles and further enhance shear resistance of sludge flocs forming in the re flocculation process thus it was probably that heavy metals chelate and mpg may lead to synergistic enhancement effects on compressibility reduction of sludge which could effectively immobilize heavy metals into sludge filter cake and weaken mobility risk of metals table 4 showed that r2 for all models were more than 95 and all estimated variables were proved to be significant p 0 05 besides a finding revealed that in comparison with other metals mf of as and ni were more sensitive to orp clb eps and odr according to those models higher orp and higher odr could transform dissolved metals into stable fraction and further promote immobilization of heavy metals into sludge filter cake and moreover the more lb eps was destroyed from colloid network the more soluble metals being chelated by active groups additionally the more unstable metals resolved into supernatant the more dissolved metals were absorbed by mpg and the more residual heavy metals were maintained in the structure of sludge particles 3 6 3 applicability of heavy metals models in different type of sludge for a better explanation on heavy metals models applicability of models in water supply sludge and industrial wastewater sludge was investigated as shown in table 5 mpg hac conditioning could obviously reduce heavy metals risk in those two sludge samples which indicated that the pretreating method for sludge samples was efficient besides heavy metals models from municipal sludge showed several errors in application of two other sludge samples in particular variation percentage error of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge was lower than 10 and that of cu ni and as was between 10 and 20 which demonstrated that mpg hac conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge especially for zn table 5 however mpg hac conditioning may not be suitable for heavy metals stabilization in industrial wastewater sludge due to a higher percentage error observed in table 5 especially for cu and zn 4 conclusions in the light of the above analyses the following conclusions were obtained 1 mpg hac conditioning significantly produce synergistic enhancement effect to the dissolution of unstable heavy metals wrapped in the stable colloidal network 2 hac might promote degradation of organics such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant and moreover about 45 16 of organics were degraded and then dissociated large amount of active group which was responsible for immobilization of dissolved heavy metals 3 mpg with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals in supernatant and transformed them into residual fraction finally stabilizing those heavy metals 4 the linear regression models showed that lower ph and higher orp could promote reduction of heavy metals from sludge filter cake and furthermore destruction of lb eps and tb eps in colloid network might do well in heavy metals reduction simultaneously higher values of orp and organics degradation rate and disintegration of lb eps might promote immobilization of unstable metals 5 excepting cd environmental risk of cr cu pb zn ni and as can be effectively mitigated after conditioning 6 mpg hac conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge especially for zn declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18926,concentration and fraction distribution of organics and heavy metals in municipal sludge treated by modified phosphogypsum and acetic acid signed as mpg hac were studied the results showed that mpg hac conditioning significantly produce synergistic enhancement effect to dissolution of unstable heavy metals wrapped in the stable colloid network simultaneously after conditioning about 45 16 of organics such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant was degraded thus dissociating large amount of active group which accelerated immobilization of dissolved heavy metals and weaken its toxicity in addition mpg with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals and transform them into residual fraction leading to a considerable decrease in their mobility risk level besides linear regression models showed that a strong oxidizability of sludge and destruction of colloidal network could greatly promote dissolution of unstable heavy metals simultaneously sludge oxidizability and organics degradation rate and disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances eps layer highly accelerate immobilization of unstable metals excepting cd environmental risk of cr cu pb zn ni and as can be effectively weakened after conditioning additionally mpg hac conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge especially for zn graphical abstract image 1 keywords municipal sludge heavy metals immobilization risk degradation 1 introduction significant amount of municipal sludge is generated in wastewater conditioning plant with increase of population density and acceleration of urbanization wang et al 2013 as a solid waste appropriate disposal of municipal sludge has been taken seriously due to its larger volume and toxic substances such as organic compounds macronutrients micronutrients organic micropollutants microorganisms microbial by products parasitic ova and heavy metals soobhany et al 2015 leng et al 2014 currently worldwide technologies such as landfill incineration land improvement and agricultural fertilizer application are used for municipal sludge disposal leng et al 2014 it was reported that incineration with high energy consumption was considered to be uneconomic and moreover air contamination will be caused leng et al 2014 besides landfill conditionings of municipal sludge greatly do harm to the water air and soil by discharging toxic leachate and stench soobhany et al 2015 in addition for land use presence of toxic substances including organic contaminants and heavy metals was proved to be harmful to the environment leng et al 2014 as a consequence removal of organics and heavy metals may be crucial to a safe reutilization of municipal sludge according to he et al 2017 presence of heavy metals will pose a threat to the ecological environment because of its higher concentration and strong mobility in environment tessier et al 1979 mentioned that fractions of heavy metals in environment contained exchangeable fraction f1 weak acid soluble fraction f2 reducible fraction f3 oxidizable fraction f4 and residual fraction f5 and furthermore exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction were regarded as the bioavailable metal fractions i e unstable fractions which can be absorbed by microbes and plants and finally concentrated in human body through food chain however in comparison with exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction reducible fraction and oxidizable fraction were relatively stable and residual fraction was the most stable and can very stably exist in the environment ure et al 1993 notably reduction of heavy metals concentration and converting from unstable fractions to stable fractions may do well in weakening heavy metals risk he et al 2017 up to now many technologies have been developed for removal of organic contaminants and heavy metals such as chemical extraction biological extraction electrokinetic process supercritical extraction chelation it was demonstrated that hydrothermal carbonization process could dissolve eps which is mainly composed of organics such as proteins polysaccharide and humic acid wrapped in sludge colloid network and reduce content of unstable heavy metals at high temperature liu et al 2018 in addition jin et al 2017 have suggested that addition of bamboo sawdust in the pyrolysis process of sludge could promote the degradation of organics and promote transformation of unstable fractions to stable fractions thus reducing environmental risk of heavy metals however many technologies cannot be used widely because of its high operation costs and unacceptable energy consumption what should be noted is that several chelate agents such as edta used for heavy metals conditioning will release toxic monomers into environment jin et al 2017 many researches have reported that chemical conditioning using inorganic substances for sludge could not only improve sludge dewaterability but also promote release of organics and unstable heavy metals wrapped in sludge dwyer et al 2009 he et al 2015 liu et al 2018 furthermore dwyer et al 2009 have mentioned that inorganic flocculants with porous structure may adsorb and sequester the unstable metal ions and transform them into the residual fraction meanwhile addition of acid or alkali will promote dissolution of exchangeable metals and weak acid soluble metals he et al 2017 in recent years several studies on using solid wastes to produce flocculant for sludge conditioning have been reported liu et al 2018 simultaneously inorganic materials could be obtained from those suitable solid wastes without paying thus it may be promising to use solid waste for sludge conditioning as a solid industrial waste phosphogypsum is found in the production process of phosphoric acid rashad 2014 rashad 2014 illustrated that massive mineral elements such as ca si and al which were proved to be responsible for skeleton construction in re flocculation process of sludge flocs were found in phosphogypsum moreover the mineral components and structure of phosphogypsum was proved to be beneficial to the preparation of sludge conditioning agent dai et al 2018a in this study cationic mpg was produced by phosphogypsum and octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride which could effectively load positive charges onto the surface of phosphogypsum dai et al 2018a meanwhile in view of the effect of acid on dissolution of heavy metals a technology combining with mpg and acetic acid may be effective in releasing organics and unstable heavy metals from sludge colloid network consequently objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the variation of organics which was represented using eps in sludge 2 analyze the effects of mpg hac on heavy metals in filtrate and filter cake 3 assess the mobility risk and potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sludge filter cake 4 validate the significance of organics on variations of heavy metals in treated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study sludge was from kunming wastewater conditioning plant kunming china besides concentration of raw sludge was 5 g l with a moisture content of 99 5 in addition water supply sludge was collected from kunming waterworks and industrial wastewater sludge was from the wastewater conditioning plant in majinpu industrial park of kunming respectively kunming china furthermore phosphogypsum was colleted from furui chemical of yuntianhua kunming china 2 2 experimental methods three groups of experiments signed as 1 2 and 3 were synchronously done in the experimental process at room temperature mpg and hac with different dosages were added into sludge samples forming the sludge agent mixture which was stirred at 500 rpm for 35 min and then the suspension was filtrated by a vacuum filter with vacuum range of 0 1 to 0 mpa in this experiment the filtration pressure was 0 075 mpa which was regulated with pressure valve and size of filter paper and brinell funnel was 12 5 cm and 10 cm respectively listed below were filtering steps 1 suspension was filtrated for 20 min to detect the compressibility of sludge and the filtrate was used to detect ph and oxidation reduction potential orp of sludge 2 suspension was filtrated for 20 min the filtrate and sludge filter cake were used for detection of heavy metals respectively 3 suspension was used for eps extraction in order to detect content of different types of eps and to investigate active groups in eps moreover volume of sludge sample was 100 ml in each experiment and dose of mpg hac was based on the mass of dry solids in sludge i e ds was for mpg and ml kgds was for hac 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge properties ph and orp of treated sludge were measured with the ph meter phs 3c leici shanghai china and the orp meter phs 2f leici shanghai china respectively dai et al 2018a 2 3 2 characterization methods 2 3 2 1 ft ir analysis of eps active groups in eps were analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectrometer alpha bruker germany the test conditions were as follows 1 signal to noise snr was 500 1 2 scan speed was 40 sheets s 3 resolution was 2 cm 1 and wavenumber range was 400 4000 cm 1 4 measure time was10s and integral number was 10 times 2 3 2 2 pore size distribution of mpg specific surface area and pore size distribution of mpg were measured using automatic specific surface area and pore size distribution analyzer autosorb1 iq mp quantachrome america mpg was degassed using a vacuum at 80 c for 5 h and then its pore size distribution was analyzed by measuring n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77k furthermore specific surface areas were calculated using the brunauer emmette teller bet equation 2 3 3 analyses on eps 2 3 3 1 extraction of eps multilayer structure of eps contains tightly bound eps tb eps which tightly surrounds the cells in the inner layer of stable system and loosely bound eps called as lb eps which is diffused from tb eps and forms the middle layer of eps and the outer layer soluble eps sb eps which is dispersed in the supernatant cao et al 2016 xiao et al 2016a according to he et al 2017 and chen 2013 extraction steps for different eps forms in sludge were as follows step one sb eps 50 ml of treated sludge was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then separated by centrifugation 5000 g 20 min then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the reagent bottle the solid residue was collected for the subsequent extractions step two lb eps the solid residue was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of 0 05 nacl solution and treated with ultrasonic at 20 khz for 20minites then shaken at 500 rpm for 10 min at ambient temperature and repeated the ultrasonic conditioning at 20 khz for 2minites finally the suspension was separated by centrifugation at 8000g for 20 min whereafter the supernatant was filtered through the 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the regent bottle similarly the solid residue was subjected to the extractions for tb eps step three tb eps 50 ml of 0 05 nacl solution was added to the solid residue in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and treated with ultrasonic at 20 khz for 30minites then heated in water bath at 60 c for 30 min finally the suspension was separated by centrifugation 12000g 20 min the supernatant was filtered through the 0 45 μm filter membrane and collected into the regent bottle 2 3 3 2 detection of eps content concentration of main components in eps generally containing proteins polysaccharides humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical were detected dai et al 2018a protein was measured by filon hydroxybenzene method with bovine serum albumin as the standard solution zhang et al 2014 polysaccharide were measured by anthrone colorimetry with a concentration of 100 μg ml of glucose solution as the standard solution chen 2013 wu et al 2014 and ye 1989 have mentioned that humic acid could be detected using an improved dichromate h2so4 titration and furthermore 4 754 g l of sucrose solution amounting to 2 mg organic carbon per milliliter was the standard solution phosphate radical and sulfate radical were determined using spectrophotometry ou et al 2011 chen 2013 moreover kh2po4 solution including 1 mg l of p was the standard solution for phosphate radical detection and additionally samples were diluted 100 times for accurate measurement with regard to determination of sulfate radical samples were condensed 100 times and moreover naso4 solution which including 1 mg of so4 2 per milliliter was the standard solution 2 3 4 determination of heavy metals in sludge concentration of cd cr cu pb and zn were measured by atomic bbsorption spectrophotometer varian aa240fs america while ni and as content were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes prodigy leeman labs america speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake was important to estimate the mobility risk of heavy metals in sludge thus it was necessary to extract different fractions of heavy metals from filter cake for detail analyses four step extraction method was performed to determine the metal fraction according to previous research tessier et al 1979 extraction steps for different forms of heavy metals in sludge filter cake were as follows tessier et al 1979 he et al 2017 step one exchangeable fraction f1 1 g of sludge sample was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 8 ml of 1 mol l mgcl2 solution and then shaken at 220 rpm for 1 h at room temperature the solid liquid mixture was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min then the supernatant was filtered through a filter membrane 0 45 μm and collected into the reagent bottle named metal f1 to detect the concentration of metal f1 moreover solid residue was collected for the subsequent extractions step two weak acid soluble fraction f2 the solid residue was introduced in a 50 ml centrifuge tube centrifuge tubes containing 8 ml of 1 mol l naac solution and then shaken at 220 rpm for 5 h at room temperature the liquid and solid phase were separated by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min whereafter the suspension was filtered through filter membrane 0 45 μm similarly the solid residue was subjected to the subsequent extractions step three reducible fraction f3 20 ml of 0 04 mol l honh3cl solution and 25 mass percent hac were added into the solid residue the solid liquid mixture was shaken for 5 h at 85 3 c water bath then centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min and subsequently filtered the supernatant was collected into the metal f3 bottle and the solid residues were collected for the following extraction of f4 step four oxidizable fraction f4 3 ml of 0 02 mol l hno3 and 5 ml of 30 h2o2 was added into the solid residue collected in step three and then digested at 85 3 c water bath for 2 h another 3 ml of 30 h2o2 was introduced into the mixture and digested at 85 3 c water bath for 3 h shaking intermittently and then cooling on the bedstand it can be found volume of mixture was much smaller than before subsequently 5 ml of 3 2 mol l nh4ac solution was added into the mixture and then diluted to 20 ml with deionized water whereafter the mixture was shaken at 20 2 c for 30 min centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20minutes and then filtered the supernatant was collected into metal f4 bottle for metal analysis and the metal fraction of the solid residues was seen as the residual fraction step five residual fraction f5 metal f5 was digested according to routine method and the digested supernatant was collected for metal measurement 2 4 statistics analysis correlation analysis on 1 heavy metals reduction rate and major factors ph orp lb eps content and tb eps content and 2 heavy metals fraction variation and major factors orp lb eps content tb eps content and organics degradation rate were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mpg hac conditioning on sludge compressibility with a higher compressibility over 0 75 sludge particles can be easily compressed under filtration pressure of 0 035 mpa to 0 075 mpa then plugging filter holes and finally hindering water filtration nematallah et al 2016 according to skinner et al 2015 inorganic conditioners which have several mineral components such as si al ca etc could provide porous mesh like skeleton to sludge seek to form a larger stable and solid floc structure which cannot be compressed easily and can be separated from liquid phase in filtration process after mpg hac conditioning compressibility of sludge was reduced sharply fig s1 it was reported that shear modulus reflects the toughness and stiffness of material skeleton the higher the shear modulus is the greater the toughness and stiffness is chen 2013 he et al 2015 moreover shear modulus of main components generally including caso4 sio2 and al2o3 in mpg were analyzed using comsol multiphysics 5 2 to better explain the rigid structure of mpg with increasing of temperature shear modulus of caso4 sio2 and al2o3 decreased gradually fig 1 in 298 15k shear modulus of caso4 sio2 and al2o3 were 2 6 109pa 1 6 1011pa and 2 05 1011pa respectively thus compared with the experimental pressure of 3 5 104pa rigidity of mpg was enough to support the structure of sludge particles besides skeleton construction was proved to be effective in holding several tinny substances i e particles stable heavy metals etc and forming larger sludge flocs which was significant to immobilize heavy metals chen 2013 skinner et al 2015 moreover through investigating the pore size distribution of mpg found that the average pore radius was 21 22 nm total pore volume was 0 04358 cm3 g for pores smaller than 89 65 nm and surface area was 8 215 m2 g meanwhile almost all the pore sizes of mpg range from 2 nm to 50 nm fig s2 explaining that mpg was a kind of mesoporous material which could accommodate lots of sludge flocs and enhance the skeleton support for sludge particles michał and małgorzata 2015 3 2 redox properties of treated sludge with increasing of mpg hac dosage ph and orp of sludge rapidly varied fig 2 under conditioning ph was reduced from 7 14 to 3 92 and orp was increased from 158mv to 145mv fig 2 simultaneously mo et al 2015 have demonstrated that with acid addition which plays as a hydrolytic reagent for organics degradation organics will be hydrolyzed into several small molecules which would ionize some positive ions such as h ca2 mg2 etc or negative ions such as hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde quinone amino etc thus it was probably that hac could promote organics hydrolyzation thus increasing sludge redox properties dai et al 2018b and releasing active groups which could chelate heavy metals this opinion can be explained by orp variations generally value of orp shows the oxidizability of sludge and the more organics in sludge are degraded the higher the orp value is he et al 2015 dai et al 2018b after mpg hac conditioning orp increased gradually fig 2 which was in good agreement with the above analyses besides jin et al 2017 have reported that exchangeable fraction and weak acid soluble fraction of heavy metals could be dissolved into water phase at a lower ph and moreover higher orp would be propitious to unstable heavy metals migration 3 3 effects of mpg hac conditioning on eps in sludge 3 3 1 concentration change of sb eps lb eps and tb eps xiao et al 2016b have mentioned that multilayer structure of eps plays an important role in release of organics and heavy metals from stable colloid network with increasing of mpg hac dose lb eps concentration decreased obviously fig 3 b and total tb eps content was also gradually reduced fig 3 c it was reported that acids are toxic to cells which destroy cell structure kill them and promote release of intracellular substances such as organic polymers heavy metals microbial by products etc thus it was probably that hac could destroy tb eps wrapped around microbial cells leading to tb eps reduction however compared with raw sludge sb eps content also decreased after conditioning fig 3 a this further proved that macromolecular substances such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acids released from lb eps tb eps and cells were degraded dai et al 2018b 3 3 2 degradation of organics in sludge for raw sludge total eps content was 181 72 mg gvss and content of total protein and total polysaccharide was 143 16 and 19 51 mg gvss respectively fig 3 indicating that proteins and polysaccharide were main components in eps after conditioning with 10 ds of mpg and 400ml kgds of hac about 45 16 of organics in sludge was reduced fig 4 a which illustrating that massive active groups were ionized from organics hydrolysis besides excessive addition will weaken degradation of organics due to its poor effect on release of eps fig 4 a it was reported that compared with polysaccharide proteins could significantly chelate heavy metals and accordingly form chelating precipitates thus sequestering the unstable heavy metals and transforming them into stable fractions therefore higher ratio of protein content to polysaccharide content value pn ps in supernatant may be important to immobilize unstable heavy metals furthermore fig 4 b showed that value of pn ps in sb eps was increased indicating that the chelating ability of sb eps to unstable heavy metals was enhanced after conditioning 3 3 3 active groups in sb eps an obvious variation of active groups can be observed in fig 5 active groups corresponding to the peaks in the ft ir spectrum were shown in table 1 apparently for raw sludge strong absorption peaks at 3630 and 1110 cm 1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of o h and c o respectively which confirmed existence of alcohol hydroxyl oh consonni et al 2016 in particular stretching vibration deformation vibration and bending vibration of n h were found at 3471 1626 and 701 cm 1 fig 5 respectively and moreover absorption peak of c n was observed at 1337 cm 1 showing the presence of amidocyanogen nh similarly carboxyl cooh was detected due to the observed absorption peaks of o h and c o at 2901 and 1714 1240 cm 1 fig 5 the results indicated that protein was contained in sb eps apart from alcohol hydroxyl amidocyanogen and carboxyl aldehyde group phenolic hydroxyl and quinonyl were also detected which probably suggest existence of polysaccharide and humic acid fig 5 table 1 balaji et al 2016 simultaneously peak area and peak height of active groups were larger and higher in treated sludge which illustrated that concentration of organics in sb eps was increased after conditioning generally active groups such as alcohol hydroxyl amidocyanogen carboxyl aldehyde group phenolic hydroxyl and quinonyl could chelate unstable heavy metals and transform them into the stable fraction ure et al 1993 dwyer et al 2009 3 4 migration and speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge under conditioning 3 4 1 migration and transformation of heavy metals in filtrate and filter cake for all metals the recovery rate was around 80 110 which represented the authenticity of obtained data he et al 2017 after conditioning heavy metals content in filtrate i e supernatant was largely increased and accordingly metals concentration in filter cake was reduced fig s3 this illustrated that mpg hac conditioning for sludge could release unstable heavy metals wrapped in the sludge colloid network into supernatant it was in good agreement with analyses of eps variation however when mpg dosage was more than 10 ds content of cu pb zn and as in sludge filter cake was increased fig s3 this is probably because that active groups in supernatant could chelate unstable heavy metals to form insoluble precipitates thus those unstable heavy metals were transferred to filter cake from filtrate and finally turned into stable metals nevertheless as mentioned earlier too many mpg hac addition may hinder heavy metals release from sludge particles which will not cause reduction of metals in filter cake tables shown in fig s3 indicated the content of metals from mpg particularly mpg would bring cu pb and zn into filtrate and filter cake and the increase of metals content caused by mpg was very tiny in comparison with the metal content in raw sludge fig s3 therefore it can be assumed that content of metal from mpg was negligible 3 4 2 speciation distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake the fraction distribution of heavy metals in sludge filter cake differed greatly with each other under conditioning in raw sludge filter cake the main fraction of cd was reducible fraction which accounted for 54 95 of total cd fig 6 with increasing of agentia addition content of cd f3 and cd f4 were increased while content of cd f1 cd f2 and cd f5 decreased sharply this might indicate that with destruction of colloid network unstable heavy metals f1 and f2 were largely dissolved in supernatant leading to an increase in cd content in filtrate fig s3 a moreover with addition of hac more and more organics was degraded and then released active groups which can chelate soluble cd in filtrate to form cd f4 and transform them into filter cake thus enhancing cd f4 content in filter cake and reducing the proportion of cd f5 moreover proportion of cd f3 in filter cake was increased to 67 35 it was noted that higher orp will hinder release of reducible metals from colloid network jin et al 2017 therefore probably reduction of total cd in filter cake was caused by reduction of cd f1 and cd f2 fig 6 showed that the residual fraction was the primary fraction of cr pb and as in raw sludge filter cake which accounted for 69 99 38 33 and 33 08 respectively with increasing of mpg hac dosage content of exchangeable fraction weak acid soluble fraction and reducible fraction of cr pb and as decreased obviously while percentage of oxidizable fraction and residual fraction in filter cake increased accordingly fig 6 similarly degradation of organics promoted chelating reaction between soluble heavy metals and active groups thus improving the content of oxidizable metals in filter cake subsequently it was probably that several unstable heavy metals in supernatant can be absorbed by mpg and then be immobilized into its inner structure finally forming the residual metals and enhancing its proportion cu f5 accounted for 72 37 of total cu in raw sludge filter cake was the main fraction fig 6 with initial addition content of cu f1 cu f3 and cu f4 were increased and then decreased however cu f2 consistently decreased and cu f5 decreased firstly and then increased to 77 09 fig 6 the variation of cu f1 was abnormal compared to other metals this may be because cu f1 and cu f3 in colloid network was insensitive to little mpg hac dosage at first while at a later stage it was released into supernatant with increasing of combined addition besides it was probably that the chelating ability of active groups to soluble cu was weakened in presence of other metals thus reducing the percentage of cu f4 in filter cake for raw sludge the primary fraction of zn and ni was reducible fraction which accounted for 57 58 of total zn and 42 61 of total ni respectively fig 6 after conditioning exchangeable fraction weak acid soluble fraction and reducible fraction of them were dissolved in supernatant leading to content reduction in filter cake besides primary fraction of zn varied from reducible fraction to residual fraction accounted for 47 80 of total zn however reducible fraction was still the main ni fraction after conditioning equally percentage of stable fractions was improved due to the chelating reaction caused by organics in supernatant and adsorption of mpg to soluble metals 3 5 environmental risk evaluation currently landfill land improvement and agricultural fertilizer application are commonly used for municipal sludge disposal in order to avoid environmental pollution the environmental risk evaluation of heavy metals was probably necessary to determine the usability and toxicity of sludge in land use 3 5 1 mobility risk analysis mobility factor m f represents the mobility risk level of heavy metal the higher the value is the higher the risk level is he et al 2017 relationships between mobility factor and heavy metals fractions can be described as follows 1 m f f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 100 according to eq 1 a finding showed that m f was closely affected by exchangeable metals and weak acid soluble metals and the more f1 and f2 in sludge filer cake the higher the mobility risk of heavy metals in environment m f of heavy metals in treated sludge filter cake was shown in fig 7 excepting cu m f of all metals cd cr pb zn ni and as were reduced sharply with regard to cr and zn the risk level decreased from low risk to no risk after conditioning with increasing of combined addition risk level of ni was gradually reduced from medium risk to low risk and risk level of as was decreased from high risk to low risk respectively fig 7 besides m f value of pb and cd decreased from 8 48 to 0 82 to 3 23 and 0 44 showing that mobility risk of pb and cd was greatly weakened the results were probably because that 1 release of unstable heavy metals f1 and f2 from colloid network has increased the percentage of stable heavy metals f3 f4 and f5 in filter cake 2 in supernatant in the presence of hac several active groups produced from organics hydrolyzation could chelate unstable heavy metals to form precipitates which are organic bound heavy metals and are seen as the f4 metal and transfer them to filter cake finally immobilizing them in the form of f4 metal chen 2013 3 porous mpg may absorb those metals into the pores on mpg surface and transfer them to filter cake thus immobilizing them in the form of f3 metal which is inorganic bound heavy metals and is absorbed or co precipitated into sludge particles he et al 2015 4 in the re flocculation process of sludge flocs unstable heavy metals in supernatant were brought into the inner structure of sludge particles through floc scrolling and adsorption bridging and finally being immobilized in filter cake in the form of f5 metal residual heavy metals which is commonly found in primary and secondary silicate and other stable minerals in sludge ure et al 1993 consequently content of f3 metal f4 metal and f5 metal in filter cake was significantly increased as shown in fig 7 m f value of cd cr pb zn ni and as was obviously reduced with a lower mpg hac dosage however at the initial stage of conditioning variation of cu fraction was abnormal with increasing of agential addition m f value of cu gradually decreased and furthermore its risk level was maintained in no risk level consequently a conclusion could be made that mobility risk of heavy metals were reduced obviously under conditioning 3 5 2 potential ecological risk analysis according to jin et al 2017 the potential ecological risk index i r is used to assess the potential ecological risk level of total heavy metals in sludge furthermore ecological risk coefficient e r is used for ecological risk evaluation of single heavy metal xu et al 2008 relationships between i r and e r were as follows jin et al 2017 2 i r i 1 n e r i 3 e r i t r i c r i 4 c r i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 i where c r i is the contamination factor of single heavy metal t r i is the toxicity coefficient of individual heavy metal which here are cd 30 cr 2 cu 5 pb 5 zn 1 ni 5 and as 10 as shown in fig 8 a potential ecological risk of cr pb zn ni and as were reduced rapidly maintaining at a low level table 2 subsequently with single hac addition er value of cd decreased from 42 80 to 34 06 and its risk level was reduced from medium level to low level however combined conditioning will improve the risk level of cd fig 8 a the results indicated that single hac addition was beneficial to immobilization of cd rather than combined addition furthermore it was probably that higher dosage of mpg hac could greatly weaken potential ecological risk of cu this was in good agreement with analyses of variation of cu fraction fig 8 b showed that with combined addition ir of total metals in filter cake increased higher dosage leading to a higher risk level this might be caused by the variation of cd toxicity coefficient of which is 30 showing a higher toxicity to ecological environment than other heavy metals jin et al 2017 therefore by comparing mobility risk and potential ecological risk of heavy metals found that adding mpg hac could effectively weaken environmental risk of cr cu pb zn ni and as with regard to cd addition of mpg hac showed a higher efficiency in increasing proportion of cd f3 and cd f4 in filter cake thus mobility risk of cd was obviously mitigated while the potential ecological risk was increased 3 6 statistics analysis 3 6 1 relationships between ph orp lb eps and tb eps of sludge and heavy metals reduction as mentioned before acidity and eps have showed high efficiency in reduction of heavy metals in sludge filter cake in addition a strong positive correlation between heavy metals reduction rate rm and orp negative correlation between rm and ph lb eps content signed as clb eps and sb eps content ctb eps were observed respectively table s1 moreover multiple linear regression models which illustrated the relationships between rm and ph orp clb eps and ctb eps was established and proved to be independent table 3 in particular regression coefficient r2 for all models were 0 showing that relationships between rm and ph orp clb eps and ctb eps was completely linear not approximatively related simultaneously reduction rate of cu and zn were highly affected by those factors ph particularly compared to other heavy metals indicating that addition of hac could largely transform unstable metals into supernatant 3 6 2 correlation between heavy metals fraction and orp clb eps ctb eps and odr for all heavy metals excepting cu positive correlation between mf and clb eps ctb eps strong negative correlation between mf and orp organics degradation rate odr were found respectively table s2 correlation analysis between mf cu and those factors showed that there was no significant correlation between them table s2 the result indicated that the morphological change of cu was very complicated and was closely related with dosage of mpg and hac as noted before it took a higher dosage of more than 25 ds of mpg and more than 200ml kgds of hac to dissolve cu f1 and cu f2 from colloid network through statistical analysis found that multiple linear regression models which indicated the relationship between mf and orp clb eps and odr was established and proved to be independent table 4 particularly in doing statistical analysis ctb eps was seen as the excluded variable and thus being eliminated from model this illustrated that compared with other factors tb eps had no obvious effect on immobilization of heavy metals which was probably caused by its minimal release from colloid network besides he et al 2017 have mentioned that chelates of heavy metals produced by unstable metals and active groups can be used as the skeleton builder for sludge particles and further enhance shear resistance of sludge flocs forming in the re flocculation process thus it was probably that heavy metals chelate and mpg may lead to synergistic enhancement effects on compressibility reduction of sludge which could effectively immobilize heavy metals into sludge filter cake and weaken mobility risk of metals table 4 showed that r2 for all models were more than 95 and all estimated variables were proved to be significant p 0 05 besides a finding revealed that in comparison with other metals mf of as and ni were more sensitive to orp clb eps and odr according to those models higher orp and higher odr could transform dissolved metals into stable fraction and further promote immobilization of heavy metals into sludge filter cake and moreover the more lb eps was destroyed from colloid network the more soluble metals being chelated by active groups additionally the more unstable metals resolved into supernatant the more dissolved metals were absorbed by mpg and the more residual heavy metals were maintained in the structure of sludge particles 3 6 3 applicability of heavy metals models in different type of sludge for a better explanation on heavy metals models applicability of models in water supply sludge and industrial wastewater sludge was investigated as shown in table 5 mpg hac conditioning could obviously reduce heavy metals risk in those two sludge samples which indicated that the pretreating method for sludge samples was efficient besides heavy metals models from municipal sludge showed several errors in application of two other sludge samples in particular variation percentage error of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge was lower than 10 and that of cu ni and as was between 10 and 20 which demonstrated that mpg hac conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge especially for zn table 5 however mpg hac conditioning may not be suitable for heavy metals stabilization in industrial wastewater sludge due to a higher percentage error observed in table 5 especially for cu and zn 4 conclusions in the light of the above analyses the following conclusions were obtained 1 mpg hac conditioning significantly produce synergistic enhancement effect to the dissolution of unstable heavy metals wrapped in the stable colloidal network 2 hac might promote degradation of organics such as proteins polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant and moreover about 45 16 of organics were degraded and then dissociated large amount of active group which was responsible for immobilization of dissolved heavy metals 3 mpg with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals in supernatant and transformed them into residual fraction finally stabilizing those heavy metals 4 the linear regression models showed that lower ph and higher orp could promote reduction of heavy metals from sludge filter cake and furthermore destruction of lb eps and tb eps in colloid network might do well in heavy metals reduction simultaneously higher values of orp and organics degradation rate and disintegration of lb eps might promote immobilization of unstable metals 5 excepting cd environmental risk of cr cu pb zn ni and as can be effectively mitigated after conditioning 6 mpg hac conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of cd cr and zn in water supply sludge especially for zn declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18927,amine containing pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and other aquatic environments amine containing pharmaceuticals can be effectively removed by chlorination these drugs however may coexist in wastewater thus they may compete with each other and their chlorinated products may react with each other to form new products in this study competitive effects of the above three amine containing pharmaceuticals by chlorination and their products were investigated the priority of chlorination of these compounds was dependent upon the ph of the solution due to the dissociation of the compounds and hypochlorite it followed the order of sulfamethoxazole diclofenac acetaminophen in an acidic condition the order of sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac in a neutral condition and the order of sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac in an alkaline condition some of the chlorinated products in single and multiple compound systems were the same dimers of sulfamethoxazole and its chlorinated products however were not found but dimers of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen or diclofenac were found in multiple compound systems this finding is important because it means that new products may be produced if different amine containing pharmaceuticals react with free chlorine simultaneously

hydrolyzes in water to form hypochlorous acid hocl and hocl is a weak acid that dissociates into hypochlorite ocl in aqueous solutions chlorine hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite are all strong oxidants and these oxidants can react with organic matter especially compounds containing aromatic entities amines or double bonds deborde and von gunten 2008 a previous study showed that amine

analysis three ph values of 5 7 and 9 were respectively chosen to investigate the effects of ph on chlorination in acidic neutral and alkaline conditions different concentrations 5 10 15 and 20 mg l of hypochlorite were added to investigate the effect of the chlorine dose initial concentrations of all pharmaceuticals were 5 μm which is similar to the concentration in hospital wastewater or chosen by previous studies pinkston and sedlak 2004 dodd and huang 2004 soufan et al 2012 lin and tsai 2009 lin et al 2008 reaction times were 1 3 5 10 30 and 60 min and the reaction temperature was controlled to 22 1 c after the chlorination reaction was quenched by thiosulfate samples 50 ml were concentrated 10 fold using solid phase extraction sep with a waters oasis hlb cartridge and a nitrogen blowing device the column was first washed with methanol and water at ph 2 then a sample was injected the flow rate was controlled to 5 ml min or lower until the water sample was injected a

sodium sulfite dodd and huang 2004 bedner and maccrehan 2006a samples without quenching therefore were also detected within 30 min time for spe after reaction the reaction rate of diclofenac was completely low than the other compounds the chromatography patterns with and without quenching seem to be the same the products of diclofenac therefore were determined by unquenched samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of competition ph and the free chlorine dose fig 1 shows variations in pharmaceutical concentrations with time at different ph values smx was effectively removed by chlorination at all ph values act could not be effectively removed in an acidic condition and dic could not be effectively removed in an alkaline condition these results are the same as results of previous research bedner and maccrehan 2006a xagoraraki et al 2008 soufan et al 2012 the decreased chlorination of dic in an alkaline condition was likely due to the dissociation of hypochlorite pka 7 5 and dic pka 4 5 in an alkaline condition the electrostatic repulsion of the two negatively charged ions inhibits chlorination the higher oxidation rate of act at the higher ph was likely due to the dissociation of phenolic group of act the pka of act is 9 38 therefore about 30 act were dissociated at ph 9 0 the second order reaction rate constant of the dissociation form of act 7000 m 1s 1 is much higher than the neutral form 3 1 m 1s 1 with hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 pinkston and sedlak 2004 the chlorination rate therefore increased significantly to investigate the competitive effect we decreased the free chlorine dosage to 1 0 mg l to achieve a molar ratio between free chlorine and all pharmaceuticals of about 2 1 competitive effects should have been significant at this level fig 2 shows differences in residual concentrations of the three pharmaceuticals between the single and multiple compound systems at different ph values results revealed that the presence of smx inhibited the chlorination of dic in acidic and neutral conditions the inhibition of act was not observed because the removal of the act in single compound system was very low in an alkaline condition act and smx competed with each other for free chlorine it seems that in acidic and neutral conditions free chlorine was quickly consumed by smx and the removal rates of act and dic therefore significantly decreased in an alkaline condition both act and smx consumed the free chlorine and both of their rates decreased fig 3 demonstrates the effect of free chlorine doses on degradation of the three pharmaceutical compounds at different ph values the residual chlorine concentrations were shown in supporting data in general increasing the dose of free chlorine increased the removal of all three pharmaceuticals because of the increase of the residual chlorine smx had a high removal rate even with the smallest amount of free chlorine and the reaction was quite rapid higher free chlorine doses increased the degradation of act and dic in acidic and neutral conditions but the degradation of dic did not increase in an alkaline condition according to the above results we inferred that the priority of chlorination should be in the order of smx dic act in an acidic condition in the order of smx act dic in a neutral condition and in the order of act smx dic in an alkaline condition pinkston and sedlak 2004 soufan et al 2012 and dodd and huang 2004 reported the apparent second order reaction rate constants kapp in m 1s 1 at different ph for act dic and smx respectively as shown in table s5 the kapp are in the order of smx dic act at ph 5 in the order of smx act dic at ph 7 and in the order of smx act dic at ph 9 the sequences of the rate constants calculated from references and the priority of chlorination obtained from this study seems to be the same except at ph 9 the kapp of act 55 3 m 1s 1 at ph 9 in table s5 was calculated by the equation as follows deborde and von gunten 2008 1 k a p p α 0 a c t α 0 h c l o k h b α 1 a c t α 1 h c l o k b where α is the ionization fractions khb and kb are the second order rate constants of the non dissociated and dissociated act respectively this equation may underestimate the value of kapp because it does not consider the reaction between the non dissociated act and hypochlorite clo the results of this study and references therefore are not consistent at ph 9 3 2 chlorinated products of single compounds the chromatograms and mass spectra of chlorinated products of the three pharmaceuticals in single compound systems are provided in supporting data patterns of the chromatograms did not change with ph therefore only results at ph 7 are shown two main chlorinated products of act were found and the m z and possible structures of the products are listed in table 1 it is notable that only chloro 4 acetamidophenol and dichloro 4 acetamidophenol were found the two other main chlorinated products 1 4 benzoquinone and n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi which were found in previous studies bedner and maccrehan 2006a xagoraraki et al 2008 cao et al 2016 were not found in this study this phenomenon should have been due to different dose of free chlorine and pharmaceuticals the chloro 4 acetamidophenol was not found in unquenched sample as shown in fig 2s it reveals the dichloro 4 acetamidophenol may be reduced by thiosulfate or all the chloro 4 acetamidophenol were oxidized to dichloro 4 acetamidophenol in unquenched sample because the reaction time was much longer table 2 lists the chlorinated products of smx six main products were detected and four of them were found in previous studies dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the products with and without quenching seemed to be the same as shown in fig 5s m h z values of the products p1 s and p2 s were 303 with a chlorine isotopic peak at 305 and 288 with a chlorine isotopic peak at 290 respectively both of the intensity ratios of m 1 z and m 3 z were about 3 1 this fact reveals there is one chlorine atom in both compounds p1 s and p2 s should be p hydroxy intermediates of n chlorinated smx and n chlorinated smx respectively as shown in table 2 dodd and huang 2004 m h z values of the products p3 s and p4 s were 501 and 503 respectively these two products should be dimers of smx azo smx and azo smx with two hydrogens on nitrogen atoms which also were detected in previous studies dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the dimerization reactions are shown as follows image 2 image 3 this fact reveals that dimeric or polymeric products may be produced during chlorination of smx because of the presence of amine groups both act and dic contain amine groups these two compounds or their chlorinated products may also form dimeric or polymeric products with smx or its chlorinated products during chlorination the other two products u1 s and u2 s were not found in any previous study these two products may be unstable intermediate products because the reaction time was only 3 min due to the ionic nature of dic three ionization methods esi esi and apci were used to determine the chlorinated products and results are listed in table 3 p1 d and p2 d had four isotopic peaks and the intensity ratio of m 1 z to m 3 z was about 1 1 this fact reveals there are three chlorine atoms in these two compounds p1 d and p2 d therefore should be chloro dic and chloro decarboxy dic respectively and were reported in soufan et al s study soufan et al 2012 all other chlorinated products of dic had three isotopic peaks and the intensity ratio of m 1 z to m 3 z was about 3 2 which reveals that these compounds contained two chlorine atoms p3 d had the lowest molecular weight but had the longest retention time this fact reveals some hydrophilic functional groups may have been lost during chlorination it should be a decarboxylated derivative of dic which was also detected in soufan et al s study soufan et al 2012 the molecular weight of p4 d was 281 282 1 281 in the ms ms fragmentation spectrum of m z 282 one major fragment at m z 264 282 18 264 which could correspond to the loss of h2o was observed the chemical structure was proposed for this compound by miyamoto et al 1997 as shown in table 3 the molecular weight of p5 d was 309 310 1 309 its structure is similar to that of p4 d because it has some of the same ms ms fragmentation spectra as p4 d it should be an oxidized product of dic as proposed by miyamoto et al 1997 p6 d and p4 d had similar molecular weights 282 and 284 p6 d however was much more hydrophilic than p4 d p6 d therefore should contain more hydrophilic functional groups the aldehyde group in p4 d was likely replaced by phenol in p6 d as shown in table 3 3 3 chlorinated products of multiple compounds fig 4 demonstrates the chromatographic patterns of pharmaceuticals and their chlorinated products the mass data of all possible products are listed in table 4 it is notable that two unknown chlorination products u1 m and u2 m were observed with m z values of 400 and 569 respectively however no fragment of the two species was detected by ms ms on the contrary some fragments were detected in the ms ms fragmentation spectrum of m z 378 and 547 as shown in figs 5 and 6 these two signals 400 and 570 therefore should be m na the molecular weights of u1 m and u2 m therefore should be 377 and 547 respectively the intensity ratios of m 1 z to m 3 z of u1 m and u2 m were 3 1 and 3 2 respectively this fact reveals that u1 m and u2 m contain one and two chlorine atoms respectively the molecular weights of u1 m and u2 m were higher than the three pharmaceuticals after subtracting the mass of chlorine atoms in the molecular structure it is also notable that no chlorination products of smx were detected in the multiple pharmaceutical system some dimers of smx however were detected in the single pharmaceutical system retention times of u1 m and u2 m were 2 26 and 3 41 min respectively just between the retention times of smx 2 25 min and dic 3 50 min therefore u1 m and u2 m may be dimers of chlorination products of smx and the other two pharmaceuticals or their chlorination products a fragment of m z 253 the molecular weight of smx was detected in the ms fragmentation spectrum of u1 m thus smx should be included in the molecular structure of u1 m the molecular weight of the other part of u1 m should be 125 377 252 125 after deducting the molecular weight of chlorine 35 the molecular weight becomes 90 which is close to the molecular weight of aniline u1 m therefore may be a dehydrated dimer of smx and a chlorinated aminophenol which is an intermediate chlorination product of act bedner and maccrehan 2006a the possible reaction is proposed as follows image 4 the molecular weight of u2 m 547 is close to the sum of the molecular weights of smx 253 28 and dic 296 16 thus u2 m might be a dimer of smx and dic the possible reaction is proposed as follows image 5 as mentioned earlier the dimerization reaction occurred because of the presence of amine groups without the presence of act and dic chlorinated smx can only react with smx or itself to form dimers of smx in the presence of act and dic however chlorinated smx should react with act and dic first due to the higher concentrations of act and dic therefore dimers of smx were not found in multiple compound systems but dimers of smx and act or dic were found the dissolved organic matters doms may also compete with the trace compounds during chlorination and the concentration of doms in usual wastewater is much higher than pharmaceuticals dimerization was also observed during chlorination of phenolic compounds such as bisphenol a hu et al 2002 this may be due to the fact that both of these two kinds of compounds have electronegative functional groups these two kinds of compounds therefore may react with each other to form dimers during chlorination the main fractions of doms in wastewater are hydrophilic acids humic substances and hydrophobic neutrals imai et al 2002 michael kordatou et al 2015 humic substances contains phenolic functional groups so these substances may react with amine containing pharmaceuticals to form dimers during chlorination the findings of this study reveal new products dimers may be generated during simultaneous chlorination of amine containing pharmaceuticals more studies therefore need to be done to investigate the effect of not only doms but also dissolved organic nitrogen don on the removal of amine containing pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions 1 the priority of chlorination of the three amine containing pharmaceuticals follow sulfamethoxazole diclofenac acetaminophen at acidic condition sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac at neutral condition and sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac at alkaline condition 2 the dimerization reaction of smx occurred because of the presence of amine groups the dimers of smx however were not found but dimers of smx aminophenol and smx dic may be produced by chlorination in multiple compound systems declaration of interests the authors

18927,amine containing pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and other aquatic environments amine containing pharmaceuticals can be effectively removed by chlorination these drugs however may coexist in wastewater thus they may compete with each other and their chlorinated products may react with each other to form new products in this study competitive effects of the above three amine containing pharmaceuticals by chlorination and their products were investigated the priority of chlorination of these compounds was dependent upon the ph of the solution due to the dissociation of the compounds and hypochlorite it followed the order of sulfamethoxazole diclofenac acetaminophen in an acidic condition the order of sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac in a neutral condition and the order of sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac in an alkaline condition some of the chlorinated products in single and multiple compound systems were the same dimers of sulfamethoxazole and its chlorinated products however were not found but dimers of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen or diclofenac were found in multiple compound systems this finding is important because it means that new products may be produced if different amine containing pharmaceuticals react with free chlorine simultaneously

may be reduced by thiosulfate or all the chloro 4 acetamidophenol were oxidized to dichloro 4 acetamidophenol in unquenched sample because the reaction time was much longer table 2 lists the chlorinated products of smx six main products were detected and four of them were found in previous studies dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the products with and without quenching seemed to be the same as shown in fig 5s m h z values of the products p1 s and p2 s were 303 with a chlorine isotopic peak at 305 and 288 with a chlorine isotopic peak at 290 respectively both of the intensity ratios of m 1 z and m 3 z were about 3 1 this fact reveals there is one chlorine atom in both compounds p1 s and p2 s should be p hydroxy intermediates of n chlorinated smx and n chlorinated smx respectively as shown in table 2 dodd and huang 2004 m h z values of the products p3 s and p4 s were 501 and 503 respectively these two products should be dimers of smx azo smx and azo smx with two hydrogens on nitrogen atoms which also were detected in previous studies dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the dimerization reactions are shown as follows image 2 image 3 this fact reveals that dimeric or polymeric products may be produced during chlorination of smx because of the presence of amine groups both act and dic contain amine groups these two compounds or their chlorinated products may also form dimeric or polymeric products with smx or its chlorinated products during chlorination the other two products u1 s and u2 s were not found in any previous study these two products may be unstable intermediate products because the reaction time was only 3 min due to the ionic nature of dic three ionization methods esi esi and apci were used to determine the chlorinated products and results are listed in table 3 p1 d and p2 d had four isotopic peaks and the intensity ratio of m 1 z to m 3 z was about 1 1 this fact reveals there are three chlorine atoms in these two compounds p1 d and p2 d therefore should be chloro dic and chloro decarboxy dic respectively and were reported in soufan et al s study soufan et al 2012 all other chlorinated products of dic had three isotopic peaks and the intensity ratio of m 1 z to m 3 z was about 3 2 which reveals that these compounds contained two chlorine atoms p3 d had the lowest molecular weight but had the longest retention time this fact reveals some hydrophilic functional groups may have been lost during chlorination it should be a decarboxylated derivative of dic which was also detected in soufan et al s study soufan et al 2012 the molecular weight of p4 d was 281 282 1 281 in the ms ms fragmentation spectrum of m z 282 one major fragment at m z 264 282 18 264 which could correspond to the loss of h2o was observed the chemical structure was proposed for this compound by miyamoto et al 1997 as shown in table 3 the molecular weight of p5 d was 309 310 1 309 its structure is similar to that of p4 d because it has some of the same ms ms fragmentation spectra as p4 d it should be an oxidized product of dic as proposed by miyamoto et al 1997 p6 d and p4 d had similar molecular weights 282 and 284 p6 d however was much more hydrophilic than p4 d p6 d therefore should contain more hydrophilic functional groups the aldehyde group in p4 d was likely replaced by phenol in p6 d as shown in table 3 3 3 chlorinated products of multiple compounds fig 4 demonstrates the chromatographic patterns of pharmaceuticals and their chlorinated products the mass data of all possible products are listed in table 4 it is notable that two unknown chlorination products u1 m and u2 m were observed with m z values of 400 and 569 respectively however no fragment of the two species was detected by ms ms on the contrary some fragments were detected in the ms ms fragmentation spectrum of m z 378 and 547 as shown in figs 5 and 6 these two signals 400 and 570 therefore should be m na the molecular weights of u1 m and u2 m therefore should be 377 and 547 respectively the intensity ratios of m 1 z to m 3 z of u1 m and u2 m were 3 1 and 3 2 respectively this fact reveals that u1 m and u2 m contain one and two chlorine atoms respectively the molecular weights of u1 m and u2 m were higher than the three pharmaceuticals after subtracting the mass of chlorine atoms in the molecular structure it is also notable that no chlorination products of smx were detected in the multiple pharmaceutical system some dimers of smx however were detected in the single pharmaceutical system retention times of u1 m and u2 m were 2 26 and 3 41 min respectively just between the retention times of smx 2 25 min and dic 3 50 min therefore u1 m and u2 m may be dimers of chlorination products of smx and the other two pharmaceuticals or their chlorination products a fragment of m z 253 the molecular weight of smx was detected in the ms fragmentation spectrum of u1 m thus smx should be included in the molecular structure of u1 m the molecular weight of the other part of u1 m should be 125 377 252 125 after deducting the molecular weight of chlorine 35 the molecular weight becomes 90 which is close to the molecular weight of aniline u1 m therefore may be a dehydrated dimer of smx and a chlorinated aminophenol which is an intermediate chlorination product of act bedner and maccrehan 2006a the possible reaction is proposed as follows image 4 the molecular weight of u2 m 547 is close to the sum of the molecular weights of smx 253 28 and dic 296 16 thus u2 m might be a dimer of smx and dic the possible reaction is proposed as follows image 5 as mentioned earlier the dimerization reaction occurred because of the presence of amine groups without the presence of act and dic chlorinated smx can only react with smx or itself to form dimers of smx in the presence of act and dic however chlorinated smx should react with act and dic first due to the higher concentrations of act and dic therefore dimers of smx were not found in multiple compound systems but dimers of smx and act or dic were found the dissolved organic matters doms may also compete with the trace compounds during chlorination and the concentration of doms in usual wastewater is much higher than pharmaceuticals dimerization was also observed during chlorination of phenolic compounds such as bisphenol a hu et al 2002 this may be due to the fact that both of these two kinds of compounds have electronegative functional groups these two kinds of compounds therefore may react with each other to form dimers during chlorination the main fractions of doms in wastewater are hydrophilic acids humic substances and hydrophobic neutrals imai et al 2002 michael kordatou et al 2015 humic substances contains phenolic functional groups so these substances may react with amine containing pharmaceuticals to form dimers during chlorination the findings of this study reveal new products dimers may be generated during simultaneous chlorination of amine containing pharmaceuticals more studies therefore need to be done to investigate the effect of not only doms but also dissolved organic nitrogen don on the removal of amine containing pharmaceuticals 4 conclusions 1 the priority of chlorination of the three amine containing pharmaceuticals follow sulfamethoxazole diclofenac acetaminophen at acidic condition sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac at neutral condition and sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen diclofenac at alkaline condition 2 the dimerization reaction of smx occurred because of the presence of amine groups the dimers of smx however were not found but dimers of smx aminophenol and smx dic may be produced by chlorination in multiple compound systems declaration of interests the authors

18928,water recovery is a measure of the amount of treated water produced relative to the total amount of water processed through the system and is an important performance metric for any desalination method conventional operating methods for desalination using capacitive deionization cdi have so far limited water recovery to be about 50 to improve water recovery for cdi we here introduce a new operating scheme based on a variable in time flow rate wherein a low flow rate during discharge is used to produce a brine volume which is significantly less than the volume of diluent produced we demonstrate experimentally and study systematically this novel variable flowrate operating scheme in the framework of both constant current and constant voltage charge discharge modes we show that the variable flowrate operation can increase water recovery for cdi to very high values of 90 and can improve thermodynamic efficiency by about 2 to 3 fold compared to conventional constant flowrate operation importantly this is achieved with minimal performance reductions in salt removal energy consumption and volume throughput our work highlights that water recovery can be readily improved for cdi at very minimal additional cost using simple flow control schemes graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization high water recovery improved thermodynamic efficiency water desalination variable flowrate operation 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a burgeoning water desalination technology aimed at energy efficient treatment of brackish water anderson et al 2010 oren 2008 porada et al 2013 in cdi feedwater is flowed between and sometimes through a pair of porous electrodes and on application of an external electric current the ions in solution are electrostatically trapped onto or regenerated from the electrodes cdi operation under dynamic steady state involves cyclic electrical charging and discharging which results in periodic salt removal freshwater and regeneration brine phases respectively metrics to evaluate cdi performance include desalination depth i e concentration reduction volumetric energy consumption productivity and water recovery hawks et al 2019 cdi performance metrics can be significantly affected by the operating method operationally a cdi cell can be dynamically controlled by varying input current voltage waveforms and varying flowrate of the feed solution most of the previous research around development and assessment of operational strategies for cdi has centered around time varying current voltage waveforms under constant flowrate conditions choi 2015 garcía quismondo et al 2016 2013 jande and kim 2013 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018a zhao et al 2012 very little attention has been given to the study of the effects of time dependent flowrate operations on cdi performance recent work hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 was aimed at the study of fluid pulsation type operations wherein short periods of high flow rates relative to a nominal value were introduced during a cdi cycle to improve the cycle charge efficiency however these studies were limited to cases where the volume of diluent produced was approximately equal to the volume of brine produced to our knowledge ours is the first quantitative study of variable flow rate operation where low flowrate during discharge is used to achieve brine volumes which are significantly lower than diluent water volume further we present the first systematic study of the effect of variable flow rate schemes on performance metrics around energy and throughput constant flowrate cdi studies have thus so far been limited to a freshwater recovery of about 50 per desalination cycle that is operation such that only half of the processed feedwater is converted to freshwater further improvements in freshwater recovery for cdi can lower the amount of wastewater generated increase thermodynamic efficiency and lower overall costs of desalination hawks et al 2019 recently discussed a method of defining a variable threshold concentration during a cdi cycle to separate desalinated and brine water to increase water recovery however the improved water recovery was achieved at the expense of significantly decreased salt removal performance interestingly dlugolecki et al 2016 reported water recovery values of 85 achieved using membrane cdi mcdi however systematic details of the electrical and flow rate schemes and their coordination are not provided and there was no published analysis of performance trade offs involved in increasing water recovery in this work we first present a simple control scheme with time varying flowrates for cdi which produces significantly lower brine volumes compared to diluent water volumes the operation involves flowing at a nominal flowrate during electrical charging followed by a decrease in flowrate during the discharge phase fig 1 we studied such a scheme under both constant current and constant voltage charge discharge modes our results demonstrate an increased value for water recovery to a maximum of about 90 compared to the more common 50 typically achieved with conventional constant flowrate operation importantly we show that this high water recovery can be achieved with only negligible tradeoffs with key metrics for energy consumption salt removal and throughput for the first time we demonstrate that such high freshwater recovery values can be achieved by conventional cdi in a single pass continuous flow desalination cycle further we show that the variable flowrate operation introduced here can also increase the thermodynamic efficiency of the desalination process by a factor 2 3 fold compared to the conventional constant flow operation demonstrating a more efficient separation desalination process here the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency is primarily due to an increase in the gibbs free energy of the separation process for nearly the same energy consumption we believe that the variable flowrate operation introduced in this work can be easily implemented in all existing cdi systems resulting in improved water recovery and overall performance these results should motivate further research into optimized time varying flowrate control schemes in concert with electrical control schemes for more generalized optimization of cdi systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 cdi cell fabrication we assembled a traditional flow between cdi fbcdi cell no membranes using a radial flow architecture as described previously biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 hemmatifar et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018b briefly five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 2 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 7 g were stacked between 4 8 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors we used two 180 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers the spacers had a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than the electrodes to prevent electrical short circuits this assembly was housed inside an acrylic clamshell structure and sealed with o ring gaskets and fasteners we estimate an effective spacer volume of 2 1 ml with a porosity of 55 and a downstream header volume of 1 ml the resistance and capacitance of our entire cell were characterized using galvanostatic charging and discharging see fig 5 and s3 we estimated an effective capacitance of 37 f and an effective series resistance of 1 5 ohms for our entire assembled cell and 20 mm nacl 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted of the cdi cell a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm sodium chloride nacl solution which was circulated in a closed loop a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet and a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh the time varying current voltage and flowrate to the cell were controlled using an in house python code on a pc which interfaced with the sourcemeter and peristaltic pump conductivity measurements were converted to salt concentration using a standard calibration curve we analyzed the data under dynamic steady state operation conditions corresponding to the fifth cycle see fig s6 for an example raw dataset 2 3 performance metrics and efficiency measures we here define four performance metrics and two measures of efficiency for a cdi cell hawks et al 2019 we will use these to explore system performance and efficiency of desalination for the variable flowrate operation first the productivity p is defined as the freshwater production rate per unit cross sectional area of the electrode given by 1 p l h m 2 v d a t c y c l e where v d is the volume of dilute solution in l produced per cycle t c y c l e is the total cycle duration in h and a is the total electrode cross section area in m2 in equation 1 the desalination phase is determined by the total duration in a cycle when the effluent concentration c is less than the feed c 0 the volume of feed solution processed during the desalination phase comprises the dilute volume v d the remainder volume v b processed during the cycle when c c 0 results in concentrated brine solution at the effluent the second performance metric we use here is water recovery wr defined as the ratio of dilute water produced to the total feedwater processed per cycle given by 2 water recovery v d v d v b third to estimate the energy cost we use volumetric energy consumption e v defined as the net energy spent during a cdi cycle per unit volume of dilute fresh water produced given by 3 e v kwh m 3 t c y c l e v i d t 3 6 e 6 v d where the integration of instantaneous power supplied to the cdi cell voltage v times current i is performed for a complete charge discharge cycle and v d has units of m3 fourth we evaluate the salt removal performance as δ c d defined as the average reduction in the salt concentration in the desalinated volume compared to the feed solution which is given by 4 c d mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v d where q is the time varying flowrate likewise we also report the average increase in concentration of the waste brine water δ c b relative to the feed solution given by 5 c b mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v b note that under dynamic steady state mass conservation implies v d δ c d v b δ c b we next define two measures of efficiency of the desalination process namely the cycle averaged charge efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency the cycle charge efficiency λ is the ratio of moles of removed salt calculated using the effluent concentration data to the moles of electronic charge supplied to the electrodes during charging calculated using the electrical current data given by 6 λ f t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t t i 0 i d t where f is the faraday s constant the thermodynamic efficiency η t h is defined as the ratio of the gibbs free energy δ g s e p of the desalination separation process to the actual volumetric energy consumption calculated from experimental data using equation 3 and is given by 7 η t h g s e p e v in equation 7 we use 8 g s e p 2 r t c d ln c d 1 w r 1 c b ln c b c 0 w r ln c 0 where c d c 0 c d and c b c 0 c b are respectively the concentrations of the dilute and brine solutions r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature in k refer to biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 wang et al 2018 for more details on the derivation and discussion about thermodynamic efficiency for cdi 3 results we systematically study and quantify the effect of variable flowrate operation on the desalination performance metrics and efficiencies for conventional constant current cc and constant voltage cv electrical charge discharge modes the variable flowrate operation studied here involves electrical charging at a constant nominal flowrate followed by electrical discharge at a constant but lower value of flowrate 3 1 constant voltage electrical charging discharging with variable flowrate we performed a series of constant voltage cv charge discharge experiments with a fixed nominal flowrate value of 6 ml min during charging and varying discharge flowrate q dc values of 6 4 8 3 6 2 4 1 2 0 6 and 0 ml min for a nominal flowrate of 6 ml min we estimate a resonant time scale ramachandran et al 2018a of 260 s we here studied the variable flowrate operation under two different voltage windows of 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v with 300 s of charging and 300 s of discharging to ensure near resonant operation ramachandran et al 2018a 3 1 1 current and effluent concentration response fig 2 a and b respectively show the current and effluent concentration responses for cv operation between 0 6 and 1 0 v for a flowrate of 6 ml min during charging and flowrates of 6 2 4 and 0 6 ml min during discharging the insets in fig 2a and b shows plots of the input voltage and flowrate waveforms respectively see fig s1 for results of additional experiments for q dc values of 4 8 3 6 and 0 ml min with a voltage window of 0 6 1 0 v and for current and effluent concentration profiles for 0 2 1 0 v voltage window operation with the same values of q dc the current data of fig 2a shows that the electrical responses of the cell to significant changes in discharge flowrate are nearly identical consequently the net electrical energy consumption in joules and electrical charge transferred in coulombs per cycle are nearly equal to each other less than 5 variation across a wide range of q dc values between 0 and 6 ml min see fig s2 on the other hand fig 2b shows the profound effects of q dc on effluent concentration profiles effluent concentration during electrical discharge regeneration phase increases strongly with decreasing q dc the charging phase effluent concentration profiles show only a very weak dependence to changes in discharge phase flow rate further the peak value of discharge phase brine concentration also occurs at later times during discharge as q dc decreases lower q dc also accordingly produces significantly lesser volume of brine during the discharge phase resulting in a low volume of concentrated brine as wastewater c f inset of fig 3 a the start and end of the electrical charge and discharge phases are determined by the times that the forcing voltage switches to maximum and minimum values respectively fig 2b also shows that lowering q dc influences the relative time delays between the forcing voltages and the output response of effluent concentration note in fig 2b the two times at which the effluent concentration crosses the value of the inlet feedwater concentration denoted as a grey horizontal dotted line lower q dc values and the higher associated values of effluent brine concentration together result in time delays for both of these crossovers particularly for the crossover which occurs in discharge the time delays between switching of input voltage and concentration of effluent are due to the finite time lag between adsorption desorption dynamics inside the cell and measurement of the conductivity at a sensor just downstream of the cell note that such delays are expected in practical implementations of cdi as these will also need to segregate output brine versus output diluent streams using some downstream valve arrangement and this operation is likely to be controlled by feedback from a downstream conductivity sensor this behavior implies that the relative valving between treated and brine collection downstream should occur at later times for lower q dc lastly note that despite these time delays there is approximate overlap in the times at which effluent concentration is minimum and overlap among the effluent concentration during much of charging phase in the next subsection we will present a quantification of the volume of fresh dilute and waste brine water produced in each cycle and we also present the average concentrations calculated based on volume averaged time integrals of the product of the effluent concentration and flowrates of fig 2b 3 1 2 water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and salt removal performance metrics fig 3 shows the performance metrics based on the experimental data of fig 2 and s1 the figure shows water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction for discharge flowrate q dc values between 0 and 6 ml min and a fixed charging flowrate of 6 ml min data are shown for two constant voltage operations corresponding to voltage windows of 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v and charging and discharging phase durations of 300 s first fig 3a shows that measured freshwater recovery increases from about 50 to 90 as the discharge flowrate q dc decreases from 6 to near 0 ml min this trend is best explained by the inset of fig 3a which plots the volume of fresh dilute and waste brine water produced per cycle as q dc decreases the volume of freshwater produced per cycle stays roughly constant except very close to stop flow discharge however the volume of brine generated decreases significantly thus resulting in an increase in water recovery fraction of freshwater produced to the total processed water c f equation 2 moreover the volume of diluent and brine produced per cycle are nearly the same for both 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v cases thus we observe in fig 3a that water recovery values versus q dc are nearly identical for 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v that is the two voltage windows have negligible effect on water recovery to the best of our knowledge our work is the first systematic study to report such high values of water recovery 90 for cdi second fig 3b shows that the volumetric energy consumption e v and productivity p shown in the inset are each approximately constant for varying discharge flowrate q dc as q dc is lowered to below about 0 6 ml min i e approaching stopped flow q dc 0 productivity drops slightly by around 10 and the volumetric energy consumption increases slightly by around 5 we attribute this limiting behavior to the slight 5 decrease in the volume of dilute water produced for nearly the same net energy consumption in joules c f section 3 1 1 and inset of fig 3a at stop flow discharge conditions we hypothesize that this effect is a result of flow mixing and dispersion inefficiencies note further in fig 3b that the variation of productivity with q dc is nearly the same for 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v voltage windows however a larger voltage window here 0 2 1 v compared to 0 6 1 v results in increased e v the increase in e v for larger voltage windows can be attributed to higher current values and subsequently increased resistive energy losses see hemmatifar et al 2016 and wang and lin 2018 for an experimental study on the effect of voltage windows and resistive losses on dissipated energy third fig 3c shows the average concentration reduction increase in the dilute brine water as a function of q dc here we observe a strong dependence on voltage window as expected in either voltage window δ c d first increases sharply reaches a maximum near q dc 0 6 ml min and is thereafter roughly constant within about 10 for increasing values of q dc the inset plot shows that brine water concentration δ c b increases reaches a maximum again near 0 6 ml min but then decreases rapidly for further increases in q dc the larger voltage window here 0 2 1 v results in higher values of δ c d and δ c b which of course comes at the cost of more energy consumption c f fig 3b importantly we note that the variable flowrate operation with q dc value of 0 6 ml min corresponding to 3 ml of total feed volume or equivalently 1 mixed reactor cell volume flowed during discharging see hawks et al 2018 and ramachandran et al 2018b represents a very efficient operation c f section 3 1 3 for more details operation with q dc of 0 6 ml min shows that variable flowrate can be used to increase water recovery to high values 90 while simultaneously achieving nearly the same volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration as the conventional operation mode of constant flowrate at 6 ml min as an example compared to the constant flowrate operation for 0 2 1 0 v wherein the wastewater contains 30 ml of brine at δ c b of 5 mm variable flow operation with q dc of 0 6 ml min results in only 4 ml of brine at δ c b of 40 mm while achieving approximately the same values on the other metrics we hypothesize that the optimal value of q dc depends on the charging mode e g constant voltage or constant current as discussed in section 3 2 charging duration the nominal value of flowrate during charging and dynamic charge efficiency variations among other factors we believe that users can perform experiments similar to those presented here with variable discharge flowrates to find the optimal value of q dc which results in high water recovery with negligible trade offs among other performance metrics we do not recommend operating at stop flow during electrical discharge i e q dc 0 ml min as inefficiency due to flow mixing results in less than optimal performance hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b lastly we again highlight the aforementioned drop in δ c d rise in e v and drop in p in the region below about q dc 0 6 ml min 3 1 3 thermodynamic efficiency and cycle charge efficiency here we present a study of the effect of variable discharge flowrate q dc on thermodynamic and cycle charge efficiencies fig 4 a shows the variation of cycle charge efficiency versus q dc for the same operating conditions as fig 3 from fig 4a for fixed flowrate during charging of 6 ml min and a fixed voltage window we observe that charge efficiency is nearly constant for varying values of discharge flowrate between 0 6 and 6 ml min for q dc approaching 0 ml min stop flow discharge the charge efficiency drops significantly as with the performance metrics discussed in fig 3 and section 3 1 2 we attribute this decrease in charge efficiency near stop flow conditions q dc 0 ml min to so called flow mixing inefficiencies hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b such inefficiencies occur when an insufficient volume of feedwater is flowed to recover the desalinated or brine solution within the cell at the effluent we conclude that the variable flowrate operation introduced here maintains approximately the same charge efficiency as conventional constant flowrate operation except obviously in the region very near q dc 0 ml min also note from fig 4a that the cycle charge efficiency values for the 0 6 1 0 v cases are overall higher than for 0 2 1 0 v cases which is consistent with previous studies kim et al 2015 the improved cycle charge efficiency for 0 6 1 0 v compared to 0 2 1 0 v is primarily due to an increased electric double layer charge efficiency at higher voltages for nearly the same flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 and approximately same coulombic efficiency see fig s7 for a comparison of dynamic charge efficiency for cv operation between 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v voltage windows next fig 4b shows the thermodynamic efficiency η t h versus varying discharge flowrate q dc same conditions as in fig 3 for both 0 6 1 0 v and 0 2 1 0 v cases we observe significant improvement in η t h maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min using the variable flowrate operation when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation q dc of 6 ml min we attribute these higher values of η t h primarily to the increased water recovery 90 given approximately equal values of δ c d from equations 8 and 7 and e v lastly we also observe from fig 4b that thermodynamic efficiency is overall higher for the 0 6 1 0 v cases when compared to 0 2 1 0 v cases similar to the trend in fig 4a for charge efficiency thus at near optimal performance for cv variable flowrate operation we find an improvement in freshwater recovery to 90 from 50 for nearly the same productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction 4 5 mm removal from 20 mm feed water in the freshwater when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation furthermore the variable flowrate operation also increases the thermodynamic efficiency significantly by 2 3 fold at near optimal operation we note here that this increase in thermodynamic efficiency is primarily due to an increase in the gibbs free energy of separation process δ g s e p due to increased water recovery for nearly the same δ c d see hemmatifar et al 2018 and for nearly the same energy consumption c f fig 3b these results clearly highlight the benefits and importance of using a low but greater than zero flowrate during electrical discharge for desalination using cdi in the next section we demonstrate that variable flowrate operation can also be used to improve constant current operation 3 2 constant current electrical charging discharging with variable flowrate we here discuss results from a series of constant current cc charge discharge experiments performed at a fixed nominal flowrate value of 3 ml min during charging and varying flowrate values of 3 2 4 1 8 1 2 0 6 0 3 and 0 ml min during discharging we studied this operation for two values of charging and discharging currents of 25 and 50 ma between 0 2 and 1 0 v 3 2 1 voltage and effluent concentration response fig 5 a and b shows the voltage and effluent concentration responses respectively for constant current cc operation at 50 ma and flowrate of 3 ml min during charging and discharge flowrates of 3 1 8 and 0 6 ml min the insets in fig 5a and b shows the input current and flowrate waveforms respectively fig 5a shows that the time variation of voltage response is nearly the same for different values of flowrate during discharge q dc between 0 6 and 3 ml min the charging duration decreases only slightly 10 s or less than 2 change for values of q dc lower than 3 ml min which corresponds to the conventional constant flowrate operation since the temporal variations of current and voltage are nearly independent of discharge flowrate the net electrical energy consumption and electrical charge transferred per cycle are accordingly approximately equal across a wide range of q dc values between 0 and 3 ml min see fig s4 recall we observed a similar trend for the constant voltage operation where the electrical responses formerly current vs time were also only weakly dependent on discharge flowrate variations c f section 3 1 1 refer to fig s3 for further effluent voltage response data at q dc values of 2 4 1 2 and 0 ml min for 50 ma cc operation and for the aforementioned q dc values with 25 ma cc charging discharging next fig 5b shows that the main effect of lowering discharge flowrate on effluent concentration response versus time is to increase the concentration of brine during electrical discharge during the charging phase the effluent concentration profiles are very similar for varying q dc values between 0 6 and 3 ml min further for low but non zero values of q dc e g here 0 6 ml min the quasi steady state value of effluent concentration during charging drops to a slightly lower value than for a constant flowrate case i e q dc of 3 ml min as with the constant voltage case that the constant current data show that a reduction in q dc causes time delays in the crossover point where effluent concentration crosses feedwater concentration during both charging and discharging again the most significant delays are observed during the discharge phase in the next subsection we use the effluent concentration current and voltage profiles to explore the variation of the performance metrics due to varying discharge flowrates 3 2 2 water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and salt removal performance metrics fig 6 shows the effect of varying discharge flowrate on the performance metrics for the data of fig 5 and s3 shown are water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction for constant current cc operation for discharge flowrate values between 0 and 3 ml min and fixed charging flowrate of 3 ml min data are shown for cc charge discharge currents of 25 and 50 ma and for a voltage window of 0 2 1 v first from fig 6a we observe that as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min water recovery increases from 50 to 78 and 84 for 50 ma and 25 ma respectively as q dc is further decreased below 0 6 ml min water recovery drops to 68 these trends can be understood from the data of inset fig 6a which plots the variation of the freshwater and brine volumes generated per cycle as a function of q dc from the inset in fig 6a we note that the volume of freshwater generated per cycle v d is nearly constant as q dc is lowered from 3 ml min to 0 6 ml min the freshwater volume then drops significantly for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min on the other hand we see the volume of brine v b generated per cycle drops approximately linearly as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min lowering q dc below 0 6 ml min results in a slight increase in v b these variations each contribute to the increase in water recovery observed in the main plot of fig 6a and the dominant effect is the decrease in the brine volume for nearly the same freshwater volume produced per cdi cycle we hypothesize that the changes in trends for values of q dc lower than 0 6 ml min are due to dispersion and mixing inefficiencies as these become more important for low feed volumes compared to the effective mixed reactor volume hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b note that these general observations for the variable flowrate and cc operation are very similar to those reported above for the constant voltage cases c f section 3 1 2 we also highlight that our work is the first to report such high values of water recovery 80 85 for cdi with constant current operation comparing cc and cv operation we observe a slightly lower maximum water recovery achieved by cc operation compared to cv operation maximum water recovery of 90 under the variable flowrate scheme we hypothesize that this is due to the differences in salt removal regeneration rates between cc and cv modes second the data of fig 6b show that volumetric energy consumption e v values are nearly constant for a given cc value as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min e v increases by 30 likewise productivity p shown in the inset of fig 6b is nearly constant as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min but p decreases by 20 for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min the volume of freshwater v d produced per cycle in nearly constant for q dc 0 6 ml min but v d decreases as q dc 0 c f inset of fig 6a likely a result of mixing inefficiencies at the same time the total energy consumption in joules is insensitive to variations in q dc c f section 3 2 1 and fig s4 accordingly fig 6b shows that the volumetric energy cost is overall higher for higher currents e g here for 50 ma we attribute this to the increased resistive energy loss of higher currents accompanied by lower volume of freshwater produced due to shorter charging durations for a given voltage window and nominal flowrate productivity values on the other hand are similar for the 25 and 50 ma cases since p mainly depends on the flowrate during charging which is equal to 3 ml min for both the cc cases third fig 6c shows the average concentration reduction in the dilute water δ c d is nearly constant with a slight increase as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min and δ c d reaches a maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min for further decreases in q dc δ c d decreases by about 25 we hypothesize that the decrease in δ c d as q dc 0 ml min is due to flow mixing inefficiencies hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b the inset in fig 6c shows the corresponding increase in concentration of wastewater brine δ c b versus q dc similar to δ c d we observe from the inset that δ c b increases by 3 4 fold as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min δ c b reaches a maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min and δ c b decreases as q dc is lowered further further fig 6c shows for a given voltage window and nominal flowrate a higher current here 50 ma results in a higher δ c d and δ c b values overall hence from the performance metrics analyzed in fig 6 we note that there exists an optimal value of q dc greater than 0 but much lower than the nominal flowrate value of 3 ml min for which the productivity volumetric energy consumption and δ c d are nearly constant or better than the corresponding constant flowrate operation while water recovery is very high 80 85 compared to the conventional value of 50 operation at optimal q dc using the variable flowrate method changes primarily the nature of the wastewater produced in a cdi cycle that is variable flowrate operation results in a highly concentrated brine with very low volume but has negligible effect on freshwater quality production rate and the energetics of the process these observations for constant current variable flowrate operation are similar to those discussed earlier for constant voltage with variable flowrate c f section 3 1 2 thus highlighting the general applicability and advantages of the variable flowrate operation lastly we note that the optimal discharge flowrate for constant current corresponds to flowing 1 5 cell volumes here equal to 4 5 ml of feed solution during discharge a value which is slightly higher than 1 cell volume of feed solution required during discharge for constant voltage operation c f section 3 1 2 we hypothesize this difference is due to the relatively slower rate of initial charging and discharging in constant current mode compared to constant voltage mode 3 2 3 thermodynamic and cycle charge efficiency fig 7 a and b respectively show the cycle charge efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency for the constant current variable flowrate operation same operating conditions as in fig 6 data are shown for two values of cc charge discharge currents of 25 and 50 ma flowrate during charging of 3 ml min and discharge flowrate varying between 0 and 3 ml min from fig 7a for both 25 and 50 ma cases as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min cycle charge efficiency λ is nearly constant and then λ increases and reaches a maximum near q dc of 0 6 ml min when q dc is further lowered λ drops sharply we hypothesize that the drop in λ as q dc 0 ml min is due to flow mixing inefficiencies c f section 3 2 2 importantly we note here that at the optimal value of q dc here at 0 6 ml min the cycle charge efficiency of the variable flowrate operation is at least equal to or higher than a constant flowrate operation i e for q dc of 3 ml min from fig 7b thermodynamic efficiency η t h increases rapidly as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min reaches a maximum at the optimal value of q dc here 0 6 ml min and then decreases as q dc is lowered in a manner similar to cycle charge efficiency note that at optimal performance η t h is 8 a factor 3 fold higher than the conventional constant flowrate operation i e for q dc of 3 ml min for which η t h 2 3 this we hypothesize is mainly a result of the much higher water recovery 85 achieved by the variable flowrate operation for nearly the same or better δ c d when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation water recovery of 50 we note here that the overall observations for the efficiency measures η t h and λ for a constant current variable flowrate operation resonate well with the corresponding constant voltage counterpart c f section 3 1 3 again emphasizing the advantages of the variable flowrate operation for cdi in general 4 discussion we here use a simple experimentally validated model for cdi dynamics to analyze performance over a wide range of desalination conditions in this discussion we use constant current operation as the electrical charging discharging mode along with variable flowrate and our results can be generalized to other electrical input waveforms e g constant voltage sinusoidal voltage etc for the purpose of these discussions we model cdi as a linear rc circuit coupled with a well mixed reactor hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b 2018a zhao et al 2010 hence the volumetric energy consumption e v assuming 100 energy recovery for constant current operation can be estimated as 9 e v kwh m 3 j a 2 r s a t c y c l e v d where j is the applied constant current density in a m2 r s is the effective series resistance in ω cm2 and a is the projected area of electrodes in cm2 and appropriate unit conversions are implied note that the numerator in eq 9 is the resistive power loss integrated over a complete cdi cycle eq 9 assumes that resistive losses determine the major fraction of energy consumption in cdi and that faradic energy losses are negligible this assumption is valid when the operating current is not overly low see for example hemmatifar et al 2016 we also assume a constant effective series resistance r s which is a good approximation when the electrodes and solution in the spacer are not strongly depleted of ions hemmatifar et al 2016 next the desalination depth δ c d defined in eq 4 is given by 10 c d mm j a λ t c h f v d where t c h is the duration of electrical charging in a cdi cycle for simplicity we here assume a constant charge efficiency λ hawks et al 2018 2019 ramachandran et al 2018b and t c y c l e 2 t c h see si section 8 for a discussion regarding these assumptions briefly we assume negligible faradaic charge losses so that electrical charging and discharging durations are nearly equal further we assume that sufficient feed volume is flowed during a cdi cycle so that flow efficiency is near unity see si section 8 for a derivation and plot of flow efficiency for constant current variable flowrate operation together from eqs 9 and 10 the volumetric energy consumption and desalination depth are related by 11 e v 2 j r s f λ c d the productivity from eqs 1 9 and 10 is given by 12 p j λ 2 f 1 c d j 2 r s e v finally the thermodynamic efficiency η t h for a given desalination depth δ c d and water recovery wr can be calculated from eqs 7 and 11 in this analysis we use a series resistance r s of 30 ω cm2 current density j of 20 a m2 constant charge efficiency λ of 0 8 projected area of electrodes a of 100 cm2 and feed salt concentration of 20 mm note these are typical values of operational and system parameters of standard cdi cells in literature hawks et al 2019 fig 8 a shows the variation of gibbs free energy of separation δ g s e p biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 versus water recovery wr for concentration reductions δ c d of 5 10 and 15 mm from a 20 mm feed salt solution we observe that for each value of δ c d the gibbs free energy of separation δ g s e p increases with water recovery note the steep increase in δ g s e p for wr greater than about 50 as an example for δ c d of 10 mm δ g s e p increases from 0 007 to 0 019 kwh m3 shown by solid data points in fig 8a as wr increases from 50 e g using a constant flowrate cdi operation to 90 e g using a variable flowrate cdi operation also note that for a given value of water recovery δ g s e p increases monotonically with greater desalination depth δ c d fig 8b shows a contour plot of thermodynamic efficiency η t h versus water recovery and desalination depth solid and dashed contour lines respectively represent constant levels of thermodynamic efficiency and volumetric energy consumption in kwh m3 the second ordinate on the right of fig 8b indicates productivity p which is here a function of desalination depth δ c d c f equation 12 fig 8b shows that for a fixed δ c d the thermodynamic efficiency η t h increases significantly with increasing water recovery this is best explained by observing that for a given δ c d e v is nearly constant for varying values of water recovery this trend remains up to the limit of flow mixing inefficiencies incurred at low q dc c f sections 3 1 and 3 2 on the other hand δ g s e p increases significantly as water recovery increases beyond about 50 c f fig 8a the variable flowrate operation thus increases δ g s e p at nearly constant energy consumption and the result is improved energy efficiency of cdi further note that the volumetric energy cost e v increases linearly with δ c d see eq 11 while productivity scales inversely with δ c d see eq 12 these observations show that energy efficiency for cdi can be significantly improved e g from 10 to 50 by achieving high desalination depth and water recovery we note these results agree well with the trends observed by hemmatifar et al 2018 for the dependence of thermodynamic efficiency on desalination depth to our knowledge fig 8 is the first experimentally validated model showing tradeoffs among thermodynamic efficiency water recovery desalination depth volumetric energy consumption and productivity for cdi qin et al 2019 present a plot relating thermodynamic efficiency to desalination depth and water recovery but this plot is based purely on a new type of circuit model they propose for cdi performance as discussed in si section 9 the latter model likely assumes incorrect values for resistance and predicts unphysical trends in thermodynamic efficiency versus salt removal we caution the readers that to achieve high water recovery ratio overly low flowrates during discharge i e when operated at less than optimal flowrate can result in mixing losses and poor performance due to inefficient recovery of fresh or concentrated water at the effluent from within the cell we note that the trends for cdi performance presented in fig 8b do not account for flow inefficiency effects an operation in which the flow efficiency is overly low due to less feed volume flowed during the cdi cycle c f si section 8 can result in increased volumetric energy consumption and lower productivity as a trade off for improved water recovery see hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b to avoid such sub optimal operating conditions we recommend the following procedure to find near optimal values of discharge flowrate for high water recovery operation irrespective of the electrical charging method first the nominal flowrate during electrical charging can be determined by the desired productivity and average concentration reduction assuming a conventional constant flowrate operation next the flowrate during discharge can be decreased as demonstrated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to find the optimal condition this optimal condition is characterized by an operating point wherein water recovery is optimized while achieving volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration reductions approximately equal to those of the typical 50 water recovery case we hypothesize that the optimal value of discharge flowrate depends on the charging modes effective mixed reactor volume dispersion in the header nominal flowrate during charging discharge to charge flowrate ratio among many other factors and thus needs to be determined individually for each baseline operating condition finally we note that the volumes of dilute and brine solutions produced per cdi cycle do not simply scale with the amount of feed volume processed during electrical charging and discharging respectively at low flowrates we believe that the deviation from this scaling is due to the coupled physics of mixed reactor salt removal fluid flow and circuit electrical dynamics for cdi hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018a together with the effects of dispersion and mixing at low flowrates 5 conclusions we performed an experimental study of a variable flowrate operation for cdi which involves flowing at a nominal flow rate during electrical charging and a lower flowrate during electrical discharging we applied this operating method to both constant current and constant voltage electrical charge discharge schemes we systematically studied the effect of variable flowrate operation on the performance and efficiency of our custom built cdi cell for the first time we systematically show that freshwater recovery for conventional cdi can be increased to as high as 85 90 in a single pass desalination cycle under realistic salt removal conditions in addition to high water recovery we demonstrated nearly the same performance in volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration reduction in the freshwater using the variable flowrate operation at near optimal performance when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation moreover the thermodynamic efficiency of the desalination process was shown to increase by 2 3 fold using the variable flowrate method compared to constant flow operation under similar conditions this was achieved primarily by increasing the gibbs free energy of separation by improving water recovery for nearly the same salt removal and energy consumption we believe that the variable flowrate scheme introduced in this work can be easily implemented in a wide range of existing cdi systems for improved

18928,water recovery is a measure of the amount of treated water produced relative to the total amount of water processed through the system and is an important performance metric for any desalination method conventional operating methods for desalination using capacitive deionization cdi have so far limited water recovery to be about 50 to improve water recovery for cdi we here introduce a new operating scheme based on a variable in time flow rate wherein a low flow rate during discharge is used to produce a brine volume which is significantly less than the volume of diluent produced we demonstrate experimentally and study systematically this novel variable flowrate operating scheme in the framework of both constant current and constant voltage charge discharge modes we show that the variable flowrate operation can increase water recovery for cdi to very high values of 90 and can improve thermodynamic efficiency by about 2 to 3 fold compared to conventional constant flowrate operation importantly this is achieved with minimal performance reductions in salt removal energy consumption and volume throughput our work highlights that water recovery can be readily improved for cdi at very minimal additional cost using simple flow control schemes graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization high water recovery improved thermodynamic efficiency water desalination variable flowrate operation 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a burgeoning water desalination technology aimed at energy efficient treatment of brackish water anderson et al 2010 oren 2008 porada et al 2013 in cdi feedwater is flowed between and sometimes through a pair of porous electrodes and on application of an external electric current the ions in solution are electrostatically trapped onto or regenerated from the electrodes cdi operation under dynamic steady state involves cyclic electrical charging and discharging which results in periodic salt removal freshwater and regeneration brine phases respectively metrics to evaluate cdi performance include desalination depth i e concentration reduction volumetric energy consumption productivity and water recovery hawks et al 2019 cdi performance metrics can be significantly affected by the operating method operationally a cdi cell can be dynamically controlled by varying input current voltage waveforms and varying flowrate of the feed solution most of the previous research around development and assessment of operational strategies for cdi has centered around time varying current voltage waveforms under constant flowrate conditions choi 2015 garcía quismondo et al 2016 2013 jande and kim 2013 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018a zhao et al 2012 very little attention has been given to the study of the effects of time dependent flowrate operations on cdi performance recent work hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 was aimed at the study of fluid pulsation type operations wherein short periods of high flow rates relative to a nominal value were introduced during a cdi cycle to improve the cycle charge efficiency however these studies were limited to cases where the volume of diluent produced was approximately equal to the volume of brine produced to our knowledge ours is the first quantitative study of variable flow rate operation where low flowrate during discharge is used to achieve brine volumes which are significantly lower than diluent water volume further we present the first systematic study of the effect of variable flow rate schemes on performance metrics around energy and throughput constant flowrate cdi studies have thus so far been limited to a freshwater recovery of about 50 per desalination cycle that is operation such that only half of the processed feedwater is converted to freshwater further improvements in freshwater recovery for cdi can lower the amount of wastewater generated increase thermodynamic efficiency and lower overall costs of desalination hawks et al 2019 recently discussed a method of defining a variable threshold concentration during a cdi cycle to separate desalinated and brine water to increase water recovery however the improved water recovery was achieved at the expense of significantly decreased salt removal performance interestingly dlugolecki et al 2016 reported water recovery values of 85 achieved using membrane cdi mcdi however systematic details of the electrical and flow rate schemes and their coordination are not provided and there was no published analysis of performance trade offs involved in increasing water recovery in this work we first present a simple control scheme with time varying flowrates for cdi which produces significantly lower brine volumes compared to diluent water volumes the operation involves flowing at a nominal flowrate during electrical charging followed by a decrease in flowrate during the discharge phase fig 1 we studied such a scheme under both constant current and constant voltage charge discharge modes our results demonstrate an increased value for water recovery to a maximum of about 90 compared to the more common 50 typically achieved with conventional constant flowrate operation importantly we show that this high water recovery can be achieved with only negligible tradeoffs with key metrics for energy consumption salt removal and throughput for the first time we demonstrate that such high freshwater recovery values can be achieved by conventional cdi in a single pass continuous flow desalination cycle further we show that the variable flowrate operation introduced here can also increase the thermodynamic efficiency of the desalination process by a factor 2 3 fold compared to the conventional constant flow operation demonstrating a more efficient separation desalination process here the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency is primarily due to an increase in the gibbs free energy of the separation process for nearly the same energy consumption we believe that the variable flowrate operation introduced in this work can be easily implemented in all existing cdi systems resulting in improved water recovery and overall performance these results should motivate further research into optimized time varying flowrate control schemes in concert with electrical control schemes for more generalized optimization of cdi systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 cdi cell fabrication we assembled a traditional flow between cdi fbcdi cell no membranes using a radial flow architecture as described previously biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 hemmatifar et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018b briefly five pairs of activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmm 203 irvine ca with 5 2 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and total dry mass of 2 7 g were stacked between 4 8 cm diameter 130 μm thick titanium sheets which acted as current collectors we used two 180 μm thick non conductive polypropylene circular meshes mcmaster carr los angeles ca between each electrode pair as spacers the spacers had a slightly larger 5 mm diameter than the electrodes to prevent electrical short circuits this assembly was housed inside an acrylic clamshell structure and sealed with o ring gaskets and fasteners we estimate an effective spacer volume of 2 1 ml with a porosity of 55 and a downstream header volume of 1 ml the resistance and capacitance of our entire cell were characterized using galvanostatic charging and discharging see fig 5 and s3 we estimated an effective capacitance of 37 f and an effective series resistance of 1 5 ohms for our entire assembled cell and 20 mm nacl 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted of the cdi cell a 3 l reservoir filled with 20 mm sodium chloride nacl solution which was circulated in a closed loop a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk a flow through conductivity sensor edaq denistone east australia close to the cell outlet and a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh the time varying current voltage and flowrate to the cell were controlled using an in house python code on a pc which interfaced with the sourcemeter and peristaltic pump conductivity measurements were converted to salt concentration using a standard calibration curve we analyzed the data under dynamic steady state operation conditions corresponding to the fifth cycle see fig s6 for an example raw dataset 2 3 performance metrics and efficiency measures we here define four performance metrics and two measures of efficiency for a cdi cell hawks et al 2019 we will use these to explore system performance and efficiency of desalination for the variable flowrate operation first the productivity p is defined as the freshwater production rate per unit cross sectional area of the electrode given by 1 p l h m 2 v d a t c y c l e where v d is the volume of dilute solution in l produced per cycle t c y c l e is the total cycle duration in h and a is the total electrode cross section area in m2 in equation 1 the desalination phase is determined by the total duration in a cycle when the effluent concentration c is less than the feed c 0 the volume of feed solution processed during the desalination phase comprises the dilute volume v d the remainder volume v b processed during the cycle when c c 0 results in concentrated brine solution at the effluent the second performance metric we use here is water recovery wr defined as the ratio of dilute water produced to the total feedwater processed per cycle given by 2 water recovery v d v d v b third to estimate the energy cost we use volumetric energy consumption e v defined as the net energy spent during a cdi cycle per unit volume of dilute fresh water produced given by 3 e v kwh m 3 t c y c l e v i d t 3 6 e 6 v d where the integration of instantaneous power supplied to the cdi cell voltage v times current i is performed for a complete charge discharge cycle and v d has units of m3 fourth we evaluate the salt removal performance as δ c d defined as the average reduction in the salt concentration in the desalinated volume compared to the feed solution which is given by 4 c d mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v d where q is the time varying flowrate likewise we also report the average increase in concentration of the waste brine water δ c b relative to the feed solution given by 5 c b mm t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t v b note that under dynamic steady state mass conservation implies v d δ c d v b δ c b we next define two measures of efficiency of the desalination process namely the cycle averaged charge efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency the cycle charge efficiency λ is the ratio of moles of removed salt calculated using the effluent concentration data to the moles of electronic charge supplied to the electrodes during charging calculated using the electrical current data given by 6 λ f t c 0 c 0 q c 0 c d t t i 0 i d t where f is the faraday s constant the thermodynamic efficiency η t h is defined as the ratio of the gibbs free energy δ g s e p of the desalination separation process to the actual volumetric energy consumption calculated from experimental data using equation 3 and is given by 7 η t h g s e p e v in equation 7 we use 8 g s e p 2 r t c d ln c d 1 w r 1 c b ln c b c 0 w r ln c 0 where c d c 0 c d and c b c 0 c b are respectively the concentrations of the dilute and brine solutions r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature in k refer to biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 wang et al 2018 for more details on the derivation and discussion about thermodynamic efficiency for cdi 3 results we systematically study and quantify the effect of variable flowrate operation on the desalination performance metrics and efficiencies for conventional constant current cc and constant voltage cv electrical charge discharge modes the variable flowrate operation studied here involves electrical charging at a constant nominal flowrate followed by electrical discharge at a constant but lower value of flowrate 3 1 constant voltage electrical charging discharging with variable flowrate we performed a series of constant voltage cv charge discharge experiments with a fixed nominal flowrate value of 6 ml min during charging and varying discharge flowrate q dc values of 6 4 8 3 6 2 4 1 2 0 6 and 0 ml min for a nominal flowrate of 6 ml min we estimate a resonant time scale ramachandran et al 2018a of 260 s we here studied the variable flowrate operation under two different voltage windows of 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v with 300 s of charging and 300 s of discharging to ensure near resonant operation ramachandran et al 2018a 3 1 1 current and effluent concentration response fig 2 a and b respectively show the current and effluent concentration responses for cv operation between 0 6 and 1 0 v for a flowrate of 6 ml min during charging and flowrates of 6 2 4 and 0 6 ml min during discharging the insets in fig 2a and b shows plots of the input voltage and flowrate waveforms respectively see fig s1 for results of additional experiments for q dc values of 4 8 3 6 and 0 ml min with a voltage window of 0 6 1 0 v and for current and effluent concentration profiles for 0 2 1 0 v voltage window operation with the same values of q dc the current data of fig 2a shows that the electrical responses of the cell to significant changes in discharge flowrate are nearly identical consequently the net electrical energy consumption in joules and electrical charge transferred in coulombs per cycle are nearly equal to each other less than 5 variation across a wide range of q dc values between 0 and 6 ml min see fig s2 on the other hand fig 2b shows the profound effects of q dc on effluent concentration profiles effluent concentration during electrical discharge regeneration phase increases strongly with decreasing q dc the charging phase effluent concentration profiles show only a very weak dependence to changes in discharge phase flow rate further the peak value of discharge phase brine concentration also occurs at later times during discharge as q dc decreases lower q dc also accordingly produces significantly lesser volume of brine during the discharge phase resulting in a low volume of concentrated brine as wastewater c f inset of fig 3 a the start and end of the electrical charge and discharge phases are determined by the times that the forcing voltage switches to maximum and minimum values respectively fig 2b also shows that lowering q dc influences the relative time delays between the forcing voltages and the output response of effluent concentration note in fig 2b the two times at which the effluent concentration crosses the value of the inlet feedwater concentration denoted as a grey horizontal dotted line lower q dc values and the higher associated values of effluent brine concentration together result in time delays for both of these crossovers particularly for the crossover which occurs in discharge the time delays between switching of input voltage and concentration of effluent are due to the finite time lag between adsorption desorption dynamics inside the cell and measurement of the conductivity at a sensor just downstream of the cell note that such delays are expected in practical implementations of cdi as these will also need to segregate output brine versus output diluent streams using some downstream valve arrangement and this operation is likely to be controlled by feedback from a downstream conductivity sensor this behavior implies that the relative valving between treated and brine collection downstream should occur at later times for lower q dc lastly note that despite these time delays there is approximate overlap in the times at which effluent concentration is minimum and overlap among the effluent concentration during much of charging phase in the next subsection we will present a quantification of the volume of fresh dilute and waste brine water produced in each cycle and we also present the average concentrations calculated based on volume averaged time integrals of the product of the effluent concentration and flowrates of fig 2b 3 1 2 water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and salt removal performance metrics fig 3 shows the performance metrics based on the experimental data of fig 2 and s1 the figure shows water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction for discharge flowrate q dc values between 0 and 6 ml min and a fixed charging flowrate of 6 ml min data are shown for two constant voltage operations corresponding to voltage windows of 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v and charging and discharging phase durations of 300 s first fig 3a shows that measured freshwater recovery increases from about 50 to 90 as the discharge flowrate q dc decreases from 6 to near 0 ml min this trend is best explained by the inset of fig 3a which plots the volume of fresh dilute and waste brine water produced per cycle as q dc decreases the volume of freshwater produced per cycle stays roughly constant except very close to stop flow discharge however the volume of brine generated decreases significantly thus resulting in an increase in water recovery fraction of freshwater produced to the total processed water c f equation 2 moreover the volume of diluent and brine produced per cycle are nearly the same for both 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v cases thus we observe in fig 3a that water recovery values versus q dc are nearly identical for 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v that is the two voltage windows have negligible effect on water recovery to the best of our knowledge our work is the first systematic study to report such high values of water recovery 90 for cdi second fig 3b shows that the volumetric energy consumption e v and productivity p shown in the inset are each approximately constant for varying discharge flowrate q dc as q dc is lowered to below about 0 6 ml min i e approaching stopped flow q dc 0 productivity drops slightly by around 10 and the volumetric energy consumption increases slightly by around 5 we attribute this limiting behavior to the slight 5 decrease in the volume of dilute water produced for nearly the same net energy consumption in joules c f section 3 1 1 and inset of fig 3a at stop flow discharge conditions we hypothesize that this effect is a result of flow mixing and dispersion inefficiencies note further in fig 3b that the variation of productivity with q dc is nearly the same for 0 2 1 v and 0 6 1 v voltage windows however a larger voltage window here 0 2 1 v compared to 0 6 1 v results in increased e v the increase in e v for larger voltage windows can be attributed to higher current values and subsequently increased resistive energy losses see hemmatifar et al 2016 and wang and lin 2018 for an experimental study on the effect of voltage windows and resistive losses on dissipated energy third fig 3c shows the average concentration reduction increase in the dilute brine water as a function of q dc here we observe a strong dependence on voltage window as expected in either voltage window δ c d first increases sharply reaches a maximum near q dc 0 6 ml min and is thereafter roughly constant within about 10 for increasing values of q dc the inset plot shows that brine water concentration δ c b increases reaches a maximum again near 0 6 ml min but then decreases rapidly for further increases in q dc the larger voltage window here 0 2 1 v results in higher values of δ c d and δ c b which of course comes at the cost of more energy consumption c f fig 3b importantly we note that the variable flowrate operation with q dc value of 0 6 ml min corresponding to 3 ml of total feed volume or equivalently 1 mixed reactor cell volume flowed during discharging see hawks et al 2018 and ramachandran et al 2018b represents a very efficient operation c f section 3 1 3 for more details operation with q dc of 0 6 ml min shows that variable flowrate can be used to increase water recovery to high values 90 while simultaneously achieving nearly the same volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration as the conventional operation mode of constant flowrate at 6 ml min as an example compared to the constant flowrate operation for 0 2 1 0 v wherein the wastewater contains 30 ml of brine at δ c b of 5 mm variable flow operation with q dc of 0 6 ml min results in only 4 ml of brine at δ c b of 40 mm while achieving approximately the same values on the other metrics we hypothesize that the optimal value of q dc depends on the charging mode e g constant voltage or constant current as discussed in section 3 2 charging duration the nominal value of flowrate during charging and dynamic charge efficiency variations among other factors we believe that users can perform experiments similar to those presented here with variable discharge flowrates to find the optimal value of q dc which results in high water recovery with negligible trade offs among other performance metrics we do not recommend operating at stop flow during electrical discharge i e q dc 0 ml min as inefficiency due to flow mixing results in less than optimal performance hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b lastly we again highlight the aforementioned drop in δ c d rise in e v and drop in p in the region below about q dc 0 6 ml min 3 1 3 thermodynamic efficiency and cycle charge efficiency here we present a study of the effect of variable discharge flowrate q dc on thermodynamic and cycle charge efficiencies fig 4 a shows the variation of cycle charge efficiency versus q dc for the same operating conditions as fig 3 from fig 4a for fixed flowrate during charging of 6 ml min and a fixed voltage window we observe that charge efficiency is nearly constant for varying values of discharge flowrate between 0 6 and 6 ml min for q dc approaching 0 ml min stop flow discharge the charge efficiency drops significantly as with the performance metrics discussed in fig 3 and section 3 1 2 we attribute this decrease in charge efficiency near stop flow conditions q dc 0 ml min to so called flow mixing inefficiencies hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b such inefficiencies occur when an insufficient volume of feedwater is flowed to recover the desalinated or brine solution within the cell at the effluent we conclude that the variable flowrate operation introduced here maintains approximately the same charge efficiency as conventional constant flowrate operation except obviously in the region very near q dc 0 ml min also note from fig 4a that the cycle charge efficiency values for the 0 6 1 0 v cases are overall higher than for 0 2 1 0 v cases which is consistent with previous studies kim et al 2015 the improved cycle charge efficiency for 0 6 1 0 v compared to 0 2 1 0 v is primarily due to an increased electric double layer charge efficiency at higher voltages for nearly the same flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 and approximately same coulombic efficiency see fig s7 for a comparison of dynamic charge efficiency for cv operation between 0 2 1 0 v and 0 6 1 0 v voltage windows next fig 4b shows the thermodynamic efficiency η t h versus varying discharge flowrate q dc same conditions as in fig 3 for both 0 6 1 0 v and 0 2 1 0 v cases we observe significant improvement in η t h maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min using the variable flowrate operation when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation q dc of 6 ml min we attribute these higher values of η t h primarily to the increased water recovery 90 given approximately equal values of δ c d from equations 8 and 7 and e v lastly we also observe from fig 4b that thermodynamic efficiency is overall higher for the 0 6 1 0 v cases when compared to 0 2 1 0 v cases similar to the trend in fig 4a for charge efficiency thus at near optimal performance for cv variable flowrate operation we find an improvement in freshwater recovery to 90 from 50 for nearly the same productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction 4 5 mm removal from 20 mm feed water in the freshwater when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation furthermore the variable flowrate operation also increases the thermodynamic efficiency significantly by 2 3 fold at near optimal operation we note here that this increase in thermodynamic efficiency is primarily due to an increase in the gibbs free energy of separation process δ g s e p due to increased water recovery for nearly the same δ c d see hemmatifar et al 2018 and for nearly the same energy consumption c f fig 3b these results clearly highlight the benefits and importance of using a low but greater than zero flowrate during electrical discharge for desalination using cdi in the next section we demonstrate that variable flowrate operation can also be used to improve constant current operation 3 2 constant current electrical charging discharging with variable flowrate we here discuss results from a series of constant current cc charge discharge experiments performed at a fixed nominal flowrate value of 3 ml min during charging and varying flowrate values of 3 2 4 1 8 1 2 0 6 0 3 and 0 ml min during discharging we studied this operation for two values of charging and discharging currents of 25 and 50 ma between 0 2 and 1 0 v 3 2 1 voltage and effluent concentration response fig 5 a and b shows the voltage and effluent concentration responses respectively for constant current cc operation at 50 ma and flowrate of 3 ml min during charging and discharge flowrates of 3 1 8 and 0 6 ml min the insets in fig 5a and b shows the input current and flowrate waveforms respectively fig 5a shows that the time variation of voltage response is nearly the same for different values of flowrate during discharge q dc between 0 6 and 3 ml min the charging duration decreases only slightly 10 s or less than 2 change for values of q dc lower than 3 ml min which corresponds to the conventional constant flowrate operation since the temporal variations of current and voltage are nearly independent of discharge flowrate the net electrical energy consumption and electrical charge transferred per cycle are accordingly approximately equal across a wide range of q dc values between 0 and 3 ml min see fig s4 recall we observed a similar trend for the constant voltage operation where the electrical responses formerly current vs time were also only weakly dependent on discharge flowrate variations c f section 3 1 1 refer to fig s3 for further effluent voltage response data at q dc values of 2 4 1 2 and 0 ml min for 50 ma cc operation and for the aforementioned q dc values with 25 ma cc charging discharging next fig 5b shows that the main effect of lowering discharge flowrate on effluent concentration response versus time is to increase the concentration of brine during electrical discharge during the charging phase the effluent concentration profiles are very similar for varying q dc values between 0 6 and 3 ml min further for low but non zero values of q dc e g here 0 6 ml min the quasi steady state value of effluent concentration during charging drops to a slightly lower value than for a constant flowrate case i e q dc of 3 ml min as with the constant voltage case that the constant current data show that a reduction in q dc causes time delays in the crossover point where effluent concentration crosses feedwater concentration during both charging and discharging again the most significant delays are observed during the discharge phase in the next subsection we use the effluent concentration current and voltage profiles to explore the variation of the performance metrics due to varying discharge flowrates 3 2 2 water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and salt removal performance metrics fig 6 shows the effect of varying discharge flowrate on the performance metrics for the data of fig 5 and s3 shown are water recovery productivity volumetric energy consumption and average concentration reduction for constant current cc operation for discharge flowrate values between 0 and 3 ml min and fixed charging flowrate of 3 ml min data are shown for cc charge discharge currents of 25 and 50 ma and for a voltage window of 0 2 1 v first from fig 6a we observe that as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min water recovery increases from 50 to 78 and 84 for 50 ma and 25 ma respectively as q dc is further decreased below 0 6 ml min water recovery drops to 68 these trends can be understood from the data of inset fig 6a which plots the variation of the freshwater and brine volumes generated per cycle as a function of q dc from the inset in fig 6a we note that the volume of freshwater generated per cycle v d is nearly constant as q dc is lowered from 3 ml min to 0 6 ml min the freshwater volume then drops significantly for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min on the other hand we see the volume of brine v b generated per cycle drops approximately linearly as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min lowering q dc below 0 6 ml min results in a slight increase in v b these variations each contribute to the increase in water recovery observed in the main plot of fig 6a and the dominant effect is the decrease in the brine volume for nearly the same freshwater volume produced per cdi cycle we hypothesize that the changes in trends for values of q dc lower than 0 6 ml min are due to dispersion and mixing inefficiencies as these become more important for low feed volumes compared to the effective mixed reactor volume hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b note that these general observations for the variable flowrate and cc operation are very similar to those reported above for the constant voltage cases c f section 3 1 2 we also highlight that our work is the first to report such high values of water recovery 80 85 for cdi with constant current operation comparing cc and cv operation we observe a slightly lower maximum water recovery achieved by cc operation compared to cv operation maximum water recovery of 90 under the variable flowrate scheme we hypothesize that this is due to the differences in salt removal regeneration rates between cc and cv modes second the data of fig 6b show that volumetric energy consumption e v values are nearly constant for a given cc value as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min e v increases by 30 likewise productivity p shown in the inset of fig 6b is nearly constant as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min but p decreases by 20 for q dc lower than 0 6 ml min the volume of freshwater v d produced per cycle in nearly constant for q dc 0 6 ml min but v d decreases as q dc 0 c f inset of fig 6a likely a result of mixing inefficiencies at the same time the total energy consumption in joules is insensitive to variations in q dc c f section 3 2 1 and fig s4 accordingly fig 6b shows that the volumetric energy cost is overall higher for higher currents e g here for 50 ma we attribute this to the increased resistive energy loss of higher currents accompanied by lower volume of freshwater produced due to shorter charging durations for a given voltage window and nominal flowrate productivity values on the other hand are similar for the 25 and 50 ma cases since p mainly depends on the flowrate during charging which is equal to 3 ml min for both the cc cases third fig 6c shows the average concentration reduction in the dilute water δ c d is nearly constant with a slight increase as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min and δ c d reaches a maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min for further decreases in q dc δ c d decreases by about 25 we hypothesize that the decrease in δ c d as q dc 0 ml min is due to flow mixing inefficiencies hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b the inset in fig 6c shows the corresponding increase in concentration of wastewater brine δ c b versus q dc similar to δ c d we observe from the inset that δ c b increases by 3 4 fold as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min δ c b reaches a maximum at q dc of 0 6 ml min and δ c b decreases as q dc is lowered further further fig 6c shows for a given voltage window and nominal flowrate a higher current here 50 ma results in a higher δ c d and δ c b values overall hence from the performance metrics analyzed in fig 6 we note that there exists an optimal value of q dc greater than 0 but much lower than the nominal flowrate value of 3 ml min for which the productivity volumetric energy consumption and δ c d are nearly constant or better than the corresponding constant flowrate operation while water recovery is very high 80 85 compared to the conventional value of 50 operation at optimal q dc using the variable flowrate method changes primarily the nature of the wastewater produced in a cdi cycle that is variable flowrate operation results in a highly concentrated brine with very low volume but has negligible effect on freshwater quality production rate and the energetics of the process these observations for constant current variable flowrate operation are similar to those discussed earlier for constant voltage with variable flowrate c f section 3 1 2 thus highlighting the general applicability and advantages of the variable flowrate operation lastly we note that the optimal discharge flowrate for constant current corresponds to flowing 1 5 cell volumes here equal to 4 5 ml of feed solution during discharge a value which is slightly higher than 1 cell volume of feed solution required during discharge for constant voltage operation c f section 3 1 2 we hypothesize this difference is due to the relatively slower rate of initial charging and discharging in constant current mode compared to constant voltage mode 3 2 3 thermodynamic and cycle charge efficiency fig 7 a and b respectively show the cycle charge efficiency and thermodynamic efficiency for the constant current variable flowrate operation same operating conditions as in fig 6 data are shown for two values of cc charge discharge currents of 25 and 50 ma flowrate during charging of 3 ml min and discharge flowrate varying between 0 and 3 ml min from fig 7a for both 25 and 50 ma cases as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min cycle charge efficiency λ is nearly constant and then λ increases and reaches a maximum near q dc of 0 6 ml min when q dc is further lowered λ drops sharply we hypothesize that the drop in λ as q dc 0 ml min is due to flow mixing inefficiencies c f section 3 2 2 importantly we note here that at the optimal value of q dc here at 0 6 ml min the cycle charge efficiency of the variable flowrate operation is at least equal to or higher than a constant flowrate operation i e for q dc of 3 ml min from fig 7b thermodynamic efficiency η t h increases rapidly as q dc is lowered from 3 to 0 6 ml min reaches a maximum at the optimal value of q dc here 0 6 ml min and then decreases as q dc is lowered in a manner similar to cycle charge efficiency note that at optimal performance η t h is 8 a factor 3 fold higher than the conventional constant flowrate operation i e for q dc of 3 ml min for which η t h 2 3 this we hypothesize is mainly a result of the much higher water recovery 85 achieved by the variable flowrate operation for nearly the same or better δ c d when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation water recovery of 50 we note here that the overall observations for the efficiency measures η t h and λ for a constant current variable flowrate operation resonate well with the corresponding constant voltage counterpart c f section 3 1 3 again emphasizing the advantages of the variable flowrate operation for cdi in general 4 discussion we here use a simple experimentally validated model for cdi dynamics to analyze performance over a wide range of desalination conditions in this discussion we use constant current operation as the electrical charging discharging mode along with variable flowrate and our results can be generalized to other electrical input waveforms e g constant voltage sinusoidal voltage etc for the purpose of these discussions we model cdi as a linear rc circuit coupled with a well mixed reactor hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b 2018a zhao et al 2010 hence the volumetric energy consumption e v assuming 100 energy recovery for constant current operation can be estimated as 9 e v kwh m 3 j a 2 r s a t c y c l e v d where j is the applied constant current density in a m2 r s is the effective series resistance in ω cm2 and a is the projected area of electrodes in cm2 and appropriate unit conversions are implied note that the numerator in eq 9 is the resistive power loss integrated over a complete cdi cycle eq 9 assumes that resistive losses determine the major fraction of energy consumption in cdi and that faradic energy losses are negligible this assumption is valid when the operating current is not overly low see for example hemmatifar et al 2016 we also assume a constant effective series resistance r s which is a good approximation when the electrodes and solution in the spacer are not strongly depleted of ions hemmatifar et al 2016 next the desalination depth δ c d defined in eq 4 is given by 10 c d mm j a λ t c h f v d where t c h is the duration of electrical charging in a cdi cycle for simplicity we here assume a constant charge efficiency λ hawks et al 2018 2019 ramachandran et al 2018b and t c y c l e 2 t c h see si section 8 for a discussion regarding these assumptions briefly we assume negligible faradaic charge losses so that electrical charging and discharging durations are nearly equal further we assume that sufficient feed volume is flowed during a cdi cycle so that flow efficiency is near unity see si section 8 for a derivation and plot of flow efficiency for constant current variable flowrate operation together from eqs 9 and 10 the volumetric energy consumption and desalination depth are related by 11 e v 2 j r s f λ c d the productivity from eqs 1 9 and 10 is given by 12 p j λ 2 f 1 c d j 2 r s e v finally the thermodynamic efficiency η t h for a given desalination depth δ c d and water recovery wr can be calculated from eqs 7 and 11 in this analysis we use a series resistance r s of 30 ω cm2 current density j of 20 a m2 constant charge efficiency λ of 0 8 projected area of electrodes a of 100 cm2 and feed salt concentration of 20 mm note these are typical values of operational and system parameters of standard cdi cells in literature hawks et al 2019 fig 8 a shows the variation of gibbs free energy of separation δ g s e p biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 versus water recovery wr for concentration reductions δ c d of 5 10 and 15 mm from a 20 mm feed salt solution we observe that for each value of δ c d the gibbs free energy of separation δ g s e p increases with water recovery note the steep increase in δ g s e p for wr greater than about 50 as an example for δ c d of 10 mm δ g s e p increases from 0 007 to 0 019 kwh m3 shown by solid data points in fig 8a as wr increases from 50 e g using a constant flowrate cdi operation to 90 e g using a variable flowrate cdi operation also note that for a given value of water recovery δ g s e p increases monotonically with greater desalination depth δ c d fig 8b shows a contour plot of thermodynamic efficiency η t h versus water recovery and desalination depth solid and dashed contour lines respectively represent constant levels of thermodynamic efficiency and volumetric energy consumption in kwh m3 the second ordinate on the right of fig 8b indicates productivity p which is here a function of desalination depth δ c d c f equation 12 fig 8b shows that for a fixed δ c d the thermodynamic efficiency η t h increases significantly with increasing water recovery this is best explained by observing that for a given δ c d e v is nearly constant for varying values of water recovery this trend remains up to the limit of flow mixing inefficiencies incurred at low q dc c f sections 3 1 and 3 2 on the other hand δ g s e p increases significantly as water recovery increases beyond about 50 c f fig 8a the variable flowrate operation thus increases δ g s e p at nearly constant energy consumption and the result is improved energy efficiency of cdi further note that the volumetric energy cost e v increases linearly with δ c d see eq 11 while productivity scales inversely with δ c d see eq 12 these observations show that energy efficiency for cdi can be significantly improved e g from 10 to 50 by achieving high desalination depth and water recovery we note these results agree well with the trends observed by hemmatifar et al 2018 for the dependence of thermodynamic efficiency on desalination depth to our knowledge fig 8 is the first experimentally validated model showing tradeoffs among thermodynamic efficiency water recovery desalination depth volumetric energy consumption and productivity for cdi qin et al 2019 present a plot relating thermodynamic efficiency to desalination depth and water recovery but this plot is based purely on a new type of circuit model they propose for cdi performance as discussed in si section 9 the latter model likely assumes incorrect values for resistance and predicts unphysical trends in thermodynamic efficiency versus salt removal we caution the readers that to achieve high water recovery ratio overly low flowrates during discharge i e when operated at less than optimal flowrate can result in mixing losses and poor performance due to inefficient recovery of fresh or concentrated water at the effluent from within the cell we note that the trends for cdi performance presented in fig 8b do not account for flow inefficiency effects an operation in which the flow efficiency is overly low due to less feed volume flowed during the cdi cycle c f si section 8 can result in increased volumetric energy consumption and lower productivity as a trade off for improved water recovery see hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018b to avoid such sub optimal operating conditions we recommend the following procedure to find near optimal values of discharge flowrate for high water recovery operation irrespective of the electrical charging method first the nominal flowrate during electrical charging can be determined by the desired productivity and average concentration reduction assuming a conventional constant flowrate operation next the flowrate during discharge can be decreased as demonstrated in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to find the optimal condition this optimal condition is characterized by an operating point wherein water recovery is optimized while achieving volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration reductions approximately equal to those of the typical 50 water recovery case we hypothesize that the optimal value of discharge flowrate depends on the charging modes effective mixed reactor volume dispersion in the header nominal flowrate during charging discharge to charge flowrate ratio among many other factors and thus needs to be determined individually for each baseline operating condition finally we note that the volumes of dilute and brine solutions produced per cdi cycle do not simply scale with the amount of feed volume processed during electrical charging and discharging respectively at low flowrates we believe that the deviation from this scaling is due to the coupled physics of mixed reactor salt removal fluid flow and circuit electrical dynamics for cdi hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018a together with the effects of dispersion and mixing at low flowrates 5 conclusions we performed an experimental study of a variable flowrate operation for cdi which involves flowing at a nominal flow rate during electrical charging and a lower flowrate during electrical discharging we applied this operating method to both constant current and constant voltage electrical charge discharge schemes we systematically studied the effect of variable flowrate operation on the performance and efficiency of our custom built cdi cell for the first time we systematically show that freshwater recovery for conventional cdi can be increased to as high as 85 90 in a single pass desalination cycle under realistic salt removal conditions in addition to high water recovery we demonstrated nearly the same performance in volumetric energy consumption productivity and average concentration reduction in the freshwater using the variable flowrate operation at near optimal performance when compared to the conventional constant flowrate operation moreover the thermodynamic efficiency of the desalination process was shown to increase by 2 3 fold using the variable flowrate method compared to constant flow operation under similar conditions this was achieved primarily by increasing the gibbs free energy of separation by improving water recovery for nearly the same salt removal and energy consumption we believe that the variable flowrate scheme introduced in this work can be easily implemented in a wide range of existing cdi systems for improved

18929,in recent years harmful algal blooms capable of producing toxins including microcystins cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin have increased in occurrence and severity these toxins can enter drinking water treatment plants and if not effectively removed pose a serious threat to human health the work here investigated the efficacy of permanganate oxidation as a treatment strategy with a focus on incorporating competition by cyanobacterial cells and dissolved organic matter dom we report rate constants of 272 23 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and microcystin lr 0 26 0 05 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and cylindrospermopsin and using chemical analogs estimate a maximum rate constant of 2 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and saxitoxin we conclude that permanganate only shows potential to remove microcystins no ph 6 10 or alkalinity 0 50 mm dependence was observed for the rate of reaction between microcystin lr and permanganate however a temperature dependence was observed and can be characterized by an activation energy of 16 5 kj mol 1 the competition posed by cyanobacterial cells was quantified by an apparent second order rate constant of 2 5 0 3 10 6 l μg chl a 1 s 1 from this apparent second order rate constant it was concluded that cyanobacterial cells are not efficient scavengers of permanganate within typical contact times but this second order rate constant can be used to accurately predict microcystin degradation in algal impacted waters the competition posed by dom depended on both the amount of dom present as measured by toc and its electron donating capacity as predicted by suva 254 or e2 e3 ratio dom was concluded to scavenge permanganate efficiently and we forward that this should be considered in permanganate dosing calculations graphical abstract image 1 keywords permanganate cyanotoxin microcystin drinking water dissolved organic matter cyanobacteria 1 introduction in recent years the eutrophication of waterways particularly in the great lakes region has led to an increase in the occurrence and severity of harmful algal blooms anderson et al 2002 hudnell 2008 landsberg 2010 harmful algal blooms are composed of cyanobacteria and are concerning for several reasons anderson et al 2002 hudnell 2008 landsberg 2010 large algal blooms can impact tourism by making the lakes less desirable destinations hoagland et al 2002 steffen et al 2014a blooms threaten wildlife by decreasing visibility in the waters and by potentially depleting oxygen following cell death anderson et al 2002 landsberg 2010 one of the most concerning threats posed by cyanobacteria blooms is their potential to produce toxins and thereby harm human and animal health through contact and or ingestion bláha et al 2009 codd 1995 cyanobacteria are known to produce a number of different toxins including liver toxins such as microcystins and cylindrospermopsin and neurotoxins such as saxitoxin dittmann et al 2013 van wagoner et al 2007 in 2014 microcystin concentrations exceeded the ohio epa standard in toledo oh usa finished drinking water wines 2014 the resultant three day treatment plant shut down left one half million residents without access to drinking water wines 2014 in response to this and incidents elsewhere in the world research on drinking water treatment strategies to remove cyanotoxins has become a priority bach 2018 kouzminov et al 2007 qin et al 2010 common drinking water treatment processes have been evaluated to assess cyanotoxin removal including activated carbon sorption ozonation biological treatments and permanganate addition he et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 of these permanganate oxidation has gained interest because it is a low cost treatment that is easy to implement and operate jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2007a 2007b 2007c these operational characteristics make permanganate oxidation accessible to smaller and lower income communities and adaptive to intermittent toxin episodes permanganate addition to raw drinking water is approved by the epa and currently applied for disinfection byproduct reduction iron and manganese removal taste and odor control and prevention of zebra mussel growth on intake pipes cherry 1962 welch 1963 permanganate is an unselective oxidant because it contains manganese in the most oxidized form mn vii dash et al 2009 thus permanganate is able to react with many classes of organic compounds including phenols alkenes alcohols aldehydes and esters dash et al 2009 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 while permanganate oxidation has shown promise to remove cyanotoxins most notably microcystins previous research has overlooked the competition that would arise from other organic constituents in water rodriguez et al 2007a a major result of these previous studies is the cyanotox calculator provided by the american water works association this tool allows treatment plant operators to calculate expected concentration reductions of cyanotoxins using readily available plant operating parameters however the tool neglects competition which likely leads to inaccuracies in predicted cyanotoxin removal the importance of oxidant competition by water constituents is highlighted by the work of acero et al 2008 who showed a slower reduction of microcystin concentrations in surface water dosed with potassium permanganate compared to permanganate dosed high purity water it is likely that dissolved organic matter dom in water is an important competitor for permanganate it has long been known that dissolved organic matter dom is abundant in phenols and alkenes thorn et al 1989 these functionalities have also been shown to be the most reactive with permanganate which suggests that they could readily compete for permanganate on a treatment relevant time scale waldemer and tratnyek 2006 additionally permanganate will likely react with cyanobacterial cell membranes and intercellular chlorophyll a as has been shown for other oxidants including ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide and chloramine ding et al 2010 ramseier et al 2011 wert et al 2013 2014 in light of this we forward that naturally occurring dom and cyanobacterial cells could efficiently scavenge permanganate and should be considered in dosing protocols targeted toward cyanotoxin removal the work presented here assesses the efficacy of permanganate towards three cyanotoxins that have been observed in drinking water sources in recent years microcystins cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin based on an initial assessment of the permanganate reaction kinetics with each of these three toxins the impact of different water quality parameters was considered ph alkalinity and temperature the competition posed by cyanobacterial cells and dom was then assessed and quantified we believe these measurements allow for the improvement of permanganate dosing protocols for cyanotoxin removal 2 experimental methods 2 1

prior to uplc analyses based on cost and laboratory usage 2 3 kinetics two measurement techniques were used to follow compound oxidation as a function of time in kinetics experiments compound concentrations of microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin and guanine in the presence of excess permanganate were quantified by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography with uv detection uplc uv reaction mixtures containing varying amounts of permanganate 1 400 μm and constant amounts of the organic compound of interest microcystin 60 nm cylindrospermopsin 70 nm guanine 500 nm were prepared in glass serum vials total volume 125 ml the microcystin and cylindrospermopsin stocks were added in volumes of 100 μl to the reaction solutions resulting in a methanol concentration of 20 μm while the reaction rate constant for permanganate and methanol has not been measured ethanol reacts with permanganate on the order of 10 2 m 1 s 1 and thus we believe methanol does not interfere with our measurements waldemer and tratnyek 2006 the reaction was initiated upon addition of permanganate samples were collected at different time points by removing 2 ml aliquots and quenching these aliquots with 10 μl of sodium thiosulfate 0 08 m or 1 m depending on the permanganate concentration the samples were then filtered into an lc vial using a 0 22 μm nylon filter to remove manganese dioxide particles and analyzed by uplc uv waters uplc acquity with a waters beh c18 column 1 7 μm particle size 2 1 mm 50 mm using a 0 2 ml min 1 flow rate the mobile phase and detection wavelength varied depending on the compound being quantified microcystin lr was detected at a wavelength of 238 nm with a mobile phase gradient beginning with 25 75 acetonitrile 0 05 v v tfa water 0 05 v v tfa and switching to 50 50 acetonitrile 0 05 v v tfa water 0 05 v v tfa over 5 min spoof et al 2009 cylindrospermopsin was analyzed using a detection wavelength of 262 nm with an isocratic mobile phase of 10 90 water 0 05 v v tfa methanol 0 05 v v tfa guanine was analyzed using a detection wavelength of 254 nm with an isocratic mobile phase of 5 mm ph 11 5 phosphate buffer a second method was used to quantify permanganate reaction kinetics with 2 amine benzodiazol urethane dom and cyanbaceterial cells each of these compounds was present in excess and the permanganate concentration changes were monitored over time the permanganate measurement method was adapted from the dpd method for residual chlorine analysis to target low permanganate concentrations with minimal absorbance interferences callaway et al 1995 palin 1975 reaction solutions 100 ml were prepared in a beaker or glass serum vial and the reactions were initiated by the addition of permanganate at each sample time point 0 25 ml of the dpd reagent and 0 25 ml of phosphate buffer 0 5 m ph 12 6 containing 800 mg l 1 edta were pre mixed before a reaction solution aliquot 5 ml was obtained the aliquot of the reaction mixture was then collected and mixed with 0 1 ml of 0 25 m sodium chloride to increase ionic strength and to encourage particle aggregation then filtered through a 0 1 μm pvdf filter to remove manganese dioxide particles the filtrate was added directly to the pre mixed dpd reagent filtrate addition to the dpd reagent was timed carefully to occur 30 s after mixing the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer exactly 1 min was allowed after combining the filtrate and dpd reagent phosphate buffer before quantifying the dpd radical absorbance at 550 nm by uv vis spectroscopy this approach lowered the permanganate limit of detection such that typical permanganate dosages 6 8 μm could be used with accurate quantification laszakovits et al 2019 the kinetic experiments were undertaken to obtain bimolecular rate constants for reaction between permanganate and cyanotoxins or other organic constituents in each case the change in reactant concentration x m with time can be described by the second order rate expression 1 d x d t k a x where t s is time k m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant and a m is the concentration of the reagent present in excess defined as tenfold greater than the initial concentration of x because the concentration of a is effectively constant through the duration of the experiment equation 1 can be simplified to a pseudo first order reaction 2 d x d t k o b s x where kobs k a s 1 is the observed pseudo first order rate constant the measured concentration of x as a function of time can be fit to the equation 3 l n x t l n x 0 k o b s t where x 0 m is the initial analyte concentration kinetic experiments for each reaction pair were repeated for different concentrations of the excess reagent a the resultant kobs values were then plotted versus the initial concentrations of a to obtain the second order bimolecular reaction rate constant for the reaction pair from the fitted slope 4 k o b s k a a minimum of three different excess concentrations were examined in duplicate for each reaction pair all observed rate constant plots equation 3 showed good linearity r2 0 93 0 99 and all second order rate constant plots equation 4 showed good linearity r2 0 96 0 99 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyanotoxin kinetics microcystin lr was used as a proxy for microcystins a class of cyanotoxins that are cyclic heptapeptides with varied amino acid substitutions at two positions fig 1 a permanganate reacts with olefin bonds within the adda moiety of microcystins since the adda moiety is highly conserved across all microcystins microcystin lr is representative broadly of this class of toxins bláha et al 2009 jeong et al 2017 the slope of the second order rate constant plot equation 4 for the reaction between mc lr and permanganate gives a second order rate constant of 272 23 m 1 s 1 fig 2 a our measured rate constant is comparable to measurements reported by others rodriguez et al 2007a reported a rate constant of 357 2 17 5 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2010 reported a rate constant of 408 m 1 s 1 jeong et al 2017 reported a rate constant of 289 9 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2018 reported a rate constant of 386 2 m 1 s 1 our rate constant is closest in value to that of jeong et al 2017 and lower than other reported values which may be subject to other confounding experimental factors for example rodriguez et al 2007a used polypropylene filters a material to which microcystin has been shown to sorb and could lead to an overestimation of microcystin consumption by permanganate reaction giving a faster apparent rate constant hyenstrand et al 2001a b kamp et al 2016 likewise the unreported material types in kim et al s 2018 experimental procedure may also have been a source of microcystins loss ding et al 2010 studied mc lr release from cyanobacteria and therefore the rate constant captures a more complex reaction process which may account for the discrepancy from our initial evaluation of the mc lr permanganate rate constant we conclude that typical dosage amounts of permanganate 0 1 5 mg l 1 have potential to degrade microcystins on a time scale relevant to drinking water treatment plant operations the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and cylindrospermopsin was similarly evaluated fig 1b from the slope of the second order rate constant plot we report a rate constant of 0 26 0 05 m 1 s 1 fig 2b the rate constant we obtained is comparable to that of rodriguez et al 2007c who reported a value of 0 30 m 1 s 1 this value is within our 95 confidence interval and we can thus conclude that our reported rate constant is reliable the rate of cylindrospermopsin reaction with permanganate is relatively slow for example the half life for cylindrospermopsin reacting with excess potassium permanganate for a typical dosing concentration of 1 mg l 1 is on the order of 5 days we thus conclude that permanganate cannot remove cylindrospermopsin on a treatment relevant time scale the rate constants for the reaction between permanganate and three saxitoxin analogs urethane guanine and 2 amine benzodiazol were evaluated these analogs closely represent sub structures of saxitoxin and thus we believe that they are appropriate choices to evaluate the reactivity of permanganate with saxitoxin fig 1c no reaction between permanganate and urethane was observed over 4 h when 600 μm urethane and 6 μm permanganate were mixed this suggests that the rate constant must be less than 0 01 m 1 s 1 and therefore permanganate would not react with the saxitoxin ester moiety on a treatment relevant time scale the second order rate constant of guanine was determined to be 2 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 fig 2c and the second order rate constant for 2 amine benzodiazol was measured to be 1 1 0 1 m 1 s 1 fig 2d these rate constants are relatively low using the guanine rate constant and an excess potassium permanganate concentration of 1 mg l 1 the half life of saxitoxin is anticipated to be on the order of 12 h from this data it is concluded that permanganate cannot remove saxitoxin on a reasonable time scale and should not be considered as a treatment strategy for this cyanotoxin the remainder of this article will focus on permanganate removal of microcystins because cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin reactions with permanganate at typical dosed concentrations are too slow compared to drinking water treatment time scales we note that potassium permanganate concentrations are typically capped at 2 5 mg l 1 out of concern that dissolved microcystin concentration may increase through cell lysage at higher oxidant doses resulting in the release of intracellular microcystins ohio epa 2015 3 2 water quality parameters we examined the influence of common water quality parameters ph alkalinity and temperature on the rate of reaction between microcystin and permanganate permanganate is known to target the two olefin bonds on the adda moiety within microcystin and it is known that ph can alter the mechanisms by which permanganate oxidizes olefin bonds dash et al 2009 huang et al 2001 rodriguez et al 2007a yan and schwartz 2000 using a 5 mm carbonate buffer the permanganate mc lr second order rate constant was measured over a ph range of 6 10 as shown in fig 3 a ph has no statistically significant impact on the rate of reaction r2 0 31 this suggests that one oxidation mechanism dominates in alkaline conditions and is consistent with other work on olefin oxidation the results shown in fig 3a suggest that the rate of reaction may increase below ph 6 which is consistent with other work kim et al 2018 however acidic ph conditions are not typically characteristic of algal bloom events and since permanganate is traditionally applied at the intake of drinking water treatment plants the treatment would occur under basic water conditions ph 8 9 wetzel 2001 alkalinity can affect the rates of oxidation reactions particularly reaction pathways that have distinct ionic reaction intermediates permanganate oxidation reactions are not known to have radical intermediates so formation of carbonate radicals from naturally occurring alkalinity is unlikely to alter microcystin removal rates dash et al 2009 yan and schwartz 1999 2000 high alkalinity can contribute to high ionic strength which stabilizes ionic reaction intermediates and thereby increases the rate of reaction muller 1994 in the case of mc lr alkalinity has no effect on the rate of reaction with permanganate fig 3b there is overlap between the 95 confidence intervals at all tested alkalinity concentrations and there is no statistically significant trend r2 0 47 the absence of an alkalinity or ionic strength effect on mc lr oxidation by permanganate suggests the absence of ionic intermediates rather this trend is consistent with the intramolecular formation of a hypomanganate cyclic intermediate that has been proposed to form during permanganate oxidation of olefin containing compounds dash et al 2009 yan and schwartz 1999 temperature was the only tested water quality parameter that did significantly impact the rate of reaction between mc lr and permanganate reaction rates showed a positive correlation with temperature which is typical of most reactions fig 3c houston 2006 using the arrhenius equation this temperature dependence allows for the activation energy to be calculated as 16 5 kj mol 1 fig 3d this activation energy is comparable to that published by rodriguez et al 2007 28 kj mol 1 rodriguez et al 2007a again the rodriguez et al 2007 value may be biased by microcystin loss to their experimental set up the effect of temperature on the rate of reaction between permanganate and mc lr can be reliably predicted in drinking water treatment scenarios using the arrhenius equation 3 3 permanganate competition modeling we were interested in quantitatively accounting for dom and cyanobacterial cell competition in the oxidation of microcystins by permanganate in this system both permanganate and microcystin concentrations change with time of reaction however the relative concentration differences allow two pseudo first order approximations to be applied using kinetic theory the first approximation assumes that dom concentration and or cyanobacterial cell concentration is constant over time we have confirmed that toc concentrations in water samples do not change over 4 h of reaction with permanganate in our experiments to estimate permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells we did not observe cell lysis and therefore believe this first assumption is also valid for cyanobacterial cells this assumption allows the reaction between the competitors and permanganate to be simplified to a pseudo first order reaction 5 d m n o 4 d t k o b s m n o 4 where kobs s 1 is the measured rate constant for the reaction between the competitor and permanganate the second approximation assumes that the concentration of permanganate is much larger than the concentration of mc the typical permanganate dose in a drinking water treatment plant is 1 mg l 1 as the potassium salt 6 μm and in extreme bloom conditions the microcystin concentrations may be as high as 100 ppb 0 1 μm more typical bloom conditions are characterized by microcystin concentrations less than 10 ppb 0 01 μm thus this assumption is reasonable and will hold until the permanganate concentration is no longer 10 times greater than the microcystin concentration the rate expression for the degradation of microcystin mc 6 d m c d t k m n o 4 m c we can capture the time variation in permanganate concentration by substituting from the integrated form of equation 5 7 m n o 4 t m n o 4 o e k o b s t and then solving equation 6 to give the expected concentration of microcystin with respect to time 8 m c t m c 0 e k m n o 4 o e k o b s t k o b s 1 k o b s where mc 0 m is the initial microcystin concentration in the water and mno4 0 is the permanganate dose 3 4 permanganate cyanobacterial cell rate constant the interference by cyanobacterial cells was investigated by concentrating planktothrix cyanobacterial cells from grand lake saint mary s oh usa whole water steffen et al 2014b the amount of cyanobacteria was quantified by chlorophyll a chl a concentrations which we believe are a good proxy for the number of cells present and is a measure that could be readily available to treatment plant operators the concentrated solution of cyanobacterial cells was diluted in 5 mm ph 8 5 carbonate buffer so that an apparent second order rate constant could be measured a typical pseudo first order kinetic plot equation 3 is shown in fig 4 a good linearity was observed for all measurements r2 0 94 except the lowest chlorophyll a concentration due to the slow rate of reaction r2 0 69 no cell lysis was observed at permanganate concentrations of 2 3 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 as cell lysis would result in a rapid decrease in permanganate concentration due to an increase in available organic material the apparent second order rate constant plot fig 4b similarly showed good linearity r2 0 93 from this the apparent second order rate constant was determined to be 2 5 0 3 10 6 l μg chl a 1 s 1 therefore the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells can easily be predicted from equation 10 using chlorophyll a concentration measurements 9 k o b s 2 5 10 6 c h l a this value is representative for blooms of planktothrix but we believe it could be applied more broadly because cyanobacteria are gram negative and thus it is expected their cell membranes would react with permanganate similarly under high bloom conditions defined by the us epa as chl a concentrations 100 μg l 1 scavenging by cyanobacterial cells would only add 20 min to the treatment time needed to reduce mc lr from 50 ppb to 1 6 ppb overall this suggests that cyanobacterial cells are not efficient competitors for permanganate but the apparent rate constant presented here could be applied in dosing models as a safety factor 3 5 permanganate dom rate constant we attempted to use the dpd method to measure the permanganate dom apparent rate constant using filtered whole water samples when we compared our data with what the model derived in section 3 3 we saw that the general shape matched our data however two trends emerged fig 5 in all cases microcystin concentrations in real water samples decreased more slowly than what are predicted for high purity water dotted lines fig 5 under these ideal conditions the ohio epa regulatory trigger for microcystin 1 6 ppb 1 6 nm is easily reached within 40 min following permanganate addition dotted line fig 5 for seven of ten whole water samples reasonable agreement within 50 was obtained between our predicted concentrations and our measured concentrations fig 5a the remaining three samples showed poor agreement between predicted and measured microcystin concentrations the sample presented in fig 5b showed the largest discrepancy between our predicted and measured microcystin concentrations 84 difference at 40 min all whole water samples that showed disagreement between the predicted and measured microcystin concentrations were from algal impacted waters in fig 5b the permanganate microcystin reaction appears to stop after 15 min when additional permanganate was dosed in the reaction proceeded again but with a faster rate e g the rate of reaction between dom and permanganate was slower these observations suggest that in these samples dom rapidly consumed permanganate within 15 min this in turn suggests that our permanganate probe subject to interference in those samples which results in an overestimation of permanganate concentration and an underestimation in the permanganate dom reaction rate because expected interferents namely mn iii complexation to dom and manganese dioxide particles had carefully been evaluated during method development we believe this suggests a change in dom electrochemical properties laszakovits et al 2019 work to evaluate dom changes during permanganate oxidation is underway but is outside the scope of this paper in samples that consume permanganate rapidly it was observed that sequential dosing led to slower permanganate dom reaction rates and therefore faster permanganate microcystin reaction rates under extreme bloom conditions 10 ppb 10 nm microcystins we forward that sequential permanganate dosing could effectively remove microcystins in order to develop a robust rate constant for the dom permanganate reaction we chose to calculate a more representative apparent rate constant from the mc lr degradation data in filtered whole water samples using equation 8 fitting the data to equation 8 resulted in high correlation coefficients r2 0 95 and thus we believe our reported rate constants are representative of the competition for permanganate oxidation posed by dom the competition posed by dom is substantially larger than that posed by cyanobacterial cells under extreme bloom conditions 100 μg chl a l 1 and toc 7 mg c l 1 cyanobacterial cells would only add 20 min to the treatment time to reduce 50 ppb microcystin to 1 6 ppb dom however could completely inhibit reduction of microcystin to regulatory levels generally we found that the effective permanganate loss to dom rate constant depended on total organic carbon fig 6 a this was expected based on kinetic theory as the concentration of one reactant in a bimolecular reaction is increased the rate of reaction similarly will increase however there is a large amount of scatter in the data which suggests that other characteristics of dom are important it should be noted that there is a clear separation in toc for samples from algal impacted water and terrestrial sources in order to compare between effective permanganate dom rate constants we normalized to organic carbon concentration using total organic carbon toc measurements equation 10 10 k o b s o c k o b s t o c to investigate the scatter in observed rate constants with toc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 was analyzed suva 254 is defined as the absorbance of a water sample at 254 nm divided by the total organic carbon concentration suva 254 is commonly used in drinking water treatment models for processes such as coagulation and disinfection byproduct formation edwards 1997 hua et al 2015 suva 254 is known to correlate directly with dom aromaticity and electron donating capacity sharpless et al 2014a weishaar et al 2003 thus it was expected that as suva 254 increases meaning the electron donating capacity increases so too would the permanganate dom reaction rate as expected there was a statistically significant trend between carbon normalized permanganate reactivity and suva 254 r2 0 72 fig 6b this relationship can be described by equation 11 11 k o b s o c 1 7 0 4 10 4 s u v a 254 2 2 1 10 4 another dom characterization parameter we used is the e2 e3 ratio the e2 e3 ratio is simply the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the absorbance at 365 nm this parameter is not currently used by plant operators but could easily be obtained from the absorption spectrum of a filtered water sample it is known that e2 e3 is inversely correlated with electron donating capacity sharpless et al 2014b it is unique in that it appears to take into account other water quality parameters such as ionic strength and ph that can affect dom s reactivity dalrymple et al 2010 it was anticipated that as the e2 e3 ratio decreases meaning the electron donating capacity increases the organic carbon normalized permanganate reaction rates with dom would increase because dom would be able to more readily donate electrons to permanganate when the carbon normalized rate constant is plotted against the e2 e3 ratio for ten whole water samples similar to suva 254 we find a statistically significant trend r2 0 56 that can be described by equation 12 and applies regardless of dom source type fig 6c 12 k o b s o c 1 4 0 4 10 4 e 2 e 3 1 1 0 3 10 3 3 6 modeling mc lr degradation in raw water to validate that there was no interference with the dpd method when determining the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and cyanobacterial cells we spiked raw water samples with mc lr and predicted the rate of oxidation by permanganate for these analysis we used three different water samples one from a healthy lake fig 7 a one from a location early in the bloom season fig 7b and one from a lake experiencing a severe bloom fig 7c these algal blooms were dominated by planktothrix and thus equation 9 is directly applicable we used the calculated dom rate constant from mc lr experiments conducted in the filtered whole water and predicted the observed rate constant for scavenging due to cyanobacterial cells using measured chlorophyll a concentrations equation 9 to predict the microcystin lr degradation equation 8 where kobs is found according to equation 13 13 k o b s k o b s d o m k o b s c y a n o where kobs dom s 1 is the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by dom and kobs cyano s 1 is the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells we find that using the rate constant determined previously equation 13 reasonably predicts the observed mc lr degradation to within 10 for the algal impacted samples fig 7 experimental purple dots v predicted 1 solid black line based on this we can conclude that our permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells rate constant is reliable and could be incorporated into dosing protocols as a safety factor during blooms to illustrate how the e2 e3 ratio could be used by treatment plant operators and to test how well our rate constant expressions equations 9 10 and 12 can predict microcystin degradation in raw water samples we applied the same kinetic model as described previously equation 8 using predicted dom scavenging rate constants equations 10 and 12 and predicted cyanobacterial cells scavenging rate constant equation 9 we find good agreement between the measured mc lr concentrations and the predicted concentrations fig 7 experimental purple dots v predicted 2 dotted red line errors were within 20 which we believe is reasonable for a model built on easily measured parameters again the predicted mc lr loss in high purity water blue dashed line is plotted for each water sample to emphasize that without considering the competition posed by dom and cyanobacterial cells remaining microcystin concentrations will be largely underestimated in light of this we forward that the kinetic rate constants for permanganate scavenging by natural competitors should be incorporated into dosing protocols 4 conclusions the work presented here shows that permanganate can efficiently remove microcystins on a treatment relevant time scale but should not be considered for the treatment of saxitoxin or cylindrospermopsin alternative treatment strategies for saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin should be assessed the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and microcystins depends only on temperature not ph or alkalinity and can therefore be reliably predicted by the arrhenius equation cyanobacterial cells do not pose significant competition for permanganate but dom does for most bloom conditions potassium permanganate treatment 1 mg l 1 alone will be sufficient to reduce microcystin concentrations around 10 ppb below state regulated standards 1 6 ppb funding sources funding was provided by the ohio

18929,in recent years harmful algal blooms capable of producing toxins including microcystins cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin have increased in occurrence and severity these toxins can enter drinking water treatment plants and if not effectively removed pose a serious threat to human health the work here investigated the efficacy of permanganate oxidation as a treatment strategy with a focus on incorporating competition by cyanobacterial cells and dissolved organic matter dom we report rate constants of 272 23 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and microcystin lr 0 26 0 05 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and cylindrospermopsin and using chemical analogs estimate a maximum rate constant of 2 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 for the reaction between permanganate and saxitoxin we conclude that permanganate only shows potential to remove microcystins no ph 6 10 or alkalinity 0 50 mm dependence was observed for the rate of reaction between microcystin lr and permanganate however a temperature dependence was observed and can be characterized by an activation energy of 16 5 kj mol 1 the competition posed by cyanobacterial cells was quantified by an apparent second order rate constant of 2 5 0 3 10 6 l μg chl a 1 s 1 from this apparent second order rate constant it was concluded that cyanobacterial cells are not efficient scavengers of permanganate within typical contact times but this second order rate constant can be used to accurately predict microcystin degradation in algal impacted waters the competition posed by dom depended on both the amount of dom present as measured by toc and its electron donating capacity as predicted by suva 254 or e2 e3 ratio dom was concluded to scavenge permanganate efficiently and we forward that this should be considered in permanganate dosing calculations graphical abstract image 1 keywords permanganate cyanotoxin microcystin drinking water dissolved organic matter cyanobacteria 1 introduction in recent years the eutrophication of waterways particularly in the great lakes region has led to an increase in the occurrence and severity of harmful algal blooms anderson et al 2002 hudnell 2008 landsberg 2010 harmful algal blooms are composed of cyanobacteria and are concerning for several reasons anderson et al 2002 hudnell 2008 landsberg 2010 large algal blooms can impact tourism by making the lakes less desirable destinations hoagland et al 2002 steffen et al 2014a blooms threaten wildlife by decreasing visibility in the waters and by potentially depleting oxygen following cell death anderson et al 2002 landsberg 2010 one of the most concerning threats posed by cyanobacteria blooms is their potential to produce toxins and thereby harm human and animal health through contact and or ingestion bláha et al 2009 codd 1995 cyanobacteria are known to produce a number of different toxins including liver toxins such as microcystins and cylindrospermopsin and neurotoxins such as saxitoxin dittmann et al 2013 van wagoner et al 2007 in 2014 microcystin concentrations exceeded the ohio epa standard in toledo oh usa finished drinking water wines 2014 the resultant three day treatment plant shut down left one half million residents without access to drinking water wines 2014 in response to this and incidents elsewhere in the world research on drinking water treatment strategies to remove cyanotoxins has become a priority bach 2018 kouzminov et al 2007 qin et al 2010 common drinking water treatment processes have been evaluated to assess cyanotoxin removal including activated carbon sorption ozonation biological treatments and permanganate addition he et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 of these permanganate oxidation has gained interest because it is a low cost treatment that is easy to implement and operate jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2007a 2007b 2007c these operational characteristics make permanganate oxidation accessible to smaller and lower income communities and adaptive to intermittent toxin episodes permanganate addition to raw drinking water is approved by the epa and currently applied for disinfection byproduct reduction iron and manganese removal taste and odor control and prevention of zebra mussel growth on intake pipes cherry 1962 welch 1963 permanganate is an unselective oxidant because it contains manganese in the most oxidized form mn vii dash et al 2009 thus permanganate is able to react with many classes of organic compounds including phenols alkenes alcohols aldehydes and esters dash et al 2009 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 while permanganate oxidation has shown promise to remove cyanotoxins most notably microcystins previous research has overlooked the competition that would arise from other organic constituents in water rodriguez et al 2007a a major result of these previous studies is the cyanotox calculator provided by the american water works association this tool allows treatment plant operators to calculate expected concentration reductions of cyanotoxins using readily available plant operating parameters however the tool neglects competition which likely leads to inaccuracies in predicted cyanotoxin removal the importance of oxidant competition by water constituents is highlighted by the work of acero et al 2008 who showed a slower reduction of microcystin concentrations in surface water dosed with potassium permanganate compared to permanganate dosed high purity water it is likely that dissolved organic matter dom in water is an important competitor for permanganate it has long been known that dissolved organic matter dom is abundant in phenols and alkenes thorn et al 1989 these functionalities have also been shown to be the most reactive with permanganate which suggests that they could readily compete for permanganate on a treatment relevant time scale waldemer and tratnyek 2006 additionally permanganate will likely react with cyanobacterial cell membranes and intercellular chlorophyll a as has been shown for other oxidants including ozone chlorine chlorine dioxide and chloramine ding et al 2010 ramseier et al 2011 wert et al 2013 2014 in light of this we forward that naturally occurring dom and cyanobacterial cells could efficiently scavenge permanganate and should be considered in dosing protocols targeted toward cyanotoxin removal the work presented here assesses the efficacy of permanganate towards three cyanotoxins that have been observed in drinking water sources in recent years microcystins cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin based on an initial assessment of the permanganate reaction kinetics with each of these three toxins the impact of different water quality parameters was considered ph alkalinity and temperature the competition posed by cyanobacterial cells and dom was then assessed and quantified we believe these measurements allow for the improvement of permanganate dosing protocols for cyanotoxin removal 2 experimental methods 2 1

hydrochloric acid and then diluting the mixture to a total volume of 50 ml carbonate buffers were prepared by dissolving sodium bicarbonate in high purity water and adjusting the ph with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide these solutions were stored at room temperature whole water samples were collected throughout the state of ohio usa and included algal impacted waters buckeye lake grand lake

our experimental set up was designed to minimize the sorptive losses of microcystin and other organic compounds hyenstrand et al 2001a b kamp et al 2016 all storage vessels were glass glass syringes

prior to uplc analyses based on cost and laboratory usage 2 3 kinetics two measurement techniques were used to follow compound oxidation as a function of time in kinetics experiments compound concentrations of microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin and guanine in the presence of excess permanganate were quantified by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography with uv detection uplc uv reaction mixtures containing varying amounts of permanganate 1 400 μm and constant amounts of the organic compound of interest microcystin 60 nm cylindrospermopsin 70 nm guanine 500 nm were prepared in glass serum vials total volume 125 ml the microcystin and cylindrospermopsin stocks were added in volumes of 100 μl to the reaction solutions resulting in a methanol concentration of 20 μm while the reaction rate constant for permanganate and methanol has not been measured ethanol reacts with permanganate on the order of 10 2 m 1 s 1 and thus we believe methanol does not interfere with our measurements waldemer and tratnyek 2006 the reaction was initiated upon addition of permanganate samples were collected at different time points by removing 2 ml aliquots and quenching these aliquots with 10 μl of sodium thiosulfate 0 08 m or 1 m depending on the permanganate concentration the samples were then filtered into an lc vial using a 0 22 μm nylon filter to remove manganese dioxide particles and analyzed by uplc uv waters uplc acquity with a waters beh c18 column 1 7 μm particle size 2 1 mm 50 mm using a 0 2 ml min 1 flow rate the mobile phase and detection wavelength varied depending on the compound being quantified microcystin lr was detected at a wavelength of 238 nm with a mobile phase gradient beginning with 25 75 acetonitrile 0 05 v v tfa water 0 05 v v tfa and switching to 50 50 acetonitrile 0 05 v v tfa water 0 05 v v tfa over 5 min spoof et al 2009 cylindrospermopsin was analyzed using a detection wavelength of 262 nm with an isocratic mobile phase of 10 90 water 0 05 v v tfa methanol 0 05 v v tfa guanine was analyzed using a detection wavelength of 254 nm with an isocratic mobile phase of 5 mm ph 11 5 phosphate buffer a second method was used to quantify permanganate reaction kinetics with 2 amine benzodiazol urethane dom and cyanbaceterial cells each of these compounds was present in excess and the permanganate concentration changes were monitored over time the permanganate measurement method was adapted from the dpd method for residual chlorine analysis to target low permanganate concentrations with minimal absorbance interferences callaway et al 1995 palin 1975 reaction solutions 100 ml were prepared in a beaker or glass serum vial and the reactions were initiated by the addition of permanganate at each sample time point 0 25 ml of the dpd reagent and 0 25 ml of phosphate buffer 0 5 m ph 12 6 containing 800 mg l 1 edta were pre mixed before a reaction solution aliquot 5 ml was obtained the aliquot of the reaction mixture was then collected and mixed with 0 1 ml of 0 25 m sodium chloride to increase ionic strength and to encourage particle aggregation then filtered through a 0 1 μm pvdf filter to remove manganese dioxide particles the filtrate was added directly to the pre mixed dpd reagent filtrate addition to the dpd reagent was timed carefully to occur 30 s after mixing the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer exactly 1 min was allowed after combining the filtrate and dpd reagent phosphate buffer before quantifying the dpd radical absorbance at 550 nm by uv vis spectroscopy this approach lowered the permanganate limit of detection such that typical permanganate dosages 6 8 μm could be used with accurate quantification laszakovits et al 2019 the kinetic experiments were undertaken to obtain bimolecular rate constants for reaction between permanganate and cyanotoxins or other organic constituents in each case the change in reactant concentration x m with time can be described by the second order rate expression 1 d x d t k a x where t s is time k m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant and a m is the concentration of the reagent present in excess defined as tenfold greater than the initial concentration of x because the concentration of a is effectively constant through the duration of the experiment equation 1 can be simplified to a pseudo first order reaction 2 d x d t k o b s x where kobs k a s 1 is the observed pseudo first order rate constant the measured concentration of x as a function of time can be fit to the equation 3 l n x t l n x 0 k o b s t where x 0 m is the initial analyte concentration kinetic experiments for each reaction pair were repeated for different concentrations of the excess reagent a the resultant kobs values were then plotted versus the initial concentrations of a to obtain the second order bimolecular reaction rate constant for the reaction pair from the fitted slope 4 k o b s k a a minimum of three different excess concentrations were examined in duplicate for each reaction pair all observed rate constant plots equation 3 showed good linearity r2 0 93 0 99 and all second order rate constant plots equation 4 showed good linearity r2 0 96 0 99 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyanotoxin kinetics microcystin lr was used as a proxy for microcystins a class of cyanotoxins that are cyclic heptapeptides with varied amino acid substitutions at two positions fig 1 a permanganate reacts with olefin bonds within the adda moiety of microcystins since the adda moiety is highly conserved across all microcystins microcystin lr is representative broadly of this class of toxins bláha et al 2009 jeong et al 2017 the slope of the second order rate constant plot equation 4 for the reaction between mc lr and permanganate gives a second order rate constant of 272 23 m 1 s 1 fig 2 a our measured rate constant is comparable to measurements reported by others rodriguez et al 2007a reported a rate constant of 357 2 17 5 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2010 reported a rate constant of 408 m 1 s 1 jeong et al 2017 reported a rate constant of 289 9 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2018 reported a rate constant of 386 2 m 1 s 1 our rate constant is closest in value to that of jeong et al 2017 and lower than other reported values which may be subject to other confounding experimental factors for example rodriguez et al 2007a used polypropylene filters a material to which microcystin has been shown to sorb and could lead to an overestimation of microcystin consumption by permanganate reaction giving a faster apparent rate constant hyenstrand et al 2001a b kamp et al 2016 likewise the unreported material types in kim et al s 2018 experimental procedure may also have been a source of microcystins loss ding et al 2010 studied mc lr release from cyanobacteria and therefore the rate constant captures a more complex reaction process which may account for the discrepancy from our initial evaluation of the mc lr permanganate rate constant we conclude that typical dosage amounts of permanganate 0 1 5 mg l 1 have potential to degrade microcystins on a time scale relevant to drinking water treatment plant operations the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and cylindrospermopsin was similarly evaluated fig 1b from the slope of the second order rate constant plot we report a rate constant of 0 26 0 05 m 1 s 1 fig 2b the rate constant we obtained is comparable to that of rodriguez et al 2007c who reported a value of 0 30 m 1 s 1 this value is within our 95 confidence interval and we can thus conclude that our reported rate constant is reliable the rate of cylindrospermopsin reaction with permanganate is relatively slow for example the half life for cylindrospermopsin reacting with excess potassium permanganate for a typical dosing concentration of 1 mg l 1 is on the order of 5 days we thus conclude that permanganate cannot remove cylindrospermopsin on a treatment relevant time scale the rate constants for the reaction between permanganate and three saxitoxin analogs urethane guanine and 2 amine benzodiazol were evaluated these analogs closely represent sub structures of saxitoxin and thus we believe that they are appropriate choices to evaluate the reactivity of permanganate with saxitoxin fig 1c no reaction between permanganate and urethane was observed over 4 h when 600 μm urethane and 6 μm permanganate were mixed this suggests that the rate constant must be less than 0 01 m 1 s 1 and therefore permanganate would not react with the saxitoxin ester moiety on a treatment relevant time scale the second order rate constant of guanine was determined to be 2 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 fig 2c and the second order rate constant for 2 amine benzodiazol was measured to be 1 1 0 1 m 1 s 1 fig 2d these rate constants are relatively low using the guanine rate constant and an excess potassium permanganate concentration of 1 mg l 1 the half life of saxitoxin is anticipated to be on the order of 12 h from this data it is concluded that permanganate cannot remove saxitoxin on a reasonable time scale and should not be considered as a treatment strategy for this cyanotoxin the remainder of this article will focus on permanganate removal of microcystins because cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin reactions with permanganate at typical dosed concentrations are too slow compared to drinking water treatment time scales we note that potassium permanganate concentrations are typically capped at 2 5 mg l 1 out of concern that dissolved microcystin concentration may increase through cell lysage at higher oxidant doses resulting in the release of intracellular microcystins ohio epa 2015 3 2 water quality parameters we examined the influence of common water quality parameters ph alkalinity and temperature on the rate of reaction between microcystin and permanganate permanganate is known to target the two olefin bonds on the adda moiety within microcystin and it is known that ph can alter the mechanisms by which permanganate oxidizes olefin bonds dash et al 2009 huang et al 2001 rodriguez et al 2007a yan and schwartz 2000 using a 5 mm carbonate buffer the permanganate mc lr second order rate constant was measured over a ph range of 6 10 as shown in fig 3 a ph has no statistically significant impact on the rate of reaction r2 0 31 this suggests that one oxidation mechanism dominates in alkaline conditions and is consistent with other work on olefin oxidation the results shown in fig 3a suggest that the rate of reaction may increase below ph 6 which is consistent with other work kim et al 2018 however acidic ph conditions are not typically characteristic of algal bloom events and since permanganate is traditionally applied at the intake of drinking water treatment plants the treatment would occur under basic water conditions ph 8 9 wetzel 2001 alkalinity can affect the rates of oxidation reactions particularly reaction pathways that have distinct ionic reaction intermediates permanganate oxidation reactions are not known to have radical intermediates so formation of carbonate radicals from naturally occurring alkalinity is unlikely to alter microcystin removal rates dash et al 2009 yan and schwartz 1999 2000 high alkalinity can contribute to high ionic strength which stabilizes ionic reaction intermediates and thereby increases the rate of reaction muller 1994 in the case of mc lr alkalinity has no effect on the rate of reaction with permanganate fig 3b there is overlap between the 95 confidence intervals at all tested alkalinity concentrations and there is no statistically significant trend r2 0 47 the absence of an alkalinity or ionic strength effect on mc lr oxidation by permanganate suggests the absence of ionic intermediates rather this trend is consistent with the intramolecular formation of a hypomanganate cyclic intermediate that has been proposed to form during permanganate oxidation of olefin containing compounds dash et al 2009 yan and schwartz 1999 temperature was the only tested water quality parameter that did significantly impact the rate of reaction between mc lr and permanganate reaction rates showed a positive correlation with temperature which is typical of most reactions fig 3c houston 2006 using the arrhenius equation this temperature dependence allows for the activation energy to be calculated as 16 5 kj mol 1 fig 3d this activation energy is comparable to that published by rodriguez et al 2007 28 kj mol 1 rodriguez et al 2007a again the rodriguez et al 2007 value may be biased by microcystin loss to their experimental set up the effect of temperature on the rate of reaction between permanganate and mc lr can be reliably predicted in drinking water treatment scenarios using the arrhenius equation 3 3 permanganate competition modeling we were interested in quantitatively accounting for dom and cyanobacterial cell competition in the oxidation of microcystins by permanganate in this system both permanganate and microcystin concentrations change with time of reaction however the relative concentration differences allow two pseudo first order approximations to be applied using kinetic theory the first approximation assumes that dom concentration and or cyanobacterial cell concentration is constant over time we have confirmed that toc concentrations in water samples do not change over 4 h of reaction with permanganate in our experiments to estimate permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells we did not observe cell lysis and therefore believe this first assumption is also valid for cyanobacterial cells this assumption allows the reaction between the competitors and permanganate to be simplified to a pseudo first order reaction 5 d m n o 4 d t k o b s m n o 4 where kobs s 1 is the measured rate constant for the reaction between the competitor and permanganate the second approximation assumes that the concentration of permanganate is much larger than the concentration of mc the typical permanganate dose in a drinking water treatment plant is 1 mg l 1 as the potassium salt 6 μm and in extreme bloom conditions the microcystin concentrations may be as high as 100 ppb 0 1 μm more typical bloom conditions are characterized by microcystin concentrations less than 10 ppb 0 01 μm thus this assumption is reasonable and will hold until the permanganate concentration is no longer 10 times greater than the microcystin concentration the rate expression for the degradation of microcystin mc 6 d m c d t k m n o 4 m c we can capture the time variation in permanganate concentration by substituting from the integrated form of equation 5 7 m n o 4 t m n o 4 o e k o b s t and then solving equation 6 to give the expected concentration of microcystin with respect to time 8 m c t m c 0 e k m n o 4 o e k o b s t k o b s 1 k o b s where mc 0 m is the initial microcystin concentration in the water and mno4 0 is the permanganate dose 3 4 permanganate cyanobacterial cell rate constant the interference by cyanobacterial cells was investigated by concentrating planktothrix cyanobacterial cells from grand lake saint mary s oh usa whole water steffen et al 2014b the amount of cyanobacteria was quantified by chlorophyll a chl a concentrations which we believe are a good proxy for the number of cells present and is a measure that could be readily available to treatment plant operators the concentrated solution of cyanobacterial cells was diluted in 5 mm ph 8 5 carbonate buffer so that an apparent second order rate constant could be measured a typical pseudo first order kinetic plot equation 3 is shown in fig 4 a good linearity was observed for all measurements r2 0 94 except the lowest chlorophyll a concentration due to the slow rate of reaction r2 0 69 no cell lysis was observed at permanganate concentrations of 2 3 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 as cell lysis would result in a rapid decrease in permanganate concentration due to an increase in available organic material the apparent second order rate constant plot fig 4b similarly showed good linearity r2 0 93 from this the apparent second order rate constant was determined to be 2 5 0 3 10 6 l μg chl a 1 s 1 therefore the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells can easily be predicted from equation 10 using chlorophyll a concentration measurements 9 k o b s 2 5 10 6 c h l a this value is representative for blooms of planktothrix but we believe it could be applied more broadly because cyanobacteria are gram negative and thus it is expected their cell membranes would react with permanganate similarly under high bloom conditions defined by the us epa as chl a concentrations 100 μg l 1 scavenging by cyanobacterial cells would only add 20 min to the treatment time needed to reduce mc lr from 50 ppb to 1 6 ppb overall this suggests that cyanobacterial cells are not efficient competitors for permanganate but the apparent rate constant presented here could be applied in dosing models as a safety factor 3 5 permanganate dom rate constant we attempted to use the dpd method to measure the permanganate dom apparent rate constant using filtered whole water samples when we compared our data with what the model derived in section 3 3 we saw that the general shape matched our data however two trends emerged fig 5 in all cases microcystin concentrations in real water samples decreased more slowly than what are predicted for high purity water dotted lines fig 5 under these ideal conditions the ohio epa regulatory trigger for microcystin 1 6 ppb 1 6 nm is easily reached within 40 min following permanganate addition dotted line fig 5 for seven of ten whole water samples reasonable agreement within 50 was obtained between our predicted concentrations and our measured concentrations fig 5a the remaining three samples showed poor agreement between predicted and measured microcystin concentrations the sample presented in fig 5b showed the largest discrepancy between our predicted and measured microcystin concentrations 84 difference at 40 min all whole water samples that showed disagreement between the predicted and measured microcystin concentrations were from algal impacted waters in fig 5b the permanganate microcystin reaction appears to stop after 15 min when additional permanganate was dosed in the reaction proceeded again but with a faster rate e g the rate of reaction between dom and permanganate was slower these observations suggest that in these samples dom rapidly consumed permanganate within 15 min this in turn suggests that our permanganate probe subject to interference in those samples which results in an overestimation of permanganate concentration and an underestimation in the permanganate dom reaction rate because expected interferents namely mn iii complexation to dom and manganese dioxide particles had carefully been evaluated during method development we believe this suggests a change in dom electrochemical properties laszakovits et al 2019 work to evaluate dom changes during permanganate oxidation is underway but is outside the scope of this paper in samples that consume permanganate rapidly it was observed that sequential dosing led to slower permanganate dom reaction rates and therefore faster permanganate microcystin reaction rates under extreme bloom conditions 10 ppb 10 nm microcystins we forward that sequential permanganate dosing could effectively remove microcystins in order to develop a robust rate constant for the dom permanganate reaction we chose to calculate a more representative apparent rate constant from the mc lr degradation data in filtered whole water samples using equation 8 fitting the data to equation 8 resulted in high correlation coefficients r2 0 95 and thus we believe our reported rate constants are representative of the competition for permanganate oxidation posed by dom the competition posed by dom is substantially larger than that posed by cyanobacterial cells under extreme bloom conditions 100 μg chl a l 1 and toc 7 mg c l 1 cyanobacterial cells would only add 20 min to the treatment time to reduce 50 ppb microcystin to 1 6 ppb dom however could completely inhibit reduction of microcystin to regulatory levels generally we found that the effective permanganate loss to dom rate constant depended on total organic carbon fig 6 a this was expected based on kinetic theory as the concentration of one reactant in a bimolecular reaction is increased the rate of reaction similarly will increase however there is a large amount of scatter in the data which suggests that other characteristics of dom are important it should be noted that there is a clear separation in toc for samples from algal impacted water and terrestrial sources in order to compare between effective permanganate dom rate constants we normalized to organic carbon concentration using total organic carbon toc measurements equation 10 10 k o b s o c k o b s t o c to investigate the scatter in observed rate constants with toc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 was analyzed suva 254 is defined as the absorbance of a water sample at 254 nm divided by the total organic carbon concentration suva 254 is commonly used in drinking water treatment models for processes such as coagulation and disinfection byproduct formation edwards 1997 hua et al 2015 suva 254 is known to correlate directly with dom aromaticity and electron donating capacity sharpless et al 2014a weishaar et al 2003 thus it was expected that as suva 254 increases meaning the electron donating capacity increases so too would the permanganate dom reaction rate as expected there was a statistically significant trend between carbon normalized permanganate reactivity and suva 254 r2 0 72 fig 6b this relationship can be described by equation 11 11 k o b s o c 1 7 0 4 10 4 s u v a 254 2 2 1 10 4 another dom characterization parameter we used is the e2 e3 ratio the e2 e3 ratio is simply the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the absorbance at 365 nm this parameter is not currently used by plant operators but could easily be obtained from the absorption spectrum of a filtered water sample it is known that e2 e3 is inversely correlated with electron donating capacity sharpless et al 2014b it is unique in that it appears to take into account other water quality parameters such as ionic strength and ph that can affect dom s reactivity dalrymple et al 2010 it was anticipated that as the e2 e3 ratio decreases meaning the electron donating capacity increases the organic carbon normalized permanganate reaction rates with dom would increase because dom would be able to more readily donate electrons to permanganate when the carbon normalized rate constant is plotted against the e2 e3 ratio for ten whole water samples similar to suva 254 we find a statistically significant trend r2 0 56 that can be described by equation 12 and applies regardless of dom source type fig 6c 12 k o b s o c 1 4 0 4 10 4 e 2 e 3 1 1 0 3 10 3 3 6 modeling mc lr degradation in raw water to validate that there was no interference with the dpd method when determining the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and cyanobacterial cells we spiked raw water samples with mc lr and predicted the rate of oxidation by permanganate for these analysis we used three different water samples one from a healthy lake fig 7 a one from a location early in the bloom season fig 7b and one from a lake experiencing a severe bloom fig 7c these algal blooms were dominated by planktothrix and thus equation 9 is directly applicable we used the calculated dom rate constant from mc lr experiments conducted in the filtered whole water and predicted the observed rate constant for scavenging due to cyanobacterial cells using measured chlorophyll a concentrations equation 9 to predict the microcystin lr degradation equation 8 where kobs is found according to equation 13 13 k o b s k o b s d o m k o b s c y a n o where kobs dom s 1 is the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by dom and kobs cyano s 1 is the observed rate constant for permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells we find that using the rate constant determined previously equation 13 reasonably predicts the observed mc lr degradation to within 10 for the algal impacted samples fig 7 experimental purple dots v predicted 1 solid black line based on this we can conclude that our permanganate scavenging by cyanobacterial cells rate constant is reliable and could be incorporated into dosing protocols as a safety factor during blooms to illustrate how the e2 e3 ratio could be used by treatment plant operators and to test how well our rate constant expressions equations 9 10 and 12 can predict microcystin degradation in raw water samples we applied the same kinetic model as described previously equation 8 using predicted dom scavenging rate constants equations 10 and 12 and predicted cyanobacterial cells scavenging rate constant equation 9 we find good agreement between the measured mc lr concentrations and the predicted concentrations fig 7 experimental purple dots v predicted 2 dotted red line errors were within 20 which we believe is reasonable for a model built on easily measured parameters again the predicted mc lr loss in high purity water blue dashed line is plotted for each water sample to emphasize that without considering the competition posed by dom and cyanobacterial cells remaining microcystin concentrations will be largely underestimated in light of this we forward that the kinetic rate constants for permanganate scavenging by natural competitors should be incorporated into dosing protocols 4 conclusions the work presented here shows that permanganate can efficiently remove microcystins on a treatment relevant time scale but should not be considered for the treatment of saxitoxin or cylindrospermopsin alternative treatment strategies for saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin should be assessed the rate constant for the reaction between permanganate and microcystins depends only on temperature not ph or alkalinity and can therefore be reliably predicted by the arrhenius equation cyanobacterial cells do not pose significant competition for permanganate but dom does for most bloom conditions potassium permanganate treatment 1 mg l 1 alone will be sufficient to reduce microcystin concentrations around 10 ppb below state regulated standards 1 6 ppb funding sources funding was provided by the ohio
