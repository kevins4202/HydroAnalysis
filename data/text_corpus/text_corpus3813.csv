jiang 2018 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes were employed for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater owing to its high rejection rate but the high operating pressure caused great

2018 anastopoulos et al 2017 with low operation pressure uf and mf pressure adm turns out to have an excellent separation efficiency even for the low concentration pollutant on the other hand the adsorption behavior abates the direct contact among pollutants and membrane surface and membrane fouling degree therefore in comparison with conventional membrane process adm has more advantages in operation cost equipment requirements process management and fouling control ma et al 2018 wang et al 2015 lin et al 2018 however during its long term process the pollutants gradually accumulate into the adsorption materials until they reached absorption saturation then it became inactive after its inactivation pollutants removal and membrane filtration efficiency decline thereby the absorption saturation restricts the long term stability and practicability of adm and how to achieve the regeneration of absorption and separation capacity becomes an indispensable issue in addition to adsorption enzyme catalysis is another direction for functionalization modified membrane with cnts and laccases via covalent bonding for organic pollutant degradation and the removal rate for five

membrane was highly efficient for pollutant removal in that enzymes were able to degrade pollutant in situ and online however during its long term operation process the inactivation of enzymes and the

thus it was difficult to achieve cyclical regeneration an efficient regeneration method was significant to enhance the practicability of enzyme catalyzed membrane in order to solve the regeneration problem of adm the enzymes can be immobilized into the adsorption layer thus a biomimetic dynamic membrane bdm comes into being in bdm the biomimetic layer containing adsorption materials and enzymes

al 2017 2 2 bdm fabrication before fabrication membrane was installed in the membrane module and cleaned by filtering with deionized water two methods stepwise fabrication and mixed fabrication were conducted to fabricate bdm cnts and laccase weighed by a balance were suspended in 100 ml of deionized water respectively then the cnt suspension was dispersed by sonication for 30 min using a water bath sonicator aquasonic 250ht for the stepwise fabrication the cnt dispersion suspension was firstly filtered in the membrane module until cnts were loaded on membrane surface completely after that the laccase dispersion was filtered forming the bionic layer on the cnt layer with respect to the mixed fabrication cnts and laccases suspension were mixed by stirring rod in the membrane module for 10 min eventually loaded onto a virgin membrane by filtering through the membrane thus adding a bionic layer onto the membrane surface afterwards membrane was filtered through deionized water until the permeate flux remained steady at 0 5 bar thus the cnts and laccases were loaded and adsorbed on membrane stably while bdm was fabricated 2 3 dye wastewater treatment the bdm was deployed to treat the dye wastewater all the tests were conducted at room temperature of 25 c before testing the pure water flux of bdm was measured at 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 bar to calculate water permeability lp subsequently the tests were carried out with various feed dye concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 mg l 1 cnt 10 20 30 40 50 g m 2 and laccase 18 6 37 3 74 6 111 9 149 3 g m 2 loading amounts agitation speeds 0 300 rpm and tmps 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 bar a virgin membrane or a new bdm was employed for each test the feed volume of test was 50 ml and the permeate volume was 48 5 ml the permeate flux was recorded with time and all feed solution was filtered each 10 ml of permeate was obtained for water quality analysis backwash cleaning process was implemented to remove the inactive bdm and refabricate a new one the inactive bdm was inverted to be installed in the membrane module and filtered with deionized water for 2 min at 300 rpm then it was used to fabricate a new bdm 2 4 analytical items and membrane characterization dye concentration in permeate was determined by uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 usa for the membranes before and after the test their morphology was inspected via sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan atr ftir 660 ir varian australia and afm xe 100 park system korea in addition the laccase activity reflecting the catalytic ability of enzymes to certain chemical reactions was evaluated by monitoring the oxidation rate of abts to abts at 420 nm via a cary100 uv visible spectrophotometer ji et al 2016a b a piece of bdm sample 2 cm2 was added in 20 ml abts solution 0 5 mm the laccase activity was defined as the amount of abts converted abts per minute and the unit was μmol min u 2 5 calculated parameters the rejection r is calculated by the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp represent the dye concentration in feed and permeate mean value during filtration process respectively the permeate flux lp is calculated as 2 l p v p t a m where vp is the volume of permeate t is the filtration time and am is the effective membrane area permeability recovery is defined by a comparison with the average water permeability for cleaned and virgin membranes 3 permeability recovery l p c l p v 100 where lpc and lpv are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of cleaned and virgin membranes respectively 2 7 data analysis all tests were repeated at least three times the errors were controlled below 5 and average values were calculated and demonstrated in the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 the bdm fabrication methods the fabrication method of bdm exerted a significant effect upon the bdm structure filtration resistance and catalysis efficiency the fluxes and removal rates of adm and bdms fabricated by mixed filtration or stepwise filtration were illustrated in fig 1 at the first two cycles the flux witnessed the following increasing order bdm mixed filtration bdm stepwise filtration adm whereas for the remaining cycles adm bdm stepwise filtration bdm mixed filtration at the beginning the foulants dyes with low concentration imposed a limiting impact on permeability but with filtration continuation the foulant concentration raised enhancing concentration polarization for bdm and adm the adsorption and enzymatic degradation were able to degrade dyes and lessened the deposition of dyes on membrane and concentration polarization besides compared with bdm adm presented a higher flux for the first two cycles but lower flux for the remaining cycles although the cnts in adm without absorbing laccases possessed higher adsorption capacity for dyes at first with the ascendance of dye amount a part of foulants were not adsorbed and deposited on membrane on account of the adsorption saturation in comparison with the mixed filtration the flux of stepwise filtration became higher at first then diminished more dramatically and was below that of mixed filtration along with filtration continuation the products accumulated on cnt layer and mixed with laccases lowering the enzyme activity and reaction rate thus the fouling resistance considerably elevated in mixed filtration laccases were mixed with cnts evenly reinforcing the laccase bioactivity lonappan et al 2018a b expanding the contact area for cnts and laccases and forming a loose bionic layer with high filtration resistance besides laccases were immobilized in cnts completely then laccases kept the activity and degraded more dyes whereas cnts could absorb the products in time hence the bdm fabricated by mixed filtration performed a better capacity for the degradation of foulants as shown in fig 1 the removal rates for bdm mixed filtration and bdm stepwise filtration were above 90 and 70 respectively while that of adm exceeded 50 bdm exerted a synergistic effect upon membrane separation adsorption and enzyme catalysis for dye removal while the cnt absorption capacity could be extended thus its treatment efficiency was much higher than others on account of dual synergistic effect of adsorption and membrane separation adm was higher than virgin membrane which only possessed a membrane separation effect wang et al 2016 xu et al 2015 as for two bdms the mixed filtration exhibited a clearly stronger removal rate than stepwise filtration because higher and more stable enzyme activity was obtained at a more uniform distribution structure for laccases and cnts lonappan et al 2018a b reinforcing dye degradation moreover as mentioned above the products of mixed filtration were easily removed thereby mixed filtration could be utilized to fabricate an efficient and stable bdm and selected for the following tests 3 2 performance for bdm during filtration with various operation parameters the operation parameters played a significant role on the bdm performance the effect of dye concentration cnt and laccase loading amounts tmp and shear stress agitation speed was investigated 3 2 1 effect of cnt loading amounts the effects of cnt loading amounts on flux and removal rate were displayed in fig 2 both adm and bdm suffered a plunge with cnt loading amounts in varying degree indicating higher filtration resistance produced by more cnt loading amounts but they changed in distinct ways the flux of bdm dropped slightly and tended to keep a steady state when the cnt loading amounts exceeded 20 g m 2 but for adm flux kept a decreasing trend for bdm the addition of laccases could widen the internal space and permeable structure shrinking the compactness between cnts besides foulants dyes could be removed by the synergistic effects of adsorption and catalysis degradation on line thus its antifouling capacity proved to be better taheran et al 2017 however for adm the flux always declined since the porous structure got compact and blocked by more cnts and the fouling layer composed of dye deposition became thicker which kept decreasing permeate flux as depicted in fig 2 bdm always performed greater removal efficiency than adm firstly in general the increasing cnt concentration strengthened the absorption efficiency and separation capacity for dynamic absorption layer secondly the laccases immobilized by cnts could degrade dyes adsorbed in cnts thus adsorption saturation may be alleviated to a certain extent and adsorption capacity was regenerated in situ and online thirdly for bdm the removal rate only witnessed a slight increment below 3 when the cnt loading amounts elevated from 20 to 50 g m 2 demonstrating that enzymatic degradation could decrease the burden of adsorption cnt consumption and its ecological risk as a result 20 g m 2 cnt could become the optimal loading amount 3 2 2 effect of laccase loading amounts the effect of laccase loading amounts on flux and removal rate was illustrated in fig 3 a the flux of bdm dropped drastically with laccase loading amounts because when adding more amounts of laccase continuously a dense layer was formed on the bionic layer surface and the cnt pore size narrowed over the same period flux also abated along the increase of cycles as the pore size of bionic layer became compact with filtration continuation hou et al 2014 and laccase layer thickness raised ji et al 2016a b furthermore the laccase activity became latent when laccase loading amounts exceeded 74 6 g m 2 which was against the foulants removal as for the removal rate at low laccase loading amount 18 6 g m 2 the removal efficiency suffered a dramatic decline with the augmentation of cycle times since the laccase activity began to inactivate after several cycle times and cnt tended to reach the absorption saturation on the other hand small laccase loading amounts meant low enzyme activity fig 3 b and the bionic layer was looser thus for laccases a longer contact time was needed to react with dyes and dyes could easily pass through the membrane but for high laccase loading amount 37 3 149 3 g m 2 only at 3 5 cycle times the removal rate showed a visible decrease therefore more laccases demonstrated a better sustainable capacity because the increasing laccase amounts promoted the catalytic degradation efficiency besides as shown in fig 3 b the excessive laccases amount higher than 74 6 g m 2 was not conducive to vitalize the laccase activity and mass transfer efficiency ji et al 2016a b thus in consideration of consumption reducing ecological risk and membrane resistance an optimized value of 74 6 g m 2 laccase loading amount was selected for the following tests 3 2 3 effect of dye concentration the effect of dye concentration on flux and removal rate was presented at fig 4 these three membranes showed the similar downtrend for flux but virgin membrane was still clearly stronger than adm and bdm for virgin membrane without functional layer and its lowest filtration resistance on account of the addition of laccase bdm possessed a better fouling layer and smaller flux than adm moreover with the elevation of dye concentration more foulants entered the adsorption layer of adm and bionic layer of bdm while more serious concentration polarization occurred thereby flux declined with dye concentration when it comes to removal rate undoubtedly virgin membrane exhibited a lowest value which was below 20 at 25 mg l 1 dye concentration because higher dye concentration brought about stronger diffusion driving force bdm presented the best removal rate above 90 since bionic layer reduced the dye concentration by the synergy effect of adsorption and catalysis with respect to adm after more dyes were adsorbed the adsorption capacity of cnt layer weakened thus dye could easily pass through the loose fouling layer and membrane cutting down the removal rate generally bdm was able to effectively treat dye wastewater with various concentrations 3 2 4 effect of shear stress shear stress generated by agitation speed could strengthen gradually zhu et al 2018 forming great turbulent hydraulic conditions which mitigated membrane fouling as displayed in fig 5 when agitation speed accelerated from 100 to 300 rpm shear stress raised from 0 01 to 0 16 pa and the fluxes for virgin membrane adm and bdm apparently intensified during this process the concentration polarization was alleviated meanwhile pores blocking cake layer and fouling resistance diminished above 200 rpm the growth rate of flux for virgin membrane and adm slowed down and kept steady whereas the flux of bdm still dramatically amounted because excessive shear stress might destroy the bionic layer of bdm and weakened its filtration resistance zhang et al 2018 leading to cnts and laccases away from membrane surface and returning to the bulk solution as shown in fig 5 the removal rate for adm accelerated with agitation speed on account of the enhancement of mass transfer koutsou and karabelas 2012 especially at high shear stress removal rate slightly reduced because some cnts returned to bulk solution with high shear stress diminishing the immobilization behavior of laccases and its enzymatic activity although high shear stress was able to significantly improve flux in order to keep the stability of bionic layer and removal rate the optimal range of agitation speed should be below 200 rpm 3 2 5 effect of tmp as displayed at fig 6 fluxes for three membranes linearly increased this linear trend indicated that operating at low tmp bdm performed a low fouling potential behavior while bdm showed a great potential for improving flux by elevating tmp because the flux had not reached the critical flux yet zhang et al 2016a b lewis et al 2017 as for removal rate bdm was above 92 5 implying that bdm had an excellent pollutant removal regardless of tmp changes due to the more reasonable structure and catalytic effect of bionic layer moreover the flux also affected removal rate zhang et al 2015 for low flux increasing flux resulted in more water in permeate producing a dilute effect and reducing dye concentration in permeate with respect to high flux greater flux caused by higher tmp indicated that more dyes gathered on membrane he et al 2017 enhancing the concentration gradient between dye solution and permeate thus more dye passed through membranes in addition the contact time between dyes and bionic layer became shorter lessening the adsorption efficiency nevertheless for bdm coated laccase could optimize bdm structure for catalysis and permeability therefore the bdm always kept favorable removal rate 3 3 membrane reusability the bdm reusability was assessed by the various cycle times test fig 7 a the fluxes obviously plunged as the cycle times and then tended to be steady after five cycles indicating that these three membranes kept stable after a certain number of reuses the flux declines for virgin membrane adm and bdm were about 43 30 and 14 respectively at 7th cycle test the removal rate was still higher than 75 it is obviously that bdm possessed a higher anti fouling capacity and removal ability at the long term test therefore bdm exhibited a remarkable reusability and sustainability as shown in fig 7 b at the first four cycles the absorption effect of cnt dominated in the filtration process whereas the enzymatic effect of laccase could take effect evidently demonstrating that dye was preliminarily adsorbed by cnt and rejected by membrane then degraded by laccase as the cycles increased the enzymatic effect became increasingly significant but the absorption and membrane rejection effect gradually attenuated on account of the absorption saturation 3 4 backwash cleaning backwash cleaning as an effective membrane cleaning strategy drews 2010 was expected to remove the inactivated bionic layer and fabricate the new one fig 8 displayed the virgin membrane a bdm b and adm c and backwashed membrane for bdm d and adm e visibly the bionic layer b was similar to the cnt layer c in appearance which was compact and black moreover the laccases were distributed in the layer and could not be found on the membrane surface indicating that the laccase immobilization was without clear protein fouling after backwash both bionic layer and pure cnt layer on membrane surface could be cleanly flushed only a thin dye layer remained on the membrane because some dyes permeate through the bionic layer or pure cnt layer but they were rejected by membrane besides after backwash cleaning the color of adm e was deeper than that of bdm d indicating that laccase could effectively eradicate the fouled layer thereby backwash could be adopted to rapidly refabricate the new bionic layer on membrane as shown in fig 9 the flux and removal rate of all membranes conspicuously diminished and tended to be stable after 5 backwash cleaning times indicating that absorption saturation enzyme inactivation and membrane fouling gradually took place during long term operation process after 7 backwash cleaning cycles the flux and removal rate remained stable at 107 73 l m 2 h 1 and 52 63 respectively more membrane chemical cleaning methods were needed to recover the permeability and pollutant removal ability generally speaking backwash could effectively remove the inactive bionic layer but was not able to regenerate pollutant removal ability and anti fouling capacity 3 5 characterization of membrane surface morphology and properties 3 5 1 membrane surface morphology fig 10 displayed that the morphology of bdm with various ratios of laccase and cnt at low ratios of laccase and cnt both the bionic layer and pure laccase layer illustrated a structure of homogeneous porous in bionic layer laccase was regard as a core and cnt was adhered all around it by strings indicating that the laccase could be firmly immobilized by cnts which reinforced its bioactivity with laccase loading amount rose more cnts gathered around this spherical laccase while the membrane surface was coated double layers the upper one was superfluous laccase and the down one was the bionic layer composed of cnt and laccase besides the pure laccase layer was getting thicker and tighter along with laccase loading amount enhancing the dye rejection in addition on account of the uncertain hazard of cnts for human body and ecological environment the cnt amount should be controlled at a suitable range 3 5 2 the contact angle and hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of bdm was measured by testing the water contact angle as demonstrated in table 2 the contact angle area of virgin membrane is 83 35 subsequently with the expansion of bionic layer water contact of bdm reduced to 49 9 since cnts were more hydrophilic than membrane lalia et al 2017 additionally the surface oxygen groups on cnts such as cooh and oh may also account for the intensification of hydrophilicity in other words this also proved that bdm manifested a better anti fouling capacity than that of virgin membrane 3 5 3 analysis of membrane foulants fig 11 showed the ftir spectrograms of virgin membrane bdm and fouled bdm for all bdms they were characterized by similar peak values 717 cm 1 c h 1484 1657 cm 1 c c 2848 2913 cm 1 c h implying that cnt and laccase had been stably immobilized on membrane compared with virgin membrane bdm with smaller peaks of carbon containing group 717 cm 1 c h 1484 1657 cm 1 c c 1103 1238 cm 1 c o manifested a higher hydrophilicity consistent with the analysis aforementioned above in addition after dye wastewater treatment few pollutants or foulants remained in bdm on account of the similar characteristic peak value with virgin membrane this testified that bdm conducted a magnificent performance for pollutant degradation and antifouling 3 6 mini discussion during the backwash and re fabrication process of bdm the loss cnts laccase is perceived as inevitable as a matter of fact every water treatment technology consumes materials or chemicals or energy for membrane technology membrane cleaning process also requires additional operation cost compared with other nf ro bdm engages itself in much smaller operation pressure and lower equipment requirement in comparison with mf uf bdm exhibits a much higher pollution removal rate apart from that advantage it also performs lower membrane fouling potential behavior thereby bdm would like to resort to the operation pressure of mf uf to achieve the high rejection efficiency of nf ro for the advanced treatment of wastewater from this perspective the costs may be economical the future study will estimate the economic feasibility of bdm and optimize the sustainability of bionic layer for better economic and application prospects 4 conclusion in this work bdm fabricated by physical adsorption and mixed filtration of cnts laccases was adopted for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater with the synergism effect of enzymatic degradation adsorption and membrane separation bdm exhibited a satisfying dye removal rate and high anti fouling capacity furthermore the optimized operation parameters were obtained 20 g m 2 cnt and 74 6 g m 2 of laccase amounts 100 rpm of agitation speed and 1 0 bar of tmp besides the backwash could be employed to eradicate the inactive bionic layer and refabricate a new bdm based on the results above it can be safely concluded that bdm proves itself as a promising functional membrane material for

the dye wastewater all the tests were conducted at room temperature of 25 c before testing the pure water flux of bdm was measured at 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 0 and 1 0 bar to calculate water permeability lp subsequently the tests were carried out with various feed dye concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 mg l 1 cnt 10 20 30 40 50 g m 2 and laccase 18 6 37 3 74 6 111 9 149 3 g m 2 loading amounts agitation speeds 0 300 rpm and tmps 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 bar a virgin membrane or a new bdm was employed for each test the feed volume of test was 50 ml and the permeate volume was 48 5 ml the permeate flux was recorded with time and all feed solution was filtered each 10 ml of permeate was obtained for water quality analysis backwash cleaning process was implemented to remove the inactive bdm and refabricate a new one the inactive bdm was inverted to be installed in the membrane module and filtered with deionized water for 2 min at 300 rpm then it was used to fabricate a new bdm 2 4 analytical items and membrane characterization dye concentration in permeate was determined by uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 35 usa for the membranes before and after the test their morphology was inspected via sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan atr ftir 660 ir varian australia and afm xe 100 park system korea in addition the laccase activity reflecting the catalytic ability of enzymes to certain chemical reactions was evaluated by monitoring the oxidation rate of abts to abts at 420 nm via a cary100 uv visible spectrophotometer ji et al 2016a b a piece of bdm sample 2 cm2 was added in 20 ml abts solution 0 5 mm the laccase activity was defined as the amount of abts converted abts per minute and the unit was μmol min u 2 5 calculated parameters the rejection r is calculated by the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp represent the dye concentration in feed and permeate mean value during filtration process respectively the permeate flux lp is calculated as 2 l p

cleaned and virgin membranes 3 permeability recovery l p c l p v 100 where lpc and lpv are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of cleaned and virgin membranes respectively 2 7 data analysis all tests were repeated at least three times the errors were controlled below 5 and average values were calculated and demonstrated in the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 the bdm fabrication methods the fabrication method of bdm exerted a significant effect upon the bdm structure filtration resistance and catalysis efficiency the fluxes and removal rates of adm and bdms fabricated by mixed filtration or stepwise filtration were illustrated in fig 1 at the first two cycles the flux witnessed the following increasing order bdm mixed filtration bdm stepwise filtration adm whereas for the remaining cycles adm bdm stepwise filtration bdm mixed filtration at the beginning the foulants dyes with low concentration imposed a limiting impact on permeability but with filtration continuation the foulant concentration raised enhancing concentration polarization for bdm and adm the adsorption and enzymatic degradation were able to degrade dyes and lessened the deposition of dyes on membrane and concentration polarization besides compared with bdm adm presented a higher flux for the first two cycles but lower flux for the remaining cycles although the cnts in adm without absorbing laccases possessed higher adsorption capacity for dyes at first with the ascendance of dye amount a part of foulants were not adsorbed and deposited on membrane on account of the adsorption saturation in comparison with the mixed filtration the flux of stepwise filtration became higher at first then diminished more dramatically and was below that of mixed filtration along with filtration continuation the products accumulated on cnt layer and mixed with laccases lowering the enzyme activity and reaction rate thus the fouling resistance considerably elevated in mixed filtration laccases were mixed with cnts evenly reinforcing the laccase bioactivity lonappan et al 2018a b expanding the contact area for cnts and laccases and forming a loose bionic layer with high filtration resistance besides laccases were immobilized in cnts completely then laccases kept the activity and degraded more dyes whereas cnts could absorb the products in time hence the bdm fabricated by mixed filtration performed a better capacity for the degradation of foulants as shown in fig 1 the removal rates for bdm mixed filtration and bdm stepwise filtration were above 90 and 70 respectively while that of adm exceeded 50 bdm exerted a synergistic effect upon membrane separation adsorption and enzyme catalysis for dye removal while the cnt absorption capacity could be extended thus its treatment efficiency was much higher than others on account of dual synergistic effect of adsorption and membrane separation adm was higher than virgin membrane which only possessed a membrane separation effect wang et al 2016 xu et al 2015 as for two bdms the mixed filtration exhibited a clearly stronger removal rate than stepwise filtration because higher and more stable enzyme activity was obtained at a more uniform distribution structure for laccases and cnts lonappan et al 2018a b reinforcing dye degradation moreover as mentioned above the products of mixed filtration were easily removed thereby mixed filtration could be utilized to fabricate an efficient and stable bdm and selected for the following tests 3 2 performance for bdm during filtration with various operation parameters the operation parameters played a significant role on the bdm performance the effect of dye concentration cnt and laccase loading amounts tmp and shear stress agitation speed was investigated 3 2 1 effect of cnt loading amounts the effects of cnt loading amounts on flux and removal rate were displayed in fig 2 both adm and bdm suffered a plunge with cnt loading amounts in varying degree indicating higher filtration resistance produced by more cnt loading amounts but they changed in distinct ways the flux of bdm dropped slightly and tended to keep a steady state when the cnt loading amounts exceeded 20 g m 2 but for adm flux kept a decreasing trend for bdm the addition of laccases could widen the internal space and permeable structure shrinking the compactness between cnts besides foulants dyes could be removed by the synergistic effects of adsorption and catalysis degradation on line thus its antifouling capacity proved to be better taheran et al 2017 however for adm the flux always declined since the porous structure got compact and blocked by more cnts and the fouling layer composed of dye deposition became thicker which kept decreasing permeate flux as depicted in fig 2 bdm always performed greater removal efficiency than adm firstly in general the increasing cnt concentration strengthened the absorption efficiency and separation capacity for dynamic absorption layer secondly the laccases immobilized by cnts could degrade dyes adsorbed in cnts thus adsorption saturation may be alleviated to a certain extent and adsorption capacity was regenerated in situ and online thirdly for bdm the removal rate only witnessed a slight increment below 3 when the cnt loading amounts elevated from 20 to 50 g m 2 demonstrating that enzymatic degradation could decrease the burden of adsorption cnt consumption and its ecological risk as a result 20 g m 2 cnt could become the optimal loading amount 3 2 2 effect of laccase loading amounts the effect of laccase loading amounts on flux and removal rate was illustrated in fig 3 a the flux of bdm dropped drastically with laccase loading amounts because when adding more amounts of laccase continuously a dense layer was formed on the bionic layer surface and the cnt pore size narrowed over the same period flux also abated along the increase of cycles as the pore size of bionic layer became compact with filtration continuation hou et al 2014 and laccase layer thickness raised ji et al 2016a b furthermore the laccase activity became latent when laccase loading amounts exceeded 74 6 g m 2 which was against the foulants removal as for the removal rate at low laccase loading amount 18 6 g m 2 the removal efficiency suffered a dramatic decline with the augmentation of cycle times since the laccase activity began to inactivate after several cycle times and cnt tended to reach the absorption saturation on the other hand small laccase loading amounts meant low enzyme activity fig 3 b and the bionic layer was looser thus for laccases a longer contact time was needed to react with dyes and dyes could easily pass through the membrane but for high laccase loading amount 37 3 149 3 g m 2 only at 3 5 cycle times the removal rate showed a visible decrease therefore more laccases demonstrated a better sustainable capacity because the increasing laccase amounts promoted the catalytic degradation efficiency besides as shown in fig 3 b the excessive laccases amount higher than 74 6 g m 2 was not conducive to vitalize the laccase activity and mass transfer efficiency ji et al 2016a b thus in consideration of consumption reducing ecological risk and membrane resistance an optimized value of 74 6 g m 2 laccase loading amount was selected for the following tests 3 2 3 effect of dye concentration the effect of dye concentration on flux and removal rate was presented at fig 4 these three membranes showed the similar downtrend for flux but virgin membrane was still clearly stronger than adm and bdm for virgin membrane without functional layer and its lowest filtration resistance on account of the addition of laccase bdm possessed a better fouling layer and smaller flux than adm moreover with the elevation of dye concentration more foulants entered the adsorption layer of adm and bionic layer of bdm while more serious concentration polarization occurred thereby flux declined with dye concentration when it comes to removal rate undoubtedly virgin membrane exhibited a lowest value which was below 20 at 25 mg l 1 dye concentration because higher dye concentration brought about stronger diffusion driving force bdm presented the best removal rate above 90 since bionic layer reduced the dye concentration by the synergy effect of adsorption and catalysis with respect to adm after more dyes were adsorbed the adsorption capacity of cnt layer weakened thus dye could easily pass through the loose fouling layer and membrane cutting down the removal rate generally bdm was able to effectively treat dye wastewater with various concentrations 3 2 4 effect of shear stress shear stress generated by agitation speed could strengthen gradually zhu et al 2018 forming great turbulent hydraulic conditions which mitigated membrane fouling as displayed in fig 5 when agitation speed accelerated from 100 to 300 rpm shear stress raised from 0 01 to 0 16 pa and the fluxes for virgin membrane adm and bdm apparently intensified during this process the concentration polarization was alleviated meanwhile pores blocking cake layer and fouling resistance diminished above 200 rpm the growth rate of flux for virgin membrane and adm slowed down and kept steady whereas the flux of bdm still dramatically amounted because excessive shear stress might destroy the bionic layer of bdm and weakened its filtration resistance zhang et al 2018 leading to cnts and laccases away from membrane surface and returning to the bulk solution as shown in fig 5 the removal rate for adm accelerated with agitation speed on account of the enhancement of mass transfer koutsou and karabelas 2012 especially at high shear stress removal rate slightly reduced because some cnts returned to bulk solution with high shear stress diminishing the immobilization behavior of laccases and its enzymatic activity although high shear stress was able to significantly improve flux in order to keep the stability of bionic layer and removal rate the optimal range of agitation speed should be below 200 rpm 3 2 5 effect of tmp as displayed at fig 6 fluxes for three membranes linearly increased this linear trend indicated that operating at low tmp bdm performed a low fouling potential behavior while bdm showed a great potential for improving flux by elevating tmp because the flux had not reached the critical flux yet zhang et al 2016a b lewis et al 2017 as for removal rate bdm was above 92 5 implying that bdm had an excellent pollutant removal regardless of tmp changes due to the more reasonable structure and catalytic effect of bionic layer moreover the flux also affected removal rate zhang et al 2015 for low flux increasing flux resulted in more water in permeate producing a dilute effect and reducing dye concentration in permeate with respect to high flux greater flux caused by higher tmp indicated that more dyes gathered on membrane he et al 2017 enhancing the concentration gradient between dye solution and permeate thus more dye passed through membranes in addition the contact time between dyes and bionic layer became shorter lessening the adsorption efficiency nevertheless for bdm coated laccase could optimize bdm structure for catalysis and permeability therefore the bdm always kept favorable removal rate 3 3 membrane reusability the bdm reusability was assessed by the various cycle times test fig 7 a the fluxes obviously plunged as the cycle times and then tended to be steady after five cycles indicating that these three membranes kept stable after a certain number of reuses the flux declines for virgin membrane adm and bdm were about 43 30 and 14 respectively at 7th cycle test the removal rate was still higher than 75 it is obviously that bdm possessed a higher anti fouling capacity and removal ability at the long term test therefore bdm exhibited a remarkable reusability and sustainability as shown in fig 7 b at the first four cycles the absorption effect of cnt dominated in the filtration process whereas the enzymatic effect of laccase could take effect evidently demonstrating that dye was preliminarily adsorbed by cnt and rejected by membrane then degraded by laccase as the cycles increased the enzymatic effect became increasingly significant but the absorption and membrane rejection effect gradually attenuated on account of the absorption saturation 3 4 backwash cleaning backwash cleaning as an effective membrane cleaning strategy drews 2010 was expected to remove the inactivated bionic layer and fabricate the new one fig 8 displayed the virgin membrane a bdm b and adm c and backwashed membrane for bdm d and adm e visibly the bionic layer b was similar to the cnt layer c in appearance which was compact and black moreover the laccases were distributed in the layer and could not be found on the membrane surface indicating that the laccase immobilization was without clear protein fouling after backwash both bionic layer and pure cnt layer on membrane surface could be cleanly flushed only a thin dye layer remained on the membrane because some dyes permeate through the bionic layer or pure cnt layer but they were rejected by membrane besides after backwash cleaning the color of adm e was deeper than that of bdm d indicating that laccase could effectively eradicate the fouled layer thereby backwash could be adopted to rapidly refabricate the new bionic layer on membrane as shown in fig 9 the flux and removal rate of all membranes conspicuously diminished and tended to be stable after 5 backwash cleaning times indicating that absorption saturation enzyme inactivation and membrane fouling gradually took place during long term operation process after 7 backwash cleaning cycles the flux and removal rate remained stable at 107 73 l m 2 h 1 and 52 63 respectively more membrane chemical cleaning methods were needed to recover the permeability and pollutant removal ability generally speaking backwash could effectively remove the inactive bionic layer but was not able to regenerate pollutant removal ability and anti fouling capacity 3 5 characterization of membrane surface morphology and properties 3 5 1 membrane surface morphology fig 10 displayed that the morphology of bdm with various ratios of laccase and cnt at low ratios of laccase and cnt both the bionic layer and pure laccase layer illustrated a structure of homogeneous porous in bionic layer laccase was regard as a core and cnt was adhered all around it by strings indicating that the laccase could be firmly immobilized by cnts which reinforced its bioactivity with laccase loading amount rose more cnts gathered around this spherical laccase while the membrane surface was coated double layers the upper one was superfluous laccase and the down one was the bionic layer composed of cnt and laccase besides the pure laccase layer was getting thicker and tighter along with laccase loading amount enhancing the dye rejection in addition on account of the uncertain hazard of cnts for human body and ecological environment the cnt amount should be controlled at a suitable range 3 5 2 the contact angle and hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of bdm was measured by testing the water contact angle as demonstrated in table 2 the contact angle area of virgin membrane is 83 35 subsequently with the expansion of bionic layer water contact of bdm reduced to 49 9 since cnts were more hydrophilic than membrane lalia et al 2017 additionally the surface oxygen groups on cnts such as cooh and oh may also account for the intensification of hydrophilicity in other words this also proved that bdm manifested a better anti fouling capacity than that of virgin membrane 3 5 3 analysis of membrane foulants fig 11 showed the ftir spectrograms of virgin membrane bdm and fouled bdm for all bdms they were characterized by similar peak values 717 cm 1 c h 1484 1657 cm 1 c c 2848 2913 cm 1 c h implying that cnt and laccase had been stably immobilized on membrane compared with virgin membrane bdm with smaller peaks of carbon containing group 717 cm 1 c h 1484 1657 cm 1 c c 1103 1238 cm 1 c o manifested a higher hydrophilicity consistent with the analysis aforementioned above in addition after dye wastewater treatment few pollutants or foulants remained in bdm on account of the similar characteristic peak value with virgin membrane this testified that bdm conducted a magnificent performance for pollutant degradation and antifouling 3 6 mini discussion during the backwash and re fabrication process of bdm the loss cnts laccase is perceived as inevitable as a matter of fact every water treatment technology consumes materials or chemicals or energy for membrane technology membrane cleaning process also requires additional operation cost compared with other nf ro bdm engages itself in much smaller operation pressure and lower equipment requirement in comparison with mf uf bdm exhibits a much higher pollution removal rate apart from that advantage it also performs lower membrane fouling potential behavior thereby bdm would like to resort to the operation pressure of mf uf to achieve the high rejection efficiency of nf ro for the advanced treatment of wastewater from this perspective the costs may be economical the future study will estimate the economic feasibility of bdm and optimize the sustainability of bionic layer for better economic and application prospects 4 conclusion in this work bdm fabricated by physical adsorption and mixed filtration of cnts laccases was adopted for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater with the synergism effect of enzymatic degradation adsorption and membrane separation bdm exhibited a satisfying dye removal rate and high anti fouling capacity furthermore the optimized operation parameters were obtained 20 g m 2 cnt and 74 6 g m 2 of laccase amounts 100 rpm of agitation speed and 1 0 bar of tmp besides the backwash could be employed to eradicate the inactive bionic layer and refabricate a new bdm based on the results above it can be safely concluded that bdm proves itself as a promising functional membrane material for

19066,flow electrode based capacitive deionization fcdi has attracted much attention owing to its continuous and scalable desalination process without the need for a discharging step which is required in conventional fixed electrode capacitive deionization however flow electrode slurry is poorly conductive which restricts desalination performance but higher carbon mass loading in the slurry could improve salt removal capacity due to enhanced connectivity however increased viscosity restricts higher loading of active materials herein we report a significant increase in salt removal performance by introducing functionalized carbon nanotubes fcnts into activated carbon ac based flow electrodes which led to the generation of conducting bridges between ac particles the salt removal rate in the presence of 0 25 wt fcnt with 5 wt ac improved four fold from that obtained with only 5 wt ac which is the highest value reported in the literature so far from 1 45 to 5 72 mmol m2s at a saline water concentration of 35 0 g l and applied potential of 1 2 v further fcnts with a high aspect ratio 50 000 can more effectively enhance salt removal than low aspect ratio fcnts 1300 electrochemical analysis further confirms that the addition of fcnts can efficiently form a connecting percolation network thus enhancing the conductivity of the flow electrode slurry for the practical application of highly efficient desalination systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization desalination flow electrode functionalized carbon nanotube activated carbon 1 introduction demand for fresh and safe water has grown continuously over the past few decades desalination of seawater is one of promising alternative to address the water shortage issue elimelech and phillip 2011 desalination by capacitive deionization cdi is a recently developed emerging process that involves low energy consumption and has a compact cell configuration the salt removal process is based on ion transportation and electrosorption at the electrical double layer of the porous surface of active materials under a typical potential of 1 0 1 5 v biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 gao et al 2015 jeon et al 2013 jung et al 2018 kim et al 2015 kim et al 2017 kim and choi 2010 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2015 porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 welgemoed and schutte 2005 however application of cdi to seawater desalination is challenging because of its relatively low desalination capacity and efficiency resulting from a fixed amount of active materials and the need for a discharging process to resolve this issue flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi which utilizes flowable electrodes instead of fixed electrodes has been recently developed boota et al 2015 cho et al 2017 cohen et al 2016 doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 hatzell et al 2015 lee et al 2018 linnartz et al 2017 porada et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018 yang et al 2016a b fcdi therefore enables continuous desalination even for seawater concentration of nacl 35 g l without requiring a discharging process as well as a much higher salt removal capacity owing to the unlimited supply of flowable active materials that can remove salt ions from the saline feed water even with such distinct advantages the fcdi system suffers from a major limitation due to the discontinuous electrical network of the suspended active materials particularly the commonly utilized activated carbons acs the conductivity of the flow electrode suspension is a few orders of magnitude lower than that of the conventionally used fixed electrode cdi system therefore the number of ions adsorbed onto the electrical double layer of ac is somewhat limited resulting in a lower desalination capacity an ac particle loading of approximately 10 15 wt of the flow electrode is the maximum content for stable and practical fcdi operation although a higher loading of active materials in the flow electrode slurry might improve the flow electrode conductivity resulting in enhanced salt removal performance it also significantly increases the viscosity of the flow electrode leading to clogging of flow electrode channels increasing efforts are being made to solve this issue in fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 park et al 2016 for example park et al introduced surface modified ac by coating polymer layers to increase the ac content to 35 wt without channel clogging park et al 2016 however such surface modification processes are somewhat time and labor consuming in addition the coated polymer may reduce the effective surface of the ac particles through penetration into the inner pores thereby reducing desalination performance suss et al also enhanced the ac loading up to 35 wt by utilizing gravitational forces acting on larger ac particles 100 μm in diameter however its salt removal capacity was not sufficiently high for seawater desalination doornbusch et al 2016 graphite based nanomaterials including graphene and carbon nanotubes cnts as active materials have been intensively studied by many researchers for conventional cdi applications and energy applications such as supercapacitors boota et al 2015 jia and zhang 2016 li et al 2010 liu et al 2014 2017 2018 nie et al 2012 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2014 such novel carbon materials with unique geometry have extremely high conductivities and large surface areas theoretical electron mobility and surface area of graphene hirai et al 2014 peigney et al 2001 5 106 cm2 v 1 s 1 and 2630 m2 g respectively which enable both fast electron transportation and high ion storing capacity such advantages render graphene and cnts as promising electrode materials however despite the extraordinary theoretical surface area the effective surface area of typically synthesized graphene is much lower 800 1000 m2 g than that of conventional ac particles higher than 3000 m2 g due to restacking which restricts the practical applications of graphene porada et al 2015 herein we present a new flow electrode material developed by combining oxygen group functionalized cnts fcnts and ac particles which shows a drastic increase in salt removal performance without imparting flowability issues since pristine cnts tend to heavily aggregate resulting in poor dispersion under aqueous flow electrode conditions cnts were functionalized under acidic conditions to introduce oxygen functional groups to ensure improved cnt dispersion in the flow electrode slurry we used fcnts as a conducting agent instead of an active material to electrically bridge the neighboring ac particles in the present system ac particles still play a major role in the desalination process as in a conventional fcdi system however its desalination performance is greatly enhanced by the formation of a conducting network owing to the presence of fcnt due to the low connectivity of ac particles only a small portion of ac particles that form the electrical double layer can participate in the desalination process most ac particles remain in the neutral charge state resulting in wastage of active materials our approach aims at maximizing the number of ac particles that can participate in the desalination process by forming a conductive network this obviates the necessity for increasing the ac loading thus resolving the channel blocking issue furthermore since the existing ac particles still play a major role in desalination only a small amount of fcnt is required to greatly improve the salt removal performance at a saline concentration of 35 g l equivalent to seawater and applied potential of 1 2 v we achieved a salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s which is the highest value reported so far to better understand the electrical properties of the fcdi system adopted here we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements which confirmed the decrease in the resistance of both the electrolyte saline water and flow electrode 2 experimental 2 1 materials cnts were purchased from cheap tubes inc multi walled carbon nanotubes outer diameter 10 20 nm length 20 μm aspect ratio ar 1300 vermont

a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid 1 l 3 1 v v and refluxed for 4 h at 70 c with vigorous stirring the mixture was then rinsed using di water several times and the cnt dispersion was obtained by ultrasonication in water for 1 h at room temperature fig s1 and s2 previous studies showed that functionalized cnts exhibit colloidal stability in water due to various oxygen functional groups on the surface including hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups lee et al 2009 2012 the viscosity of the flow electrodes was measured as a function of the shear rate at room temperature fig s3 2 3 measurement of desalination performance to prepare the flow electrode solution 0 25 and 0 05 wt cnt 5 wt ac and 2 5 wt sodium chloride were added to 500 ml of deionized di water and the aqueous electrode suspension was sonicated for 1 h before the desalination experiment the desalination cell consisted of cation and anion exchange membranes current collectors and a spacer as reported in our previous study fig s4 saline feed water composed of di water and various concentrations of sodium chloride 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l was continuously pumped into the inlet of the desalination cell and drained through the outlet located at the other side of the cell at a flow rate of 3 ml min the aqueous electrode suspension was also continuously recirculated in the desalination cell using a peristaltic pump miniplus 3 gilson inc usa at a flow rate of 25 ml min per channel desalination was initiated by applying a cell potential of 1 2 v using a potentiostat zive sps wonatech korea and the salt concentration of the effluent was obtained by the conversion of conductivity measured in real time ds 70 laqua horina japan from a conductivity salt concentration plot fig s5 2 4 electrochemical characterization electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis experiments were performed at room temperature using a hioki im3533 lcr meter under an open circuit voltage condition in the frequency range

results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance of fcdi utilizing fcnt fig 1 shows the schematic of the fcdi process used in the present study the fcdi unit cell consists of a pair of graphite current collectors located outermost a pair of channels for flow electrodes a pair of ion exchange membranes anionic and cationic and a spacer layer to act as a feed water channel fig s4 the salt ions flowing in the spacer layer sandwiched between the oppositely charged flow electrode channels were separated through anion and cation exchange membranes by applying a potential during the desalination process electrical double layers were generated on the micro and meso pores of the ac particles suspended in the flow electrode channels however electrical double layers are generated only with limited acs which are in electrical contact with the current collector in other words acs that are electrically disconnected from each other or do not touch the current collector can hardly possess electrical double layers for a low volume fraction of ac in the flow electrode suspension typically less than 15 wt of flow electrode slurry only a small amount of ac can act as active materials which effectively remove the salt ions while most of the ac particles remain in the neutral charge state thus the conventional fcdi system cannot fully utilize the salt removal performance of the ac particles present in the flow electrode suspension on the other hand when fcnts were added into the flow electrode suspension they acted as electrical pathways between the ac particles therefore more ac particles could have a chance to form electrical double layers which drastically increased the amount of adsorbed salt ions in the electrode pores fig 1a fig 1b and c shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem images of acs without and with fcnts respectively spherical ac particles with a mean diameter of 6 μm were used in the present study which can minimize the channel clogging issue when fcnts were added into the ac slurry they bridged the neighboring ac particles as shown in fig 1c such a conducting network structure can greatly improve the electrical conductivity of the flow electrode suspension fcdi desalination experiments using fcnts were performed as shown in fig 2 the saline feed water with various concentrations ranging from 1 1 to 35 0 g l note 35 0 g l is similar to the concentration of seawater was pumped into the spacer channel of the fcdi cell at a flow rate of 3 ml min at the same time the flow electrode containing acs 5 wt sodium chloride 2 5 wt and fcnt 0 25 wt 50 000 ar were continuously circulated in the electrode channels of the fcdi cell with a flow rate of 25 ml min per channel desalination was performed by applying a potential of 1 2 v to the fcdi cell the salt concentration of the effluent stream rapidly decreases within the first 10 min and then maintains a steady value during the process indicating continuous desalination of saline water without any additional processes occurring e g a discharging step which is a distinct advantage of the fcdi system for the flow electrode without fcnt the calculated desalination efficiencies were 19 8 11 7 10 7 and 5 7 with salt removal rates of 0 17 0 45 0 97 and 1 45 mmol m2s for feed water salt concentrations of 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l respectively table 1 when fcnt 0 25 wt was added to the flow electrode suspension the desalination performance significantly increased as shown in fig 2b and the desalination efficiency increased to over four times that of the system without fcnt furthermore the salt removal rate remarkably improved to 0 81 3 83 4 65 and 5 72 mmol m2s which are more than four times those of the ac only slurry table 1 the current measured during the fcdi operation also increased by 2 8 times compared with that during the case without fcnt moreover the current efficiency was enhanced from approximately 67 2 to 94 2 fig s6 the salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s is the highest reported value for a fcdi desalination system with only 5 wt ac in the flow electrode while 5 6 mmol m2s has been reported with 35 wt ac park et al 2016 two main approaches exist for realizing higher salt removal performance in fcdi research first a higher loading of active materials such as ac in the flow electrode slurry can enhance the salt removal capacity however due to channel clogging the amount of active materials that can be loaded in the flow electrode slurry is restricted to realize long term operational stability second maximizing the ion holding capacity of the active materials is an alternative approach for realizing better fcdi performance as explained above due to the low electrical conductivity of liquid type flow electrodes compared to conventional solid type fixed electrodes only a small portion of acs can participate in the salt removal process we believe that such a drastic increase in salt removal capacity with only a small amount of fcnt 0 25 wt in the present study originates from the generation of electrical conductivity between the isolated ac particles for example when a single fcnt or bundles of fcnts form a conducting bridge between two separate ac particles the doubled electrical double layer can hold more salt ions resulting in double the salt removal capacity the effect is identical to that achieved with double the amount of ac as the number of ac particles which are electrically connected by fcnts increases the ion holding capacity increases accordingly therefore only a small amount of fcnts which is enough to generate a conductive network can greatly improve the salt removal capacity and current efficiency liang et al 2017 has introduced up to 1 5 spherical carbon black particles in the flow electrode as a conducting agent which increased the salt removal rate by 39 liang et al 2017 one dimensional fcnts used in the present study 20 μm 1 mm in length can more effectively enhance the salt removal performance of fcdi than spherical carbon black particles can more than 3 9 times at a saline water concentration of 35 g l since one dimensional materials can more effectively form a conducting network with acs 3 2 fcnts as active materials since unique nanoscale carbon materials such as cnts or graphene have extraordinary electrical conductivities and high surface areas there is a possibility that fcnts themselves can hold salt ions electrically as an active material thereby enhancing the salt removal capacity as reported for a conventional cdi process porada et al 2015 yang et al 2014 in order to assess such a possibility we performed the fcdi desalination experiment using a flow electrode containing only fcnts instead of ac for the comparison of fcdi performance in the presence of fcnts only 0 25 wt fcnts and ac with fcnts 5 wt ac with 0 25 wt fcnt the amounts used were equivalent to fig 2b we found that overall desalination performance of fcnts only including desalination efficiency and salt removal rate were much lower than those of the fcdi system using both fcnts and ac as shown in fig 3 a 0 02 and 0 05 mmol m2s for 1 1 and 5 9 g l respectively furthermore for a saline feed water salt concentration higher than 14 2 g l the change in salt concentration after desalination was not noticeable table 2 this indicates that though fcnt itself can possibly act as an active material for capturing salt ions the salt removal capacity is negligible in the present fcdi system therefore it is believed that the ion holding capacity mostly originates from acs rather than fcnts however the presence of fcnts can greatly increase the number of ac particles that can participate in the desalination process by generating conductive pathways between ac particles this obviates the necessity of increasing the amount of ac which may cause channel blocking one distinct advantage of utilizing fcnt as a conducting agent is that only a small amount of fcnt is required to achieve a significant increase in desalination performance as shown in fig 3b we reduced the concentration of fcnt in the flow electrode slurry to 0 05 wt which is only 20 of that used in the experiment shown in fig 2b for the same amount of ac 5 wt the salt removal rate with only 0 05 wt fcnt is still much higher than that obtained without fcnt as shown in fig 3b 0 25 1 13 2 10 and 3 14 mmol m2s for 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l respectively this confirmed that adding a small amount of fcnt into the existing ac slurry can readily enhance desalination performance even though it is thought that a higher concentration of fcnt in the flow electrode slurry might increase salt removal capacity the viscosity of the flow electrode slurry increases when fcnts are added as shown in fig s3 therefore the flow electrode channels can easily be clogged which might impede long term fcdi operation but 0 25 wt fcnts exhibited stable fcdi operation without channel blocking higher ac loading might further improve the salt removal performance however for stable fcdi operation 5 wt ac was not utilized in the present study most recently some research groups have suggested the possible electrodialytic desalination mechanism in fcdi desalination ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 in the isolated closed cycle icc operation the change in ph was clearly observed which is one of the strongest pieces of evidence showing that the faradaic reaction definitely occurs during fcdi operation however the contribution of the electrodialytic effect on desalination depends on various parameters including the type of electrode materials electrode content salt content in the flow electrode slurry and the amount of the electrode material in the present study since we used a mixed flow electrode cell i e the anode and cathode flow electrode slurry were mixed outside the cell the flow electrode slurry ph was neutral therefore we also operated the fcdi system in the icc mode and measured the ph variation as shown in fig s7 the ph of the anode and cathode changes slightly during fcdi operation 1 h however the variation is significantly small compared to those reported in the literature ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 furthermore control fcdi experiments utilizing only cnts without activated carbons which exhibit contributions from only the electrodialytic effect on desalination were also conducted fig 3 and table 2 since there is only a very small amount of cnts without acs any distinct desalination behavior is mostly due to the electrodialytic effect rather than the capacitive process the results show that the salt removal rate with only 0 25 wt fcnt 0 02 and 0 05 mmol m2s for 1 1 and 5 9 g l saline water concentration respectively is negligible compared with that in the case of 5 wt ac with 0 25 wt fcnts 0 81 and 3 83 mmol m2s for 1 1 and 5 9 g l saline water concentration respectively table 1 in particular for the saline water concentration 14 2 g l we could not observe any salt removal behavior this suggests that even though the electrodialytic effect coexists with the capacitive process its contribution is small in the present system furthermore simply adding the cnts to the flow electrode significantly affected the desalination results this also indicates that the capacitive process is the main factor responsible for the significant increase in salt removal performance in the present system we believe that there are a couple of reasons for such a small electrodialytic effect in the present system first the high salt concentration of the flow electrode 2 5 wt can result in a decrease in the ionic resistance second the presence of cnts provides a good interparticle connectivity of the flow electrode which leads to low electronic resistance 3 3 effect of aspect ratio on desalination performance since fcnts play a key role in the formation of conducting bridges between neighboring ac particles another parameter that can potentially affect desalination performance is the length of fcnts to evaluate this aspect fcdi desalination was carried out using fcnts with a much lower ar ar 1300 compared to fcnts with an ar of 50 000 figs 2b and 3 all other experimental parameters were fixed as seen in fig 4 a much higher desalination performance including desalination efficiency and salt removal rate was achieved compared to that obtained with only ac particles fig 4a however the fcdi process using low ar fcnts was less efficient than that using high ar fcnts as shown in fig 5 0 67 1 97 3 30 and 4 61 mmol m2s for 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l respectively we believe that such differences in salt removal performance originate from different morphologies as shown in the fe sem images fig s2 fcnts with an ar of 50 000 1 mm in length are approximately 500 times longer than those with an ar of 1300 20 μm in length considering the size of ac particles 6 μm in diameter low ar fcnts can form electrical contact points with only a few ac particles whereas high ar fcnts can effectively provide electrical pathways to more ac particles this results in enhanced desalination performance 3 4 electrochemical analysis we performed eis measurements to further investigate the electrochemical properties of fcdi cells and the essential mechanism for enhancing salt removal performance of flow electrodes in the presence of fcnts fig 6 shows the nyquist plots of the impedance spectra of the fcdi cells used in the present study 5 wt ac only and 5 wt ac with 0 25 wt fcnts 35 g l saline water concentration eis data were fitted to the equivalent circuit with r1 r2q1 r3q3 to understand the underlying electrochemical processes in the conventional cdi eis experiment r1 is typically the electrolyte resistance since carbon electrodes were fixed on the current collector in contrast in the case of fcdi carbon slurry electrodes flow between the spacer and the current collector therefore r1 represents both electrolyte resistance including ion and electron transfer reaction and electrical resistance at the interface between the flow electrode and current collector r2 and q1 represent the resistance and constant phase element of the interfacial charge transfer of the flow electrodes respectively and r3 and q2 are the resistance and constant phase element of the interfacial adsorption of ions on the surface of the flow electrodes respectively dennison 2014 liang et al 2017 sarac et al 2008 the overall interfacial resistance of the flow electrodes is calculated by the summation of r2 and r3 the capacitance of each rq value was calculated using the following equation c r1 nq 1 n the calculated capacitance per electrode channel area 12 7 cm2 was in the range of 1 20 mf cm2 signifying the electrosorption of charged species and ions onto the flow electrodes irvine et al 1990 the fitting parameters from the equivalent circuit are summarized in fig s8 the equivalent circuit fitting results show a decrease in both electrolyte resistance from 0 346 to 0 286 ω and overall interfacial resistance of the flow electrode from 7 96 to 4 67 ω by the addition of fcnts to the flow electrode slurry at the fixed saline water concentration of 35 g l this strongly suggests that the increase in conductivity of the flow electrodes is a result of the formation of an electrical network between ac particles in the presence of fcnts thus enhancing the salt removal performance of fcdi cells 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated a fcdi desalination system with a remarkable salt removal performance based on flow electrodes consisting of ac and fcnts the fcnts in the ac based flow electrode slurry bridge the neighboring ac particles thus increasing the connectivity without the need for higher loadings of active materials therefore more ac particles in the flow slurry could effectively participate in the salt removal process improving the salt removal performance to over four times salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s that of the system without fcnts which is the highest value for desalination using the fcdi process with only 5 wt ac therefore there is room for further enhancement in salt removal performance by increasing the ac content further fcnts with different ars were investigated the low ar fcnt containing system ar 1300 exhibited improved salt removal performance compared to the ac only system but was less effective than high ar fcnts ar 50 000 electrochemical analysis suggests the generation of a conducting network by fcnts which increases the conductivity of the flow electrodes we expect that the demonstrated approach will open new avenues for realizing high performance deionization for seawater desalination and has strong potential for

19066,flow electrode based capacitive deionization fcdi has attracted much attention owing to its continuous and scalable desalination process without the need for a discharging step which is required in conventional fixed electrode capacitive deionization however flow electrode slurry is poorly conductive which restricts desalination performance but higher carbon mass loading in the slurry could improve salt removal capacity due to enhanced connectivity however increased viscosity restricts higher loading of active materials herein we report a significant increase in salt removal performance by introducing functionalized carbon nanotubes fcnts into activated carbon ac based flow electrodes which led to the generation of conducting bridges between ac particles the salt removal rate in the presence of 0 25 wt fcnt with 5 wt ac improved four fold from that obtained with only 5 wt ac which is the highest value reported in the literature so far from 1 45 to 5 72 mmol m2s at a saline water concentration of 35 0 g l and applied potential of 1 2 v further fcnts with a high aspect ratio 50 000 can more effectively enhance salt removal than low aspect ratio fcnts 1300 electrochemical analysis further confirms that the addition of fcnts can efficiently form a connecting percolation network thus enhancing the conductivity of the flow electrode slurry for the practical application of highly efficient desalination systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization desalination flow electrode functionalized carbon nanotube activated carbon 1 introduction demand for fresh and safe water has grown continuously over the past few decades desalination of seawater is one of promising alternative to address the water shortage issue elimelech and phillip 2011 desalination by capacitive deionization cdi is a recently developed emerging process that involves low energy consumption and has a compact cell configuration the salt removal process is based on ion transportation and electrosorption at the electrical double layer of the porous surface of active materials under a typical potential of 1 0 1 5 v biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 gao et al 2015 jeon et al 2013 jung et al 2018 kim et al 2015 kim et al 2017 kim and choi 2010 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2015 porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 welgemoed and schutte 2005 however application of cdi to seawater desalination is challenging because of its relatively low desalination capacity and efficiency resulting from a fixed amount of active materials and the need for a discharging process to resolve this issue flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi which utilizes flowable electrodes instead of fixed electrodes has been recently developed boota et al 2015 cho et al 2017 cohen et al 2016 doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 hatzell et al 2015 lee et al 2018 linnartz et al 2017 porada et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 2018 yang et al 2016a b fcdi therefore enables continuous desalination even for seawater concentration of nacl 35 g l without requiring a discharging process as well as a much higher salt removal capacity owing to the unlimited supply of flowable active materials that can remove salt ions from the saline feed water even with such distinct advantages the fcdi system suffers from a major limitation due to the discontinuous electrical network of the suspended active materials particularly the commonly utilized activated carbons acs the conductivity of the flow electrode suspension is a few orders of magnitude lower than that of the conventionally used fixed electrode cdi system therefore the number of ions adsorbed onto the electrical double layer of ac is somewhat limited resulting in a lower desalination capacity an ac particle loading of approximately 10 15 wt of the flow electrode is the maximum content for stable and practical fcdi operation although a higher loading of active materials in the flow electrode slurry might improve the flow electrode conductivity resulting in enhanced salt removal performance it also significantly increases the viscosity of the flow electrode leading to clogging of flow electrode channels increasing efforts are being made to solve this issue in fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 park et al 2016 for example park et al introduced surface modified ac by coating polymer layers to increase the ac content to 35 wt without channel clogging park et al 2016 however such surface modification processes are somewhat time and labor consuming in addition the coated polymer may reduce the effective surface of the ac particles through penetration into the inner pores thereby reducing desalination performance suss et al also enhanced the ac loading up to 35 wt by utilizing gravitational forces acting on larger ac particles 100 μm in diameter however its salt removal capacity was not sufficiently high for seawater desalination doornbusch et al 2016 graphite based nanomaterials including graphene and carbon nanotubes cnts as active materials have been intensively studied by many researchers for conventional cdi applications and energy applications such as supercapacitors boota et al 2015 jia and zhang 2016 li et al 2010 liu et al 2014 2017 2018 nie et al 2012 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2014 such novel carbon materials with unique geometry have extremely high conductivities and large surface areas theoretical electron mobility and surface area of graphene hirai et al 2014 peigney et al 2001 5 106 cm2 v 1 s 1 and 2630 m2 g respectively which enable both fast electron transportation and high ion storing capacity such advantages render graphene and cnts as promising electrode materials however despite the extraordinary theoretical surface area the effective surface area of typically synthesized graphene is much lower 800 1000 m2 g than that of conventional ac particles higher than 3000 m2 g due to restacking which restricts the practical applications of graphene porada et al 2015 herein we present a new flow electrode material developed by combining oxygen group functionalized cnts fcnts and ac particles which shows a drastic increase in salt removal performance without imparting flowability issues since pristine cnts tend to heavily aggregate resulting in poor dispersion under aqueous flow electrode conditions cnts were functionalized under acidic conditions to introduce oxygen functional groups to ensure improved cnt dispersion in the flow electrode slurry we used fcnts as a conducting agent instead of an active material to electrically bridge the neighboring ac particles in the present system ac particles still play a major role in the desalination process as in a conventional fcdi system however its desalination performance is greatly enhanced by the formation of a conducting network owing to the presence of fcnt due to the low connectivity of ac particles only a small portion of ac particles that form the electrical double layer can participate in the desalination process most ac particles remain in the neutral charge state resulting in wastage of active materials our approach aims at maximizing the number of ac particles that can participate in the desalination process by forming a conductive network this obviates the necessity for increasing the ac loading thus resolving the channel blocking issue furthermore since the existing ac particles still play a major role in desalination only a small amount of fcnt is required to greatly improve the salt removal performance at a saline concentration of 35 g l equivalent to seawater and applied potential of 1 2 v we achieved a salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s which is the highest value reported so far to better understand the electrical properties of the fcdi system adopted here we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements which confirmed the decrease in the resistance of both the electrolyte

a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid 1 l 3 1 v v and refluxed for 4 h at 70 c with vigorous stirring the mixture was then rinsed using di water several times and the cnt dispersion was obtained by ultrasonication in water for 1 h at room temperature fig s1 and s2 previous studies showed that functionalized cnts exhibit colloidal stability in water due to various oxygen functional groups on the surface including hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups lee et al 2009 2012 the viscosity of the flow electrodes was measured as a function of the shear rate at room temperature fig s3 2 3 measurement of desalination performance to prepare the flow electrode solution 0 25 and 0 05 wt cnt 5 wt ac and 2 5 wt sodium chloride were added to 500 ml of deionized di water and the aqueous electrode suspension was sonicated for 1 h before the desalination experiment the desalination cell consisted of cation and anion exchange membranes current collectors and a spacer as reported in our previous study fig s4 saline feed water composed of di water and various concentrations of sodium chloride 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l was continuously pumped into the inlet of the desalination cell and

results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance of fcdi utilizing fcnt fig 1 shows the schematic of the fcdi process used in the present study the fcdi unit cell consists of a pair of graphite current collectors located outermost a pair of channels for flow electrodes a pair of ion exchange membranes anionic and cationic and a spacer layer to act as a feed water channel fig s4 the salt ions flowing in the spacer layer sandwiched between the oppositely charged flow electrode channels were separated through anion and cation exchange membranes by applying a potential during the desalination process electrical double layers were generated on the micro and meso pores of the ac particles suspended in the flow electrode channels however electrical double layers are generated only with limited acs which are in electrical contact with the current collector in other words acs that are electrically disconnected from each other or do not touch the current collector can hardly possess electrical double layers for a low volume fraction of ac in the flow electrode suspension typically less than 15 wt of flow electrode slurry only a small amount of ac can act as active materials which effectively remove the salt ions while most of the ac particles remain in the neutral charge state thus the conventional fcdi system cannot fully utilize the salt removal performance of the ac particles present in the flow electrode suspension on the other hand when fcnts were added into the flow electrode suspension they acted as electrical pathways between the ac particles therefore more ac particles could have a chance to form electrical double layers which drastically increased the amount of adsorbed salt ions in the electrode pores fig 1a fig 1b and c shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem images of acs without and with fcnts respectively spherical ac particles with a mean diameter of 6 μm were used in the present study which can minimize the channel clogging issue when fcnts were added into the ac slurry they bridged the neighboring ac particles as shown in fig 1c such a conducting network structure can greatly improve the electrical conductivity of the flow electrode suspension fcdi desalination experiments using fcnts were performed as shown in fig 2 the saline feed water with various concentrations ranging from 1 1 to 35 0 g l note 35 0 g l is similar to the concentration of seawater was pumped into the spacer channel of the fcdi cell at a flow rate of 3 ml min at the same time the flow electrode containing acs 5 wt sodium chloride 2 5 wt and fcnt 0 25 wt 50 000 ar were continuously circulated in the electrode channels of the fcdi cell with a flow rate of 25 ml min per channel desalination was performed by applying a potential of 1 2 v to the fcdi cell the salt concentration of the effluent stream rapidly decreases within the first 10 min and then maintains a steady value during the process indicating continuous desalination of saline water without any additional processes occurring e g a discharging step which is a distinct advantage of the fcdi system for the flow electrode without fcnt the calculated desalination efficiencies were 19 8 11 7 10 7 and 5 7 with salt removal rates of 0 17 0 45 0 97 and 1 45 mmol m2s for feed water salt concentrations of 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l respectively table 1 when fcnt 0 25 wt was added to the flow electrode suspension the desalination performance significantly increased as shown in fig 2b and the desalination efficiency increased to over four times that of the system without fcnt furthermore the salt removal rate remarkably improved to 0 81 3 83 4 65 and 5 72 mmol m2s which are more than four times those of the ac only slurry table 1 the current measured during the fcdi operation also increased by 2 8 times compared with that during the case without fcnt moreover the current efficiency was enhanced from approximately 67 2 to 94 2 fig s6 the salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s is the highest reported value for a fcdi desalination system with only 5 wt ac in the flow electrode while 5 6 mmol m2s has been reported with 35 wt ac park et al 2016 two main approaches exist for realizing higher salt removal performance in fcdi research first a higher loading of active materials such as ac in the flow electrode slurry can enhance the salt removal capacity however due to channel clogging the amount of active materials that can be loaded in the flow electrode slurry is restricted to realize long term operational stability second maximizing the ion holding capacity of the active materials is an alternative approach for realizing better fcdi performance as explained above due to the low electrical conductivity of liquid type flow electrodes compared to conventional solid type fixed electrodes only a small portion of acs can participate in the salt removal process we believe that such a drastic increase in salt removal capacity with only a small amount of fcnt 0 25 wt in the present study originates from the generation of electrical conductivity between the isolated ac particles for example when a single fcnt or bundles of fcnts form a conducting bridge between two separate ac particles the doubled electrical double layer can hold more salt ions resulting in double the salt removal capacity the effect is identical to that achieved with double the amount of ac as the number of ac particles which are electrically connected by fcnts increases the ion holding capacity increases accordingly therefore only a small amount of fcnts which is enough to generate a conductive network can greatly improve the salt removal capacity and current efficiency liang et al 2017 has introduced up to 1 5 spherical carbon black particles in the flow electrode as a conducting agent which increased the salt removal rate by 39 liang et al 2017 one dimensional fcnts used in the present study 20 μm 1 mm in length can more effectively enhance the salt removal performance of fcdi than spherical carbon black particles can more than 3 9 times at a saline water concentration of 35 g l since one dimensional materials can more effectively form a conducting network with acs 3 2 fcnts as active materials since unique nanoscale carbon materials such as cnts or graphene have extraordinary electrical conductivities and high surface areas there is

desalination efficiency and salt removal rate were much lower than those of the fcdi system using both fcnts and ac as shown in fig 3 a 0 02 and 0 05 mmol m2s for 1 1 and 5 9 g l respectively furthermore for a saline feed water salt concentration higher than 14 2 g l the change in salt concentration after desalination was not noticeable table 2 this indicates that though fcnt itself can

3 14 mmol m2s for 1 1 5 9 14 2 and 35 0 g l respectively this confirmed that adding a small amount of fcnt into the existing ac slurry can readily enhance desalination performance even though it is

constant phase element of the interfacial charge transfer of the flow electrodes respectively and r3 and q2 are the resistance and constant phase element of the interfacial adsorption of ions on the surface of the flow electrodes respectively dennison 2014 liang et al 2017 sarac et al 2008 the overall interfacial resistance of the flow electrodes is calculated by the summation of r2 and r3 the capacitance of each rq value was calculated using the following equation c r1 nq 1 n the calculated capacitance per electrode channel area 12 7 cm2 was in the range of 1 20 mf cm2 signifying the electrosorption of charged species and ions onto the flow electrodes irvine et al 1990 the fitting parameters from the equivalent circuit are summarized in fig s8 the equivalent circuit fitting results show a decrease in both electrolyte resistance from 0 346 to 0 286 ω and overall interfacial resistance of the flow electrode from 7 96 to 4 67 ω by the addition of fcnts to the flow electrode slurry at the fixed saline water concentration of 35 g l this strongly suggests that the increase in conductivity of the flow electrodes is a result of the formation of an electrical network between ac particles in the presence of fcnts thus enhancing the salt removal performance of fcdi cells 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated a fcdi desalination system with a remarkable salt removal performance based on flow electrodes consisting of ac and fcnts the fcnts in the ac based flow electrode slurry bridge the neighboring ac particles thus increasing the connectivity without the need for higher loadings of active materials therefore more ac particles in the flow slurry could effectively participate in the salt removal process improving the salt removal performance to over four times salt removal rate of 5 72 mmol m2s that of the system without fcnts which is the highest value for desalination using the fcdi process with only 5 wt ac therefore there is room for further enhancement in salt removal performance by increasing the ac content further fcnts with different ars were investigated the low ar fcnt containing system ar 1300 exhibited improved salt removal performance compared to the ac only system but was less effective than high ar fcnts ar 50 000 electrochemical analysis suggests the generation of a conducting network by fcnts which increases the conductivity of the flow electrodes we expect that the demonstrated approach will open new avenues for realizing high performance deionization for seawater desalination and has strong potential for large scale desalination modules as well as flow electrode based energy storage systems acknowledgement this work was supported by the soonchunhyang university research fund we also acknowledge the

19067,the effects of extreme cold water temperature elevated cleaning water temperature cleaning time on membrane performance and pore size distribution were studied using flat sheet polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes extreme cold water temperature led to a decrease in membrane permeability and membrane pore size shrinkage the use of periodical warm water 35 c membrane conditioning could almost completely recover the membrane permeability and pore size structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature while the use of room temperature 23 1 c conditioning recovered majority of the membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature changes in membrane performance correlate well with changes in membrane structure membranes periodically conditioned in warmer water temperature showed a higher permeability than that periodically conditioned at room temperature from a long term operation of three months the results suggest the change in pvdf membrane performance and structure caused by extreme cold water temperature is almost completely reversible after periodical warm water conditioning and thus the use of warm water conditioning

electron microscope tmp transmembrane pressure 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used for drinking water production all over the world including cold regions due to its obvious advantages such as a decrease in chemical usage more environmentally friendly reduced space requirement high product water quality easier operation and in some areas of the world communities such as cold regions it is a more practical choice pearce 2007 guo et al 2012 mohammad et al 2012 however there are various factors that can impact the performance of the membrane which include feed water characteristics type of contaminants concentration of contaminants membrane characteristics roughness pore size hydrophobicity operational conditions ph flow rate temperature and fouling wang et al 2010 krzeminski et al 2012 manawi et al 2014 the impact of feed water temperature on the membrane performance and structure is understudied uhr 2001 farahbakhsh and smith 2006 cui et al 2017 temperature is a known factor to impact feed characteristics such as viscosity the diffusivity of a contaminant surface tension etc awwa 2006 dang et al 2014 however little is known as to how cold temperature has an impact on membrane structure cui et al 2017 many areas around the world such as canada united states of america scandinavia countries russia china etc are subjected to harsher cold climates and are less studied than that of areas in the range of room and warm temperatures ozgun et al 2013 similarly some studies also observed the negative effect of psychrophilic temperature on the performance of membrane bioreactors wang et al 2009 van den brink et al 2011 ma et al 2013 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 gurung et al 2017 and the effect of cleaning water temperature on membrane permeability recovery liu et al 2000 caothien et al 2018 the impact of temperature on viscosity has been the focus on why flux decreases with a decreased temperature however based on models that are able to compensate for the viscosity change with temperature there still presents unaccountable factors that are contributing to flux decline such as the impact of temperature on the physical properties of the membrane which include lower porosity and higher tortuosity farahbakhsh and smith 2006 uhr 2001 due to this unaccountability thousands of dollars are wasted each year due to the lack of understanding of how cold water temperature impacts the physical properties of the membrane as many industries assume that flux decline is due to fouling and therefore perform unnecessary chemical cleaning on the membrane which has been shown to deteriorate the membrane structure and decrease their lifespan abdullah and bérubé 2013 in addition the factor that impacts the resistance of the membrane the most is the pore size which means that any small change in pore size can result in a large increase in resistance therefore causing an increase in pressure that is required to maintain the desired flux robinson et al 2016 in practical situations it would not be feasible to elevate the temperature of cold feed water as this would increase operating cost especially for large scale drinking water membrane filtration plants therefore it is important to have a better understanding of the impact that cold water temperature has on the performance and structure of the membranes and eventually develop strategies to recover membrane structural changes avina 2006 ozgun et al 2013 the impact of cold water temperature on the membrane filters has not been studied in great detail and to the best of our knowledge no attention has been paid as to whether or not the impact of cold water temperature on the membrane structure can be recovered or reversed completely by operating and cleaning strategies the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of cold water temperature of 0 3 c a feed water temperature often seen during the cold season for many treatment plants across canada usa scandinavia countries russia china ozgun et al 2013 on membrane performance and structure and to investigate if periodical warm water conditioning chemical cleaning would be able to partially or completely reinstall the potential membrane structure changes caused by extreme cold water temperature 2 methodology 2 1 chemicals and membrane in this study sodium metabisulphite na2s2o5 supplied by anachemia now owned by vwr was used and made into a 1 w w na2s2o5 solution as a filtration solution to prevent potential biofilm growth deionized distilled water was used throughout this experiment for this investigation virgin flat sheet membranes made out of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with a pore size of 0 1 μm dafu membrane technology co ltd jiangsu prchina were used 2 2 module the module consists of a plastic plate used to provide stability two pieces of plastic mesh material to prevent the membrane from sticking to the surface of the plate two pieces of flat sheet pvdf

the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus used in this study is shown in fig s1 supplemental information the holding tank holds both the 1 w w na2s2o5 solution and the membrane module na2s2o5 is used in this study to prevent any biofilm growth on the membrane for the duration of the three months filtration operation xu et al 2010 cui et al 2017 the permeation was achieved by continuously pumping and recirculationg the na2s2o5 solution by a masterflex c l pump cole parmer montreal quebec and the transmembrane pressure tmp is monitored by an analog omega vacuum gauge omega korea the permeate is than collected in a graduated cylinder by measuring the amount of time it takes to collect a predetermined permeate volume to ensure that the system is at steady and stable flux the system is operated at a constant flux of 30lmh and monitored on a daily basis where minor adjustments are made if necessary to maintain the desired flux practically the instant membrane flux was maintained within the range of 30 0 0 7 lmh at 0 3 c the temperature of the 1 w w na2s2o5 solution was monitored daily to ensure that the temperature was held constant at 0 3 c maintained by a well controlled walk in cold room climate testing systems inc warminster pa and the tmp was measured from the pressure indicator the following is the coding system applied for the membrane modules operated in a 1 w w na2s2o5 solution for the duration of the three month filtration study table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions of the three different operation modes and membrane pieces d and e the selections of the duration periodical condition of every two weeks and total experimental time of 3 months flux 30 l m2 h lmh and cold temperature 0 3 c are based on the real conditions of a local membrane drinking water plant the local membrane drinking water filtration plant experiences a winter season of about 3 months with a cold raw water temperature of 0 3 1 0 c all the membranes used in the modules a b c and membrane pieces d and e were from the same roll of pvdf flat sheet membrane the initial clean water permeability of module a b and c were 1015 23lmh bar 1007 5 lmh bar and 1074 4lmh bar at 20 c respectively 2 4 permeability every two weeks two of the modules a and b were taken out of the cold room then placed treated in either 23 c or 35 c water for a duration of 6 h while the third module module c having a flux of 30 lmh was kept in the cold room and operated continuously without room temperature and warm water treatment the selection of a 6 h conditioning is based on the fact that 6 h chemical cleaning is usually used for recovery chemical cleaning in a number of membrane filtration plants the 35 c water was maintained using a water bath after 6 h the clean water permeability of the modules was determined by using deionized distilled water at 23 c by generating a graph of membrane flux vs tmp the pure water permeability was determined based on the slope of the graph the tmp used for the determination of pure water permeability ranged from 0 022 bar to 0 061 bar once the permeability test was complete the two modules were immediately placed back into the cold room for another two weeks continuous filtration operation until the same treatment process is applied again this will continue for the three month duration the permeability of the membrane modules in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution was determined using equation 1 which is a modification of cui et al 2017 to be applied for a plate and frame module the tmp of the membrane modules in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution ranged from 0 046 bar to 0 093 bar 1 p q δ p a v t δ p 2 w h where p specific permeability of the membrane lmh bar q flow rate of the permeate l h δp tmp bar a effective

experiment is compared to that of the permeability of the modules after being subjected to cold temperature operation and treated and is seen in equation 3 cui et al 2017 3 n o r m a l i z e d p e r m

and e with no filtration 0 lmh were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution in the cold room and two 1 cm 4 cm segments were cut from each membrane immediately and put into liquid nitrogen for 10 min for sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy sem images for pore size distribution psd determination then the remaining membrane pieces d and e were placed into 23 c and 35 c water respectively for 6 h and consecutively another 18 h conditioning a total of 24 h conditioning one 1 cm 4 cm segment of membrane was cut from each membrane d and e after 6 h and 24 h conditioning respectively and put into liquid nitrogen for 10 min after completion of a total of 24 h conditioning remaining membranes d and e were immediately placed back into the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution for another two weeks storage and the same process was applied for the three month duration the membrane segments 1 cm 4 cm after liquid nitrogen freezing were cut into two 1 cm 1 cm samples these 1 cm 1 cm samples were placed onto a metal holder having carbon tape on it and then a coating of carbon was sputtered on using sputter coater model 12560 fullam usa these coated samples were placed under an sem su 70 hitachi japan and images of the surface of the membrane were taken over different regions of the same piece of membrane at different magnifications only the sem images taken at a magnification of 100 k were used to determine membrane pore size and its distribution two pieces of segments were prepared for each set of tests so as to have a replicate and during sem analysis approximately seven to twenty sem images at the 500 nm scale were used for membrane segments for psd determination for a total of 700 pores sample the images used to determine the psd were randomly selected until 700 pores were measured for each set of tests the software used to measure the pores of the membrane was imagej version 1 51p national institutes of health usa the reproducibility of the sem psd was verified by counting a large number of membrane pores fig 1 shows the effect of randomly counted pore size number on the accumulative frequency psd d10 10 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number d50 50 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number and d90 90 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number it is clear that the number of counted pore size had a limited impact on the accumulative frequency psd d10 d50 and d90 when the counted pore size number was larger than about 500 thus a large number of pores 700 pores sample were used in this study to ensure the repeatability of sem psd and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 in this study fig 1 shows that the sem technique used in this study provides reliable information on the pore sizes of the pvdf membranes at a counted pore number of 700 pores each sample similarly at the end of the three month filtration operation membrane samples were taken from membrane modules a b and c for sem analysis 0 3ct 23 module a 0 3ct 35 module b were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 and placed in 23 c and 35 c water respectively for 6 h treatment the clean water permeability was than determined and the modules were then placed back into 23 c and 35 c water for an additional 6 h conditioning to maintain the membrane structure at the desired temperatures after the 6 h treatment the same technique for preparing the sem for membrane pieces d and e were applied for 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 module membrane samples however six segments were taken from each module top middle and bottom six segments were also taken from 0 3ct nt membrane module after permeation was halted for 6 h in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution a piece of virgin membrane was also prepared for sem so as to be able to compare any changes that may have occurred during the study 3 results 3 1 tmp permeability at 0 3 c and normalized permeability the variations in tmp of the three membrane modules operating in 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution is shown in fig 2 the tmp steadily increased for 0 3ct nt until it reached a plateau near the end of the experimental run the highest tmp reached was 0 093bar the average tmp before and after 23 c treatment for 0 3ct 23 were 0 067 0 003 bar and 0 055 0 003 bar respectively the average tmp before and after 35 c treatment for 0 3ct 35 were 0 059 0 003 bar and 0 048 0 004 bar respectively the results suggested that membranes treated at 23 c and 35 c reduced tmp as compared to operating at 0 3 c with no treatment and a higher treatment temperature 35 c led to a further reduction in tmp the initial permeability of the membrane modules at room temperature for 0 3ct nt 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 are 1074 4lmh bar 1015 23lmh bar and 1007 5lmh bar respectively the change in permeability of the membrane modules operating in 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution is shown in fig 3 the permeability of 0 3ct nt slowly but steadily decreased during its duration in 0 3 c the lowest permeability was 307 6 0 0 lmh bar for the 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 after each treatment a recovery of permeability was clearly observed however the permeability slowly decreased with time in the two weeks filtration but reached to a plateau value that was higher than that of the 0 3ct nt module without treatment the average permeability before and after 23 c treatment for 0 3ct 23 were 441 0 15 3 lmh bar and 557 5 29 8 lmh bar respectively the average permeability before and after 35 c treatment for 0 3ct 35 were 501 3 29 9 lmh bar and 632 4 57 3 lmh bar respectively the higher treatment temperature 35 c led to a higher recovery of permeability and maintained a higher operating permeability after being taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 were treated with 23 c and 35 c deionized distilled water respectively for 6 h after every two weeks operation in 0 3 c the normalized permeability of 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 after being treated is shown in fig 4 the permeability of 0 3ct 23 was never able to fully recover p0 1015 23lmh bar while 0 3ct 35 was completely recovered p0 1007 5lmh bar 3 2 morphology and pore sizes of membranes from sem images the sem images of the virgin membrane membrane pieces d and e 0 h and 6 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c respectively after 8 weeks storage at 0 3 c cold water are shown in fig 5 as is seen pores with different pore sizes were observed from all the sem images at 500 nm scale indicating a psd existed the pores showed different shapes thus an equivalent pore diameter was used for each pore size characterization from each pore area in the sem images furthermore the pore sizes from 0 h conditioning fig 5 b and 5 d were obviously smaller than that after 6 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c and the virgin membrane the evidence suggests that room temperature and warm water temperature conditionings were able to recover the pore sizes shrinkages caused by extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c 3 3 comparison of pore parameters and psd of membranes conditioned at different temperatures and times fig 6 shows the representative psds of membranes after 0 h 6 h and 24 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c on average the pore size shifted towards a smaller size when the membrane was under cold temperature conditions while after being treated in warm water 23 c or 35 c there appeared to be a higher frequency of the medium to large pores implying there were more larger pores after treatments the results suggested that conditioning of membrane at 23 c and 35 c could reinstall the membrane structure pore size loss caused by extreme cold water temperature the effects of storage time treatment water temperature 23 vs 35 c and treatment time 6 and 24 h on the fractions of large membrane pores 30 nm and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 are shown in table 2 and fig s2 supplemental information respectively the rational to focus on the fractions of large pores 30 nm in table 2 is due to the fact that a small increase in the fraction of large pores could lead to a significant increase in membrane flux and permeability masselin et al 2001 in general there was a larger fraction of large pores 30 nm when the membrane was treated with 35 c than that treated with 23 c water in most cases table 2 the most significant difference in the fraction of large pores 30 nm was demonstrated at the 6 h conditioning the difference between 23 c and 35 c conditioning was reduced with an increase in treatment time at 24 h table 2 a further comparison of pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 was conducted as shown in table 3 and fig s2 supplemental materials changes of the pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 of membranes d and e storage in extreme cold temperature 0 3 c with experimental time were observed it appeared that pore sizes started to have some shrinkage after 2 weeks in extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c as compared to virgin membranes but stabilized after 2 4 weeks this was repeatedly observed in every two weeks cold water storage room temperature and warm water conditioning cycle a relatively stable d10 d50 and d90 were observed after the 4th or 6th week fig s2 for comparison purposes the average values of the d10 d50 and d90 from weeks 6 8 10 and 12 under different conditioning temperature and times were summarized and compared to the virgin membrane table 3 statistical analyses analysis of variances anova and student t test clearly showed that there was a difference in d10 d50 and d90 between 0 h conditioning and the virgin membrane student t test p 0 05 and between 0 h and 6 and or 24 h conditioning at both 23 c and 35 c student t test p 0 05 indicating that extreme cold temperature storage indeed caused pore size shrinkage and that room temperature and warm temperature conditionings could recover the pores size shrinkages further statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference in d90 after 6 h treatments between 23 c and 35 c t test p 0 05 which indicated a larger fraction of large pores after 35 c treatment and is consistent with the results summarized in table 2 3 4 comparison of membrane psd of module a b and c at the end of filtration operation the psd of the virgin membrane as well as membranes from the three membrane modules that were operated in the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution at 30lmh for three months are shown in fig 7 a 53 of the measured pores of the virgin membrane were below 15 nm while the membrane that had no treatment 0 3ct nt for the three month operation had a higher frequency 68 of smaller pores below 15 nm or a smaller frequency 32 of medium to large pores above 15 nm as compared to 0 3ct 23 60 8 below 15 nm and 39 2 above 15 nm and 0 3ct 35 58 6 below 15 nm and 41 4 above 15 nm furthermore there was a higher frequency of pores in the range of 15 20 nm and 20 25 nm medium pores or larger than 30 nm for module b 0 3ct 35 that was periodically treated at a higher temperature 35 c as compared to that treated at 23 c the membrane psd of module 0 3ct 35 was close to that of the virgin membrane the changes in pore sizes can be better observed in fig 7 b which shows the plots of the accumulative frequency vs pore size of the virgin membrane and membranes from the three modules after three month operation the results clearly show that the use of the membrane module in cold temperature lead to a significant shrinkage of the membrane pores while treating the membrane with elevated temperatures lead to reversibility close to the original membrane pore size 4 discussion this study shows that the membrane performance and pore size after being subjected to an extreme cold temperature of 0 3 c can be recovered almost fully or fully through treating the membrane every two weeks with 23 c and 35 c water conditioning or chemical cleaning in drinking water treatment plants for 6 h the 35 c water provided a full recovery of the performance of the membrane permeability while the 23 c treatment provided partial recovery it was never able to reach full restoration at room temperature which cui et al 2017 also observed the full recovery of permeability after 35 c conditioning as compared to the majority about 80 permeability recovery after 23 c conditioning figs 3 and 4 can be explained by the fact that a larger fraction of larger pores existed after 35 c conditioning table 2 and fig 7 the larger fraction of large pores 30 nm were generally found over the membrane surface after 35 c conditioning could effectively lead to a very large increase in permeability masselin et al 2001 the recovery of the permeability of the membrane modules could also be explained because the pore size recovered partially or almost fully back to its original size after being treated in 23 c and 35 c water the results of the increase in pore sizes after 23 and 35 c treatments are consistent with the results from the literature sharma and chellam 2005 dang et al 2014 an increase in pore size at elevated temperatures was also found through sharma and chellam 2005 study on flat sheet polyamide nanofilter with the use of a hydrodynamic transport model using a hindrance transport model dang et al 2014 found that when the temperature changed from 20 to 40 c the pore radius of the polyamide nanofilter membrane increased from 0 39 to 0 44 nm the magnitutide of changes in pore sizes in this study was larger than that observed by sharma and chellam 2005 and dang et al 2014 indicating that significant changes in pore sizes did occure under the tested conditions of this study the increase in tmp for the membrane modules in the cold water temperature could be explained by the fact that the pore size decreased with the decrease in pore size the resistance of the membrane would increase and to maintain the desired flux of 30lmh the pressure that is applied to the module must increase awwa 2006 the initial permeability drop observed was understandable since the viscosity of the liquid was higher in colder temperature than room temperature however because the cold temperature was held constant the viscosity would have also been constant therefore the resistance of the membrane might have increased during its time in the cold room this increase in resistance could be attributed to the pore size shrinkage bert 1969 and therefore the pressure would have had to increase to maintain the desired flux causing permeability loss another potential reason for the permeability decline in the cold temperature could be because the na2s2o5 has the potential of precipitating on the surface of the membrane which could cause pore blocking and therefore lead to a decline in permeability shi et al 2014 when the membrane modules 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution and placed in 23 c and 35 c water for conditioning respectively the na2s2o5 that precipitated in theextreme cold temperature could have dissolved and therefore would be removed from the membrane since the solubility of na2s2o5 is 36 w w in water at 16 c anachemia 2012 however as seen in cui et al 2017 study a very small amount but not significant precipitation of na2s2o5 did occurs during the membranes time in the solution at 0 3 c treatment temperature 23 vs 35 c had a significant impact on the recovery of membrane pore structure it is generally believed that a higher treatment temperature will lead to more thermal expansion of pores sharma and chellam 2005 dang et al 2014 park et al 2016 however the benefit of using a higher treatment temperature was treatment time related a 6 h treatment was better than that at 24 h this result may suggest that the recovery of pore structure might be related to the kinetics of thermal response of pores under different treatment temperatures a higher treatment temperature led to faster kenitics and thus achieved the maximal pore size recovery in a shorter period of time while the 24 h treatment would need a longer time due to its lower kinetics thus it is suggested that there is an optimal treatment time to achieve the maximal pore structure recovery the impact of treatment time 6 vs 24 hrs on psd and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 appeared to be temperature related a careful review of fig s2 shows that a general trend of increase in d50 and d90 was observed when the treatment time was increased from 6 h to 24 h at 23 c for the same week in most cases while a general trend of decrease in d50 and d90 was observed when the treatment time was increased from 6 h to 24 h at 35 c for the same week this might suggest that a longer treatment time was needed to achieve the maximal pore structure recovery at 23 c while at a warm temperature 35 c a longer time than what is usually performed in the drinking water membrane filtration plants for chemical cleanings 6 h could result in deterioation of the recovered pore sizes as compared to the virgin membranes the small increase in the smaller pore range for 0 3ct 35 fig 7 could be related to the mechanical stress caused by continuous vacuum filtration this effect could potentially be compensated by backpulse during maintenance cleaning in full scale drinking water membrane filtration plants therefore the combination of periodical warm chemical cleaning and in situ maintenance cleaning plus backpluse could potentially achieve a full reinstallation of membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature in cold regions the results suggest that pvdf membrane structure change is almost fully reversible during cold water operation and warm water cleaning cycles therefore warm water chemical cleaning and maintenance cleaning is highly recommended for pvdf membrane drinking water filtration plants particularly those operating in cold regions the potential mechanisms for the small fraction of irreversible change in membrane structure after a three months long term operation in extreme cold water 0 3 c as shown in fig 7 might be explained by the following reasons 1 the potential formation of ice crystals in membrane pores under the extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c might lead to permanent damage of pore structure 2 the repeated extreme cold water warm water cyclic operations led to membrane fatigue 3 the mechanical stress of continuous filtration over a long term operation might also contribute to the creepage of membrane and 4 the loss of elasticity of polymeric membranes over a long term operation in future studies other membrane materials should be analyzed with the given treatment method warm water treatment to determine if this method is suitable for all membrane materials and to potentially have designed a material for membranes that is able to resist to the extreme cold temperatures in cold regions without having it undergo structural changes in addition other factors such as tortuosity could be studied to determine the impact that cold temperature has on it as well as the treatment method in the real world membrane fouling would be another important factor co existing with cold water temperatures effect in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants thus using membrane samples from full scale plants will be of more industrial significance future studies should consider that 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of membrane treatment temperature and time on the recovery of membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature the main conclusions are summarized below 1

19067,the effects of extreme cold water temperature elevated cleaning water temperature cleaning time on membrane performance and pore size distribution were studied using flat sheet polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes extreme cold water temperature led to a decrease in membrane permeability and membrane pore size shrinkage the use of periodical warm water 35 c membrane conditioning could almost completely recover the membrane permeability and pore size structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature while the use of room temperature 23 1 c conditioning recovered majority of the membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature changes in membrane performance correlate well with changes in membrane structure membranes periodically conditioned in warmer water temperature showed a higher permeability than that periodically conditioned at room temperature from a long term operation of three months the results suggest the change in pvdf membrane performance and structure caused by extreme cold water temperature is almost completely reversible after periodical warm water conditioning and thus the use of warm water conditioning

electron microscope tmp transmembrane pressure 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used for drinking water production all over the world including cold regions due to its obvious advantages such as a decrease in chemical usage more environmentally friendly reduced space requirement high product water quality easier operation and in some areas of the world communities such as cold regions it is a more practical choice pearce 2007 guo et al 2012 mohammad et al 2012 however there are various factors that can impact the performance of the membrane which include feed water characteristics type of contaminants concentration of contaminants membrane characteristics roughness pore size hydrophobicity operational conditions ph flow rate temperature and fouling wang et al 2010 krzeminski et al 2012 manawi et al 2014 the impact of feed water temperature on the membrane performance and structure is understudied uhr 2001 farahbakhsh and smith 2006 cui et al 2017 temperature is a known factor to impact feed characteristics such as viscosity the diffusivity of a contaminant surface tension etc awwa 2006 dang et al 2014 however little is known as to how cold temperature has an impact on membrane structure cui et al 2017 many areas around the world such as canada united states of america scandinavia countries russia china etc are subjected to harsher cold climates and are less studied than that of areas in the range of room and warm temperatures ozgun et al 2013 similarly some studies also observed the negative effect of psychrophilic temperature on the performance of membrane bioreactors wang et al 2009 van den brink et al 2011 ma et al 2013 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 gurung et al 2017 and the effect of cleaning water temperature on membrane permeability recovery liu et al 2000 caothien et al 2018 the impact of temperature on viscosity has been the focus on why flux decreases with a decreased temperature however based on models that are able to compensate for the viscosity change with temperature there still presents unaccountable factors that are contributing to flux decline such as the impact of temperature on the physical properties of the membrane which include lower porosity and higher tortuosity farahbakhsh and smith 2006 uhr 2001 due to this unaccountability thousands of dollars are wasted each year due to the lack of understanding of how cold water temperature impacts the physical properties of the membrane as many industries assume that flux decline is due to fouling and therefore perform unnecessary chemical cleaning on the membrane which has been shown to deteriorate the membrane structure and decrease their lifespan abdullah and bérubé 2013 in addition the factor that impacts the resistance of the membrane the most is the pore size which means that any small change in pore size can result in a large increase in resistance therefore causing an increase in pressure that is required to maintain the desired flux robinson et al 2016 in practical situations it would not be feasible to elevate the temperature of cold feed water as this would increase operating cost especially for large scale drinking water membrane filtration plants therefore it is important to have a better understanding of the impact that cold water temperature has on the performance and structure of the membranes and eventually develop strategies to recover membrane structural changes avina 2006 ozgun et al 2013 the impact of cold water temperature on the membrane filters has not been studied in great detail and to the best of our knowledge no attention has been paid as to whether or not the impact of cold water temperature on the membrane structure can be recovered or reversed completely by operating and cleaning strategies the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of cold water temperature of 0 3 c a feed water temperature often seen during the cold season for many treatment plants across canada usa scandinavia countries russia china ozgun et al 2013 on membrane performance and structure and to investigate if periodical warm water conditioning chemical cleaning would be able to partially or completely reinstall the potential membrane structure changes caused by extreme cold water temperature 2 methodology 2 1 chemicals and membrane in this study sodium metabisulphite na2s2o5 supplied by anachemia now owned by vwr was used and made into a 1 w w na2s2o5 solution as a filtration solution to prevent potential biofilm growth deionized distilled water was used throughout this experiment for this investigation virgin flat sheet membranes made out of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with a pore size of 0 1 μm dafu membrane technology co ltd jiangsu prchina were used 2 2 module the module consists of a plastic plate used to provide stability two pieces of plastic mesh material to prevent the membrane from sticking to the surface of the plate two pieces of flat sheet pvdf membrane with a total effective area of 0 03 m2 two rubber gaskets two stainless steel frames along with nuts and bolts used to secure the membrane and the gasket to the plate 2 3 experimental set up the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus used in this study is shown in fig s1 supplemental information the holding tank holds both the 1 w w na2s2o5 solution and the membrane module na2s2o5 is used in this study to prevent any biofilm growth on the membrane for the duration of the three months filtration operation xu et al 2010 cui et al 2017 the permeation was achieved by continuously pumping and recirculationg the na2s2o5 solution by a masterflex c l pump cole parmer montreal quebec and the transmembrane pressure tmp is monitored by an analog omega vacuum gauge omega korea the permeate is than collected in a graduated cylinder by measuring the amount of time it takes to collect a predetermined permeate volume to ensure that the system is at steady and stable flux the system is operated at a constant flux of 30lmh and monitored on a daily basis where minor adjustments are made if necessary to maintain the desired flux practically the instant membrane flux was maintained within the range of 30 0 0 7 lmh at 0 3 c the temperature of the 1 w w na2s2o5 solution was monitored daily to ensure that the temperature was held constant at 0 3 c maintained by a well controlled walk in cold room climate testing systems inc warminster pa and the tmp was measured from the pressure indicator the following is the coding system applied for the membrane modules operated in a 1 w w na2s2o5 solution for the duration of the three month filtration study table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions of the three different operation modes and membrane pieces d and e the selections of the duration periodical condition of every two weeks and total experimental time of 3 months flux 30 l m2 h lmh and cold temperature 0 3 c are based on the real conditions of a local membrane drinking water plant the local membrane drinking water filtration plant experiences a winter season of about 3 months with a cold raw water temperature of 0 3 1 0 c all the membranes used in the modules a b c and membrane pieces d and e were from the same roll of pvdf flat sheet membrane the initial clean water permeability of module a b and c were 1015 23lmh bar 1007 5 lmh bar and 1074 4lmh bar at 20 c respectively 2 4 permeability every two weeks two of the modules a and b were taken out of the cold room then placed treated in either 23 c or 35 c water for a duration of 6 h while the third module module c having a flux of 30 lmh was kept in the cold room and operated continuously without room temperature and warm water treatment the selection of a 6 h conditioning is based on the fact that 6 h chemical cleaning is usually used for recovery chemical cleaning in a number of membrane filtration plants the 35 c water was maintained using a water bath after 6 h the clean water permeability of the modules was determined by using deionized distilled water at 23 c by generating a graph of membrane flux vs tmp the pure water permeability was determined based on the slope of the graph the tmp used for the determination of pure water permeability ranged from 0 022 bar to 0 061 bar once the permeability test was complete the two modules were immediately placed back into the cold room for another two weeks continuous filtration operation until the same treatment process is applied again this will continue for the three month duration the permeability of the membrane modules in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution was determined using equation 1 which is a modification of cui et al 2017 to be applied for a plate and frame module the tmp of the membrane modules in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution ranged from 0 046 bar to 0 093 bar 1 p q δ p a v t δ p 2 w h where p specific permeability of the membrane lmh bar q flow rate of the permeate l h δp tmp bar a effective

for clean water permeability determination varied from 21 to 25 c therefore to ensure consistency the permeability obtained was corrected using equation 2 bogati 2014 so that the permeability shown is

experiment is compared to that of the permeability of the modules after being subjected to cold temperature operation and treated and is seen in equation 3 cui et al 2017 3 n o r m a l i z e d p e r m

and e with no filtration 0 lmh were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution in the cold room and two 1 cm 4 cm segments were cut from each membrane immediately and put into liquid nitrogen for 10 min for sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy sem images for pore size distribution psd determination then the remaining membrane pieces d and e were placed into 23 c and 35 c water respectively for 6 h and consecutively another 18 h conditioning a total of 24 h conditioning one 1 cm 4 cm segment of membrane was cut from each membrane d and e after 6 h and 24 h conditioning respectively and put into liquid nitrogen for 10 min after completion of a total of 24 h conditioning remaining membranes d and e were immediately placed back into the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution for another two weeks storage and the same process was applied for the three month duration the membrane segments 1 cm 4 cm after liquid nitrogen freezing were cut into two 1 cm 1 cm samples these 1 cm 1 cm samples were placed onto a metal holder having carbon tape on it and then a coating of carbon was sputtered on using sputter coater model 12560 fullam usa these coated samples were placed under an sem su 70 hitachi japan and images of the surface of the membrane were taken over different regions of the same piece of membrane at different magnifications only the sem images taken at a magnification of 100 k were used to determine membrane pore size and its distribution two pieces of segments were prepared for each set of tests so as to have a replicate and during sem analysis approximately seven to twenty sem images at the 500 nm scale were used for membrane segments for psd determination for a total of 700 pores sample the images used to determine the psd were randomly selected until 700 pores were measured for each set of tests the software used to measure the pores of the membrane was imagej version 1 51p national institutes of health usa the reproducibility of the sem psd was verified by counting a large number of membrane pores fig 1 shows the effect of randomly counted pore size number on the accumulative frequency psd d10 10 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number d50 50 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number and d90 90 of pores number with an equivalent diameter smaller than this number it is clear that the number of counted pore size had a limited impact on the accumulative frequency psd d10 d50 and d90 when the counted pore size number was larger than about 500 thus a large number of pores 700 pores sample were used in this study to ensure the repeatability of sem psd and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 in this study fig 1 shows that the sem technique used in this study provides reliable information on the pore sizes of the pvdf membranes at a counted pore number of 700 pores each sample similarly at the end of the three month filtration operation membrane samples were taken from membrane modules a b and c for sem analysis 0 3ct 23 module a 0 3ct 35 module b were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 and placed in 23 c and 35 c water respectively for 6 h treatment the clean water permeability was than determined and the modules were then placed back into 23 c and 35 c water for an additional 6 h conditioning to maintain the membrane structure at the desired temperatures after the 6 h treatment the same technique for preparing the sem for membrane pieces d and e were applied for 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 module membrane samples however six segments were taken from each module top middle and bottom six segments were also taken from 0 3ct nt membrane module after permeation was halted for 6 h in the 0 3 c 1 w w na2s2o5 solution a piece of virgin membrane was also prepared for sem so as to be able to compare any changes that may have occurred during the study 3 results 3 1 tmp permeability at 0 3 c and normalized permeability the variations in tmp of the three membrane modules operating in 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution is shown in fig 2 the tmp steadily increased for 0 3ct nt until it reached a plateau near the end of the experimental run the highest tmp reached was 0 093bar the average tmp before and after 23 c treatment for 0 3ct 23 were 0 067 0 003 bar and 0 055 0 003 bar respectively the average tmp before and after 35 c treatment for 0 3ct 35 were 0 059 0 003 bar and 0 048 0 004 bar respectively the results suggested that membranes treated at 23 c and 35 c reduced tmp as compared to operating at 0 3 c with no treatment and a higher treatment temperature 35 c led to a further reduction in tmp the initial permeability of the membrane modules at room temperature for 0 3ct nt 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 are 1074 4lmh bar 1015 23lmh bar and 1007 5lmh bar respectively the change in permeability of the membrane modules operating in 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution is shown in fig 3 the permeability of 0 3ct nt slowly but steadily decreased during its duration in 0 3 c the lowest permeability was 307 6 0 0 lmh bar for the 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 after each treatment a recovery of permeability was clearly observed however the permeability slowly decreased with time in the two weeks filtration but reached to a plateau value that was higher than that of the 0 3ct nt module without treatment the average permeability before and after 23 c treatment for 0 3ct 23 were 441 0 15 3 lmh bar and 557 5 29 8 lmh bar respectively the average permeability before and after 35 c treatment for 0 3ct 35 were 501 3 29 9 lmh bar and 632 4 57 3 lmh bar respectively the higher treatment temperature 35 c led to a higher recovery of permeability and maintained a higher operating permeability after being taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 were treated with 23 c and 35 c deionized distilled water respectively for 6 h after every two weeks operation in 0 3 c the normalized permeability of 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 after being treated is shown in fig 4 the permeability of 0 3ct 23 was never able to fully recover p0 1015 23lmh bar while 0 3ct 35 was completely recovered p0 1007 5lmh bar 3 2 morphology and pore sizes of membranes from sem images the sem images of the virgin membrane membrane pieces d and e 0 h and 6 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c respectively after 8 weeks storage at 0 3 c cold water are shown in fig 5 as is seen pores with different pore sizes were observed from all the sem images at 500 nm scale indicating a psd existed the pores showed different shapes thus an equivalent pore diameter was used for each pore size characterization from each pore area in the sem images furthermore the pore sizes from 0 h conditioning fig 5 b and 5 d were obviously smaller than that after 6 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c and the virgin membrane the evidence suggests that room temperature and warm water temperature conditionings were able to recover the pore sizes shrinkages caused by extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c 3 3 comparison of pore parameters and psd of membranes conditioned at different temperatures and times fig 6 shows the representative psds of membranes after 0 h 6 h and 24 h conditioning at 23 c and 35 c on average the pore size shifted towards a smaller size when the membrane was under cold temperature conditions while after being treated in warm water 23 c or 35 c there appeared to be a higher frequency of the medium to large pores implying there were more larger pores after treatments the results suggested that conditioning of membrane at 23 c and 35 c could reinstall the membrane structure pore size loss caused by extreme cold water temperature the effects of storage time treatment water temperature 23 vs 35 c and treatment time 6 and 24 h on the fractions of large membrane pores 30 nm and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 are shown in table 2 and fig s2 supplemental information respectively the rational to focus on the fractions of large pores 30 nm in table 2 is due to the fact that a small increase in the fraction of large pores could lead to a significant increase in membrane flux and permeability masselin et al 2001 in general there was a larger fraction of large pores 30 nm when the membrane was treated with 35 c than that treated with 23 c water in most cases table 2 the most significant difference in the fraction of large pores 30 nm was demonstrated at the 6 h conditioning the difference between 23 c and 35 c conditioning was reduced with an increase in treatment time at 24 h table 2 a further comparison of pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 was conducted as shown in table 3 and fig s2 supplemental materials changes of the pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 of membranes d and e storage in extreme cold temperature 0 3 c with experimental time were observed it appeared that pore sizes started to have some shrinkage after 2 weeks in extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c as compared to virgin membranes but stabilized after 2 4 weeks this was repeatedly observed in every two weeks cold water storage room temperature and warm water conditioning cycle a relatively stable d10 d50 and d90 were observed after the 4th or 6th week fig s2 for comparison purposes the average values of the d10 d50 and d90 from weeks 6 8 10 and 12 under different conditioning temperature and times were summarized and compared to the virgin membrane table 3 statistical analyses analysis of variances anova and student t test clearly showed that there was a difference in d10 d50 and d90 between 0 h conditioning and the virgin membrane student t test p 0 05 and between 0 h and 6 and or 24 h conditioning at both 23 c and 35 c student t test p 0 05 indicating that extreme cold temperature storage indeed caused pore size shrinkage and that room temperature and warm temperature conditionings could recover the pores size shrinkages further statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference in d90 after 6 h treatments between 23 c and 35 c t test p 0 05 which indicated a larger fraction of large pores after 35 c treatment and is consistent with the results summarized in table 2 3 4 comparison of membrane psd of module a b and c at the end of filtration operation the psd of the virgin membrane as well as membranes from the three membrane modules that were operated in the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution at 30lmh for three months are shown in fig 7 a 53 of the measured pores of the virgin membrane were below 15 nm while the membrane that had no treatment 0 3ct nt for the three month operation had a higher frequency 68 of smaller pores below 15 nm or a smaller frequency 32 of medium to large pores above 15 nm as compared to 0 3ct 23 60 8 below 15 nm and 39 2 above 15 nm and 0 3ct 35 58 6 below 15 nm and 41 4 above 15 nm furthermore there was a higher frequency of pores in the range of 15 20 nm and 20 25 nm medium pores or larger than 30 nm for module b 0 3ct 35 that was periodically treated at a higher temperature 35 c as compared to that treated at 23 c the membrane psd of module 0 3ct 35 was close to that of the virgin membrane the changes in pore sizes can be better observed in fig 7 b which shows the plots of the accumulative frequency vs pore size of the virgin membrane and membranes from the three modules after three month operation the results clearly show that the use of the membrane module in cold temperature lead to a significant shrinkage of the membrane pores while treating the membrane with elevated temperatures lead to reversibility close to the original membrane pore size 4 discussion this study shows that the membrane performance and pore size after being subjected to an extreme cold temperature of 0 3 c can be recovered almost fully or fully through treating the membrane every two weeks with 23 c and 35 c water conditioning or chemical cleaning in drinking water treatment plants for 6 h the 35 c water provided a full recovery of the performance of the membrane permeability while the 23 c treatment provided partial recovery it was never able to reach full restoration at room temperature which cui et al 2017 also observed the full recovery of permeability after 35 c conditioning as compared to the majority about 80 permeability recovery after 23 c conditioning figs 3 and 4 can be explained by the fact that a larger fraction of larger pores existed after 35 c conditioning table 2 and fig 7 the larger fraction of large pores 30 nm were generally found over the membrane surface after 35 c conditioning could effectively lead to a very large increase in permeability masselin et al 2001 the recovery of the permeability of the membrane modules could also be explained because the pore size recovered partially or almost fully back to its original size after being treated in 23 c and 35 c water the results of the increase in pore sizes after 23 and 35 c treatments are consistent with the results from the literature sharma and chellam 2005 dang et al 2014 an increase in pore size at elevated temperatures was also found through sharma and chellam 2005 study on flat sheet polyamide nanofilter with the use of a hydrodynamic transport model using a hindrance transport model dang et al 2014 found that when the temperature changed from 20 to 40 c the pore radius of the polyamide nanofilter membrane increased from 0 39 to 0 44 nm the magnitutide of changes in pore sizes in this study was larger than that observed by sharma and chellam 2005 and dang et al 2014 indicating that significant changes in pore sizes did occure under the tested conditions of this study the increase in tmp for the membrane modules in the cold water temperature could be explained by the fact that the pore size decreased with the decrease in pore size the resistance of the membrane would increase and to maintain the desired flux of 30lmh the pressure that is applied to the module must increase awwa 2006 the initial permeability drop observed was understandable since the viscosity of the liquid was higher in colder temperature than room temperature however because the cold temperature was held constant the viscosity would have also been constant therefore the resistance of the membrane might have increased during its time in the cold room this increase in resistance could be attributed to the pore size shrinkage bert 1969 and therefore the pressure would have had to increase to maintain the desired flux causing permeability loss another potential reason for the permeability decline in the cold temperature could be because the na2s2o5 has the potential of precipitating on the surface of the membrane which could cause pore blocking and therefore lead to a decline in permeability shi et al 2014 when the membrane modules 0 3ct 23 and 0 3ct 35 were taken out of the 0 3 c na2s2o5 solution and placed in 23 c and 35 c water for conditioning respectively the na2s2o5 that precipitated in theextreme cold temperature could have dissolved and therefore would be removed from the membrane since the solubility of na2s2o5 is 36 w w in water at 16 c anachemia 2012 however as seen in cui et al 2017 study a very small amount but not significant precipitation of na2s2o5 did occurs during the membranes time in the solution at 0 3 c treatment temperature 23 vs 35 c had a significant impact on the recovery of membrane pore structure it is generally believed that a higher treatment temperature will lead to more thermal expansion of pores sharma and chellam 2005 dang et al 2014 park et al 2016 however the benefit of using a higher treatment temperature was treatment time related a 6 h treatment was better than that at 24 h this result may suggest that the recovery of pore structure might be related to the kinetics of thermal response of pores under different treatment temperatures a higher treatment temperature led to faster kenitics and thus achieved the maximal pore size recovery in a shorter period of time while the 24 h treatment would need a longer time due to its lower kinetics thus it is suggested that there is an optimal treatment time to achieve the maximal pore structure recovery the impact of treatment time 6 vs 24 hrs on psd and pore parameters d10 d50 and d90 appeared to be temperature related a careful review of fig s2 shows that a general trend of increase in d50 and d90 was observed when the treatment time was increased from 6 h to 24 h at 23 c for the same week in most cases while a general trend of decrease in d50 and d90 was observed when the treatment time was increased from 6 h to 24 h at 35 c for the same week this might suggest that a longer treatment time was needed to achieve the maximal pore structure recovery at 23 c while at a warm temperature 35 c a longer time than what is usually performed in the drinking water membrane filtration plants for chemical cleanings 6 h could result in deterioation of the recovered pore sizes as compared to the virgin membranes the small increase in the smaller pore range for 0 3ct 35 fig 7 could be related to the mechanical stress caused by continuous vacuum filtration this effect could potentially be compensated by backpulse during maintenance cleaning in full scale drinking water membrane filtration plants therefore the combination of periodical warm chemical cleaning and in situ maintenance cleaning plus backpluse could potentially achieve a full reinstallation of membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature in cold regions the results suggest that pvdf membrane structure change is almost fully reversible during cold water operation and warm water cleaning cycles therefore warm water chemical cleaning and maintenance cleaning is highly recommended for pvdf membrane drinking water filtration plants particularly those operating in cold regions the potential mechanisms for the small fraction of irreversible change in membrane structure after a three months long term operation in extreme cold water 0 3 c as shown in fig 7 might be explained by the following reasons 1 the potential formation of ice crystals in membrane pores under the extreme cold water temperature 0 3 c might lead to permanent damage of pore structure 2 the repeated extreme cold water warm water cyclic operations led to membrane fatigue 3 the mechanical stress of continuous filtration over a long term operation might also contribute to the creepage of membrane and 4 the loss of elasticity of polymeric membranes over a long term operation in future studies other membrane materials should be analyzed with the given treatment method warm water treatment to determine if this method is suitable for all membrane materials and to potentially have designed a material for membranes that is able to resist to the extreme cold temperatures in cold regions without having it undergo structural changes in addition other factors such as tortuosity could be studied to determine the impact that cold temperature has on it as well as the treatment method in the real world membrane fouling would be another important factor co existing with cold water temperatures effect in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants thus using membrane samples from full scale plants will be of more industrial significance future studies should consider that 5 conclusions this study investigated the effects of membrane treatment temperature and time on the recovery of membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature the main conclusions are summarized below 1 extreme cold water temperature led to the deterioation of membrane performance and structure pore size shrinkage 2 periodically membrane treatment at room temperature about 23 c or warm temperature 35 c significantly recovered the membrane permeability and structure pore size loss caused by extreme cold water temperature 3 a higher treatment temperature 35 c led to a better recovery of membrane permeability and structure at 6 h treatment 4 structure change of pvdf membrane caused by extreme cold water temperature was mainly reversible after treatment at 35 c at 6 h 5 chemical cleaning of

methanogenic process from organic compounds remains an enigma after decades of empirical operation in this study simplified ad microbial communities were obtained with substrate specifications and continuous reactor operation genome centric metagenomic approach was followed to holistically investigate the metabolic pathways of the ad and the microbial synergistic networks in total 63 metagenome assembled genomes mags were assembled from 8 metagenomes acquired in specific methanogenic niches the metabolic pathways were reconstructed from the annotated genes and their dynamicity under experimental conditions the results show that the methanogenic niches nourish unique metabolism beyond current knowledge acquired from cultivation based methods a novel glucose mineralization model without acetate formation was proposed and asserted in a pair of syntrophs clostridiaceae sp and methanoculleus thermophilus moreover the catabolic pathway was elucidated in uncharacterized syntrophic acetate oxidizers synergistaceae spp a remarkable evolutionary insight is the discovery that electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms impose selective pressure on syntrophic partners overall the functional roles of the individual microbes tightly rely on the catabolic pathways and cannot always be physiologically defined in accordance with conventional four step ad concept the substrate specific systems provided a traceable microbial community to dissecting the ad process the genome centric metagenomics successfully constructed genomes of microbes that have not been

conversion rittmann et al 2008 shah et al 2016 ad microbiome remains partially elucidated because the community is rich in uncharacterized taxa and difficult to explore with traditional cultivation based methods campanaro et al 2016 therefore molecular techniques especially based on dna sequencing are nowadays widely used to unravel ad microbial ecology nevertheless traditional marker gene approaches such as dna amplicon sequencing failed to fully characterize the entire microbial community and their functionalities due to ambiguous taxonomy assignment and the presence of uncharacterized microorganisms from known and candidate taxa without cultivated representatives rivière et al 2009 in order to bypass this limitation metagenomics sequencing of bulk dna from environmental samples was applied to analyse the metabolic potential of the microbial community tsapekos et al 2017 moreover the advent of novel bioinformatic methods has allowed us to move beyond the characterized microbes existing in public database and brings the possibility to discover new lineages metabolic pathways and microbial interactions campanaro et al 2016 nobu et al 2015 the genome centric metagenomic also led to the proposal of novel candidate species and revealed the rationale of microbial dynamicity towards deterministic operational factors such as change of substrates chemical composition kougias et al 2017 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 up to now the majority of metagenomic studies have been conducted with real feedstocks such as manure wastewater and organic waste luo et al 2016 treu et al 2016a that create robust niches for extremely diverse microbial consortia and complex metabolic activities therefore the correlation between specific microbial members and their functionalities are difficult to be determined due to the versatile metabolism required for heterogeneous substrates degradation few studies have used an engineered synthetic ad system where the carbon source nutrition level and operational parameters were controlled to simplify the microbial community in order to reveal metabolic activity and interactions of the keystone species embree et al 2015 lü et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2016 however the overlap in metabolic capability inherent to ad communities hindered the exact identification of microbial functional roles in ad food chain the current research used synthetic substrates to simulate engineered ad systems containing certain subsets of ad steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis more specifically microbiomes responsible for degradation of polysaccharides avicel monosaccharides glucose volatile fatty acids vfa mixture and acetic acid were characterized using genome centric metagenomics approach the functionality of each mag was inferred according to its dynamicity during the transition between substrates and its gene content an integrated cellulose catabolic network was reconstructed according to gene annotations including a novel glucose degradation pathway moreover the electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms were specifically analysed for obligatory syntrophs the results of the current study elucidated the microbial ecology of simplified ad microbial communities and highlighted several important regulations for microbial syntrophy the gained knowledge will assist unraveling the microbial black box and contribute to further optimization of ad process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the microbial communities analysed in this study were obtained from a continuously fed lab scale methanogenic reactor empirical conditions for sufficient thermophilic ad were adopted i e 55 c as operational temperature and 15 days as hydraulic retention time hrt the reactor was initially inoculated with digestate from snertinge thermophilic biogas plant denmark which is operated with mainly manures and with organic food wastes providing a microbiome that can mediate all ad steps for heterogeneous substrates the experiment consisted of four periods and the feedstock used in each period was basal media supplemented with organic compound stepwise simplified following the biochemical degradation steps namely avicel polysaccharide glucose monosaccharide vfa mixture acetate propionate butyrate 2 6 1 1 3 8 in mass and acetic acid the organic loading rates olr used for sugar substrates avicel and glucose were 1g vs l reactor day and for intermediates were sequentially halved 0 5 g vs l reactor day for vfa and 0 25 g vs l reactor day for acetic acid detailed feedstock composition is presented in supplementary information table s1 total sugar concentrations methane yields vfa concentrations and ph values in the reactor were recorded to evaluate the digestion process the unutilized sugars were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatograph hp series1100 germany equipped with a column biorad aminex hpx 87 h at 63 c and a refractive index detector rid1362a using 0 6 ml min of 4 mm h2so4 as eluent the daily biogas production was quantified using a water replacement gas meter and methane concentration was measured using a gas chromatograph mikrolab aarhus a s denmark equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd as previously described kougias et al 2015 other digestion products including vfa and ethanol concentration were measured using a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 2010 af kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid as described by kougias et al 2015 2 2 dna extraction and sequencing reactor samples were obtained at the steady states of each experimental period and genomic dna was extracted with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio powersoil carlsbad ca usa with an additional phenol cleaning step in order to improve dna purification the quality and quantity of the dna extract were evaluated with nanodrop and gel electrophoresis the results showed that the dna was pure and in good integrity the detailed data and figures were presented in supplementary information dna library preparation was performed in technical duplicates according to nextera xt kit illumina san diego ca and sequentially sequenced using illumina nextseq 500 sequencer 2x150bp illumina san diego ca at ramaciotti centre for genomics unsw sydney australia sequence data were deposited at the sequence read archive sra ncbi under bioproject prjna416337 sample specific accession numbers are listed in supplementary information table s2 2 3 genome centric metagenomics and statistics metagenomic assembly and binning process were previously described by campanaro et al 2016 and all the perl scripts sere obtained from http www biogasmicrobiome com binning process v1 briefly all metagenomes were co assembled with clc workbench and binned with a process that was based on hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection combining taxonomic investigation with clustering of coverage profiles albertsen et al 2013 the mag coverage was calculated from the average number of sequencing reads aligned with metagenomics assemblies in each sequencing sample using bowtie 2 software v2 2 4 and bedtools package v2 17 0 langmead and salzberg 2012 quinlan and hall 2010 mags with high relative abundance normalized coverage higher than 0 8 in at least one experimental condition were selected for functional analysis the relative population abundance was calculated by the percentage of selected mag coverage compared to total coverage all mags were visualized and organized into hierarchical dendrograms according to their coverage and dynamicity during four experimental periods using mev software with pearson correlation metrics and average linkage clustering saeed et al 2003 the basic mag properties and the metrics of the assembled genomes including genome size completeness and contamination were evaluated with checkm parks et al 2015 taxonomical assignment for the mags was obtained using phylophlan v0 99 segata et al 2013 those having incomplete confidence were checked using phylopythias web server patil et al 2012 and assigned to a clade only when more than 50 of the genome sequence displayed coherent results the average nucleotide identity ani was calculated as previously described by varghese et al 2015 and was used to find genomes belonging to the same species in the ncbi microbial genome database as previously described and mags recovered in previous metagenomics binning studies campanaro et al 2018 kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016b for all mags gene prediction was performed by prodigal v2 6 2 run in metagenomic mode hyatt et al 2010 protein encoding genes were annotated using reverse position specific blast algorithm and using cog rpsblast database galperin et al 2014 with e value lower cut off as 1e 5 in addition genes were also annotated according to kegg database using ghostkoala and the predicted genes for each mag were analyzed using foam software in order to refine kegg pathways and modules prediction kanehisa et al 2016 prestat et al 2014 for mag involved in avicel and glucose degradation all predicted genes were annotated using dbcan software yin et al 2012 moreover for high quality mags the detailed catabolic pathways were manually asserted gene by gene according to previously defined enzymology mechanisms 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the metagenomes were acquired from a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with a series of specific substrates namely avicel glucose vfa and acetic acid the operational condition was favourable for the development of methanogenic microbial community inside the reactor thus during the experiment methane was stably produced as the main digestion product together with a trace amount of vfa acetate and propionate table 1 vfa with more than three carbon atoms and alcohol products were undetected throughout the experiment it is well known that the vfa are the intermediate products during anaerobic digestion thus their detection in low levels indicate a well functioning process the ph of the reactor was maintained between 6 7 and 8 2 which are the values within the optimum range of methanogenesis the highest ph value was recorded during the period that the reactor was fed with the medium containing vfa mixture probably due to the stoichiometrically low production of carbon dioxide during this condition batstone et al 2002 3 2 mags reconstruction the ad microbiome was dissected with a genome centric metagenomic approach high throughput sequencing data were filtered assembled and binned with a hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection approach resulting in a total of 63 mags supplementary information table s3 specifically our discussion focused on a specific selection of highly abundant microbes including 21 high quality mags more than 70 completeness and lower than 10 contamination 12 medium low quality mags lower than 70 completeness and lower than 10 contamination and two meta mags contamination higher than 80 the selected mags were taxonomically assigned into four bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum namely firmicutes synergistetes chloroflexi bacteroidetes and euryarchaeota fig 1 these members were known to play important roles during thermophilic ad process de vrieze and verstraete 2016 rivière et al 2009 the continuous operation of the reactor with selected substrates imposed specific and constant selective pressures to the microbial survival the experimental conditions shaped simplified microbial communities by washing out the microbes that are not supported for growth by the substrates the results highlighted considerably distinctive community compositions specific for avicel glucose vfa mixture and acetic acid degradation as the substrate was stepwise simplified according to ad steps the metabolic role of each mag could be deduced by its presence absence under the specific influent substrate fig 1 hierarchical clustering performed on the mags coverage profiles showed that 31 bacterial mags could be clustered into four groups correlating to their catabolic traits g1 avicel degradation bacterial community g2 glucose degradation bacterial community g3 vfa degradation bacterial community and g4 acetate degradation bacterial community all the selected bacterial mag groups are representative of the entire community because combined with the corresponding archaeal community they accounted for over 90 of the entire microbial community during each experimental period therefore we propose that those mag groups harbour the entire set of genes independently that are responsible for aiding methanogens to complete the biomethanation process from the chosen substrate regarding high quality mags their metabolic capability has been further confirmed by pathway assertion the gene profiles of all mags were manually inspected and 92 enzymes are selected to cover the main metabolic reactions involved in the ad of specific substrates fig 2 supplementary information table s4 s6 s7 and s8 the hydrolysis step was only active during avicel degradation and mainly mediated by extracellular enzymes the following acidogenesis step was performed by both g1 and g2 through embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway romano and conway 1996 however the majority of key genes for propionate and butyrate biosynthesis were absent indicating these compounds were not formed during sufficient avicel and glucose degradation acetogenesis was performed through multiple pathways depending on starting substrates more specifically acetogenesis from pyruvate was mainly observed in g1 and g2 as indicated by the presence of pyruvate ferredoxin driven oxidoreductase genes ec 1 2 7 1 pfor in addition acetogenesis from propionate and butyrate were recorded in g3 via methylmalonyl coenzyme a pathway and β oxidation pathway respectively müller et al 2010 methanogenesis was performed by four archaeal mags with different metabolic traits corresponding to the change in the bacterial community the interconversion of direct methanogenic substrates i e acetate and co2 h2 was also examined with genes for syntrophic acetate oxidation sao homoacetogenesis including the conventional wood ljungdahl wl pathway and a novel pathway through glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway müller et al 2016 nobu et al 2015 3 3 avicel adapted community g1 consisted of 9 bacterial mags with extremely uneven distribution dtu0444 dominated the microbial community with a relative abundance of 53 following by dtu0497 14 seven out of nine mags including dtu0444 and dtu0497 were taxonomically assigned to phylum firmicutes members of which was previously proven to play important roles in the thermophilic cellulolytic process by producing a complex of multi cellulolytic enzymes namely cellulosome azman et al 2015 however in contrast with previous findings neither dtu0444 nor dtu0497 were found to encode proteins involved in cellulosome formation ziganshin et al 2013 supplementary information table s5 despite some mags containing various cellulolytic genes all firmicutes spp in g1 shared genes encoding specific endoglucanase ec 3 2 1 4 suggesting that this enzyme is essential for the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in thermophilic ad process supplementary information table s9 the remaining two mags specific of g1 dtu0435 and dtu0433 belonged to chloroflexi and rikenellaceae phyla respectively and contained distinct gene profiles encoding carbohydrate binding domains in comparison with firmicutes spp supplementary information table s4 as presented in fig 1 the relative abundance of the archaeal community during avicel degradation is extremely low suggesting that methanogens have much lower cell yields than hydrolytic bacteria the difference in cell yields could attribute to the energy released during substrates utilization more specifically the high atp gained through phosphorolytic cleavage of β glucosidic bonds in dtu0444 promotes its dominance in the microbial community zhang and lynd 2005 on the other hands the electron transport phosphorylation in methanogenic archaea provides limited energy for cells growth leading to their lower abundance deppenmeier et al 1996 dtu0440 identified as obligatory hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus thermophilus was the most abundant archaea indicating the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis during avicel degradation dtu0439 identified as methanosarcina thermophila was also present during avicel degradation but in lower abundance methanosarcina spp have been suggested to be mixotrophic but mainly acetoclastic methanogens consistently m thermophila showed very weak methane production activity from co2 h2 with the absence of methanol zinder et al 1985 moreover m thermophila known as methanogens with cytochromes is not able to compete for h2 with methanogens without cytochromes dtu0440 under the condition that prevails in their natural environments thauer et al 2008 thus the functional role of m thermophila was assigned as acetoclastic methanogen in the current study 3 4 glucose adapted community during glucose degradation the entire g1 decreased significantly in relative abundance and the bacterial community evolved into a more specialized g2 with five representative mags fig 1 the most abundant mag dtu0446 belonged to clostridiaceae and counted for 36 5 of the total community followed by methanoculleus thermophilus that counted for 33 0 mags with cellulolytic genes were outcompeted by dtu0446 which contains the genetic material encoding glucose permease ec 2 7 3 9 of phosphotransferase system pts to transport the glucose from the periplasm or extracellular space into the cytoplasm and phosphorylates supplementary information table s9 the predominance of dtu0446 contradicts previous study showing that mainly low abundant community members utilize pts to transport sugars in manure based biogas reactors campanaro et al 2016 the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that pts favours the transportation of extracellular free glucose which is not abundant in natural substrates i e such as livestock manure while polysaccharide hydrolysates probably employed an alternative mechanism for substrate uptake ikeda et al 2011 none of the g2 mags encoded the complete wl pathway or and were present in acetate degradation community g4 indicating a week sao capability in cooperation with methanogens moreover methanoculleus thermophilus an obligatory h2 utilizing methanogen was the only abundant archaeal mag during glucose degradation suggesting that the majority of methane was produced via the hydrogenotrophic pathway the absence of both sao and acetoclastic methanogenesis suggests that acetate is not a necessary intermediate product during glucose catabolism thus we propose a novel glucose degradation model combining emp glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation through glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway nobu et al 2015 this model can be curated based on gene contents of the two most abundant microbes dtu0446 and dtu0440 in glucose degradation community fig 3 supplementary information table s9 specifically in dtu0446 glucose is firstly degraded to pyruvate through emp and then to co2 through the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway in addition the rhodobacter nitrogen fixation complex rnf was found in dtu0446 utilizing the reverse proton motive force to produce the reduced ferredoxin for electron disposal in the form of h2 schmehl et al 1993 the produced co2 h2 can be further utilized by dtu0440 for methanogenesis 3 5 vfa adapted community vfa degraders are postulated to play an important role in ad communities scavenging the intermediates produced during primary fermentation during the third experimental period m thermophilus dtu0440 and m thermophila dtu0439 presented at the relative abundance of 19 4 and 6 3 respectively regarding bacterial community all g3 members accounted at extremely low relative abundance during avicel and glucose degradation except dtu0445 this observation is consistent with a previous study stating that lactate butyrate and formate were not involved in glucose degradation and propionate degraders accounted for less than 2 of total population ito et al 2012 unfortunately dtu0445 was identified as a cluster of several organisms due to high contamination of the genome genes for both glucose and vfa catabolism are present in this metagenome and are probably derived from a cluster of bacteria with high relative abundance in both g2 and g3 other mags with the exception of dtu0445 were evenly distributed with the relative abundance spanning from 2 9 to 7 2 fig 1 three mags dtu0451 dtu0456 and dtu0457 belong to a carboxylic acids utilizing family syntrophomonadaceae and the high quality representative genome dtu0451 contains the complete genes for butyrate degradation hatamoto et al 2008 on the contrary dtu0485 dtu0493 and dtu0495 in g3 contain genes responsible for propionate degradation which agrees with previously reported catabolic capability for isolates from the same taxa namely peptococcaceae synergistaceae and firmicutes honda et al 2013 imachi et al 2002 shigematsu et al 2006 both butyrate and propionate degradation are thermodynamically endergonic processes under the standard condition and require obligate syntrophic coupling with hydrogenotrophic methanogens m thermophiles which lowers the products mainly h2 concentration and thereby reduces the gibbs free energy change at real reactor conditions acetic acid both originating from the influent to the reactor and produced during acetogenesis promotes acetoclastic methanogenesis leading to an increment of m thermophile dtu0439 moreover several mags contain genes related to sao homoacetogenesis and consequentially shift the methanogenic pathways from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic or vice versa specifically dtu0455 and dtu0493 harbour the complete gene set to encode the proposed sao pathway through the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway nobu et al 2015 moreover acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase were also present in dtu0445 3 6 acetic acid adapted community a further increase of m thermophila was observed suggesting an enhancement of acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway when compared to the previous experimental periods nevertheless the acetate metabolizing bacteria g4 accounted for 70 1 of the total microbial community suggesting conversion of acetate to h2 co2 providing evidence that the ultimate methanogenesis was through the hydrogenotrophic path g4 consisted of previously identified sao bacteria including six mags belonging to firmicutes two mags belonging to synergistaceae and one mag belonging to bacteroidetes hattori 2008 the most abundant taxon was synergistaceae spp with two representative mags dtu0491 and dtu0492 that accounted for 17 9 and 8 5 of the total microbial community respectively the high abundance of this taxon suggested a role for sao under methanogenic environment and this result is in accordance with a stable isotope based functional study mosbæk et al 2016 however the majority of synergistetes isolates were only functionally connected with amino acid fermentation while the acetate oxidizing capability was never explored from a genomic point of view surprisingly the genes for acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase were absent from both dtu0491 and dtu0492 suggesting that they unlikely perform conventional sao through wl pathway supplementary information table s9 on the contrary dtu0491 contains the almost complete gene sets to perform the novel sao suggested in thermotogae spp by nobu et al 2015 with only one transferase absent ec 2 1 2 10 considering that the size of dtu0491 1 43 mb is smaller than the reported isolate 1 68 3 28 mb and it is 75 complete we also examined the gene contents of other publically available synergistetes genomes to address a more solid argumentation supplementary information table s10 in particular 27 publically available synergistetes genomes in genomes online database gold database were investigated to putatively assert the sao pathways reddy et al 2014 the results showed that ec 2 1 2 10 which is missing in dtu0491 is commonly present in synergistetes spp including anaerobaculum sp dtu043 binned in a previous project unpublished data this result suggests that its absence in dtu0491 was probably because it was not recovered during assembly or binning moreover none of analysed genome harbours gene for acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase but 20 out of 29 tested genomes contain almost complete gene sets less than two blocks missing to perform thermotogae like sao for energy conservation rnf and ion translocating ferredoxin ifo that are commonly used by sao bacteria were not present in dtu0491 nobu et al 2015 instead we found genes encoding subunits of synergistete specific f420 reducing hydrogenase implying the possibility that coenzyme f420 might be used as electron carriers to drive redox reactions and directly release electrons in the form of h2 another interesting observation is the proliferation of methanothermobacter sp dtu0441 in g4 while m thermophilus decreased significantly in relative abundance the central genes for methanogenesis are highly conserved in both mag hydrogenotrophic and the main differences of their gene profiles were observed in cobalamin biosynthesis flagellum structure and biogenesis and multisubunit na h antiporter 4 discussion the distinct community compositions during avicel glucose vfa and acetate degradation suggested that the ad community is composed of fastidious microorganisms proliferating only in specific ecological niches the dramatic shifts between g1 and g2 is consisted with a previous study where a significant difference in microbial community composition was reported between glucose and starch feeding digesters tang et al 2015 thus these results suggested that although hydrolysis is an extracellular process polymerization degree and molecular structures of the substrates could impose selective pressure on fermentative bacteria probably due to their different substrate uptake system this could be one of the many reasons that ad pre treatment technologies change the overall microbial community composition rather than affects only the hydrolytic bacteria tsapekos et al 2017 it has been long postulated that methanogenic niches form obligate synergistic networks among microbes to drive the reactions near thermodynamic equilibria such as vfa and alcohol degradation narihiro et al 2015 however it is overlooked that these synergistic activities could also enable the bacteria to form energetically unfavourable digestion products from fermentable substrates such as glucose schröder et al 1994 a novel glucose degradation pathway was asserted in uncharacterized firmicutes sp dtu0446 which is the predominant bacteria during glucose degradation in this pathway the conventional pfor driven pyruvate oxidation is replaced by glycine cleavage system with the methyl branch of the wl pathway to circumvent the extremely thermodynamically unfavourable acetate oxidation dolfing 2014 this proposal suggested that methanogenic pathways are occurring though synergistic relationships with bacteria having metabolic capabilities different from those of cultivated strains it is well known that the ad community is a trove of uncultivated microorganisms and therefore we believe that more specialised pathways remain unexplored in this engineered microcosm methanogens can change their predominant trophic groups in order to scavenge the various catabolic products from bacteria besides the dichotomic division of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens we also recorded the dynamic transition between methanothermobacter and methanoculleus spp i e both are hydrogenotrophic methanogens this shift was previously observed in response to vfa concentration and with long term operation with external hydrogen addition hori et al 2006 treu et al 2018 which presumably attribute to hydrogen partial pressure comparing the gene profiles of two hydrogenotrophic mags we found almost identical gene sets to mediate methanogenesis but different facilitating systems in addition although the detailed regulation has not been fully elucidated yet the flagellum structure genes in m thermophilus and multisubunit na h antiporter genes in methanothermobacter sp are an indication of different strategies to utilize the proton motive force for atp synthesis it was previously proven that methanogens with lower atp gain have lower h2 thresholds which increase their capability to utilize scarce hydrogen and other electron donors such as formate or co thauer et al 2008 therefore the equilibrium of archaeal species with different metabolic traits could be regulated by their energy coupling strategies in addition to trophic specialization another interesting observation is that archaeal mags in this study ubiquitously lacked the genes to biosynthesise some essential cofactors for methanogenesis supplementary information suggesting a possibility that there are gene homologs or uncharacterized biosynthesis pathways which hamper the assertion of metabolic potential to synthesize cofactors moreover the results underlined the importance of sao bacteria in acetate methanogenic process which is consisted with the results from previous experiments with isotope labelling combined with online membrane inlet quadrupole mass spectrometry mulat et al 2014 the energy conservation strategy of bacterial community plays an important role by manipulating the size of interspecies electron pool and the distribution among different carriers including h2 formate co and iron ions stams and plugge 2009 it is well known that ad has limited energy margins due to the absence of oxygen as an efficient electron acceptor and the key to achieve the endergonic electron transfer in such systems is the utilization of high energy electron carriers such as ferredoxin sieber et al 2012 we found gene evidence which indicates that in anaerobic bacteria the ferredoxin could be used to receive electrons from two sources 1 from the substrates to drive redox reactions that are energetically unfavourable with general electron carriers i e nad and 2 from low energy electron carriers through ion translocating oxidoreductase or electron confurcation enzymes moreover genes encoding the proteins to release electrons from reduced carriers in the form of h2 are also present in most of bacterial mags it is worthy to mention that coenzyme f420 hydrogenase subunits in addition to ferredoxin were present in multiple copies coenzyme f420 synthesis was recently found in diverse bacterial taxa and presumably plays a role in a broader microbial metabolism besides methanogenesis ney et al 2017 the results from this study could raise the hypothesis that coenzyme f420 could mediate the organic compounds mineralization in the ad system 5 conclusions the sequential 4 step empirical concept has been long developed to describe the ad process and the majority of studies on ad microbiome implicitly assume that individual microbes are specialized in one of the steps however the individual genomes found in this study cannot be physiologically defined in accordance with ad steps since the entire process is not always following the 4 step structure thus it can be concluded that the functional roles of microorganisms cannot be rigorously determined without elucidation of their metabolic pathways the results of the current study also suggested that the methanogenic niches could nourish obligatory syntrophic metabolism that is unique in uncultivated ad microbes in future pursuit in situ ecogenomics should be applied to explore the pathways beyond the current knowledge of catabolism it is essential to highlight that the synergistic network of ad microbes is based on catabolic complementarity but also requires electron transfer equilibrium and overall energy conservation strategies that microbes choose to transfer electron and harvest energy were also key factors for selection of syntrophic partners although the pathway and energy conservation mechanism proposed in this paper still require full validation with cultivation based approaches and gene expression this study is one step forwards to unravel the holistic ad syntrophy

19068,in typical anaerobic digestion ad systems the microbial functional assertion is hampered by synchronised versatile metabolism required for heterogeneous substrates degradation thus the intricate methanogenic process from organic compounds remains an enigma after decades of empirical operation in this study simplified ad microbial communities were obtained with substrate specifications and continuous reactor operation genome centric metagenomic approach was followed to holistically investigate the metabolic pathways of the ad and the microbial synergistic networks in total 63 metagenome assembled genomes mags were assembled from 8 metagenomes acquired in specific methanogenic niches the metabolic pathways were reconstructed from the annotated genes and their dynamicity under experimental conditions the results show that the methanogenic niches nourish unique metabolism beyond current knowledge acquired from cultivation based methods a novel glucose mineralization model without acetate formation was proposed and asserted in a pair of syntrophs clostridiaceae sp and methanoculleus thermophilus moreover the catabolic pathway was elucidated in uncharacterized syntrophic acetate oxidizers synergistaceae spp a remarkable evolutionary insight is the discovery that electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms impose selective pressure on syntrophic partners overall the functional roles of the individual microbes tightly rely on the catabolic pathways and cannot always be physiologically defined in accordance with conventional four step ad concept the substrate specific systems provided a traceable microbial community to dissecting the ad process the genome centric metagenomics successfully constructed genomes of microbes that have not been previously isolated and illustrated metabolic pathways that beyond the current knowledge of ad process this study provides new perspectives to unravel the ad microbial ecology and suggests more

sediments and animal rumens thauer et al 2008 this bio conversion process known as anaerobic digestion ad has been scaled up and utilized to produce biogas from a wide range of organic residues in engineered fermenters specific ecological niches were created to favour the proliferation of microbes that mediate degradation of certain substrates this selected methanogenic microbial community consists of anaerobic syntrophs and methanogens interacting to facilitate methane production it is postulated that a complete and balanced microbial community is the premise of the efficient conversion rittmann et al 2008 shah et al 2016 ad microbiome remains partially elucidated because the community is rich in uncharacterized taxa and difficult to explore with traditional cultivation based methods campanaro et al 2016 therefore molecular techniques especially based on dna sequencing are nowadays widely used to unravel ad microbial ecology nevertheless traditional marker gene approaches such as dna amplicon sequencing failed to fully characterize the entire microbial community and their functionalities due to ambiguous taxonomy assignment and the presence of uncharacterized microorganisms from known and candidate taxa without cultivated representatives rivière et al 2009 in order to bypass this limitation metagenomics sequencing of bulk dna from environmental samples was applied to analyse the metabolic potential of the microbial community tsapekos et al 2017 moreover the advent of novel bioinformatic methods has allowed us to move beyond the characterized microbes existing in public database and brings the possibility to discover new lineages metabolic pathways and microbial interactions campanaro et al 2016 nobu et al 2015 the genome centric metagenomic also led to the proposal of novel candidate species and revealed the rationale of microbial dynamicity towards deterministic operational factors such as change of substrates chemical composition kougias et al 2017 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 up to now the majority of metagenomic studies have been conducted with real feedstocks such as manure wastewater and organic waste luo et al 2016 treu et al 2016a that create robust niches for extremely diverse microbial consortia and complex metabolic activities therefore the correlation between specific microbial members and their functionalities are difficult to be determined due to the versatile metabolism required for heterogeneous substrates degradation few studies have used an engineered synthetic ad system where the carbon source nutrition level and operational parameters were controlled to simplify the microbial community in order to reveal metabolic activity and interactions of the keystone species embree et al 2015 lü et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2016 however the overlap in metabolic capability inherent to ad communities hindered the exact identification of microbial functional roles in ad food chain the current research used synthetic substrates to simulate engineered ad systems containing certain subsets of ad steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis more specifically microbiomes responsible for degradation of polysaccharides avicel monosaccharides glucose volatile fatty acids vfa mixture and acetic acid were characterized using genome centric metagenomics approach the functionality of each mag was inferred according to its dynamicity during the transition between substrates and its gene content an integrated cellulose catabolic network was reconstructed according to gene annotations including a novel glucose degradation pathway moreover the electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms were specifically analysed for obligatory syntrophs the results of the current study elucidated the microbial ecology of simplified ad microbial communities and highlighted several important regulations for microbial syntrophy the gained knowledge will assist unraveling the microbial black box and contribute to further optimization of ad process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the microbial communities analysed in this study were

that can mediate all ad steps for heterogeneous substrates the experiment consisted of four periods and the feedstock used in each period was basal media supplemented with organic compound stepwise simplified following the biochemical degradation steps namely avicel polysaccharide glucose monosaccharide vfa mixture acetate propionate butyrate 2 6 1 1 3 8 in mass and acetic acid the organic loading rates olr used for sugar substrates avicel and glucose were 1g vs l reactor day and for intermediates were sequentially halved 0 5 g vs l reactor day for vfa and 0 25 g vs l reactor day for acetic acid detailed feedstock composition is presented in supplementary information table s1 total sugar concentrations methane yields vfa concentrations and ph values in the reactor were recorded to evaluate the digestion process the unutilized sugars were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatograph hp series1100 germany equipped with a column biorad aminex hpx 87 h at 63 c and a refractive index detector rid1362a using 0 6 ml min of 4 mm h2so4 as eluent the daily biogas production was quantified using a water replacement gas meter and methane concentration was measured using a gas chromatograph mikrolab aarhus a s denmark equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd as previously described kougias et al 2015 other digestion products including vfa and ethanol concentration were measured using a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 2010 af kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid as described by kougias et al 2015 2 2 dna extraction and sequencing reactor samples were obtained at the steady states of each experimental period and genomic dna was extracted with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio powersoil carlsbad ca usa with an additional phenol cleaning step in order to improve dna purification the quality and quantity of the dna extract were evaluated with nanodrop and gel electrophoresis the results showed that the dna was pure and in good integrity the detailed data and figures were presented in supplementary information dna library preparation was performed in technical duplicates according to nextera xt kit illumina san diego ca and sequentially sequenced using illumina nextseq 500 sequencer 2x150bp illumina san diego ca at ramaciotti centre for genomics unsw sydney australia sequence data were deposited at the sequence read archive sra ncbi under bioproject prjna416337 sample specific accession numbers are listed in supplementary information table s2 2 3 genome centric metagenomics and statistics metagenomic assembly and binning process were previously described by campanaro et al 2016 and all the perl scripts sere obtained from http www biogasmicrobiome com binning process v1 briefly all metagenomes were co assembled with clc workbench and binned with a process that was based on hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection combining taxonomic investigation with clustering of coverage profiles albertsen et al 2013 the mag coverage was calculated from the average number of sequencing reads aligned with metagenomics assemblies in each sequencing sample using bowtie 2 software v2 2 4 and bedtools package v2 17 0 langmead and salzberg 2012 quinlan and hall 2010 mags with high relative abundance normalized coverage higher than 0 8 in at least one experimental condition were selected for functional analysis the relative population abundance was calculated by the percentage of selected mag coverage compared to total coverage all mags were visualized and organized into hierarchical dendrograms according to their coverage and dynamicity during four experimental periods using mev software with pearson correlation metrics and average linkage clustering saeed et al 2003 the basic mag properties and the metrics of the assembled genomes including genome size completeness and contamination were evaluated with checkm parks et al 2015 taxonomical assignment for the mags was obtained using phylophlan v0 99 segata et al 2013 those having incomplete confidence were checked using phylopythias web server patil et al 2012 and assigned to a clade only when more than 50 of the genome sequence displayed coherent results the average nucleotide identity ani was calculated as previously described by varghese et al 2015 and was used to find genomes belonging to the same species in the ncbi microbial genome database as previously described and mags recovered in previous metagenomics binning studies campanaro et al 2018 kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016b for all mags gene prediction was performed by prodigal v2 6 2 run in metagenomic mode hyatt et al 2010 protein encoding genes were annotated using reverse position specific blast algorithm and using cog rpsblast database galperin et al 2014 with e value lower cut off as 1e 5 in addition genes were also annotated according to kegg database using ghostkoala and the predicted genes for each mag were analyzed using foam software in order to refine kegg pathways and modules prediction kanehisa et al 2016 prestat et al 2014 for mag involved in avicel and glucose degradation all predicted genes were annotated using dbcan software yin et al 2012 moreover for high quality mags the detailed catabolic pathways were manually asserted gene by gene according to previously defined enzymology mechanisms 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the metagenomes were acquired from a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with a series of specific substrates namely avicel glucose vfa and acetic acid the operational condition was favourable for the development of methanogenic microbial community inside the reactor thus during the experiment methane was stably produced as the main digestion product together with a trace amount of vfa acetate and propionate table 1 vfa with more than three carbon atoms and alcohol products were undetected throughout the experiment it is well known that the vfa are the intermediate products during anaerobic digestion thus their detection in low levels indicate a well functioning process the ph of the reactor was maintained between 6 7 and 8 2 which are the values within the optimum range of methanogenesis the highest ph value was recorded during the period that the reactor was fed with the medium containing vfa mixture probably due to the stoichiometrically low production of carbon dioxide during this condition batstone et al 2002 3 2 mags reconstruction the ad microbiome was dissected with a genome centric metagenomic approach high throughput sequencing data were filtered assembled and binned with a hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection approach resulting in a total of 63 mags supplementary information table s3 specifically our discussion focused on a specific selection of highly abundant microbes including 21 high quality mags more than 70 completeness and lower than 10 contamination 12 medium low quality mags lower than 70 completeness and lower than 10 contamination and two meta mags contamination higher than 80 the selected mags were taxonomically assigned into four bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum namely firmicutes synergistetes chloroflexi bacteroidetes and euryarchaeota fig 1 these members were known to play important roles during thermophilic ad process de vrieze and verstraete 2016 rivière et al 2009 the continuous operation of the reactor with selected substrates imposed specific and constant selective pressures to the microbial survival the experimental conditions shaped simplified microbial communities by washing out the microbes that are not supported for growth by the substrates the results highlighted considerably distinctive community compositions specific for avicel glucose vfa mixture and acetic acid degradation as the substrate was stepwise simplified according to ad steps the metabolic role of each mag could be deduced by its presence absence under the specific influent substrate fig 1 hierarchical clustering performed on the mags coverage profiles showed that 31 bacterial mags could be clustered into four groups correlating to their catabolic traits g1 avicel degradation bacterial community g2 glucose degradation bacterial community g3 vfa degradation bacterial community and g4 acetate degradation bacterial community all the selected bacterial mag groups are representative of the entire community because combined with the corresponding archaeal community they accounted for over 90 of the entire microbial community during each experimental period therefore we propose that those mag groups harbour the entire set of genes independently that are responsible for aiding methanogens to complete the biomethanation process from the chosen substrate regarding high quality mags their metabolic capability has been further confirmed by pathway assertion the gene profiles of all mags were manually inspected and 92 enzymes are selected to cover the main metabolic reactions involved in the ad of specific substrates fig 2 supplementary information table s4 s6 s7 and s8 the hydrolysis step was only active during avicel degradation and mainly mediated by extracellular enzymes the following acidogenesis step was performed by both g1 and g2 through embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway romano and conway 1996 however the majority of key genes for propionate and butyrate biosynthesis were absent indicating these compounds were not formed during sufficient avicel and glucose degradation acetogenesis was performed through multiple pathways depending on starting substrates more specifically acetogenesis from pyruvate was mainly observed in g1 and g2 as indicated by the presence of pyruvate ferredoxin driven oxidoreductase genes ec 1 2 7 1 pfor in addition acetogenesis from propionate and butyrate were recorded in g3 via methylmalonyl coenzyme a pathway and β oxidation pathway respectively müller et al 2010 methanogenesis was performed by four archaeal mags with different metabolic traits corresponding to the change in the bacterial community the interconversion of direct methanogenic substrates i e acetate and co2 h2 was also examined with genes for syntrophic acetate oxidation sao homoacetogenesis including the conventional wood ljungdahl wl pathway and a novel pathway through glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway müller et al 2016 nobu et al 2015 3 3 avicel adapted community g1 consisted of 9 bacterial mags with extremely uneven distribution dtu0444 dominated the microbial community with a relative abundance of 53 following by dtu0497 14 seven out of nine mags including dtu0444 and dtu0497 were taxonomically assigned to phylum firmicutes members of which was previously proven to play important roles in the thermophilic cellulolytic process by producing a complex of multi cellulolytic enzymes namely cellulosome azman et al 2015 however in contrast with previous findings neither dtu0444 nor dtu0497 were found to encode proteins involved in cellulosome formation ziganshin et al 2013 supplementary information table s5 despite some mags containing various cellulolytic genes all firmicutes spp in g1 shared genes encoding specific endoglucanase ec 3 2 1 4 suggesting that this enzyme is essential for the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in thermophilic ad process supplementary information table s9 the remaining two mags specific of g1 dtu0435 and dtu0433 belonged to chloroflexi and rikenellaceae phyla respectively and contained distinct gene profiles encoding carbohydrate binding domains in comparison with firmicutes spp supplementary information table s4 as presented in fig 1 the relative abundance of the archaeal community during avicel degradation is extremely low suggesting that methanogens have much lower cell yields than hydrolytic bacteria the difference in cell yields could attribute to the energy released during substrates utilization more specifically the high atp gained through phosphorolytic cleavage of β glucosidic bonds in dtu0444 promotes its dominance in the microbial community zhang and lynd 2005 on the other hands the electron transport phosphorylation in methanogenic archaea provides limited energy for cells growth leading to their lower abundance deppenmeier et al 1996 dtu0440 identified as obligatory hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus thermophilus was the most abundant archaea indicating the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis during avicel degradation dtu0439 identified as methanosarcina thermophila was also present during avicel degradation but in lower abundance methanosarcina spp have been suggested to be mixotrophic but mainly acetoclastic methanogens consistently m thermophila showed very weak methane production activity from co2 h2 with the absence of methanol zinder et al 1985 moreover m thermophila known as methanogens with cytochromes is not able to compete for h2 with methanogens without cytochromes dtu0440 under the condition that prevails in their natural environments thauer et al 2008 thus the functional role of m thermophila was assigned as acetoclastic methanogen in the current study 3 4 glucose adapted community during glucose degradation the entire g1 decreased significantly in relative abundance and the bacterial community evolved into a more specialized g2 with five representative mags fig 1 the most abundant mag dtu0446 belonged to clostridiaceae and counted for 36 5 of the total community followed by methanoculleus thermophilus that counted for 33 0 mags with cellulolytic genes were outcompeted by dtu0446 which contains the genetic material encoding glucose permease ec 2 7 3 9 of phosphotransferase system pts to transport the glucose from the periplasm or extracellular space into the cytoplasm and phosphorylates supplementary information table s9 the predominance of dtu0446 contradicts previous study showing that mainly low abundant community members utilize pts to transport sugars in manure based biogas reactors campanaro et al 2016 the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that pts favours the transportation of extracellular free glucose which is not abundant in natural substrates i e such as livestock manure while polysaccharide hydrolysates probably employed an alternative mechanism for substrate uptake ikeda et al 2011 none of the g2 mags encoded the complete wl pathway or and were present in acetate degradation community g4 indicating a week sao capability in cooperation with methanogens moreover methanoculleus thermophilus an obligatory h2 utilizing methanogen was the only abundant archaeal mag during glucose degradation suggesting that the majority of methane was produced via the hydrogenotrophic pathway the absence of both sao and acetoclastic methanogenesis suggests that acetate is not a necessary intermediate product during glucose catabolism thus we propose a novel glucose degradation model combining emp glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation through glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway nobu et al 2015 this model can be curated based on gene contents of the two most abundant microbes dtu0446 and dtu0440 in glucose degradation community fig 3 supplementary information table s9 specifically in dtu0446 glucose is firstly degraded to pyruvate through emp and then to co2 through the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway in addition the rhodobacter nitrogen fixation complex rnf was found in dtu0446 utilizing the reverse proton motive force to produce the reduced ferredoxin for electron disposal in the form of h2 schmehl et al 1993 the produced co2 h2 can be further utilized by dtu0440 for methanogenesis 3 5 vfa adapted community vfa degraders are postulated to play an important role in ad communities scavenging the intermediates produced during primary fermentation during the third experimental period m thermophilus dtu0440 and m thermophila dtu0439 presented at the relative abundance of 19 4 and 6 3 respectively regarding bacterial community all g3 members accounted at extremely low relative abundance during avicel and glucose degradation except dtu0445 this observation is consistent with a previous study stating that lactate butyrate and formate were not involved in glucose degradation and propionate degraders accounted for less than 2 of total population ito et al 2012 unfortunately dtu0445 was identified as a cluster of several organisms due to high contamination of the genome genes for both glucose and vfa catabolism are present in this metagenome and are probably derived from a cluster of bacteria with high relative abundance in both g2 and g3 other mags with the exception of dtu0445 were evenly distributed with the relative abundance spanning from 2 9 to 7 2 fig 1 three mags dtu0451 dtu0456 and dtu0457 belong to a carboxylic acids utilizing family syntrophomonadaceae and the high quality representative genome dtu0451 contains the complete genes for butyrate degradation hatamoto et al 2008 on the contrary dtu0485 dtu0493 and dtu0495 in g3 contain genes responsible for propionate degradation which agrees with previously reported catabolic capability for isolates from the same taxa namely peptococcaceae synergistaceae and firmicutes honda et al 2013 imachi et al 2002 shigematsu et al 2006 both butyrate and propionate degradation are thermodynamically endergonic processes under the standard condition and require obligate syntrophic coupling with hydrogenotrophic methanogens m thermophiles which lowers the products mainly h2 concentration and thereby reduces the gibbs free energy change at real reactor conditions acetic acid both originating from the influent to the reactor and produced during acetogenesis promotes acetoclastic methanogenesis leading to an increment of m thermophile dtu0439 moreover several mags contain genes related to sao homoacetogenesis and consequentially shift the methanogenic pathways from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic or vice versa specifically dtu0455 and dtu0493 harbour the complete gene set to encode the proposed sao pathway through the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway nobu et al 2015 moreover acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase were also present in dtu0445 3 6 acetic acid adapted community a further increase of m thermophila was observed suggesting an enhancement of acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway when compared to the previous experimental periods nevertheless the acetate metabolizing bacteria g4 accounted for 70 1 of the total microbial community suggesting conversion of acetate to h2 co2 providing evidence that the ultimate methanogenesis was through the hydrogenotrophic path g4 consisted of previously identified sao bacteria including six mags belonging to firmicutes two mags belonging to synergistaceae and one mag belonging to bacteroidetes hattori 2008 the most abundant taxon was synergistaceae spp with two representative mags dtu0491 and dtu0492 that accounted for 17 9 and 8 5 of the total microbial community respectively the high abundance of this taxon suggested a role for sao under methanogenic environment and this result is in accordance with a stable isotope based functional study mosbæk et al 2016 however the majority of synergistetes isolates were only functionally connected with amino acid fermentation while the acetate oxidizing capability was never explored from a genomic point of view surprisingly the genes for acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase were absent from both dtu0491 and dtu0492 suggesting that they unlikely perform conventional sao through wl pathway supplementary information table s9 on the contrary dtu0491 contains the almost complete gene sets to perform the novel sao suggested in thermotogae spp by nobu et al 2015 with only one transferase absent ec 2 1 2 10 considering that the size of dtu0491 1 43 mb is smaller than the reported isolate 1 68 3 28 mb and it is 75 complete we also examined the gene contents of other publically available synergistetes genomes to address a more solid argumentation supplementary information table s10 in particular 27 publically available synergistetes genomes in genomes online database gold database were investigated to putatively assert the sao pathways reddy et al 2014 the results showed that ec 2 1 2 10 which is missing in dtu0491 is commonly present in synergistetes spp including anaerobaculum sp dtu043 binned in a previous project unpublished data this result suggests that its absence in dtu0491 was probably because it was not recovered during assembly or binning moreover none of analysed genome harbours gene for acetyl coa synthase co dehydrogenase but 20 out of 29 tested genomes contain almost complete gene sets less than two blocks missing to perform thermotogae like sao for energy conservation rnf and ion translocating ferredoxin ifo that are commonly used by sao bacteria were not present in dtu0491 nobu et al 2015 instead we found genes encoding subunits of synergistete specific f420 reducing hydrogenase implying the possibility that coenzyme f420 might be used as electron carriers to drive redox reactions and directly release electrons in the form of h2 another interesting observation is the proliferation of methanothermobacter sp dtu0441 in g4 while m thermophilus decreased significantly in relative abundance the central genes for methanogenesis are highly conserved in both mag hydrogenotrophic and the main differences of their gene profiles were observed in cobalamin biosynthesis flagellum structure and biogenesis and multisubunit na h antiporter 4 discussion the distinct community compositions during avicel glucose vfa and acetate degradation suggested that the ad community is composed of fastidious microorganisms proliferating only in specific ecological niches the dramatic shifts between g1 and g2 is consisted with a previous study where a significant difference in microbial community composition was reported between glucose and starch feeding digesters tang et al 2015 thus these results suggested that although hydrolysis is an extracellular process polymerization degree and molecular structures of the substrates could impose selective pressure on fermentative bacteria probably due to their different substrate uptake system this could be one of the many reasons that ad pre treatment technologies change the overall microbial community composition rather than affects only the hydrolytic bacteria tsapekos et al 2017 it has been long postulated that methanogenic niches form obligate synergistic networks among microbes to drive the reactions near thermodynamic equilibria such as vfa and alcohol degradation narihiro et al 2015 however it is overlooked that these synergistic activities could also enable the bacteria to form energetically unfavourable digestion products from fermentable substrates such as glucose schröder et al 1994 a novel glucose degradation pathway was asserted in uncharacterized firmicutes sp dtu0446 which is the predominant bacteria during glucose degradation in this pathway the conventional pfor driven pyruvate oxidation is replaced by glycine cleavage system with the methyl branch of the wl pathway to circumvent the extremely thermodynamically unfavourable acetate oxidation dolfing 2014 this proposal suggested that methanogenic pathways are occurring though synergistic relationships with bacteria having metabolic capabilities different from those of cultivated strains it is well known that the ad community is a trove of uncultivated microorganisms and therefore we believe that more specialised pathways remain unexplored in this engineered microcosm methanogens can change their predominant trophic groups in order to scavenge the various catabolic products from bacteria besides the dichotomic division of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens we also recorded the dynamic transition between methanothermobacter and methanoculleus spp i e both are hydrogenotrophic methanogens this shift was previously observed in response to vfa concentration and with long term operation with external hydrogen addition hori et al 2006 treu et al 2018 which presumably attribute to hydrogen partial pressure comparing the gene profiles of two hydrogenotrophic mags we found almost identical gene sets to mediate methanogenesis but different facilitating systems in addition although the detailed regulation has not been fully elucidated yet the flagellum structure genes in m thermophilus and multisubunit na h antiporter genes in methanothermobacter sp are an indication of different strategies to utilize the proton motive force for atp synthesis it was previously proven that methanogens with lower atp gain have lower h2 thresholds which increase their capability to utilize scarce hydrogen and other electron donors such as formate or co thauer et al 2008 therefore the equilibrium of archaeal species with different metabolic traits could be regulated by their energy coupling strategies in addition to trophic specialization another interesting observation is that archaeal mags in this study ubiquitously lacked the genes to biosynthesise some essential cofactors for methanogenesis supplementary information suggesting a possibility that there are gene homologs or uncharacterized biosynthesis pathways which hamper the assertion of metabolic potential to synthesize cofactors moreover the results underlined the importance of sao bacteria in acetate methanogenic process which is consisted with the results from previous experiments with isotope labelling combined with online membrane inlet quadrupole mass spectrometry mulat et al 2014 the energy conservation strategy of bacterial community plays an important role by manipulating the size of interspecies electron pool and the distribution among different carriers including h2 formate co and iron ions stams and plugge 2009 it is well known that ad has limited energy margins due to the absence of oxygen as an efficient electron acceptor and the key to achieve the endergonic electron transfer in such systems is the utilization of high energy electron carriers such as ferredoxin sieber et al 2012 we found gene evidence which indicates that in anaerobic bacteria the ferredoxin could be used to receive electrons from two sources 1 from the substrates to drive redox reactions that are energetically unfavourable with general electron carriers i e nad and 2 from low energy electron carriers through ion translocating oxidoreductase or electron confurcation enzymes moreover genes encoding the proteins to release electrons from reduced carriers in the form of h2 are also present in most of bacterial mags it is worthy to mention that coenzyme f420 hydrogenase subunits in addition to ferredoxin were present in multiple copies coenzyme f420 synthesis was recently found in diverse bacterial taxa and presumably plays a role in a broader microbial metabolism besides methanogenesis ney et al 2017 the results from this study could raise the hypothesis that coenzyme f420 could mediate the organic compounds mineralization in the ad system 5 conclusions the sequential 4 step empirical concept has been long developed to describe the ad process and the majority of studies on ad microbiome implicitly assume that individual microbes are specialized in one of the steps however the individual genomes found in this study cannot be physiologically defined in accordance with ad steps since the entire process is not always following the 4 step structure thus it can be concluded that the functional roles of microorganisms cannot be rigorously determined without elucidation of their metabolic pathways the results of the current study also suggested that the methanogenic niches could nourish obligatory syntrophic metabolism that is unique in uncultivated ad microbes in future pursuit in situ ecogenomics should be applied to explore the pathways beyond the current knowledge of catabolism it is essential to highlight that the synergistic network of ad microbes is based on catabolic complementarity but also requires electron transfer equilibrium and overall energy conservation strategies that microbes choose to transfer electron and harvest energy were also key factors for selection of syntrophic partners although the pathway and energy conservation mechanism proposed in this paper still require full validation with cultivation based approaches and gene expression this study is one step forwards to unravel the holistic ad syntrophy

19069,dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in degradation of organic pollutants by photochemically produced reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh however it is not clear whether dom extracted from coastal seawaters cs dom and dom derived from freshwaters fw dom exhibit similar effects on photodegradation of organic micropollutants herein 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 was adopted as a model compound to probe the effects of different dom on photodegradation kinetics of organic micropollutants results show that the cs dom promotes the photodegradation of bp 1 mainly via the pathway involving 3dom while 3dom 1o2 and oh are responsible for bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the fw dom compared with the fw dom the cs dom undergoes more photobleaching and contains less aromatic c c and c o functional groups although 3dom formation quantum yields for the cs dom are relatively higher than those for the fw dom the cs dom has lower rates of light absorption leading to lower steady state ri concentrations for the cs dom bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the cs dom is faster than in the presence of the fw dom due to higher second order reaction rate constants between bp 1 and cs 3dom and fewer antioxidants contained in the cs dom graphical abstract image

2013a gago ferrero et al 2012 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 is one of the commonly used sunscreen agents in personal care products gago ferrero et al 2012 bp 1 belongs to the benzophenone derived class of sunscreen agents kotnik et al 2016 li et al 2016 it was reported that the annual production of benzophenone derived compounds is approximately 4000 tons in china li et al 2016 because of the high volume application of bp 1 it has been frequently detected in various environmental waters in many regions of the world bp 1 concentrations were reported to be up to 135 117 and 280 ng l 1 in seawaters of hong kong tsui et al 2014 los angeles tsui et al 2014 and spain ramos et al 2015 respectively bp 1 was detected in rivers in bangkok and uk with concentrations up to 166 and 17 000 ng l 1 respectively previous studies reported that bp 1 has estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities causing hazard to organisms rainieri et al 2017 however little is known about the fate of bp 1 in the aquatic environment therefore it is of importance to understand bp 1 behavior in the aquatic environment for its ecological risk assessment photochemical degradation has been proved to be a major transformation pathway for organic pollutants in surface waters macmanus spencer et al 2011 de laurentiis et al 2013a li et al 2016 bao and niu 2015 previous studies have shown that dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in indirect photodegradation of organic pollutants li et al 2015 2016 vione et al 2014 sunlight irradiated dom can lead to formation of primary and secondary reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh which can degrade organic pollutants zhang et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 al housari et al 2010 it was reported that 3dom can react with phenols canonica 2007 phenylurea herbicides canonica 2007 and sulfonamide antibiotics li et al 2015 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 1o2 also plays an important role in transformation of organic micropollutants bodhipaksha et al 2017 maddigapu et al 2011 oh reacts at near diffusion controlled rates with many organic compounds and it can even react with refractory pollutants vione et al 2014 however dom can also retard photodegradation of organic pollutants by shielding sunlight scavenging ris and quenching excited states of target pollutants zhang et al 2016 wenk et al 2013 wenk and canonica 2012 niu et al 2018 the specific role of dom in photodegradation of a specific organic pollutant depends on sources of dom guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 besides freshwater rivers and lakes coastal seawaters also have considerable concentrations of dom due to input of terrestrial rivers and human activities such as mariculture al housari et al 2010 herbeck et al 2013 in a recent study dom from mariculture impacted areas was found to exhibit higher reactivity than dom from the more pristine coastal seawaters in promoting photodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics wang et al 2018 dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching contains more humic like materials and more aromatic and carbonyl structures which lead to higher 3dom steady state concentrations and higher reactivity wang et al 2018 the combined effect of the steady state concentrations of ris and the second order rate constants between ris and organic pollutants are essential in determining the photochemical reactivity of dom on pollutant photodegradation compared with the dom from coastal seawaters cs dom the freshwater dom fw dom usually has higher chromophore and fluorophore contents that are relevant with steady state concentrations of ris coble 2007 helms et al 2008 timko et al 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 it is also known that for dom from different sources with different compositions the corresponding 3dom has different excited state reduction potentials mcneill and canonica 2016 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 therefore dom extracted from coastal seawaters and freshwater river lakes may have different effects on photodegradation of micropollutants such as of bp 1 in this study coupled reverse osmosis electrodialysis ro ed method was adopted to extract cs dom since suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom were widely used in previous experimental studies on photodegradation of micropollutants li et al 2017 bahnmüller et al 2014 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 erickson et al 2018 steady state photochemical experiments were performed on photodegradation of bp 1 so as to compare the effects of cs dom with those of srfa and srnom 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are

which the results are listed in table 1 a reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed system that was used in our previous studies wang et al 2016 2018 was adopted to isolate dom from the filtrated seawater samples since water is split into h and oh that can lead to ph changes in the diluate and concentrate compartments if the applied electric current reaches or exceeds the limiting current at a given diluate conductivity gurtler et al 2008 cowan and brown 1959 the limiting current was determined for the ed stack before the isolation process the ed current was always kept well below the limiting current for desalting the concentrate compartment was fed with a solution of 0 05 m nacl the electrode compartment was fed with a solution of 0 4 m na2so4 and the diluate compartment with the seawater to be desalted the flow rate of the diluate and concentrate was 500 l h the ed was operated in a constant current mode if the conductivity is above 15 ms cm otherwise a constant voltage mode was carried out 2 3 spectroscopic measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the dom samples were measured with a shimadzu prestige 21 ftir spectrometer as detailed in the sm uv visible absorption spectra were measured with a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer the spectra were recorded against pure water over a range of 200 700 nm the average absorbance in the range of 650 700 nm was subtracted from the spectra to correct for the small offsets of the baseline kujawinski et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 m2 g c was determined by normalizing the absorbance to doc concentration and used as a proxy for aromaticity of dom helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 weishaar et al 2003 the spectral slopes s nm 1 over the wavelength range of 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm were determined by fitting the absorption spectra to the following exponential decay function by nonlinear regression helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 1 s 1 λ 0 λ ln α λ α λ 0 where α λ 0 and α λ are the napierian absorption coefficients at wavelength λ 0 and λ respectively α λ is converted from absorbance a by the following equation 2 α λ 2 3 a λ r where r is optical path length spectral slope ratio s r was calculated by dividing s 275 295 by s 350 400 helms et al 2008 helms et al 2013 dom molecular weight can be decreased by photobleaching when the molecular weight distribution is shifted to low molecular weight the absorption spectrum will shift to greater relative absorption at shorter wavelengths leading increased s r values due to increase in s 275 295 and decrease in s 350 400 values helms et al 2008 the ratio between the absorbance at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 was also calculated to track the changes in the relative size of dom molecules helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 de laurentiis et al 2013b with the increase in molecular size e2 e3 decrease due to stronger light absorption by high molecular weight dom at longer wavelengths helms et al 2008 thus e2 e3 is also a proxy for the degree of photobleaching helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 de laurentiis et al 2013b fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of the dom samples extracted from the coastal seawaters cs dom were measured with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer as detailed in the sm the eem can be divided into five regions based on the fluorescence regional integration technique that was frequently used to quantify eem spectra for dom chen et al 2003 the eem peaks can be associated with protein like e g i tyrosine tryptophan amino acid with ex em 200 250 nm 280 330 nm ii tyrosine tryptophan protein with ex em 200 250 nm 330 380 nm and iv tryptophan like or soluble microbial byproduct like material with ex em

an xpa 7 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing the reaction solutions was used the light transmittance of the quartz tube was shown in fig s1 a water refrigerated 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the irradiance spectrum of the light source was recorded by a trios spectroradiometer with a ramses acc uv sensor germany the light source mimics the solar light spectrum with an intensity of approximately 33 w m2 from 290 to 400 nm for comparison natural sunlight intensity was also measured by the same trios spectroradiometer at noon on september 21 2015 in the sampling areas as can be seen from fig s2 the irradiation intensity of the 1000 w xenon lamp with the 290 nm cutoff filters is close to that of the natural sunlight thus the xenon lamp with the 290 nm cutoff filters could be used to simulated sunlight in this study the initial concentration of bp 1 in the photolytic solutions was 5 μm the concentration of dom was 10 mg c l which represents the environmentally relevant level of dom in natural waters li et al 2017 felcyn et al 2012 guerard and chin 2012 zhang et al 2018 to clarify the role of 3dom and oh in the photodegradation scavenging experiments were performed using sorbic acid as a quencher of 3dom li et al 2015 and 2 propanol as a quencher of oh ryan et al 2011 perinaphthenone and 3 methoxyacetophenone 1 μm as model triplet sensitizers ryan et al 2011 were employed to investigate the reactivity between bp 1 and 3dom dark control experiments with pure water under the same conditions were performed to know whether bp 1 undergoes other degradation except for photodegradation the steady state concentrations for the ris 1o2 oh and 3dom generated in the systems containing dom can be calculated as zhou et al 2018 3 r i s s r r i s r i where r ri is the formation rates of ris s ri is scavenging rate constants 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was used as a probe to measure the formation rate of 3dom al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013b tmp was spiked into the dom solutions with an initial concentration of 100 μm all the dom solutions were buffered to ph 8 0 with 10 mm phosphate to eliminate the interference of ph and ionic strength the second order reaction rate constant between tmp and 3dom k tmp 3dom is 3 109 m 1 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b although tmp can also react with 1o2 and oh the contribution of 1o2 and oh to the overall tmp transformation would be negligible compared to that of 3dom zhou et al 2018 in addition 3dom would mainly react with 3o2 to give 1o2 or undergo various deactivation reactions such processes were assumed to have a lumped first order deactivation rate constant of s 3dom 5 105 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b the initial triplet formation rate r 3dom can be obtained as follows de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 4 r d 3 o m r t m p r 0 k t m p d 3 o m t m p s d 3 o m k t m p d 3 o m t m p where r tmp is the transformation rate of tmp in the dom solutions r 0 is direct photolysis rate of tmp furfuryl alcohol ffa was used as a probe to measure the formation of 1o2 zhang et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2013b ffa was added to the buffered dom solutions with an initial concentration of 50 μm along with methanol 0 1 m to quench oh direct photolysis of ffa was negligible due to its low molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield under wavelength 290 nm zhang et al 2014 the formation rate of 1o2 r 1o2 can be calculated as follows 5 r o 2 1 r f f a k f f a o 2 1 f f a s o 2 1 k f f a o 2 1 f f a where r ffa is the degradation rate of ffa k ffa 1o2 is the second order reaction rate constant 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 between ffa and 1o2 de laurentiis et al 2013b s 1o2 is the physical quenching rate constant of 1o2 by water 2 5 105 s 1 and the overall decay of 1o2 is dominated by this process in aquatic systems de laurentiis et al 2013b the oh formation rate r oh was measured with hydroxylation of benzene to phenol de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 benzene was added into the buffered dom solutions at an initial concentration of 3 mm dong and rosario ortiz 2012 reported that scavenging rate constant 107 s 1 yielded by benzene is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the total scavenging rate constant 105 s 1 estimated from water matrices therefore benzene is the main scavenger in the system the second order reaction rate constant between oh and benzene k benzene oh is 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b and the scavenging rate constant s oh is k benzene oh benzene r oh was related to the formation rate of phenol r ph by a factor of 0 85 zhou et al 2018 6 r oh r ph 0 85 from the r ri values quantum yields φ ri can be calculated by the following equations de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 7 φ r i λ r r i λ k a λ d o m 8 k a λ i p ε λ 1 1 0 ε λ d o m z ε λ d o m z where k a λ is specific rate of light absorption dom stands for the concentration of dom mg c l k a λ dom is the rate of light absorption by dom i p is surface photon irradiance that was obtained by relative emissions of the xenon lamp multiplied by corresponding transmittance of the quartz tubes einstein cm 2 s 1 ε λ is the molar absorptivity for a given wavelength from 290 to 400 nm m 1 cm 1 and z is the optical path length cm 2 5 determination of second order rate constants for bp 1 reaction with 1o2 k 1o2 and oh k oh k 1o2 and k oh were determined by the competition kinetics method xie et al 2013 for k 1o2 determination rose bengal was employed as 1o2 photosensitizer and ffa was adopted as 1o2 probe second order reaction rate constant between ffa and 1o2 is 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 the initial concentrations of rose bengal ffa and bp 1 were 5 μm 20 μm and 20 μm respectively a 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 380 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the k 1o2 value of bp 1 can be calculated with the following equation xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 9 k 1 o 2 s l n s t s 0 l n r t r 0 k 1 o 2 r where s and r represent bp 1 and the reference compound ffa respectively for determination of k oh a uv h2o2 system was used to generate oh xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 a 500 w mercury lamp surrounded by 340 nm cut off filters was used as the light source acetophenone was used as a reference compound with a known rate constant k oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 initial concentrations of h2o2 acetophenone and bp 1 were 100 μm 20 μm and 20 μm respectively the k oh value of bp 1 can be calculated with the following equation zhang et al 2018 10 k o h s l n s t s 0 l n r t r 0 k o h r 2 6 analytical methods an agilent 1260 hplc with a diode array detector and a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 3 0 150 mm 3 5 μm was employed for quantification of bp 1 2 4 6 trimethylphenol furfuryl alcohol phenol and acetophenone the mobile phase compositions detection wavelengths flow rates and injection volumes are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different dom on photodegradation of bp 1 in the dark control no obvious loss of bp 1 was observed fig s3 linear regression of ln c t c 0 vs time t shows that the photodegradation of bp 1 followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 in pure water the observed pseudo first order photolytic rate constants k obs was 5 95 0 35 10 3 h 1 fig 1 and the half life t 1 2 was 117 h kotnik et al 2016 also reported that t 1 2 for photolysis of bp 1 was more than 100 h in distilled water upon sunlight irradiation based on eq s 4 in the sm apparent quantum yield of bp 1 photolysis was obtained to be 2 1 10 2 the average k obs values for bp 1 in the solutions with the coastal seawater dom cs dom 1 and 2 were determined to be 2 32 0 10 10 2 h 1 and 3 60 0 24 10 2 h 1 respectively fig 1 with the srnom and srfa the corresponding k obs values are 2 70 0 26 10 2 h 1 and 2 34 0 11 10 2 h 1 respectively therefore the photodegradation rates of bp 1 in the solutions with dom are much higher than that in pure water indicating that dom is an effective photosensitizer for bp 1 photodegradation cs dom 2 and srnom was adopted to probe the photodegradation mechanisms as can be seen from fig 1 in the presence of the srnom the photodegradation rate was inhibited with the addition of 2 propanol as a quencher of oh while no effect was observed in the presence of cs dom 2 therefore the freshwater dom fw dom can photosensitize degradation of bp 1 via oh while the cs dom cannot additionally in the presence of the cs dom the addition of sorbic acid as a quencher of 3dom almost completely retarded the photodegradation fig 1 suggesting that bp 1 reacts almost exclusively with 3dom k obs was just reduced by about a half in the presence of the fw dom with the addition of sorbic acid fig 1 indicating that 3dom reactivity for the coastal seawater and freshwater dom is different in promoting the degradation additionally k obs was significantly enhanced in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment as ground state 3o2 is a quencher of 3dom removal of dissolved oxygen by n2 sparging can decrease the formation rate of 1o2 as well as the quenching rate of 3dom in the system li et al 2015 therefore the removal of oxygen in the system consequently increases 3dom ss and decrease 1o2 ss this result further indicates that 3dom is an important species involved in the enhanced photodegradation of bp 1 and 1o2 is not as important if 1o2 is the major reactive species for the photodegradation the photodegradation rates would decrease in the deoxygenation experiment to further verify susceptibility to the reaction of bp 1 with triplet excited states 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone were used in pure water as model triplet sensitizers the k obs value for bp 1 is 0 033 0 005 h 1 in the presence of 3 methoxyacetophenone and 0 543 0 011 h 1 in the presence of perinapthenone fig s4 further confirming that bp 1 is susceptible to reactions with 3dom since it is difficult to investigate the properties of 3dom directly owing to the great variety of chromophores present in dom proxies of dom e g 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone were commonly employed as proxies of dom to investigate triplet mediated transformations canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 ryan et al 2011 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone could be employed as proxies of dom in environmental photochemical investigations on organic micropollutants since their molecules contain aromatic carbonyl structures and aromatic ketones were regarded to be main 3dom precursors in dom moieties canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 cawley et al 2009 sharpless et al 2014 different proxies of triplet sensitizers have disparate excited state energies and excited state redox potentials resulting in different reactivity toward organic micropollutants mcneill and canonica 2016 3 2 steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh it is known that the k obs values in the presence of dom are associated with the steady state concentrations of the ris 3dom 1o2 and oh and second order reaction rate constants for the reaction with the ris ryan et al 2011 therefore the steady state concentrations 3dom ss 1o2 ss and oh ss for the cs dom 1 and 2 and fw dom srfa and srnom were measured table 2 it can be seen that the steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh for the cs dom are significantly lower than those for the fw dom the steady state concentrations of the ris are associated with the formation quantum yields of the ris and the rates of light absorption of dom zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore the quantum yields φ 3dom φ 1o2 φ oh for formation of 3dom 1o2 and oh were also measured as can be seen from table 2 the cs dom has relatively higher formation quantum yields of 3dom than the fw dom however the rates of light absorption for cs dom 1 5 17 10 10 e l 1 s 1 and cs dom 2 6 09 10 10 e l 1 s 1 are significantly lower than those of srfa 2 34 10 9 e l 1 s 1 and srnom 2 28 10 9 e l 1 s 1 due to the lower absorbance of the cs dom fig 2 therefore it is the lower rates of light absorption of the cs dom that results in the lower steady state concentrations of the ris in the presence of the cs dom although the steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh for the fw dom are higher than those for the cs dom the k obs values in presence of the cs dom are close to or even higher than those in presence of the fw dom implying there are other important factors affecting the photodegradation kinetics besides the steady state concentrations of the ris from the absorption spectra of the dom fig 2 the values for s 275 295 s 350 400 s r e2 e3 and suva254 were calculated table 3 the s 275 295 maizel and remucal 2017 e2 e3 maizel and remucal 2017 and suva254 rering et al 2017 values for srfa determined in this study are consistent with the ones reported previously helms et al 2008 employed the s r values to compare dom from different water types and reported that the s r values for dom from eight coastal seawater samples in georgia bight were in the range of 1 74 4 56 as shown in table 3 the s r values of the cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 are 1 79 and 2 37 respectively cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 have higher s r values than srnom and srfa previous studies also reported that marine dom has higher s r values than freshwater dom helms et al 2008 stephens and minor 2010 as the values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r are proxies for the degree of photobleaching of dom helms et al 2008 helms et al 2013 galí et al 2016 it can be inferred that cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 undergo more photobleaching than the terrestrially derived suwannee river dom for the cs dom photobleaching leads to significant loss of chromophores and leads to the low absorbance the lower suva254 values for the cs dom than those of srfa and srnom also indicates that the cs dom has lower aromaticity and lower absorbance the ftir spectra for the dom samples are shown in fig 3 the band at 1720 cm 1 can be assigned to c o stretching of carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups esteves et al 2009 the band at 1628 cm 1 can be assigned to c c stretching of aromatics and c o stretching of amide and quinones stephens and minor 2010 for the cs dom intensities of these bands are weaker than those of the fw dom indicating less aromatic contents for the cs dom this result is consistent with the observations in the uv visible absorption the band at 1450 cm 1 that relates with c h deformation in methyl and methylene groups abdulla et al 2010 zhang et al 2013b is stronger for the cs dom than for the fw dom this result indicates that the cs dom contains more branched aliphatic structures that result dominantly from microbial activities esteves et al 2009 the band at around 1200 1000 cm 1 can be assigned to c o stretching in carbohydrate stephens and minor 2010 esteves et al 2009 the intensity of this band for the cs dom is much higher than that of the fw dom the carbohydrate compounds in the cs dom can be mainly derived from decomposition of cellulose material and algae esteves et al 2009 thus the ftir spectra further explain why the cs dom has weaker absorption than the fw dom 3 3 contribution of the ris to the photodegradation to quantify the contribution of oh to photodegradation of bp 1 in the different dom solutions the second order rate constant for the reaction of oh with bp 1 k oh was determined to be 4 8 109 m 1 s 1 fig s5 multiplying oh ss by the k oh value leads to the oh induced photolytic rate constants of 7 38 10 4 h 1 and 5 33 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the oh induced degradation rate constants account for 2 1 and 19 7 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the second order rate constant for the reaction of 1o2 with bp 1 k 1o2 was determined to be 9 2 106 m 1 s 1 fig s6 consequently pseudo first order rate constants for 1o2 induced degradation of bp 1 were determined to be 9 79 10 4 h 1 and 4 46 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the 1o2 induced degradation accounts for 2 7 and 16 5 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively therefore the contribution of oh and 1o2 on the photodegradation in the presence of the cs dom is less than 5 due to significantly lower steady state concentrations of oh and 1o2 the contribution of 3dom on the photodegradation was estimated by subtracting the direct photolysis rate constant and pseudo first order rate constants induced by oh and 1o2 from the k obs values the direct photolysis rate constants for bp 1 in the presence of dom were corrected for the light screening as detailed in the sm the total light screening coefficients f were calculated to be 0 82 for cs dom 2 and 0 62 for srnom multiplying k obs for bp 1 in pure water by the f values leads to the direct photolysis rate constants of 4 88 10 3 h 1 and 3 69 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively as a result the 3dom induced pseudo first order degradation rate constants were estimated to be 2 94 10 2 h 1 and 1 35 10 2 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively therefore the 3dom induced pseudo first order rate constants account for 81 6 and 50 1 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the above results indicate that 3dom is the most important ri determining photodegradation of bp 1 especially in the presence of the cs dom thus in coastal seawaters that have considerable concentrations of dom due to input of terrestrial rivers and human activities such as mariculture 3dom may also play an important role in degradation of organic micropollutants previous studies also reported that ions in seawaters may promote degradation of micropollutants induced by 3dom through ionic strength effects glover and rosario ortiz 2013 parker et al 2013 wang et al 2018 from the 3dom ss values and the pseudo first order rate constants for the reaction between bp 1 and 3dom second order rate constants for bp 1 reacting with 3dom can be obtained the second order rate constants are 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 for cs dom 2 and 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 for srnom indicating that the cs 3dom reacts much faster with bp 1 than the fw 3dom previous studies indicated that dom from mariculture areas exhibits higher reactivity in promoting photodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics than that from the more pristine coastal waters due to high 3dom steady state concentrations for mariculture impacted dom wang et al 2018 in summary there is an inherent difference in the photoreactivity of the cs dom and fw dom on photodegradation of organic pollutants photochemical reactivity of dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants may also be influenced by contents of antioxidants in dom mcneill and canonica 2016 canonica and laubscher 2008 the eem spectra for the cs dom are shown in fig s7 and the percentage of protein like materials and humic like materials is listed in table s2 it can be seen that protein like materials are main components for the cs dom cs dom 1 65 2 cs dom 2 63 8 the protein like materials are mainly from autochthonous production associated with biological degradation of dom murphy et al 2008 srfa and srnom are terrestrial end member dom that has been well characterized with high percentages of aromatic moieties derived from lignin and tannins mcneill and canonica 2016 guerard et al 2009 compared with autochthonous dominated dom allochthonous dom contains more antioxidants such as phenolic moieties formed from higher plant precursors e g lignin and tannins wenk and canonica 2012 canonica and laubscher 2008 the antioxidants moieties in dom can repair some of photooxidation damage and reduce the oxidized intermediates back to parent compounds wenk and canonica 2012 yong et al 2013 wenk et al 2011 the k obs values for bp 1 in the dom solutions fig 4 were all corrected by the f values for light screening table s3 as can be seen from fig 4 the k obs values increase with the increment of the cs dom concentrations from 5 to 20 mg c l however with the increase in the fw dom concentrations the k obs values slightly decrease which can be due to the higher contents of antioxidants in the fw dom that can suppress the photodegradation therefore the lower contents of antioxidants in the cs dom may explain its higher photosensitizing abilities on photodegradation of bp 1 niu et al 2018 reported that the excited triplet states of norfloxacin could be quenched by natural organic matter nom and found norfloxacin possessed a higher affinity with nom isolates that have higher suva254 values in the current study the fw dom with the higher suva254 values may also has higher affinity with bp 1 than the cs dom leading to lower k obs values of bp 1 as far as we know this is a first attempt to unveil the differences in the effects of dom isolated from coastal seawaters and freshwaters on photodegradation of bp 1 as cs dom 1 and 2 have protein like materials as main components they are largely of autochthonous nature the salinities of coastal seawater samples 1 and 2 are 32 2 and 26 2 respectively murphy et al 2008 reported that seawaters with limited freshwater influence have salinities exceeding 30 although the 2 coastal seawater sample was collected from a tidal creek that may be impacted by local terrestrial inputs cs dom 2 is still largely of autochthonous nature as indicated by the eem results the effects of autochthonous dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants have been widely investigated pony lake fulvic acid plfa and effluent organic matter are typical autochthonous dom guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 however plfa suva254 4 4 m2 g c has significantly higher aromaticity rering et al 2017 than cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 previous studies reported that dom with different aromaticity have different photochemical reactivity on photodegradation of organic micropollutants galí et al 2016 rosado lausell et al 2011 wang et al 2018 besides dom derived from wastewater effluents is known to possess different photoreactive properties relative to naturally derived dom e g plfa zhang et al 2014 bodhipaksha et al 2015 2017 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 therefore it is of great importance to investigate the effects of cs dom on the photodegradation of organic micropollutants 4 conclusion in this study the effects of dom extracted from coastal seawaters cs dom and two kinds of commercial freshwater dom fw dom on photochemical behavior of bp 1 were investigated 3dom in coastal seawaters is exclusively responsible for bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the fw dom bp 1 is transformed mainly via reaction with 3dom 1o2 and oh jointly due to the higher steady state concentrations of these two ris compared with the fw dom the cs dom undergoes more photobleaching contains lower aromatic c c and c o functional groups and thus has lower rates of light absorption and exhibits lower 3dom 1o2 and oh steady state concentrations however the k obs values for bp 1 in the presence of the cs dom are higher than those in the presence of the fw dom due to higher reactivity of cs 3dom toward bp 1 and lower antioxidants contained in the cs dom than in the fw dom acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21661142001 appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this

19069,dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in degradation of organic pollutants by photochemically produced reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh however it is not clear whether dom extracted from coastal seawaters cs dom and dom derived from freshwaters fw dom exhibit similar effects on photodegradation of organic micropollutants herein 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 was adopted as a model compound to probe the effects of different dom on photodegradation kinetics of organic micropollutants results show that the cs dom promotes the photodegradation of bp 1 mainly via the pathway involving 3dom while 3dom 1o2 and oh are responsible for bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the fw dom compared with the fw dom the cs dom undergoes more photobleaching and contains less aromatic c c and c o functional groups although 3dom formation quantum yields for the cs dom are relatively higher than those for the fw dom the cs dom has lower rates of light absorption leading to lower steady state ri concentrations for the cs dom bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the cs dom is faster than in the presence of the fw dom due to higher second order reaction rate constants between bp 1 and cs 3dom and fewer antioxidants contained in the cs dom graphical abstract image

class of sunscreen agents kotnik et al 2016 li et al 2016 it was reported that the annual production of benzophenone derived compounds is approximately 4000 tons in china li et al 2016 because of the high volume application of bp 1 it has been frequently detected in various environmental waters in many regions of the world bp 1 concentrations were reported to be up to 135 117 and 280 ng l 1 in seawaters of hong kong tsui et al 2014 los angeles tsui et al 2014 and spain ramos et al 2015 respectively bp 1 was detected in rivers in bangkok and uk with concentrations up to 166 and 17 000 ng l 1 respectively previous studies reported that bp 1 has estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities causing hazard to organisms rainieri et al 2017 however little is known about the fate of bp 1 in the aquatic environment therefore it is of importance to understand bp 1 behavior in the aquatic environment for its ecological risk assessment photochemical degradation has been proved to be a major

matter dom plays an important role in indirect photodegradation of organic pollutants li et al 2015 2016 vione et al 2014 sunlight irradiated dom can lead to formation of primary and secondary reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh which can degrade organic pollutants zhang et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 al housari et al 2010 it was reported that 3dom can react with phenols canonica 2007 phenylurea herbicides canonica 2007 and sulfonamide antibiotics li et al 2015 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 1o2 also plays an important role in transformation of organic micropollutants bodhipaksha et al 2017 maddigapu et al 2011 oh reacts at near diffusion controlled rates with many organic compounds and it can even react with refractory pollutants vione et al 2014 however dom can also retard photodegradation of organic pollutants by shielding sunlight scavenging ris and quenching excited states of target pollutants zhang et al 2016 wenk et al 2013 wenk and canonica 2012 niu et al 2018 the specific role of dom in photodegradation of a specific organic pollutant depends on sources of dom guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 besides freshwater rivers and lakes coastal seawaters also have considerable concentrations of dom due to input of terrestrial rivers and human activities such as mariculture al housari et al 2010 herbeck et al 2013 in a recent study dom from mariculture impacted areas was found to exhibit higher reactivity than dom from the more pristine coastal seawaters in promoting photodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics wang et al 2018 dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching contains more humic like materials and more aromatic and carbonyl structures which lead to higher 3dom steady state concentrations and higher reactivity wang et al 2018 the combined effect of the steady state concentrations of ris and the second order rate constants between ris and organic pollutants are essential in determining the photochemical reactivity of dom on pollutant photodegradation compared with the dom from coastal seawaters cs dom the freshwater dom fw dom usually has higher chromophore and fluorophore contents that are relevant with steady state concentrations of ris coble 2007 helms et al 2008 timko et al 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 it is also known that for dom from different sources with different compositions the corresponding 3dom has different excited state reduction potentials mcneill and canonica 2016 guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 therefore dom extracted from coastal seawaters and freshwater river lakes may have different effects on photodegradation of micropollutants such as of bp 1 in this study coupled reverse osmosis electrodialysis ro ed method was adopted to extract cs dom since suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom were widely used in previous experimental studies on photodegradation of micropollutants li et al 2017 bahnmüller et al 2014 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 erickson et al 2018 steady state photochemical experiments were performed on photodegradation of bp 1 so as to compare the effects of cs dom with those of srfa and srnom 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are described in the supplementary material sm 2 2 sample collection and dom isolation 1 two coastal seawater samples 1 and 2 were collected from the bohai sea of china sample 1 was taken from dalian coastal area in september 2015 and 2 was from a tidal creek of the yellow river estuary in july 2015 at each sampling site 200 l of seawaters was collected and transported to the laboratory immediately a portion of the water samples was filtered sequentially through 1 0 and 0 45 μm polypropylene filters and stored at 4 c for further analysis dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of the samples were determined with a toc analyzer multi n c 2100s jena germany salinity conductivity and ph were measured using a wtw water quality analyzer multi 3420 set g germany on the spot for which the results are listed in table 1 a reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed system that was used in our previous studies wang et al 2016 2018 was adopted to isolate dom from the filtrated seawater samples since water is split into h and oh that can lead to ph changes in the diluate and concentrate compartments if the applied electric current reaches or exceeds the limiting current at a given diluate conductivity gurtler et al 2008 cowan and brown 1959 the limiting current was determined for the ed stack before the isolation process the ed current was always kept well below the limiting current for desalting the concentrate compartment was fed with a solution of 0 05 m nacl the electrode compartment was fed with a solution of 0 4 m na2so4 and the diluate compartment with the seawater to be desalted the flow rate of the diluate and concentrate was 500 l h the ed was operated in a constant current mode if the conductivity is above 15 ms cm otherwise a constant voltage mode was carried out 2 3 spectroscopic measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the dom samples were measured with a shimadzu prestige 21 ftir spectrometer as detailed in the sm uv visible absorption spectra were measured with a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer the spectra were recorded against pure water over a range of 200 700 nm the average absorbance in the range of 650 700 nm was subtracted from the spectra to correct for the small offsets of the baseline kujawinski et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 m2 g c was determined by normalizing the absorbance to doc concentration and used as a proxy for aromaticity of dom helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 weishaar et al 2003 the spectral slopes s nm 1 over the wavelength range of 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm were determined by fitting the absorption spectra to the following exponential decay function by nonlinear regression helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 1 s 1 λ 0 λ ln α λ α λ 0 where α λ 0 and α λ are the napierian absorption coefficients at wavelength λ 0 and λ respectively α λ is converted from absorbance a by the following equation 2 α λ 2 3 a λ r where r is optical path length spectral slope ratio s r was calculated by dividing s 275 295 by s 350 400 helms et al 2008 helms et al 2013 dom molecular weight can be decreased by photobleaching when the molecular weight distribution is shifted to low molecular weight the absorption spectrum will shift to greater relative absorption at shorter wavelengths leading increased s r values due to increase in s 275 295 and decrease in s 350 400 values helms et al 2008 the ratio between the absorbance at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 was also calculated to track the changes in the relative size of dom molecules helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 de laurentiis et al 2013b with the increase in molecular size e2 e3 decrease due to stronger light absorption by high molecular weight dom at longer wavelengths helms et al 2008 thus e2 e3 is also a proxy for the degree of photobleaching helms et al 2008 maizel and remucal 2017 de laurentiis et al 2013b fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of the dom samples extracted from the coastal seawaters cs dom were measured with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer as detailed in the sm the eem can be divided into five regions based on the fluorescence regional integration technique that was frequently used to quantify eem spectra for dom chen et al 2003 the eem peaks can be associated with protein like e g i tyrosine tryptophan amino acid with ex em 200 250 nm 280 330 nm ii tyrosine tryptophan protein with ex em 200 250 nm 330 380 nm and iv tryptophan like or soluble microbial byproduct like material with ex em 250 380 nm 280 380 nm and humic like e g iii fulvic acid with ex em 200 250 nm 380 500 nm and v humic acid with ex em 250 380 nm 380 500 mn dom components chen et al 2003 2 4 photochemical experiments an xpa 7 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing the reaction solutions was used the light transmittance of the quartz tube was shown in fig s1 a water refrigerated 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the irradiance spectrum of the light source was recorded by a trios spectroradiometer with a ramses acc uv sensor germany the light source mimics the solar light spectrum with an intensity of approximately 33 w m2 from 290 to 400 nm for comparison natural sunlight intensity was also measured by the same trios spectroradiometer at noon on september 21 2015 in the sampling areas as can be seen from fig s2 the irradiation intensity of the 1000 w xenon lamp with the 290 nm cutoff filters is close to that of the natural sunlight thus the xenon lamp with the 290 nm cutoff filters could be used to simulated sunlight in this study the initial concentration of bp 1 in the photolytic solutions was 5 μm the concentration of dom was 10 mg c l which represents the environmentally relevant level of dom in natural waters li et al 2017 felcyn et al 2012 guerard and chin 2012 zhang et al 2018 to clarify the role of 3dom and oh in the photodegradation scavenging experiments were performed using sorbic acid as a quencher of 3dom li et al 2015 and 2 propanol as a quencher of oh ryan et al 2011 perinaphthenone and 3 methoxyacetophenone 1 μm as model triplet sensitizers ryan et al 2011 were employed to investigate the reactivity between bp 1 and 3dom dark control experiments with pure water under the same conditions were performed to know whether bp 1 undergoes other degradation except for photodegradation the steady state concentrations for the ris 1o2 oh and 3dom generated in the systems containing dom can be calculated as zhou et al 2018 3 r i s s r r i s r i where r ri is the formation rates of ris s ri is scavenging rate constants 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was used as a probe to measure the formation rate of 3dom al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013b tmp was spiked into the dom solutions with an initial concentration of 100 μm all the dom solutions were buffered to ph 8 0 with 10 mm phosphate to eliminate the interference of ph and ionic strength the second order reaction rate constant between tmp and 3dom k tmp 3dom is 3 109 m 1 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b although tmp can also react with 1o2 and oh the contribution of 1o2 and oh to the overall tmp transformation would be negligible compared to that of 3dom zhou et al 2018 in addition 3dom would mainly react with 3o2 to give 1o2 or undergo various deactivation reactions such processes were assumed to have a lumped first order deactivation rate constant of s 3dom 5 105 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b the initial triplet formation rate r 3dom can be obtained as follows de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 4 r d 3 o m r t m p r 0 k t m p d 3 o m t m p s d 3 o m k t m p d 3 o m t m p where r tmp is the transformation rate of tmp in the dom solutions r 0 is direct photolysis rate of tmp furfuryl alcohol ffa was used as a probe to measure the formation of 1o2 zhang et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2013b ffa was added to the buffered dom solutions with an initial concentration of 50 μm along with methanol 0 1 m to quench oh direct photolysis of ffa was negligible due to its low molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield under wavelength 290 nm zhang et al 2014 the formation rate of 1o2 r 1o2 can be calculated as follows 5 r o 2 1 r f f a k f f a o 2 1 f f a s o 2 1 k f f a o 2 1 f f a where r ffa is the degradation rate of ffa k ffa 1o2 is the second order reaction rate constant 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 between ffa and 1o2 de laurentiis et al 2013b s 1o2 is the physical quenching rate constant of 1o2 by water 2 5 105 s 1 and the overall decay of 1o2 is dominated by this process in aquatic systems de laurentiis et al 2013b the oh formation rate r oh was measured with hydroxylation of benzene to phenol de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 benzene was added into the buffered dom solutions at an initial concentration of 3 mm dong and rosario ortiz 2012 reported that scavenging rate constant 107 s 1 yielded by benzene is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the total scavenging rate constant 105 s 1 estimated from water matrices therefore benzene is the main scavenger in the system the second order reaction rate constant between oh and benzene k benzene oh is 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 de laurentiis et al 2013b and the scavenging rate constant s oh is k benzene oh benzene r oh was related to the formation rate of phenol r ph by a factor of 0 85 zhou et al 2018 6 r oh r ph 0 85 from the r ri values quantum yields φ ri can be calculated by the following equations de laurentiis et al 2013b zhou et al 2018 7 φ r i λ r r i λ k a λ d o m 8 k a λ i p ε λ 1 1 0 ε λ d o m z ε λ d o m z where k a λ is specific rate of light absorption dom stands for the concentration of dom mg c l k a λ dom is the rate of light absorption by dom i p is surface photon irradiance that was obtained by relative emissions of the xenon lamp multiplied by corresponding transmittance of the quartz tubes einstein cm 2 s 1 ε λ is the molar absorptivity for a given wavelength from 290 to 400 nm m 1 cm 1 and z is the optical path length cm 2 5 determination of second order rate constants for bp 1 reaction with 1o2 k 1o2 and oh k oh k 1o2 and k oh were determined by the competition kinetics method xie et al 2013 for k 1o2 determination rose bengal was employed as 1o2 photosensitizer and ffa was adopted as 1o2 probe second order reaction rate constant between ffa and 1o2 is 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 the initial concentrations of rose bengal ffa and bp 1 were 5 μm 20 μm and 20 μm respectively a 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 380 nm cut off filters was used as the light source the k 1o2 value of bp 1 can be calculated with the following equation xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 9 k 1 o 2 s l n s t s 0 l n r t r 0 k 1 o 2 r where s and r represent bp 1 and the reference compound ffa respectively for determination of k oh a uv h2o2 system was used to generate oh xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 a 500 w mercury lamp surrounded by 340 nm cut off filters was used as the light source acetophenone was used as a reference compound with a known rate constant k oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 initial concentrations of h2o2 acetophenone and bp 1 were 100 μm 20 μm and 20 μm respectively the k oh value of bp 1 can be calculated with the following equation zhang et al 2018 10 k o h s l n s t s 0 l n r t r 0 k o h r 2 6 analytical methods an agilent 1260 hplc with a diode array detector and a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 3 0 150 mm 3 5 μm was employed for quantification of bp 1 2 4 6 trimethylphenol furfuryl alcohol phenol and acetophenone the mobile phase compositions detection wavelengths flow rates and injection volumes are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different dom on photodegradation of bp 1 in the dark control no obvious loss of bp 1 was observed fig s3 linear regression of ln c t c 0 vs time t shows that the photodegradation of bp 1 followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 in pure water the observed pseudo first order photolytic rate constants k obs was 5 95 0 35 10 3 h 1 fig 1 and the half life t 1 2 was 117 h kotnik et al 2016 also reported that t 1 2 for photolysis of bp 1 was more than 100 h in distilled water upon sunlight irradiation based on eq s 4 in the sm apparent quantum yield of bp 1 photolysis was obtained to be 2 1 10 2 the average k obs values for bp 1 in the solutions with the coastal seawater dom cs dom 1 and 2 were determined to be 2 32 0 10 10 2 h 1 and 3 60 0 24 10 2 h 1 respectively fig 1 with the srnom and srfa the corresponding k obs values are 2 70 0 26 10 2 h 1 and 2 34 0 11 10 2 h 1 respectively therefore the photodegradation rates of bp 1 in the solutions with dom are much higher than that in pure water indicating that dom is an effective photosensitizer for bp 1 photodegradation cs dom 2 and srnom was adopted to probe the photodegradation mechanisms as can be seen from fig 1 in the presence of the srnom the photodegradation rate was inhibited with the addition of 2 propanol as a quencher of oh while no effect was observed in the presence of cs dom 2 therefore the freshwater dom fw dom can photosensitize degradation of bp 1 via oh while the cs dom cannot additionally in the presence of the cs dom the addition of sorbic acid as a quencher of 3dom almost completely retarded the photodegradation fig 1 suggesting that bp 1 reacts almost exclusively with 3dom k obs was just reduced by about a half in the presence of the fw dom with the addition of sorbic acid fig 1 indicating that 3dom reactivity for the coastal seawater and freshwater dom is different in promoting the degradation additionally k obs was significantly enhanced in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment as ground state 3o2 is a quencher of 3dom removal of dissolved oxygen by n2 sparging can decrease the formation rate of 1o2 as well as the quenching rate of 3dom in the system li et al 2015 therefore the removal of oxygen in the system consequently increases 3dom ss and decrease 1o2 ss this result further indicates that 3dom is an important species involved in the enhanced photodegradation of bp 1 and 1o2 is not as important if 1o2 is the major reactive species for the photodegradation the photodegradation rates would decrease in the deoxygenation experiment to further verify susceptibility to the reaction of bp 1 with triplet excited states 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone were used in pure water as model triplet sensitizers the k obs value for bp 1 is 0 033 0 005 h 1 in the presence of 3 methoxyacetophenone and 0 543 0 011 h 1 in the presence of perinapthenone fig s4 further confirming that bp 1 is susceptible to reactions with 3dom since it is difficult to investigate the properties of 3dom directly owing to the great variety of chromophores present in dom proxies of dom e g 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone were commonly employed as proxies of dom to investigate triplet mediated transformations canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 mcneill and canonica 2016 ryan et al 2011 3 methoxyacetophenone and perinapthenone could be employed as proxies of dom in environmental photochemical investigations on organic micropollutants since their molecules contain aromatic carbonyl structures and aromatic ketones were regarded to be main 3dom precursors in dom moieties canonica 2007 canonica et al 1995 cawley et al 2009 sharpless et al 2014 different proxies of triplet sensitizers have disparate excited state energies and excited state redox potentials resulting in different reactivity toward organic micropollutants mcneill and canonica 2016 3 2 steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh it is known that the k obs values in the presence of dom are associated with the steady state concentrations of the ris 3dom 1o2 and oh and second order reaction rate constants for the reaction with the ris ryan et al 2011 therefore the steady state concentrations 3dom ss 1o2 ss and oh ss for the cs dom 1 and 2 and fw dom srfa and srnom were measured table 2 it can be seen that the steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh for the cs dom are significantly lower than those for the fw dom the steady state concentrations of the ris are associated with the formation quantum yields of the ris and the rates of light absorption of dom zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 therefore the quantum yields φ 3dom φ 1o2 φ oh for formation of 3dom 1o2 and oh were also measured as can be seen from table 2 the cs dom has relatively higher formation quantum yields of 3dom than the fw dom however the rates of light absorption for cs dom 1 5 17 10 10 e l 1 s 1 and cs dom 2 6 09 10 10 e l 1 s 1 are significantly lower than those of srfa 2 34 10 9 e l 1 s 1 and srnom 2 28 10 9 e l 1 s 1 due to the lower absorbance of the cs dom fig 2 therefore it is the lower rates of light absorption of the cs dom that results in the lower steady state concentrations of the ris in the presence of the cs dom although the steady state concentrations of 3dom 1o2 and oh for the fw dom are higher than those for the cs dom the k obs values in presence of the cs dom are close to or even higher than those in presence of the fw dom implying there are other important factors affecting the photodegradation kinetics besides the steady state concentrations of the ris from the absorption spectra of the dom fig 2 the values for s 275 295 s 350 400 s r e2 e3 and suva254 were calculated table 3 the s 275 295 maizel and remucal 2017 e2 e3 maizel and remucal 2017 and suva254 rering et al 2017 values for srfa determined in this study are consistent with the ones reported previously helms et al 2008 employed the s r values to compare dom from different water types and reported that the s r values for dom from eight coastal seawater samples in georgia bight were in the range of 1 74 4 56 as shown in table 3 the s r values of the cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 are 1 79 and 2 37 respectively cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 have higher s r values than srnom and srfa previous studies also reported that marine dom has higher s r values than freshwater dom helms et al 2008 stephens and minor 2010 as the values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r are proxies for the degree of photobleaching of dom helms et al 2008 helms et al 2013 galí et al 2016 it can be inferred that cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 undergo more photobleaching than the terrestrially derived suwannee river dom for the cs dom photobleaching leads to significant loss of chromophores and leads to the low absorbance the lower suva254 values for the cs dom than those of srfa and srnom also indicates that the cs dom has lower aromaticity and lower absorbance the ftir spectra for the dom samples are shown in fig 3 the band at 1720 cm 1 can be assigned to c o stretching of carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups esteves et al 2009 the band at 1628 cm 1 can be assigned to c c stretching of aromatics and c o stretching of amide and quinones stephens and minor 2010 for the cs dom intensities of these bands are weaker than those of the fw dom indicating less aromatic contents for the cs dom this result is consistent with the observations in the uv visible absorption the band at 1450 cm 1 that relates with c h deformation in methyl and methylene groups abdulla et al 2010 zhang et al 2013b is stronger for the cs dom than for the fw dom this result indicates that the cs dom contains more branched aliphatic structures that result dominantly from microbial activities esteves et al 2009 the band at around 1200 1000 cm 1 can be assigned to c o stretching in carbohydrate stephens and minor 2010 esteves et al 2009 the intensity of this band for the cs dom is much higher than that of the fw dom the carbohydrate compounds in the cs dom can be mainly derived from decomposition of cellulose material and algae esteves et al 2009 thus the ftir spectra further explain why the cs dom has weaker absorption than the fw dom 3 3 contribution of the ris to the photodegradation to quantify the contribution of oh to photodegradation of bp 1 in the different dom solutions the second order rate constant for the reaction of oh with bp 1 k oh was determined to be 4 8 109 m 1 s 1 fig s5 multiplying oh ss by the k oh value leads to the oh induced photolytic rate constants of 7 38 10 4 h 1 and 5 33 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the oh induced degradation rate constants account for 2 1 and 19 7 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the second order rate constant for the reaction of 1o2 with bp 1 k 1o2 was determined to be 9 2 106 m 1 s 1 fig s6 consequently pseudo first order rate constants for 1o2 induced degradation of bp 1 were determined to be 9 79 10 4 h 1 and 4 46 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the 1o2 induced degradation accounts for 2 7 and 16 5 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively therefore the contribution of oh and 1o2 on the photodegradation in the presence of the cs dom is less than 5 due to significantly lower steady state concentrations of oh and 1o2 the contribution of 3dom on the photodegradation was estimated by subtracting the direct photolysis rate constant and pseudo first order rate constants induced by oh and 1o2 from the k obs values the direct photolysis rate constants for bp 1 in the presence of dom were corrected for the light screening as detailed in the sm the total light screening coefficients f were calculated to be 0 82 for cs dom 2 and 0 62 for srnom multiplying k obs for bp 1 in pure water by the f values leads to the direct photolysis rate constants of 4 88 10 3 h 1 and 3 69 10 3 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively as a result the 3dom induced pseudo first order degradation rate constants were estimated to be 2 94 10 2 h 1 and 1 35 10 2 h 1 in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively therefore the 3dom induced pseudo first order rate constants account for 81 6 and 50 1 of k obs in the presence of cs dom 2 and srnom respectively the above results indicate that 3dom is the most important ri determining photodegradation of bp 1 especially in the presence of the cs dom thus in coastal seawaters that have considerable concentrations of dom due to input of terrestrial rivers and human activities such as mariculture 3dom may also play an important role in degradation of organic micropollutants previous studies also reported that ions in seawaters may promote degradation of micropollutants induced by 3dom through ionic strength effects glover and rosario ortiz 2013 parker et al 2013 wang et al 2018 from the 3dom ss values and the pseudo first order rate constants for the reaction between bp 1 and 3dom second order rate constants for bp 1 reacting with 3dom can be obtained the second order rate constants are 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 for cs dom 2 and 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 for srnom indicating that the cs 3dom reacts much faster with bp 1 than the fw 3dom previous studies indicated that dom from mariculture areas exhibits higher reactivity in promoting photodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics than that from the more pristine coastal waters due to high 3dom steady state concentrations for mariculture impacted dom wang et al 2018 in summary there is an inherent difference in the photoreactivity of the cs dom and fw dom on photodegradation of organic pollutants photochemical reactivity of dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants may also be influenced by contents of antioxidants in dom mcneill and canonica 2016 canonica and laubscher 2008 the eem spectra for the cs dom are shown in fig s7 and the percentage of protein like materials and humic like materials is listed in table s2 it can be seen that protein like materials are main components for the cs dom cs dom 1 65 2 cs dom 2 63 8 the protein like materials are mainly from autochthonous production associated with biological degradation of dom murphy et al 2008 srfa and srnom are terrestrial end member dom that has been well characterized with high percentages of aromatic moieties derived from lignin and tannins mcneill and canonica 2016 guerard et al 2009 compared with autochthonous dominated dom allochthonous dom contains more antioxidants such as phenolic moieties formed from higher plant precursors e g lignin and tannins wenk and canonica 2012 canonica and laubscher 2008 the antioxidants moieties in dom can repair some of photooxidation damage and reduce the oxidized intermediates back to parent compounds wenk and canonica 2012 yong et al 2013 wenk et al 2011 the k obs values for bp 1 in the dom solutions fig 4 were all corrected by the f values for light screening table s3 as can be seen from fig 4 the k obs values increase with the increment of the cs dom concentrations from 5 to 20 mg c l however with the increase in the fw dom concentrations the k obs values slightly decrease which can be due to the higher contents of antioxidants in the fw dom that can suppress the photodegradation therefore the lower contents of antioxidants in the cs dom may explain its higher photosensitizing abilities on photodegradation of bp 1 niu et al 2018 reported that the excited triplet states of norfloxacin could be quenched by natural organic matter nom and found norfloxacin possessed a higher affinity with nom isolates that have higher suva254 values in the current study the fw dom with the higher suva254 values may also has higher affinity with bp 1 than the cs dom leading to lower k obs values of bp 1 as far as we know this is a first attempt to unveil the differences in the effects of dom isolated from coastal seawaters and freshwaters on photodegradation of bp 1 as cs dom 1 and 2 have protein like materials as main components they are largely of autochthonous nature the salinities of coastal seawater samples 1 and 2 are 32 2 and 26 2 respectively murphy et al 2008 reported that seawaters with limited freshwater influence have salinities exceeding 30 although the 2 coastal seawater sample was collected from a tidal creek that may be impacted by local terrestrial inputs cs dom 2 is still largely of autochthonous nature as indicated by the eem results the effects of autochthonous dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants have been widely investigated pony lake fulvic acid plfa and effluent organic matter are typical autochthonous dom guerard et al 2009 ryan et al 2011 however plfa suva254 4 4 m2 g c has significantly higher aromaticity rering et al 2017 than cs dom 1 and cs dom 2 previous studies reported that dom with different aromaticity have different photochemical reactivity on photodegradation of organic micropollutants galí et al 2016 rosado lausell et al 2011 wang et al 2018 besides dom derived from wastewater effluents is known to possess different photoreactive properties relative to naturally derived dom e g plfa zhang et al 2014 bodhipaksha et al 2015 2017 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 therefore it is of great importance to investigate the effects of cs dom on the photodegradation of organic micropollutants 4 conclusion in this study the effects of dom extracted from coastal seawaters cs dom and two kinds of commercial freshwater dom fw dom on photochemical behavior of bp 1 were investigated 3dom in coastal seawaters is exclusively responsible for bp 1 photodegradation in the presence of the fw dom bp 1 is transformed mainly via reaction with 3dom 1o2 and oh jointly due to the higher steady state concentrations of these two ris compared with the fw dom the cs dom undergoes more photobleaching contains lower aromatic c c and c o functional groups and thus has lower rates of light absorption and exhibits lower 3dom 1o2 and oh steady state concentrations however the k obs values for bp 1 in the presence of the cs dom are higher than those in the presence of the fw dom due to higher reactivity of cs 3dom toward bp 1 and lower antioxidants contained in the cs dom than in the fw dom acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21661142001 appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this
