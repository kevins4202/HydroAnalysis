3895,erosion of the topsoil is a serious environmental problem worldwide that critically alarms agricultural and upland areas most wetlands rivers and reservoirs are losing their capacity because of sediment deposition into the water body from the upstream of watersheds as they were not managed soil and water assessment tool swat model is used to simulate streamflow sediment load identify spatiotemporal variability of the sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr point out erosion prone area and prioritize sub basins hydrologic response units hrus for management the model is implemented by utilizing a digital elevation model land use soil type and slope of the genale basin 464 hrus were created spreading over 25 sub basins within the drainage area 54 942km2 sufi 2 algorithm of swat calibration uncertainty programs swat cup is used to calibrate 1990 2005 and validated 2006 2013 streamflow sediment on monthly scale and the resulted statistics are r2 0 87 0 85 and nse 0 81 0 78 for flow calibration and validation respectively whereas r2 0 84 0 82 and nse 0 79 0 75 for sediment calibration and validation respectively significant spatiotemporal variability of sediment yield was observed in the watershed as the characteristics of the terrain land use soil type in each sub basin varies among the total 25 sub basins three sub basins produced a very high sediment rate 21 31 ton ha year one produced high 16 20 ton ha year one is moderate 11 15 ton ha year three were low 6 10 ton ha year and the rest 16 sub basins were under very low categories in the case of sdr three sub basins have very high sdr 0 452 two sub basins resulted in high sdr 0 326 0 451 which are located at the upland basin based on the model results sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 were identified as sediment prone areas further investigation at the hrus scale is taken to understand critical erosion areas and minimize the cost of management practice time human resources hru analysis

consequences while the onsite effect includes a reduction in cultivable soil depth soil fertility crop productivity and nutrient offsite negative impacts include reduced reservoir storage capacity increased flood risk and water quality degradation because of excess release of sediment and other pollutant loads moss 2008 in addition to these direct impacts all these factors combined effect can finally lead to potentially widespread food insecurity ayele gebremariam 2020 namomsa and adugna 2019 runoff water flowing over an erosion prone agriculture dominated watershed degrades the land productivity and becomes a source of sediment nutrients and pesticides for the nearby stream duru et al 2018 singh et al 2012 and their presence in excess quantity can adversely affect the aquatic biota sources of pollution for aquatic systems are primarily classified into point and non point sources nps point sources are contaminants generated from single identifiable sources of pollution such as discharge from waste water treatment plants and therefore relatively easy to handle however non point sources refer to pollutants that do not have a specific point of source and include sediment yields excess fertilizers herbicides and insecticides from agricultural and residential watershed areas dong et al 2018 babaei 2019 sediment yield being a nps pollutant controlling sediment loss at the source i e in the upper catchment itself using suitable soil conservation practices is ideal for eliminating all sediment related problems stated above however many a time it becomes challenging to take management measures in the entire watershed sub basin because of financial constraints particularly for a developing country identifying critical soil loss areas in a river basin watershed is fundamental to better soil loss control through land use prioritization and soil conservation mahoney et al 2018 a hydrological model providing sediment assessment can help identify such critical sediment contributing areas to prioritized management measures soil and water assessment tool swat one of the widely used physically based semi distributed hydrological model has a physical representation for spatiotemporal variability and are adequate for simulating the impacts of climate change anthropogenic activities on hydrological cycle environment swat can be used in a nearly continuous time domain to assess streamflow generation sediment yield water quality and quantity and thus facilitates studying the response of management practices at the sub basin hru level liu et al 2019 samimi et al 2020 xu et al 2009 change in socio economic conditions and increased anthropogenic activities have increased stress on the water resources watershed management challenges in ethiopia particularly in the genale catchment negewo and sarma 2021b in ethiopia the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation surface runoff varies all over the country causing significant spatial variation in soil erosion sediment yield such variability is more prominent in southern ethiopia in the genale river basin thus it can provide a better opportunity for taking soil and water conservation measures in sub catchment hrus scale to yield effective solutions with optimal funds and human resources to support local communities lives to prioritize critical sediment contributing areas one needs to assess soil erosion characteristics of a watershed from different angles gross erosion means the sum of all particles leaving the various erodible surface in the watershed the gross soil erosion in each hrus cell was calculated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle in swat daggupati et al 2011 the required model parameters for the musle can be calculated using the digital elevation model soil type and land use cover information on a cell basis jain and das 2010 however all the eroded sediment particles within the catchment are not transported to the watershed outlet as they are trapped and deposited in the upstream reaches the eroded sediment particles transported to the watershed outlet constitute the sediment yield sediment yieldcan also bedefinedas the amount ofsediment that leaves a boundary reaching or passing a point of interest in a given period expressed in mass per unit area bhattarai and dutta 2007 sediment delivery ratio sdr is defined as the ratio of sediment yield at the watershed outlet to the concerned watershed area s gross erosion the sdr has multi fold environmental significance in estimating the soil and water losses and the efficacy of control measures in watersheds wang et al 2018 the variations in ranges of sdr between sub basins are likely due to different physiographic characteristics such as land use soil type climate drainage area channel density slope gradient rainfall runofffactors and sediment transport processes both overland flow and channel and nearness to the mainstream in the catchment sub basins large sdr also indicates high erosion rates watersheds with large drainage areas will generally have a lower sdr than small watersheds as large areas within a watershed will have more chances to trap soil particles so the possibility of soil particles reaching the water channel system is low wu et al 2018 sdr represents the efficiency of the watershed in transporting soil particles sediment from areas of erosion to the point wheresedimentyield is measured therefore identifying sub basins with a high value of sdr will help minimize sediment yield at the watershed outlet woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 walling 1983 bartholic 2004 the sedimentation problem is also becoming a subject of discussion among researchers due to its negative effect on the available water capacity design and operation of hydropower reservoirs worldwide ebtehaj et al 2020 water shortage for different purposes backwater flooding and approximately one percent of reservoir storage capacity are being lost every year because sedimentation is becoming a major concern in most developing countries briak et al 2016 zarris et al 2011 the cost of reviving this lost capacity requires a massive amount of restoration work and it is better to construct new reservoirs instead therefore watershed modeling and management play a vital role in the early management planning and local resources development by identifying critical erosion zone adeogun et al 2018 liu et al 2019 markhi et al 2019 to reduce the peak rate of surface runoff causing soil erosion and sedimentation comprehensive understanding and estimation of hydrological processes land management soil types slope class and climatic conditions of different parts of the watersheds are fundamental in recent years the swat model is gaining popularity in hydrology and water resources research and has been adopted widely because of its robust algorithms for simulation of the hydrological system estimating sediment yield sdr and calculating nps pollutant transport in addition the scope of incorporating a comprehensive database on agricultural management practices is another advantage of the swat model negewo and sarma in press this study presents a systematic procedure of prioritizing the implementation of soil and water conservation measures in limited critical areas of a watershed to manage sediment related problems of the entire watershed including its stream network the procedure presented is implemented using the swat model integrated with geographic information system gis the criticality of an area the minimum extent being the hru level is assessed based on the severity of soil erosion sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr to evaluate its implementation suitability the proposed method is applied in the genale basin of ethiopia where soil erosion was identified as a major problem and its severity varies widely within the basin spatiotemporal variability of soil erosion sediment yield

constant of proportionality between the quantities following the visual observation we have evaluated the consistency of the data by slope calculation and finding the adjustment correction factor at the deviation point between cumulative plot linear trend line analysis and have distributed the adjustment factor by multiplying the data that need to be adjusted then the data adjusted using standard procedure are consistent with high values of correlation coefficient r2 as indicated in the plot fig 3 2 3 1 developing sediment rating curve src evaluation of sediment yield from watersheds depends on the length of the data series and the reliability of observed records of suspended sediment concentrations however some missing estimates are often derived from empirical relations between river discharges and corresponding sediment concentrations loads ulke et al 2009 mohammadi et al 2021 src is commonly used to produce a continuous time series of suspended sediment in the river based on available historical flow and sediment data src thus helps to predict a variable that is difficult to measure continuously from another variable easier to determine in the present study historical daily sediment concentration data are available from october 20 1987 to october 1 2005 however streamflow data are available from 1990 to 2013 i e with an overlapping period of 16 years with the sediment during the non rainy days particularly during non monsoon period sediment concentration remains almost negligible and generally is not collected by the department also to assess soil erosion due to water data of rainy days are important as we have carried out the model study on a monthly scale available daily sediment data for 16 years were converted to monthly data and used for developing sediment rating curves this derived equation of src eq 6 was used to continuously generate suspended sediment data for the period for which streamflow data are available and facilitate the

swat cup tool swat calibration and uncertainty programs is a program that interfaced with arc swat to perform output files generated by the swat model for calibration validation model performance evaluation parameterizations and sensitivity analysis to compromise the simulated value abbaspour 2011 in recent years of research hydrological modeling has given more attention to sensitivity analysis calibration validation to remove minimize sources of hydrological uncertainty before using the simulation output for planning management of any project for this reason researchers developed different uncertainty analysis techniques for hydrological watershed models which includes sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 particle swarm optimization pso markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter solution parasol and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue which are in a single package called swat cup markhi et al 2019 the sufi 2 can supply the broadest marginal parameter uncertainty intervals of model parameters furthermore it can consider all sources of uncertainties input data like weather generator model parameters and observed data therefore it is quite efficient and fast for large scale models in which the calibration process can be very time consuming moriasi et al 2007 2 4 1 statistical analysis of the swat model performance assessment this study estimated

2 2 5 sediment delivery ratio sdr in this work sdr for the sub basin is described as the ratio of sediment yield at the watershed outlet to the gross erosion total sediment load generated from an individual sub basin it is a non dimensional scalar and conventionally expressed as walling 1983 11 s d r syld e where syld is the average annual sediment yield sediment load at the end of slope length at the endpoint of watershed outlet per unit area and e is the yearly gross erosion from stream reach over that same area sdr is estimated using swat with the musle equation and compared with empirical equations walling 1983 boyce 1975 woznicki et al 2013 usda scs 1979 zarris et al 2011 vanoni 1975 12 sdr 0 5656 a 0 11 13 sdr 0 51 a 0 11 14 sdr 0 42 a 0 125 where a is the drainage area in square kilometers for equation 12 and square miles for equation 13 and 14 the expected values of sdr are from 0 floodplains to 1 in uplands of the basin because of possible deposition of eroded soil during transport and before reaching the watershed outlet walling 1983 park et al 2010 however sdr can also be more extensive than unity in watersheds of very small areas with extremely erosive streams 2 6 identification of critical erosion prone sub basins watershed management practice cannot be implemented into the whole multiple sub basins because of resource constraints like finances human resources time and land availability in the study area identifying erosion prone areas will draw researchers attention to the most problematic reach and reduce the involved financial cost required for minimizing sediment yield and nps pollutant transport for the whole watershed so the watershed s critical reach should be identified to implement soil and water conservation management measures by estimating the average annual sediment yield from each sub basin from 1990 to 2013 the sub basins were arranged in decreasing the significance of average annual sediment yield and classified as per erosion class specified by uniyal et al 2020 table 1 3 results in the present study the streamflow and sediment load data used for calibration parameterization uncertainty analysis validation of the model ranges from 1990 to 2013 in which for suspended sediment the extended data were predicted using sediment rating curve the model was created with dem land use cover soil type and slope characteristics for the genale basin which formed 25 sub basins 464 hrus with a drainage area of 54 942 km2 a hydrological model s capability to adequately simulate streamflow and sediment load typically accounts for the precise calibration validation of parameters which are indispensable for the simulation process to minimize uncertainties 3 1 uncertainty analysis for streamflow and sediment sensitivity analysis helps determine the relative ranking of parameters depending on how it affects the output variance due to input variability this helps in reducing uncertainty and provides parameter estimation guidance for the calibration step of the model sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the global sensitivity produced by the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup initially16 numbers of parameters were involved in the sensitivity analysis for streamflow after many iterations based on the p value t stat values ten parameters

unknown variables and the most sensitive parameters found to have the most considerable effect on the streamflow and sediment load in the model result were identified analysis of sediment sensitivity was carried out for a three year warm up period from 1987 to 1989 and 16 years calibration period from 1990 to 2005 and an 8 years validation period from 2006 to 2013 based on the p value and t stat

process used for the required objectives calibration of streamflow and sediment load was performed with several iterations of 500 simulations each was carried out for the monthly calibration period of 1990 2005 validation is required to verify whether the calibrated parameters also work for other data of different years within the watershed validation involves a model run with continuous flow and sediment parameters already adjusted during the calibration process validation period 2006 2013 results showed a satisfactory performance as statistical measures are in the allowable range for streamflow and sediment table 3 shows the acceptable ranges of statically performance criteria for the model abbaspour 2011 and moriasi et al 2007 stated about the good and satisfactory rating of p factor r factor no fixed numbers exist but they acknowledge that the results should capture most of the observations with small uncertainty within the range for p factor 0 1 and r factor close to zero but ranges from zero to infinity uncertainty measure of swat cup sufi 2 indicated that p factor of 0 51 and r factor of 0 78 for calibration and p factor of 0 50 and r factor of 0 86 for validation table 4 p factor r factor are the two indices calculated to evaluate the model uncertainty p factor is the percentage of observed data enveloped shaded by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu in sensitivity analysis represented by green color while r factor is the average width thickness of the 95ppu band envelopes of the observed data thus the p factor of 1 and r factor of zero indicate that the simulation exactly precisely corresponds to the observed data without sources of uncertainty which is impossible in the reality of hydrological modeling in this study p factor for calibration and validation is 0 51 0 50 respectively which means about 51 of calibration and 50 of validation of the observed flow were bracket by 95ppu band therefore the swat model is at an acceptable level of uncertainty for analyzing the genale river basin s flow fig 7 shows the calibration and validation of the swat model where the model computed values are in good agreement with the monthly observed streamflow as indicated the model s simulated and observed sediment load agreed and showed a satisfactory performance during the calibration and validation process fig 8 3 2 spatial and temporal variation of sediment delivery ratio sdr at watershed scale 3 2 1 spatial variation of sdr this section aims to resolve each sub basin sediment contribution to the watershed outlet using sdr and identify erosion prone areas within the catchment from table 5 the average sub basins sdr dispersed in the genale watershed in this case the identified area of high priority was covered with 12 347 6 km2 agricultural and brushland over a steep upland sub basin sdr disparity is mainly due to the differences in land use cover soil type sub basin size the slope of sub basins and stream channel characteristics understandably the value of sdr is higher near the watershed outlet because there is a probability of transporting all eroded sediment loads at the watershed outlet from fig 9 the spatial variability of sdr ranges from 0 001 sub 15 and sub 21 to 0 754 sub 7 sub 7 6 8 12 and 10 have high sdr values and high sediment yield within the catchment so they should be prioritized for implementing management practice sub basins with relatively high gross erosion but low sediment yield produce a small sdr value which means sdr directly relates to sediment yield at a sub watershed outlet fig 9 for instance sub basins 15 16 20 21 and 25 have very high gross erosion but produce very low sediment yield resulting in small sdr in the sub basins fig 9 because of maximum stream transport capacity is reached and a greater proportion of sediment yield deposition effect before reaching into the sub basins outlet that is why the generated sub basin sediment yield is very low compared to gross erosion additionally sediment yield is very low in large sub basins and the probability of sediment deposition in a large watershed is higher than in a small watershed under the same circumstances these sub basins are relatively large in drainage areas range shrubs and forest cover which might curbs arrest some amounts of sediment yield moreover from fig 11 c in the manuscript based on the spatial distribution the generated surface runoff from the same sub basins are still under the category of very low and low which also resulted in very low and low sediment yield from the respective sub basins and other physiographic characteristics that dictate erosion potential 3 2 2 temporal variation of sdr analyzing the temporal variability of sdr at the watershed scale is significant to understanding the sediment transport process therefore management practice in the catchment can be preferred accordingly from fig 10 the sdr values of the genale watershed at the outlet varied from 0 08 december to 0 86 may gross erosion from all sub basins and sediment yield at sub basins outlet is the most significant in may october april and september and similarly these months have high sdr values 3 2 3 comparing sdr values using swat musle versus area based empirical methods a comparison between the sdr value calculated by the swat model and empirical methods was also carried out although they produced similar results to the swat model the sdr values vary in the genale watershed the swat musle estimation for the genale watershed indicated that 19 of all sediment entering a stream reach would be transported to the watershed outlet table 6 from table 6 vanoni 1975 predicted a somewhat lower value of sdr for the genale watershed while the usda scs 1979 and the boyce 1975 method predicted comparable values with the swat musle model for the watershed the convenience of using the swat musle model to predict sdr is that it simulates channel transport processes and considers the physiographic characteristics and detailed spatial data over the entire watershed other empirical methods lump temporal and spatial sediment transport data without considering climatic variations land use cover slope class and soil type a physically based and spatially distributed model is more suited to calculate sdr for watershed planning and decision making therefore this study uses the swat musle model which considers spatial variability climatic data channel transport etc 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield at sub basins scale the variability of sediment yields spatially and temporally occurred in the watershed due to the dem land use cover soil type rainfall distribution slope classes and watershed management practice which formed uneven sediment yield distribution in each sub basin the results obtained from the swat model indicate that significant portions of highly gradient sub basins near the stream network urbanized highly cultivated brushland areas are more critical to the sediment yield rate for the existing conditions in the studied basin 3 3 1 spatial variability at sub basins scale swat model was simulated annually for 24 years of sediment data at a sub basins level the spatial variability of sediment yield for the entire genale watershed was estimated and the average annual sediment yield was found to vary significantly within the catchment as shown in fig 11 from fig 11 among the total 25 sub basins three sub basins produced sediment rate at very high 21 31 ton ha year one sub basin was high 16 20 ton ha year one sub basin produced moderate 11 15 ton ha year four were low 6 10 ton ha year and the rest 16 sub basins were under low categories sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 were identified as erosions prone areas the average sediment yield of five identified sediment hot spot sub basins was 21 8 ton ha year and covered 22 47 of the total watershed area critical sub basins are located in areas with a steep slope high surface runoff and high rainfall fig 11 as shown in the correlation coefficient matrix the spatial distribution of sediment yield is remarkably responsive to the precipitation surface runoff and mean slope of the respective sub basins table 7 from fig 12 sub basins with a steep slope have high sediment yield sub 6 8 12 10 and 7 while sub basins with mild slope produced low sediment yield except that sub 19 23 and 24 which produced slightly low moderate sediment yield in which their land use cover was dominated by range brushland and agricultural area although the slope values for the sub 19 23 and 24 are similar other physiographic factors like land use cover the shape of sub basins area of sub basins also influence the sub basins sediment yield at the sub basins level the slope was taken on an average basis and they were found to be in the same range in all the sub 19 23 and 24 however at the hrus scale there is a visibility of slope variation as we have seen particularly for hrus in sub 6 fig 15 additionally as seen from fig 11 based on the spatial distribution precipitation and runoff are high in sub 23 and 24 leading to high sediment yield all these combinations make the difference in sediment yield although the basin scale mean slope is within the same range in the sub 19 23 and 24 similarly for sub 2 3 4 5 11 13 14 and 16 25 though the mean slope value looks the same there is a slight difference in sediment yield from these sub basins here the effects of other physiographic characteristic factors land use cover shape of sub basin area of sub basins might be over dominating the effect of slope to cause variation in sediment yield from sub basins having the same slope moreover the slope was taken as average mean value and therefore for the sub basins mentioned above slope values are approaching each other on the other hand if we explore at the hrus scale their slope is also different as we have seen particularly for hrus in sub 6 fig 15 3 3 2 temporal variability at sub basins scale the temporal variation of sediment yield was evaluated over the entire genale basin using the monthly simulated swat model according to the results the average sediment yields obtained during may and october are almost double the sediment yields in other months fig 13 note pcp precipitation surqmm surface runoff the temporal variability of sediment yield distribution in the study area is divided into five sediment yield classes meager erosion time january february and december low erosion time march july and november moderate erosion time june august and september high soil erosion time april and very severe soil erosion time which was in may and october fig 13 it is observed that high sediment yield occurred in may october april september august and june whereas low sediment yield was observed in november december january february and march the average temporal variability of sediment yield is 0 667 ton ha the temporal variability of sediment yield is positively correlated with rainfall distribution streamflow and surface runoff fig 13 3 4 spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield at hrus level to understand in depth about critical erosion areas further investigation at the hrus scale is very important to avoid confusion when land use cover slope and soil type are in doubt besides it helps the stakeholders more when resources like finance human power time and land availability are limited furthermore this investigation allowed us to identify parts where severe soil losses and need prioritization note surqmm surface runoff in mm hrus hydrologic response units sub 6 sub basin number 6 in general the hrus with higher surface runoff is expected to generate significant sediment yield however for particular three 3 hrus hru 181 182 and 183 sediment yield is limited as the lulc over the areas is mixed forest and it dominated the results by curbing and arresting sediment yield at the early stage fig 14 at hrus scale among the 31 hrus scattered in sub 6 only eight 8 hrus such as hru 158 159 160 161 168 169 170 and 171 are assessed to be erosion prone areas in terms of sediment yield while others are insignificant regarding the comparison of sediment yield at sub basins and hrus level separately in the watershed four 4 hrus hru 158 hru 159 hru 160 and hru 161 are found in a highly agricultural area having a steep slope which contributes significant sediment yield fig 15 on the other hand sub 19 23 and 24 are at the sub basins scale which exhibits low and moderate sediment yield and still exhibits visible results compared to other sub basins with the same mean slope because of the presence of agriculture and range brushland in the area economically identifying erosion prone areas is vital to encourage management practice and discourage catchment mismanagement particularly at the hrus level fig 15 shows the influence of slope gradient land use cover on sediment yield the hrus with a steep slope agricultural and range brush land cover produced high sediment yield in the catchment particularly in sub 6 on the other hand three 3 hrus hru 181 182 and 183 from fig 14 which exhibits recognizable surface runoff did not contribute significant sediment yield fig 15 as the lulc effects forest mixed dominated over the influence of surface runoff and slope as seen in fig 15 hru 174 with a high gradient steep slope produced very low insignificant sediment yield due to non recorded surface runoff in that particular hydrologic response unit fig 14 analysis at hrus level in the subbasin 6 has revealed an interesting fact that the magnitude of sediment yield precipitation and surface runoff is relatively higher at the hru level than at the sub basin level figs 14 and 16 this is basically because of the averaging effect at the sub basin level from fig 16 a very high sediment yield was recorded in 1996 and 1997 66 3 and 58 5 ton ha respectively while the lowest sediment yield was obtained in 2005 and 2004 2 and 9 3 ton ha respectively the temporal variation of sediment yield at the hru level follows the precipitation and surface runoff graphs in the catchment i e the influence of precipitation and surface runoff is directly proportional to the sediment yield hru level fig 16 4 discussions even though the challenge of soil erosion is clearly exhibited by available estimate of gross erosion and field observations there is a need for quantitative information at the watershed sub basins and hrus level and identifying sediment contributing areas within the catchment is necessary to implement management measures at optimal cost and effort a hydrologic modeling based approach of identifying critically degraded areas within a watershed is presented in this paper and the proposed approach is implemented in the genale watershed of ethiopia to demonstrate its applicability widely used semi distributed physically based hydrological model swat integrated with arcgis is applied after calibration and validation using available streamflow and sediment transport data from 1990 2013 successful implementation of the model has helped identify the soil erosion critical regions at sub basins and hydrologic response units hrus scale to prioritize the needful watershed management based on the sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr in the genale basin ethiopia in addition to proposing this generalized modeling based approach our effort was also towards the regional importance as identification of soil erosion critical sub basins or at hrus scale providing vital information to help watershed management decision making for solving the community problem adopting early watershed management measures in the catchment is not yet reported in the study area the consistency of precipitation data can always be questioned in such a less explored basin therefore consistency of precipitation data was ensured by using a double mass curve dmc evaluating the adjustment correction factor at the deviation point between cumulative plot linear trend line analysis and distributing the adjustment factor by multiplying the data that need to be adjusted and then checking the correlation coefficient r2 owolabi et al 2021 gao et al 2017 historical daily data of sediment concentration was available from october 20 1987 to october 1 2005 but since streamflow data was available from 1990 to 2013 the suspended sediment record was systematically extended to make its length equal with the streamflow period to meet the requirement of calibration and validation process this is achieved by developing a sediment rating curve src mohammadi et al 2021 and predicting sediment concentration from 1987 to 2013 continuously on a monthly basis to perform the required calibration and validation for 27 years which is standard practice for the data scarce region as supported by different report research fig 4 the previous study by ulke et al 2009 used from 1971 to 1985 data range for streamflow sediment load calibration and validation the study by uniyal et al 2020 used from 1999 to 2003 the study by markhi et al 2019 used streamflow and sediment data from 1990 to 2015 the study by liu et al 2019 used from 2006 to 2013 for sediment validation setegn et al 2010 xu et al 2009 meshram et al 2020 also used the data range for sediment calibration validation from 1984 to 1993 1986 1991 1990 2015 respectively which convinced the validation of the present study on genale watershed as far as the data range is concerned compared to other empirical models the convenience of using the swat musle model include better prediction accuracy with less uncertainty considers watershed physiographic characteristics land use cover soil type topography climate drainage area and the ability for single storm estimates of sediment yield neitsch et al 2011 therefore a physically based and spatially distributed model that can simulate channel transport processes is more suited to calculating sdr for watershed planning and decision making sdr results were also compared with standard widely used empirical equations to ensure that the result obtained from swat musle are in order generally a sub basin having high gross erosion and located close to the watershed outlet in terms of stream distance is expected to produce high sdr value however as value of sdr depends both on sediment transport deposition characteristic of the stream as well as physiographic characteristic of the basin deviation from the expected trend was observed in different studies woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 walling 1983 bartholic 2004 genale watershed is also not an exception as sdr value is found to be relatively less for some of the sub basins located close to the watershed outlet low value of sdr indicates better capability of the watershed in restricting movement of eroded soil and thus implies low watershed degradation high sdr value is of concern as it not only indicates degradation of sub basin but also poses a threat of flooding due to loss of flow carrying capacity of the downstream channel reach therefore sdr value of different sub basins of genale catchment is used for prioritizing sub basins needing attention hru analysis in a degraded sub basin helped in identifying critical erosion area for adopting watershed management practices on priority basis identifying the most erosion critical areas has a regional importance and will help the local government authority and other stakeholders involved in soil and water conservation activities within the genale catchment the magnitude and variation in sediment yield were significant at a smaller scale hru whereas relatively small at the sub basin scale due to compensating effects detail analysis of hrus response of sub 6 has clearly shown that while some of the hrus contributed very high sediment yield and surface runoff large numbers of hrus contributed very minimal fig 14 this gives a better opportunity to identify the most sensitive area needing treatment however sub basins analysis is still essential to identify priority sub basin that needs urgent attention data used in this study are up to 2013 therefore more recent data can be used if actual field implementation is taken up the present study can be further extended to include estimating other pollutants that may affect the water quality with the increasing availability of satellite data of high spatiotemporal resolution using up to date weather data range more detailed study can be taken up to get an idea about delivery of other pollutants from the catchment to the stream system to address some emerging issues of environmental and ecological concerns 5 conclusions the swat musle model is applied successfully in the genale watershed ethiopia to determine sediment yield at the sub basins and hrus scale to identify critical erosion areas and prioritize sub basins hrus within the catchment the model application is carried out by sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr to reveal and prioritize the erosion prone area of the genale watershed the uncertainty analysis of streamflow and sediment was carried out for a three year warm up period from 1987 to 1989 16 years calibration period from 1990 to 2005 and 8 years validation period from 2006 to 2013 using swat cup sufi 2 program identifying spatial and temporal variation of critical erosion prone areas in the whole genale watershed was made to adopt management measures sub basin prioritization using sediment delivery ratio sdr and sediment yield methods at sub basins hrus scale among 25 sub basins both ways revealed that the sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 are very high erosion prone areas and need management measures the output from the genale watershed indicated that significant portions of the regions known to be highly agricultural steep slope poor soil physical properties are more critical to soil erosion and sediment yield it is also seen that some of the areas having steep slopes are also not experiencing high sediment yield because of having a good vegetative cover and a greater proportion of sediment deposition capacity therefore prioritizing catchment at sub basins and hrus can be a better proposal for integrated soil and water conservation measures economically identifying soil erosion prone areas is vital to encourage management practice and discouraging catchment mismanagement particularly at the hrus level out of 31 hrus dispersed in sub 6 only hru 158 159 160 161 168 169 170 and 171 were assessed as erosion prone areas in terms of sediment rate analysis indicated that exploring sediment yield till the hrus scale becomes easier to address the challenges with low human resources low cost and within a short time with a better understanding about the area and acting accordingly the critical area of sediment impacts wasmore visible ata smaller scale whereas relatively small at the sub basins scale due to compensating effects the model identified the hot spot area of erosion for possible watershed and sub basin scale planning and management information about spatiotemporal variability of sediment yield and sdr at the sub basins and hrus scale will help the judicious management of water resources through basin level planning yet addressing the water problem of the local community this study has demonstrated the swat muscle model s adequacy and capability in assessing critical areas needing sediment management in the genale watershed ethiopia which may inspire other researchers to implement in other watershedsfacilitating even local bodies to take management measures locally declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

nse 0 81 0 78 for flow calibration and validation respectively whereas r2 0 84 0 82 and nse 0 79 0 75 for sediment calibration and validation respectively significant spatiotemporal variability of sediment yield was observed in the watershed as the characteristics of the terrain land use soil type in each sub basin varies among the total 25 sub basins three sub basins produced a very high sediment rate 21 31 ton ha year one produced high 16 20 ton ha year one is moderate 11 15 ton ha year three were low 6 10 ton ha year and the rest 16 sub basins were under very low categories in the case of sdr three sub basins have very high sdr 0 452 two sub basins resulted in high sdr 0 326 0 451 which are located at the upland basin based on the model results sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 were identified as sediment prone areas further investigation at the hrus scale is taken to understand critical erosion areas and minimize the cost of management practice time human resources hru analysis has revealed the immense scope of minimizing cost by concentrating management measures only in the critical hrus for example sub basin 6 has 31 hrus of which only seven are assessed to have the high rates of sediment yield and thus prioritized as hru 159 hru 160 hru 161 hru 168 hru 170 and hru 171 which are located on agricultural and arable lands of steep slopes keywords swat sediment yield sdr

watershed s land use cover soil type and slope classes gizaw and kebede 2019 effects of soil erosion in the upper catchments can be of many folds in the form of onsite and offsite negative consequences while the onsite effect includes a reduction in cultivable soil depth soil fertility crop productivity and nutrient offsite negative impacts include reduced reservoir storage capacity increased flood risk and water quality degradation because of excess release of sediment and other pollutant loads moss 2008 in addition to these direct impacts all these factors combined effect can finally lead to potentially widespread food insecurity ayele gebremariam 2020 namomsa and adugna 2019 runoff water flowing over an erosion prone agriculture dominated watershed degrades the land

biota sources of pollution for aquatic systems are primarily classified into point and non point sources nps point sources are contaminants generated from single identifiable sources of pollution such as discharge from waste water treatment plants and therefore relatively easy to handle however non point sources refer to pollutants that do not have a specific point of source and include sediment

the source i e in the upper catchment itself using suitable soil conservation practices is ideal for eliminating all sediment related problems stated above however many a time it becomes challenging to take management measures in the entire watershed sub basin because of financial constraints particularly for a developing country identifying critical soil loss areas in a river basin watershed is fundamental to better soil loss control through land use prioritization and soil conservation mahoney et al 2018 a hydrological model providing sediment assessment can help identify such critical sediment contributing areas to prioritized management measures soil and water assessment tool swat one of the widely used physically based semi distributed hydrological model has a physical representation for spatiotemporal variability and are adequate for simulating the impacts of climate change anthropogenic activities on hydrological cycle environment swat can be used in a nearly continuous time domain to assess streamflow generation sediment yield water quality and quantity and thus facilitates studying the response of management practices at the sub basin hru level liu et al 2019 samimi et al 2020 xu et al 2009 change in socio economic conditions and increased anthropogenic activities have increased stress on the water resources watershed management challenges in ethiopia particularly in the genale catchment negewo and sarma 2021b in ethiopia the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation surface runoff varies all over the country causing significant spatial variation in soil erosion sediment yield such variability is more prominent in southern ethiopia in the genale river basin thus it can provide a better opportunity for taking soil and water conservation measures in sub catchment hrus scale to yield effective solutions with optimal funds and human resources to support local communities lives to prioritize critical sediment contributing areas one needs to assess soil erosion characteristics of a watershed from different angles gross erosion means the sum of all particles leaving the various erodible surface in the watershed the gross soil erosion in each hrus cell was calculated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle in swat daggupati et al 2011 the required model parameters for the musle can be calculated using the digital elevation model soil type and land use cover information on a cell basis jain and das 2010 however all the eroded sediment particles within the catchment are not transported to the watershed outlet as they are trapped and deposited in the upstream reaches the eroded sediment particles transported to the watershed outlet constitute the sediment yield sediment yieldcan also bedefinedas the amount ofsediment that leaves a boundary reaching or passing a point of interest in a given period expressed in mass per unit area bhattarai and dutta 2007 sediment delivery ratio sdr is defined as the ratio of sediment yield at the watershed outlet to the concerned watershed area s gross erosion the sdr has multi fold environmental significance in estimating the soil and water losses and the efficacy of control measures in watersheds wang et al 2018 the variations in ranges of sdr between sub basins are likely due to different physiographic characteristics such as land use soil type climate drainage area channel density slope gradient rainfall runofffactors and sediment transport processes both overland flow and channel and nearness to the mainstream in the catchment sub basins large sdr also indicates high erosion rates watersheds with large drainage areas will generally have a lower sdr than small watersheds as large areas within a watershed will have more chances to trap soil particles so the possibility of soil particles reaching the water channel system is low wu et al 2018 sdr represents the efficiency of the watershed in transporting soil particles sediment from areas of erosion to the point wheresedimentyield is measured therefore identifying sub basins with a high value of sdr will help minimize sediment yield at the watershed outlet woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 walling 1983 bartholic 2004 the sedimentation problem is also becoming a subject of discussion among researchers due to its negative effect on the available water capacity design and operation of hydropower reservoirs worldwide ebtehaj et al 2020 water shortage for different purposes backwater flooding and approximately one percent of reservoir storage capacity are being lost every year because sedimentation is becoming a major concern in most developing countries briak et al 2016 zarris et al 2011 the cost of reviving this lost capacity requires a massive amount of restoration work and it is better to construct new reservoirs instead therefore watershed modeling and management play a vital role in the early management planning and local resources development by identifying critical erosion zone adeogun et al 2018 liu et al 2019 markhi et al 2019 to reduce the peak rate of surface runoff causing soil erosion and sedimentation comprehensive understanding and estimation of hydrological processes land management soil types slope class and climatic conditions of different parts of the watersheds are fundamental in recent years the swat model is gaining popularity in hydrology and water resources research and has been adopted widely because of its robust algorithms for simulation of the hydrological system estimating sediment yield sdr and calculating nps pollutant transport in addition the scope of incorporating a comprehensive database on agricultural management practices is another advantage of the swat model negewo and sarma in

their quality quantity were analyzed to detect any data inconsistency or missing data and required adjustments were made to minimize the data uncertainty in the model output double mass curve dmc analyzes and investigates records in meteorological data particularly for precipitations at different stations in the catchment the dmc is used to determine whether the correction is required for data

individual stations against the cumulative of all other stations during the same period the plot shows as a straight line so long as the data are proportional the slope of the line will represent the constant of proportionality between the quantities following the visual observation we have evaluated the consistency of the data by slope calculation and finding the adjustment correction factor at the deviation point between cumulative plot linear trend line analysis and have distributed the adjustment factor by multiplying the data that need to be adjusted then the data adjusted using standard procedure are consistent with high values of correlation coefficient r2 as indicated in the plot fig 3 2 3 1 developing sediment rating curve src evaluation of sediment yield from watersheds depends on the length of the data series and the reliability of observed records of suspended sediment concentrations however some missing estimates are often derived from empirical relations between river discharges and corresponding sediment concentrations loads ulke et al 2009 mohammadi et al 2021 src is commonly used to produce a continuous time series of suspended sediment in the river based on available historical flow and sediment data src thus helps to predict a variable that is difficult to measure continuously from another variable easier to determine in the present study historical daily sediment concentration data are available from october 20 1987 to october 1 2005 however streamflow data are available from 1990 to 2013 i e with an overlapping period of 16 years with the sediment during the non rainy days particularly during non monsoon period sediment concentration remains almost negligible and generally is not collected by the department also to assess soil erosion due to water data of rainy days are important as we have carried out the model study on a monthly scale available daily sediment data for 16 years were converted to monthly data and used for developing sediment rating curves this derived equation of src eq 6 was used to continuously generate suspended sediment data for the period for which streamflow data are available and facilitate the

2 2 5 sediment delivery ratio sdr in this work sdr for the sub basin is described as the ratio of sediment yield at the watershed outlet to the gross erosion total sediment load generated from an individual sub basin it is a non dimensional scalar and conventionally expressed as walling 1983 11 s d r syld e where syld is the average annual sediment yield sediment load at the end of slope length at the endpoint of watershed outlet per unit area and e is the yearly gross erosion from stream reach over that same area sdr is estimated using swat with the musle equation and compared with empirical equations walling 1983 boyce 1975 woznicki et al 2013 usda scs 1979 zarris et al 2011 vanoni 1975 12 sdr 0 5656 a 0 11 13 sdr 0 51 a 0 11 14 sdr 0 42 a 0 125 where a is the drainage area in square kilometers for equation 12 and square miles for equation 13 and 14 the expected values of sdr are from 0 floodplains to 1 in uplands of the basin because of possible deposition of eroded soil during transport and before reaching the watershed outlet walling 1983 park et al 2010 however sdr can also be more extensive than unity in watersheds of very small areas with extremely erosive streams 2 6 identification of critical erosion prone sub basins watershed management practice cannot be implemented into the whole multiple sub basins because of resource constraints like finances human resources time and land availability in the study area identifying erosion prone areas will draw researchers attention to the most problematic reach and reduce the involved financial cost required for minimizing sediment yield and nps pollutant transport for the whole watershed so the watershed s critical reach should be identified to implement soil and water conservation management measures by estimating the average annual sediment yield from each sub basin from 1990 to 2013 the sub basins were arranged in decreasing the significance of average annual sediment yield and classified as per erosion class specified by uniyal et al 2020 table 1 3 results in the present study the streamflow and sediment load data used for calibration parameterization uncertainty analysis validation of the model ranges from 1990 to 2013 in which for suspended sediment the extended data were predicted using sediment rating curve the model was created with dem land use cover soil type and slope characteristics for the genale basin which formed 25 sub basins 464 hrus with a drainage area of 54 942 km2 a hydrological model s capability to adequately simulate streamflow and sediment load typically accounts for the precise calibration validation of parameters which are indispensable for the simulation process to minimize uncertainties 3 1 uncertainty analysis for streamflow and sediment sensitivity analysis helps determine the relative ranking of parameters depending on how it affects the output variance due to input variability this helps in reducing uncertainty and provides parameter estimation guidance for the calibration step of the model sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the global sensitivity produced by the sequential uncertainty fitting version

process used for the required objectives calibration of streamflow and sediment load was performed with several iterations of 500 simulations each was carried out for the monthly calibration period of 1990 2005 validation is required to verify whether the calibrated parameters also work for other data of different years within the watershed validation involves a model run with continuous flow and sediment parameters already adjusted during the calibration process validation period 2006 2013 results showed a satisfactory performance as statistical measures are in the allowable range for streamflow and sediment table 3 shows the acceptable ranges of statically performance criteria for the model abbaspour 2011 and moriasi et al 2007 stated about the good and satisfactory rating of p factor r factor no fixed numbers exist but they acknowledge that the results should capture most of the observations with small uncertainty within the range for p factor 0 1 and r factor close to zero but ranges from zero to infinity uncertainty measure of swat cup sufi 2 indicated that p factor of 0 51 and r factor of 0 78 for calibration and p factor of 0 50 and r factor of 0 86 for validation table 4 p factor r factor are the two indices calculated to evaluate the model uncertainty p factor is the percentage of observed data enveloped shaded by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu in sensitivity analysis represented by green color while r factor is the average width thickness of the 95ppu band envelopes of the observed data thus the p factor of 1 and r factor of zero indicate that the simulation exactly precisely corresponds to the observed data without sources of uncertainty which is impossible in the reality of hydrological modeling in this study p factor for calibration and validation is 0 51 0 50 respectively which means about 51 of calibration and 50 of validation of the observed flow were bracket by 95ppu band therefore the swat model is at an acceptable level of uncertainty for analyzing the genale river basin s flow fig 7 shows the calibration and validation of the swat model where the model computed values are in good agreement with the monthly observed streamflow as indicated the model s simulated and observed sediment load agreed and showed a satisfactory performance during the calibration and validation process fig 8 3 2 spatial and temporal variation of sediment delivery ratio sdr at watershed scale 3 2 1 spatial variation of sdr this section aims to resolve each sub basin sediment contribution to the watershed outlet using sdr and identify erosion prone areas within the catchment from table 5 the average sub basins sdr dispersed in the genale watershed in this case the identified area of high priority was covered with 12 347 6 km2 agricultural and brushland over a steep upland sub basin sdr disparity is mainly due to the differences in land use cover soil type sub basin size the slope of sub basins and stream channel characteristics understandably the value of sdr is higher near the watershed outlet because there is a probability of transporting all eroded sediment loads at the watershed outlet from fig 9 the spatial variability of sdr ranges from 0 001 sub 15 and sub 21 to 0 754 sub 7 sub 7 6 8 12 and 10 have high sdr values and high sediment yield within the catchment so they should be prioritized for implementing management practice sub basins with relatively high gross erosion but low sediment yield produce a small sdr value which means sdr directly relates to sediment yield at a sub watershed outlet fig 9 for instance sub basins 15 16 20 21 and 25 have very high gross erosion but produce very low sediment yield resulting in small sdr in the sub basins fig 9 because of maximum stream transport capacity is reached and a greater proportion of sediment yield deposition effect before reaching into the sub basins outlet that is why the generated sub basin sediment yield is very low compared to gross erosion additionally sediment yield is very low in large sub basins and the probability of sediment deposition in a large watershed is higher than in a small watershed under the same circumstances these sub basins are relatively large in drainage areas range shrubs and forest cover which might curbs arrest some amounts of sediment yield moreover from fig 11 c in the manuscript based on the spatial distribution the generated surface runoff from the same sub basins are still under the category of very low and low which also resulted in very low and low sediment yield from the respective sub basins and other physiographic characteristics that dictate erosion potential 3 2 2 temporal variation of sdr analyzing the temporal variability of sdr at the watershed scale is significant to understanding the sediment transport process therefore management practice in the catchment can be preferred accordingly from fig 10 the sdr values of the genale watershed at the outlet varied from 0 08 december to 0 86 may gross erosion from all sub basins and sediment yield at sub basins outlet is the most significant in may october april and september and similarly these months have high sdr values 3 2 3 comparing sdr values using swat musle versus area based empirical methods a comparison between the sdr value calculated by the swat model and empirical methods was also carried out although they produced similar results to the swat model the sdr values vary in the genale watershed the swat musle estimation for the genale watershed indicated that 19 of all sediment entering a stream reach would be transported to the watershed outlet table 6 from table 6 vanoni 1975 predicted a somewhat lower value of sdr for the genale watershed while the usda scs 1979 and the boyce 1975 method predicted comparable values with the swat musle model for the watershed the convenience of using the swat musle model to predict sdr is that it simulates channel transport processes and considers the physiographic characteristics and detailed spatial data over the entire watershed other empirical methods lump temporal and spatial sediment transport data without considering climatic variations land use cover slope class and soil type a physically based and spatially distributed model is more suited to calculate sdr for watershed planning and decision making therefore this study uses the swat musle model which considers spatial variability climatic data channel transport etc 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield at sub basins scale the variability of sediment yields spatially and temporally occurred in the watershed due to the dem land use cover soil type rainfall distribution slope classes and watershed management practice which formed uneven sediment yield distribution in each sub basin the results obtained from the swat model indicate that significant portions of highly gradient sub basins near the stream network urbanized highly cultivated brushland areas are more critical to the sediment yield rate for the existing conditions in the studied basin 3 3 1 spatial variability at sub basins scale swat model was simulated annually for 24 years of sediment data at a sub basins level the spatial variability of sediment yield for the entire genale watershed was estimated and the average annual sediment yield was found to vary significantly within the catchment as shown in fig 11 from fig 11 among the total 25 sub basins three sub basins produced sediment rate at very high 21 31 ton ha year one sub basin was high 16 20 ton ha year one sub basin produced moderate 11 15 ton ha year four were low 6 10 ton ha year and the rest 16 sub basins were under low categories sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 were identified as erosions prone areas the average sediment yield of five identified sediment hot spot sub basins was 21 8 ton ha year and covered 22 47 of the total watershed area critical sub basins are located in areas with a steep slope high surface runoff and high rainfall fig 11 as shown in the correlation coefficient matrix the spatial distribution of sediment yield is remarkably responsive to the precipitation surface runoff and mean slope of the respective sub basins table 7 from fig 12 sub basins with a steep slope have high sediment yield sub 6 8 12 10 and 7 while sub basins with mild slope produced low sediment yield except that sub 19 23 and 24 which produced slightly low moderate sediment yield in which their land use cover was dominated by range brushland and agricultural area although the slope values for the sub 19 23 and 24 are similar other physiographic factors like land use cover the shape of sub basins area of sub basins also influence the sub basins sediment yield at the sub basins level the slope was taken on an average basis and they were found to be in the same range in all the sub 19 23 and 24 however at the hrus scale there is a visibility of slope variation as we have seen particularly for hrus in sub 6 fig 15 additionally as seen from fig 11 based on the spatial distribution precipitation and runoff are high in sub 23 and 24 leading to high sediment yield all these combinations make the difference in sediment yield although the basin scale mean slope is within the same range in the sub 19 23 and 24 similarly for sub 2 3 4 5 11 13 14 and 16 25 though the mean slope value looks the same there is a slight difference in sediment yield from these sub basins here the effects of other physiographic characteristic factors land use cover shape of sub basin area of sub basins might be over dominating the effect of slope to cause variation in sediment yield from sub basins having the same slope moreover the slope was taken as average mean value and therefore for the sub basins mentioned above slope values are approaching each other on the other hand if we explore at the hrus scale their slope is also different as we have seen particularly for hrus in sub 6 fig 15 3 3 2 temporal variability at sub basins scale the temporal variation of sediment yield was evaluated over the entire genale basin using the monthly simulated swat model according to the results the average sediment yields obtained during may and october are almost double the sediment yields in other months fig 13 note pcp precipitation surqmm surface runoff the temporal variability of sediment yield distribution in the study area is divided into five sediment yield classes meager erosion time january february and december low erosion time march july and november moderate erosion time june august and september high soil erosion time april and very severe soil erosion time which was in may and october fig 13 it is observed that high sediment yield occurred in may october april september august and june whereas low sediment yield was observed in november december january february and march the average temporal variability of sediment yield is 0 667 ton ha the temporal variability of sediment yield is positively correlated with rainfall distribution streamflow and surface runoff fig 13 3 4 spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield at hrus level to understand in depth about critical erosion areas further investigation at the hrus scale is very important to avoid confusion when land use cover slope and soil type are in doubt besides it helps the stakeholders more when resources like finance human power time and land availability are limited furthermore this investigation allowed us to identify parts where severe soil losses and need prioritization note surqmm surface runoff in mm hrus hydrologic response units sub 6 sub basin number 6 in general the hrus with higher surface runoff is expected to generate significant sediment yield however for particular three 3 hrus hru 181 182 and 183 sediment yield is limited as the lulc over the areas is mixed forest and it dominated the results by curbing and arresting sediment yield at the early stage fig 14 at hrus scale among the 31 hrus scattered in sub 6 only eight 8 hrus such as hru 158 159 160 161 168 169 170 and 171 are assessed to be erosion prone areas in terms of sediment yield while others are insignificant regarding the comparison of sediment yield at sub basins and hrus level separately in the watershed four 4 hrus hru 158 hru 159 hru 160 and hru 161 are found in a highly agricultural area having a steep slope which contributes significant sediment yield fig 15 on the other hand sub 19 23 and 24 are at the sub basins scale which exhibits low and moderate sediment yield and still exhibits visible results compared to other sub basins with the same mean slope because of the presence of agriculture and range brushland in the area economically identifying erosion prone areas is vital to encourage management practice and discourage catchment mismanagement particularly at the hrus level fig 15 shows the influence of slope gradient land use cover on sediment yield the hrus with a steep slope agricultural and range brush land cover produced high sediment yield in the catchment particularly in sub 6 on the other hand three 3 hrus hru 181 182 and 183 from fig 14 which exhibits recognizable surface runoff did not contribute significant sediment yield fig 15 as the lulc effects forest mixed dominated over the influence of surface runoff and slope as seen in fig 15 hru 174 with a high gradient steep slope produced very low insignificant sediment yield due to non recorded surface runoff in that particular hydrologic response unit fig 14 analysis at hrus level in the subbasin 6 has revealed an interesting fact that the magnitude of sediment yield precipitation and surface runoff is relatively higher at the hru level than at the sub basin level figs 14 and 16 this is basically because of the averaging effect at the sub basin level from fig 16 a very high sediment yield was recorded in 1996 and 1997 66 3 and 58 5 ton ha respectively while the lowest sediment yield was obtained in 2005 and 2004 2 and 9 3 ton ha respectively the temporal variation of sediment yield at the hru level follows the precipitation and surface runoff graphs in the catchment i e the influence of precipitation and surface runoff is directly proportional to the sediment yield hru level fig 16 4 discussions even though the challenge of soil erosion is clearly exhibited by available estimate of gross erosion and field observations there is a need for quantitative information at the watershed sub basins and hrus level and identifying sediment contributing areas within the catchment is necessary to implement management measures at optimal cost and effort a hydrologic modeling based approach of identifying critically degraded areas within a watershed is presented in this paper and the proposed approach is implemented in the genale watershed of ethiopia to demonstrate its applicability widely used semi distributed physically based hydrological model swat integrated with arcgis is applied after calibration and validation using available streamflow and sediment transport data from 1990 2013 successful implementation of the model has helped identify the soil erosion critical regions at sub basins and hydrologic response units hrus scale to prioritize the needful watershed management based on the sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr in the genale basin ethiopia in addition to proposing this generalized modeling based approach our effort was also towards the regional importance as identification of soil erosion critical sub basins or at hrus scale providing vital information to help watershed management decision making for solving the community problem adopting early watershed management measures in the catchment is not yet reported in the study area the consistency of precipitation data can always be questioned in such a less explored basin therefore consistency of precipitation data was ensured by using a double mass curve dmc evaluating the adjustment correction factor at the deviation point between cumulative plot linear trend line analysis and distributing the adjustment factor by multiplying the data that need to be adjusted and then checking the correlation coefficient r2 owolabi et al 2021 gao et al 2017 historical daily data of sediment concentration was available from october 20 1987 to october 1 2005 but since streamflow data was available from 1990 to 2013 the suspended sediment record was systematically extended to make its length equal with the streamflow period to meet the requirement of calibration and validation process this is achieved by developing a sediment rating curve src mohammadi et al 2021 and predicting sediment concentration from 1987 to 2013 continuously on a monthly basis to perform the required calibration and validation for 27 years which is standard practice for the data scarce region as supported by different report research fig 4 the previous study by ulke et al 2009 used from 1971 to 1985 data range for streamflow sediment load calibration and validation the study by uniyal et al 2020 used from 1999 to 2003 the study by markhi et al 2019 used streamflow and sediment data from 1990 to 2015 the study by liu et al 2019 used from 2006 to 2013 for sediment validation setegn et al 2010 xu et al 2009 meshram et al 2020 also used the data range for sediment calibration validation from 1984 to 1993 1986 1991 1990 2015 respectively which convinced the validation of the present study on genale watershed as far as the data range is concerned compared to other empirical models the convenience of using the swat musle model include better prediction accuracy with less uncertainty considers watershed physiographic characteristics land use cover soil type topography climate drainage area and the ability for single storm estimates of sediment yield neitsch et al 2011 therefore a physically based and spatially distributed model that can simulate channel transport processes is more suited to calculating sdr for watershed planning and decision making sdr results were also compared with standard widely used empirical equations to ensure that the result obtained from swat musle are in order generally a sub basin having high gross erosion and located close to the watershed outlet in terms of stream distance is expected to produce high sdr value however as value of sdr depends both on sediment transport deposition characteristic of the stream as well as physiographic characteristic of the basin deviation from the expected trend was observed in different studies woznicki and nejadhashemi 2013 walling 1983 bartholic 2004 genale watershed is also not an exception as sdr value is found to be relatively less for some of the sub basins located close to the watershed outlet low value of sdr indicates better capability of the watershed in restricting movement of eroded soil and thus implies low watershed degradation high sdr value is of concern as it not only indicates degradation of sub basin but also poses a threat of flooding due to loss of flow carrying capacity of the downstream channel reach therefore sdr value of different sub basins of genale catchment is used for prioritizing sub basins needing attention hru analysis in a degraded sub basin helped in identifying critical erosion area for adopting watershed management practices on priority basis identifying the most erosion critical areas has a regional importance and will help the local government authority and other stakeholders involved in soil and water conservation activities within the genale catchment the magnitude and variation in sediment yield were significant at a smaller scale hru whereas relatively small at the sub basin scale due to compensating effects detail analysis of hrus response of sub 6 has clearly shown that while some of the hrus contributed very high sediment yield and surface runoff large numbers of hrus contributed very minimal fig 14 this gives a better opportunity to identify the most sensitive area needing treatment however sub basins analysis is still essential to identify priority sub basin that needs urgent attention data used in this study are up to 2013 therefore more recent data can be used if actual field implementation is taken up the present study can be further extended to include estimating other pollutants that may affect the water quality with the increasing availability of satellite data of high spatiotemporal resolution using up to date weather data range more detailed study can be taken up to get an idea about delivery of other pollutants from the catchment to the stream system to address some emerging issues of environmental and ecological concerns 5 conclusions the swat musle model is applied successfully in the genale watershed ethiopia to determine sediment yield at the sub basins and hrus scale to identify critical erosion areas and prioritize sub basins hrus within the catchment the model application is carried out by sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr to reveal and prioritize the erosion prone area of the genale watershed the uncertainty analysis of streamflow and sediment was carried out for a three year warm up period from 1987 to 1989 16 years calibration period from 1990 to 2005 and 8 years validation period from 2006 to 2013 using swat cup sufi 2 program identifying spatial and temporal variation of critical erosion prone areas in the whole genale watershed was made to adopt management measures sub basin prioritization using sediment delivery ratio sdr and sediment yield methods at sub basins hrus scale among 25 sub basins both ways revealed that the sub basins 6 8 12 10 and 7 are very high erosion prone areas and need management measures the output from the genale watershed indicated that significant portions of the regions known to be highly agricultural steep slope poor soil physical properties are more critical to soil erosion and sediment yield it is also seen that some of the areas having steep slopes are also not experiencing high sediment yield because of having a good vegetative cover and a greater proportion of sediment deposition capacity therefore prioritizing catchment at sub basins and hrus can be a better proposal for integrated soil and water conservation measures economically identifying soil erosion prone areas is vital to encourage management practice and discouraging catchment mismanagement particularly at the hrus level out of 31 hrus dispersed in sub 6 only hru 158 159 160 161 168 169 170 and 171 were assessed as erosion prone areas in terms of sediment rate analysis indicated that exploring sediment yield till the hrus scale becomes easier to address the challenges with low human resources low cost and within a short time with a better understanding about the area and acting accordingly the critical area of sediment impacts wasmore visible ata smaller scale whereas relatively small at the sub basins scale due to compensating effects the model identified the hot spot area of erosion for possible watershed and sub basin scale planning and management information about spatiotemporal variability of sediment yield and sdr at the sub basins and hrus scale will help the judicious management of water resources through basin level planning yet addressing the water problem of the local community this study has demonstrated the swat muscle model s adequacy and capability in assessing critical areas needing sediment management in the genale watershed ethiopia which may inspire other researchers to implement in other watershedsfacilitating even local bodies to take management measures locally declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3896,land surface processes significantly influence weather thereby affecting terrestrial water balance even though land surface models lsms offer a complementary means of examining fluxes their simulations are often subjected to uncertainties from model parameters model structure and forcing data of these precipitation forcing uncertainty is known to significantly contribute to lsm output this study examines the impact of different satellite based precipitation products on lsm simulated soil moisture over india based on a data period of 8 years 2008 to 2015 the precipitation products used are namely the global precipitation measurement mission gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals imerg late run sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci and sm2rain advanced scaterometer sm2rain ascat the first product is a multi satellite precipitation product top down approach with the remaining two products derived from surface satellite soil moisture bottom up approach the uncertainty in these three precipitation products are evaluated against simulations resulting from india meteorological department imd precipitation dataset the imerg precipitation indicates a bias mm of 1 3014 and rmse mm of 1 8024 during monsoon whereas for sm2rain ascat it shows a bias of 0 0206 and rmse of 0 9368 during monsoon and sm2rain cci which showed a bias of 0 3711 and rmse of 0 9345 during monsoon vic simulated soil moisture using imerg indicate a bias m3 m3 of 0 0356 and rmse m3 m3 of 0 0402 during monsoon this is in comparison to sm2rain ascat which showed a bias of 0 0211 and rmse of 0 0286 during monsoon and sm2rain cci which showed a bias of 0 0178 and rmse of 0 0327 during monsoon our study has evaluated precipitation products derived from two different algorithms i e

resolutions guo et al 2015 satellite based precipitation have been an indispensable source of forcing in all standalone land surface model lsms hong et al 2006 wu et al 2012 two approaches exist for precipitation estimation using satellite observations namely the conventional top down approach and relatively new bottom up approach in top down approach characteristics of precipitation sized particles hydrometeors are captured using satellite borne sensors operating in different ranges of electromagnetic spectrum such as visible vis infrared ir and microwave mw complementary to the top down approach a new novel bottom up approach is developed by brocca et al 2013 for estimating precipitation from in situ and satellite based soil moisture observations named sm2rain soil moisture to rain the sm2rain approach has provided two global scale datasets namely sm2rain ascat derived from ascat advanced scatterometer satellite soil moisture product brocca et al 2019 and sm2rain cci derived from esa cci european space agency climate change initiative based soil moisture product ciabatta et al 2017 the sm2rain withstands an independent approach for estimating precipitation from soil moisture hence known as bottom up approach the terrestrial energy and water cycles are strongly affected by the interplay of precipitation and soil moisture as the amount of water contained in the soil influences the exchange of heat between the land and atmosphere thereby affecting the hydrologic processes such as flood drought streamflow james and roulet 2009 liang et al 2010 brocca et al 2015 sehler et al 2019 with increase in precipitation there is sudden increase in soil moisture followed by smooth recession limb driven by drainage and evapotranspiration brocca et al 2014 both the top down and bottom up approaches have huge potential in estimating accurate precipitation literature presents numerous studies examining precipitation estimates from this conventional top down

however the mw sensors have limitation in capturing orographic precipitation events such as in western ghats of india retalis et al 2020 there is a serious need to evaluate the efficiency of precipitation products like sm2rain from bottom up approach quantitatively and to examine their propagation in hydrological modeling literature presents studies wherein sm2rain products are successfully applied to different soil moisture data to generate daily global precipitation estimates few studies have quantitatively evaluated these precipitation products paredes trejo et al 2018 assessed the performance of sm2rain cci precipitation against state of the art precipitation products chirps cmorph mswep results suggest that sm2rain cci performs poorly under extreme dry or extreme wet conditions ciabatta et al 2015 investigated the uncertainty of tmpa 3b42 rt and sm2rain ascat precipitation products over four different basins in italy they found the performance scores of sm2rain ascat products to be 30 less as compared to tmpa prakash 2019 assessed the performance of chirps mswep sm2rain cci and tmpa precipitation products across india it was observed that chirps and tmpa performs best followed by mswep whereas the sm2rain cci was found to largely underestimate precipitation chiaravalloti et al 2018 assessed the performance of gpm imerg sm2rain ascat and a combined product from gpm imerg sm2rain ascat rain gauge and meteorological radars they found that product performance depends on time resolution with the combined product outperforming each of the individual products few studies have also tried to examine the propagation of uncertainty of satellite based precipitation products in hydrologic modeling for example falck et al 2015 investigated the

study is to examine the impact of precipitation forcing uncertainty from three products namely global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg estimated using top down approach sm2rain ascat estimated using bottom up approach sm2rain cci estimated using bottom up approach on vic simulated soil moisture the study is carried out over india as shown in fig 1 the detailed methodology implemented is presented in fig 2 the study is subdivided into 2 parts with first part quantitatively evaluating the precipitation products against the imd reference data and second part evaluating the vic simulated soil moisture resulting from these three precipitation products 4 1 performance metrics quantitative performance evaluation is assessed through scores such as bias i e the mean difference between satellite and observed data the correlation coefficient r degree of linear correlation between satellite and observed data and root mean square error rmse further comparative evaluation of the precipitation products are conducted against the imd reference data using the 2 2 contingency table as shown in table 2 specific scores used are hit rate rain detected in both satellite and imd observation miss rate no rain detected by satellite precipitation while rain detected in imd reference observation and false alarm no rain detected in imd observation whereas

et al 1996 was setup over india at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution a total of 5027 grids and daily temporal scale for the years 2007 to 2015 for setting up the model all the forcing input parameters table 4 consisted of meteorological parameters precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed soil parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity three soil layer depth bulk density vegetation parameter fraction of area of each land use land cover of each grid and vegetation library file e g leaf area index albedo model simulations for the year 2007 were considered as the initialization period owing to the common period of data availability from all three precipitation products to analyse the study objectives vic simulated soil moisture resulting from imd precipitation is considered as reference this in turn is used for evaluating the simulated soil moisture from vic when using precipitation forcing from imerg sm2rain cci and sm2rain ascat respectively it is to be noted that for all the simulations all the parameters are kept constant except the precipitation forcing 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparative evaluation of precipitation products to address first objective of this study the three precipitation products are validated with respect to imd reference precipitation fig 3 depicts the bias annual mean of precipitation products with the imd reference precipitation for the years 2008 2015 completely imerg precipitation shows a dry bias over majority of india except in parts of north northeast western and southern peninsula fig 3a while sm2rain ascat has a wet bias fig 3b over the majority of states as opposed to imerg based precipitation products similarly sm2rain cci fig 3c has a wet bias but over the parts of western ghats it shows a high dry bias the higher bias observed in western ghats is mainly attributed to the limitation in sm2rain cci to capture orographic precipitation events retalis et al 2020 which is the major precipitation type over the western ghat region fig 4 represents the rmse annual mean of precipitation products compared to the imd reference precipitation for the years 2008 2015 precipitation from sm2rain ascat fig 4a indicates lowest overall rmse among the three products followed by sm2rain cci fig 4b and then imerg fig 4a this is mainly due to the low sensitivity of gpm mission to capture low intensity precipitation events particularly during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons retalis et al 2020 which has resulted in higher rmse compared to sm2rain products concurrently the sm2rain algorithm detects a small rise of soil moisture due to low precipitation brocca et al 2016 rendering sm2rain a superior commodity with a lower average rmse the summary of statistical performance scores for different precipitation products are provided in table 5 fig 5 shows the correlation coefficient annual mean of precipitation products with the imd reference precipitation for a duration of 8 years from 2008 to 2015 the sm2rain ascat fig 5b reflects highest correlation coefficient among the three products followed by sm2rain cci fig 5c and imerg precipitation in the northern region of india both the imerg fig 5a and sm2rain ascat precipitation shows a low correlation coefficient this is because in northern regions of india particularly jammu and kashmir including himalayan ranges majority of precipitation is in the form of snow which are not captured in rain gauge measurements pai et al 2014 from imd it is to be noted that sm2rain algorithm estimates only liquid precipitation and does not estimate precipitation over the snow covered frozen regions ciabatta et al 2017 fig 6 represents the spatial plot of various performance metrics for imerg sm2rain ascat and sm2rain cci with reference to imd precipitation the plots depict results for the monsoon period i e june july august and september during the study period fig 6 a d g shows imerg as having relatively high positive bias compared to other products sm2rain cci fig 6g has the most bias in the western ghats area which is consistent with our previous findings in fig 4 one reason for this is that satellite based soil moisture estimates over the western ghats area perform poorly due to high vegetation and complex topography mialon et al 2008 leading to low performance of sm2rain results fig 6 b e h show the pod and fig 6 c f i show the vhi wherein the best performance is shown by sm2rain ascat all three products perform poor in terms of pod and vhi over the south east coast of india fig 7 a d g shows the spatial distribution of far and fig 7 b e h depicts the vfar during monsoon season from 2008 to 2015 fig 7 shows superior performance by imerg precipitation product with lowest far and vfar fig 7 c f i of shows the spatial distribution of categorical miss wherein the imerg was observed to perform poorly especially over the northern part of india as well as the northern southern region with high miss index due to the large uncertainties of the imd product in these areas we cannot assess the quality of satellite rainfall owing to the reduced accuracy of the imd product used as reference fig 8 a d g shows the vmi distribution over the study area with respect to the reference imd precipitation similar to categorical miss index the sm2rain ascat precipitation is observed to perform good as compared to other products with low vmi plots b e h and c f i of fig 8 show the spatial distribution of csi and vcsi over the study region for the three selected precipitation products respectively all three precipitation products perform consistently in terms of csi and vcsi 5 2 evaluation of simulated soil moisture from vic lsm the vic simulated soil moisture outputs have been analysed for eight years i e 2008 2015 over the study region using three meteorological datasets as mentioned in section 4 2 the simulated soil moisture from imd reference precipitation was considered as reference all the analyses have been conducted seasonally i e monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon fig 9 represents the bias of simulated soil moisture generated from three precipitation products in the case of all the three seasonal analyses imerg was found to consistently overestimate soil moisture this is in accordance with positive bias in imerg based precipitation during monsoon as shown in fig 6a the northern region seems to indicate a high amount of positive bias for the three products in all the seasons one of the major factors for positive bias in sm2rain in northern region could be attributed to the impact of irrigation the northern regions are irrigated during post monsoon and are captured by soil moisture products nair and indu 2019 when such soil moisture products are used in sm2rain it generates erroneous precipitation events for irrigated water leading to positive bias jalilvand et al 2019 fig 10 represents rmse of simulated soil moisture for the three precipitation products for different seasons the imerg precipitation was found to have lowest rmse during post monsoon season in the western ghats and northern area especially during the monsoon season sm2rain cci simulated soil moisture shows a high amount of rmse fig 9f which is consistent with the variability of precipitation products as discussed in previous tests the summary of statistical performance scores for different vic simulated soil moisture is provided in table 6 fig 11 represents the correlation coefficient of simulated soil moisture for the three precipitation products all the products indicated a low correlation coefficient during the pre monsoon season with an overall better correlation coefficient from imerg fig 11a during monsoon fig 11 d e f all the products failed to capture variation in soil moisture over the south eastern coast of india with respect to reference during post monsoon also imerg based precipitation has performed better as compared to other products with better correlation coefficient fig 11g further a comparative analysis was performed between bias in soil moisture to bias in precipitation fig 12 in fig 12 it can be observed that for all simulations the uncertainty in precipitation is strongly propagated into model simulations all products indicate a strong positive bias in precipitation over south eastern coast of india which in turn results in wet bias in simulated soil moisture in majority of regions precipitation products underestimate precipitation resulting a dry bias in simulated soil moisture 6 summary and conclusion the present study evaluates three different precipitation products namely global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg late run top down approach sm2rain ascat bottom up approach sm2rain cci bottom up approach the study was conducted in two sub parts firstly the precipitation products are evaluated against the reference gridded imd dataset over india for a time period from year 2008 to 2015 among the three precipitation products overall imerg was found to have the least bias except in the western ghats which is attributed due to the limitations in imerg precipitation to capture the orographic precipitation and sm2rain ascat have the highest bias on validating the three precipitation products with imd reference precipitation in terms of rmse it was observed that sm2rain ascat has the lowest rmse and imerg precipitation the highest the difference in the principle of generating products plays a major role such as gpm mission has limitations in capturing low precipitation events while sm2rain products captures the slight increase in soil moisture which is caused due to low precipitation the second part of the study examined the simulated soil moisture from vic lsm against the reference imd simulated soil moisture the uncertainty in the precipitation products is also evaluated with the uncertainty in simulated soil moisture to quantify the error due to propagation in lsm here all the analysis is performed in three seasons monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon imerg simulated soil moisture was found to have the least amount of bias in all the seasons except monsoon season the sm2rain simulated soil moisture indicating a high amount of positive bias in the northern region is due to the impact of irrigation thereby generating erroneous positive bias precipitation events as reported in previous studies in the western ghats sm2rain cci was observed to perform poor in soil moisture simulation especially in the monsoon season it was also observed that bias in precipitation is sensitive to bias in soil moisture precipitation is one of the key roles in estimation accurate soil moisture estimates overall results show that the imerg precipitation depicts a good performance skill as meteorological forcing for hydrological models over hilly terrains of western ghats the sm2rain precipitation product seems to be performing good during pre monsoon seasons of india the results of our study will be helpful for the end users scientists hydrologists researchers across the world to choose the most appropriate precipitation

3896,land surface processes significantly influence weather thereby affecting terrestrial water balance even though land surface models lsms offer a complementary means of examining fluxes their simulations are often subjected to uncertainties from model parameters model structure and forcing data of these precipitation forcing uncertainty is known to significantly contribute to lsm output this study examines the impact of different satellite based precipitation products on lsm simulated soil moisture over india based on a data period of 8 years 2008 to 2015 the precipitation products used are namely the global precipitation measurement mission gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals imerg late run sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci and sm2rain advanced scaterometer sm2rain ascat the first product is a multi satellite precipitation product top down approach with the remaining two products derived from surface satellite soil moisture bottom up approach the uncertainty in these three precipitation products are evaluated against simulations resulting from india meteorological department imd precipitation dataset the imerg precipitation indicates a bias mm of 1 3014 and rmse mm of 1 8024 during monsoon whereas for sm2rain ascat it shows a bias of 0 0206 and rmse of 0 9368 during monsoon and sm2rain cci which showed a bias of 0 3711 and rmse of 0 9345 during monsoon vic simulated soil moisture using imerg indicate a bias m3 m3 of 0 0356 and rmse m3 m3 of 0 0402 during monsoon this is in comparison to sm2rain ascat which showed a bias of 0 0211 and rmse of 0 0286 during monsoon and sm2rain cci which showed a bias of 0 0178 and rmse of 0 0327 during monsoon our study has evaluated precipitation products derived from two different algorithms i e top down and bottom up approach it will provide insights on which algorithm is performing better in a country like india on different topographic condition keywords uncertainty sm2rain cci sm2rain ascat gpm imerg vic model 1 introduction precipitation is one of the major factors influencing earths hydrological behavior roth lemann 2016 pang et al 2020 nair and indu 2017 with its uncertainty significantly impacting hydrological modeling pradhan et al 2021 advances in satellite remote sensing have made available numerous precipitation products globally at high spatial and temporal resolutions guo et al 2015 satellite based precipitation have been an indispensable source of forcing in all standalone land surface model lsms hong et al 2006 wu et al 2012 two approaches exist for precipitation estimation using satellite observations namely the conventional top down approach and relatively new bottom up approach in top down approach characteristics of precipitation sized particles hydrometeors are captured using satellite borne sensors operating in different ranges of electromagnetic spectrum such as visible vis infrared ir and microwave mw complementary to the top down approach a new novel bottom up approach is developed by brocca et al 2013 for estimating precipitation from in situ and satellite based soil moisture observations named sm2rain soil moisture to rain the sm2rain approach has provided two global scale datasets namely sm2rain ascat derived from ascat advanced scatterometer satellite soil moisture product brocca et al 2019 and sm2rain cci derived from esa cci european space agency climate change initiative based soil moisture product ciabatta et al 2017 the sm2rain withstands an independent approach for estimating precipitation from soil moisture hence known as bottom up approach the terrestrial energy and water cycles are strongly affected by the interplay of precipitation and soil moisture as the amount of water contained in the soil influences the exchange of heat between the land and atmosphere thereby affecting the hydrologic processes such as flood drought streamflow james and roulet 2009 liang et al 2010 brocca et al 2015 sehler et al 2019 with increase in precipitation there is sudden increase in soil moisture followed by smooth recession limb driven by drainage and evapotranspiration brocca et al 2014 both the top down and bottom up approaches have huge potential in estimating accurate precipitation literature presents numerous studies examining precipitation estimates from this conventional top down approach using data from the global precipitation measurement mission gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals imerg hou et al 2014 climate prediction center cpc morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 xie

stations chirps funk et al 2015 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2016 the gpm mission mainly relies on sensors working in mw frequencies to capture precipitation events however the mw sensors have limitation in capturing orographic precipitation events such as in western ghats of india retalis et al 2020 there is a serious need to evaluate the efficiency of precipitation products like sm2rain from bottom up approach quantitatively and to examine their propagation in hydrological modeling literature presents studies wherein sm2rain products are successfully applied to different soil moisture data to generate daily global precipitation estimates few studies have quantitatively evaluated these precipitation products paredes trejo et al 2018 assessed the performance of sm2rain cci precipitation against state of the art precipitation products chirps cmorph mswep results suggest that sm2rain cci performs poorly under extreme dry or extreme wet conditions ciabatta et al 2015 investigated the uncertainty of tmpa 3b42 rt and sm2rain ascat precipitation products over four different basins in italy they found the performance scores of sm2rain ascat products to be 30 less as compared to tmpa prakash 2019 assessed the performance of chirps mswep sm2rain cci and tmpa precipitation products across india it was observed that chirps and tmpa performs best followed by mswep whereas the sm2rain cci was found to largely underestimate precipitation chiaravalloti et al 2018 assessed the performance of gpm imerg sm2rain ascat and a combined product from gpm imerg sm2rain ascat rain gauge and meteorological radars they found that product performance depends on time resolution with the combined product outperforming each of the individual products few studies have also tried to examine the propagation of uncertainty of satellite based precipitation products in hydrologic modeling for example falck et al 2015 investigated the propagation of four satellite precipitation product uncertainties through a distributed hydrologic model they utilized a two dimensional stochastic satellite rainfall error model srem2d to correct errors in satellite precipitation shrestha et al 2020 examined the role of four satellite precipitation forcing trmm tmpa 3b42rt v7 gdas chirps mswep on the uncertainty of land surface simulated soil

propagate to streamflow thereby magnifying the bias and dampening the aggregated error camici et al 2018 explored the feasibility of forcing satellite precipitation products tmpa 3b42 rt cmorph persiann sm2rain cci and ground based precipitation through a lumped hydrologic model over 15 basins with different physical characteristics they observe better performances when using tmpa 3b42 rt

study is to examine the impact of precipitation forcing uncertainty from three products namely global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg estimated using top down approach sm2rain ascat estimated using bottom up approach sm2rain cci estimated using bottom up approach on vic simulated soil moisture the study is carried out over india as shown in fig 1 the detailed methodology implemented is presented in fig 2 the study is subdivided into 2 parts with first part quantitatively evaluating the precipitation products against the imd reference data and second part evaluating the vic simulated soil moisture resulting from these three precipitation products 4 1 performance metrics quantitative performance evaluation is assessed through scores such as bias i e the mean difference between satellite and observed data the correlation coefficient r degree of linear correlation between satellite and observed data and root mean square error rmse further comparative evaluation of the precipitation products are conducted against the imd reference data using the 2 2 contingency table as shown in table 2 specific scores used are hit rate rain detected in both satellite and imd observation miss rate no rain detected by satellite precipitation while rain detected in imd reference observation and false alarm no rain detected in imd observation whereas

the observed imd precipitation s k is the satellite derived precipitation product and s a n d o are mean values of satellite and observed precipitation in addition to assess the volumetric precipitation detected by the three products volumetric skill scores by aghakouchak and mehran 2013 were also utilized the different volumetric skill scores are volumetric hit index vhi volumetric false alarm ratio vfar volumetric miss index vmi and volumetric critical success index vcsi the range of all the skill scores varies in the range of 0 to 1 for pod csi vhi and vcsi 1 represent perfect score whereas for far vfar and vmi 0 represents perfect score the detailed expressions of all the indices are presented in table 3 4 2 variable infiltration capacity model setup the vic 3l model liang et al 1996 was setup over india at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution a total of 5027 grids and daily temporal scale for the years 2007 to 2015 for setting up the model all the forcing input parameters table 4 consisted of meteorological parameters precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed soil parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity three soil layer depth bulk density vegetation parameter fraction of area of each land use land cover of each grid and vegetation library file e g leaf area index albedo model simulations for the year 2007 were considered as the initialization period owing to the common period of data availability from all three precipitation products to analyse the study objectives vic simulated soil moisture resulting from imd precipitation is considered as reference this in turn is used for evaluating the simulated soil moisture from vic when using precipitation forcing from imerg sm2rain cci and sm2rain ascat respectively it is to be noted that for all the simulations all the parameters are kept constant except the precipitation forcing 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparative evaluation of precipitation products to address first objective of this study the three precipitation products are validated with respect to imd reference precipitation fig 3 depicts the bias annual mean of precipitation products with the imd reference precipitation for the years 2008 2015 completely imerg precipitation shows a dry bias over majority of india except in parts of north northeast western and southern peninsula fig 3a while sm2rain ascat has a wet bias fig 3b over the majority of states as opposed to imerg based precipitation products similarly sm2rain cci fig 3c has a wet bias but over the parts of western ghats it shows a high dry bias the higher bias observed in western ghats is mainly attributed to the limitation in sm2rain cci to capture orographic precipitation events retalis et al 2020 which is the major precipitation type over the western ghat region fig 4 represents the rmse annual mean of precipitation products compared to the imd reference precipitation for the years 2008 2015 precipitation from sm2rain ascat fig 4a indicates lowest overall rmse among the three products followed by sm2rain cci fig 4b and then imerg fig 4a this is mainly due to the low sensitivity of gpm mission to capture low intensity precipitation events particularly during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons retalis et al 2020 which has resulted in higher rmse compared to sm2rain products concurrently the sm2rain algorithm detects a small rise of soil moisture due to low precipitation brocca et al 2016 rendering sm2rain a superior commodity with a lower average rmse the summary of statistical performance scores for different precipitation products are provided in table 5 fig 5 shows the correlation coefficient annual mean of precipitation products with the imd reference precipitation for a duration of 8 years from 2008 to 2015 the sm2rain ascat fig 5b reflects highest correlation coefficient among the three products followed by sm2rain cci fig 5c and imerg precipitation in the northern region of india both the imerg fig 5a and sm2rain ascat precipitation shows a low correlation coefficient this is because in northern regions of india particularly jammu and kashmir including himalayan ranges majority of precipitation is in the form of snow which are not captured in rain gauge measurements pai et al 2014 from imd it is to be noted that sm2rain algorithm estimates only liquid precipitation and does not estimate precipitation over the snow covered frozen regions ciabatta et al 2017 fig 6 represents the spatial plot of various performance metrics for imerg sm2rain ascat and sm2rain cci with reference to imd precipitation the plots depict results for the monsoon period i e june july august and september during the study period fig 6 a d g shows imerg as having relatively high positive bias compared to other products sm2rain cci fig 6g has the most bias in the western ghats area which is consistent with our previous findings in fig 4 one reason for this is that satellite based soil moisture estimates over the western ghats area perform poorly due to high vegetation and complex topography mialon et al 2008 leading to low performance of sm2rain results fig 6 b e h show the pod and fig 6 c f i show the vhi wherein the best performance is shown by sm2rain ascat all three products perform poor in terms of pod and vhi over the south east coast of india fig 7 a d g shows the spatial distribution of far and fig 7 b e h depicts the vfar during monsoon season from 2008 to 2015 fig 7 shows superior performance by imerg precipitation product with lowest far and vfar fig 7 c f i of shows the spatial distribution of categorical miss wherein the imerg was observed to perform poorly especially over the northern part of india as well as the northern southern region with high miss index due to the large uncertainties of the imd product in these areas we cannot assess the quality of satellite rainfall owing to the reduced accuracy of the imd product used as reference fig 8 a d g shows the vmi distribution over the study area with respect to the reference imd precipitation similar to categorical miss index the sm2rain ascat precipitation is observed to perform good as compared to other products with low vmi plots b e h and c f i of fig 8 show the spatial distribution of csi and vcsi over the study region for the three selected precipitation products respectively all three precipitation products perform consistently in terms of csi and vcsi 5 2 evaluation of simulated soil moisture from vic lsm the vic simulated soil moisture outputs have been analysed for eight years i e 2008 2015 over the study region using three meteorological datasets as mentioned in section 4 2 the simulated soil moisture from imd reference precipitation was considered as reference all the analyses have been conducted seasonally i e monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon fig 9 represents the bias of simulated soil moisture generated from three precipitation products in the case of all the three seasonal analyses imerg was found to consistently overestimate soil moisture this is in accordance with positive bias in imerg based precipitation during monsoon as shown in fig 6a the northern region seems to indicate a high amount of positive bias for the three products in all the seasons one of the major factors for positive bias in sm2rain in northern region could be attributed to the impact of irrigation the northern regions are irrigated during post monsoon and are captured by soil moisture products nair and indu 2019 when such soil moisture products are used in sm2rain it generates erroneous precipitation events for irrigated water leading to positive bias jalilvand et al 2019 fig 10 represents rmse of simulated soil moisture for the three precipitation products for different seasons the imerg precipitation was found to have lowest rmse during post monsoon season in the western ghats and northern area especially during the monsoon season sm2rain cci simulated soil moisture shows a high amount of rmse fig 9f which is consistent with the variability of precipitation products as discussed in previous tests the summary of statistical performance scores for different vic simulated soil moisture is provided in table 6 fig 11 represents the correlation coefficient of simulated soil moisture for the three precipitation products all the products indicated a low correlation coefficient during the pre monsoon season with an overall better correlation coefficient from imerg fig 11a during monsoon fig 11 d e f all the products failed to capture variation in soil moisture over the south eastern coast of india with respect to reference during post monsoon also imerg based precipitation has performed better as compared to other products with better correlation coefficient fig 11g further a comparative analysis was performed between bias in soil moisture to bias in precipitation fig 12 in fig 12 it can be observed that for all simulations the uncertainty in precipitation is strongly propagated into model simulations all products indicate a strong positive bias in precipitation over south eastern coast of india which in turn results in wet bias in simulated soil moisture in majority of regions precipitation products underestimate precipitation resulting a dry bias in simulated soil moisture 6 summary and conclusion the present study evaluates three different precipitation products namely global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg late run top down approach sm2rain ascat bottom up approach sm2rain cci bottom up approach the study was conducted in two sub parts firstly the precipitation products are evaluated against the reference gridded imd dataset over india for a time period from year 2008 to 2015 among the three precipitation products overall imerg was found to have the least bias except in the western ghats which is attributed due to the limitations in imerg precipitation to capture the orographic precipitation and sm2rain ascat have the highest bias on validating the three precipitation products with imd reference precipitation in terms of rmse it was observed that sm2rain ascat has the lowest rmse and imerg precipitation the highest the difference in the principle of generating products plays a major role such as gpm mission has limitations in capturing low precipitation events while sm2rain products captures the slight increase in soil moisture which is caused due to low precipitation the second part of the study examined the simulated soil moisture from vic lsm against the reference imd simulated soil moisture the uncertainty in the precipitation products is also evaluated with the uncertainty in simulated soil moisture to quantify the error due to propagation in lsm here all the analysis is performed in three seasons monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon imerg simulated soil moisture was found to have the least amount of bias in all the seasons except monsoon season the sm2rain simulated soil moisture indicating a high amount of positive bias in the northern region is due to the impact of irrigation thereby generating erroneous positive bias precipitation events as reported in previous studies in the western ghats sm2rain cci was observed to perform poor in soil moisture simulation especially in the monsoon season it was also observed that bias in precipitation is sensitive to bias in soil moisture precipitation is one of the key roles in estimation accurate soil moisture estimates overall results show that the imerg precipitation depicts a good performance skill as meteorological forcing for hydrological models over hilly terrains of western ghats the sm2rain precipitation product seems to be performing good during pre monsoon seasons of india the results of our study will be helpful for the end users scientists hydrologists researchers across the world to choose the most appropriate precipitation

3897,terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa retrieved from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission can be used as a good indicator of flood potential but it is limited to regional analysis due to the coarse resolution 300 km this study proposed an optimal least square merging scheme to spatially downscale grace based twsa via integrating it with model based twsa estimates on to a finer resolution 0 125 with associated uncertainty estimates twsa products estimated from grace an advanced land surface model lsm and reanalysis data were used in the merging process error uncertainties in each input data sets and the merged twsa product were calculated based on the triple collocation approach the merged twsa was subsequently used to compute the flood potential index and results were compared against measured river discharge and historical flood records results showed that the merged twsa provides a better representation of the spatial variability of twsa at a sub regional scale relative to grace based twsa along with improved uncertainties merged twsa also showed improved capability in capturing flood events that occurred at sub regional to local scales relative to grace based twsa when compared to historical flood records keywords grace grace fo twsa triple colocation least square merging flood potential 1 introduction hydrological extremes in the form of floods are a global issue causing devastating damage to the ecosystem human lives and economics slater and villarini 2016 the frequency of extreme flood events has been increasing due to climate change and anthropogenic activities it is extremely important to characterize and quantify the timing duration and severity of flood for flood monitoring and warning but also challenging especially over data sparse regions without efficient ground based flood monitoring systems idowu and zhou 2019 traditional flood monitoring depends on in situ measurements of hydro meteorological variables e g precipitation and streamflow which are distributed unevenly labor expensive time consuming and constrained by weather conditions sun et al 2017 in recent years the remote sensing technique has been increasingly utilized for flood mapping and monitoring domeneghetti et al 2019 however this technique also has its limitations such as the lack of all weather capability for optical remote sensing e g landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and the limited spatial coverage within the specific time frame for active microwave remote sensing e g synthetic aperture radar sun et al 2017 the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission in 2002 and its successor grace follow on grace fo mission in 2018 have provided an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the variation of terrestrial water storage tws i e the sum of groundwater soil moisture snow ice surface water and biomass at the global scale tapley et al 2004 it is demonstrated that grace based tws anomaly twsa i e tws change after removing the long term mean is capable of indicating predisposition of regional flood approximately 5 to 11 months in advance reager et al 2014 reager and famiglietti 2009 also devised a flood potential index fpi to quantify flood risk at the global scale by using grace twsa and precipitation records the grace based flood index map was further compared with the dartmouth flood observatory map and results showed that grace based fpi predicted large scale flood affected areas successfully in most regions although missing some flooded areas in africa and asia reager and famiglietti 2009 afterward grace based fpi was evaluated over different regions across the globe such as the united states molodtsova et al 2016 china long et al 2014 sun et al 2017 huang et al 2021 india gupta and dhanya 2020 shah and mishra 2021 and africa idowu and zhou 2019 to examine flood features results showed that grace based fpi performed well in predicting large scale long duration floods however the application of grace for flood prediction has limitations because of the coarse resolution of grace based twsa in both space 300 km and time monthly a common practice to downscale grace twsa is to assimilate grace retrievals into land surface models lsms zaitchik et al 2008 first assimilated grace twsa into nasa catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 in the mississippi river basin using an ensemble based smoother results suggested that grace data assimilation da enhanced groundwater and river discharge estimates relative to the model only simulation zaitchik et al 2008 grace da was also implemented to improve estimates of tws components such as snowpack bahrami et al 2020 forman et al 2012 su et al 2010 soil moisture zhao and yang 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2020 and groundwater girotto et al 2017 nie et al 2019 getirana et al 2020 additionally grace da was conducted across australia schumacher et al 2018 europe li et al 2012 north america houborg et al 2012 and the entire globe li et al 2019 to analyze its efficacy for drought monitoring in the context of the flood reager et al 2015 assimilated grace twsa retrievals into clsm to evaluate the flood potential in the missouri river basin results revealed grace da as a valuable method to assess flood potential by identifying and quantifying hydrological extremes with higher resolution relative to grace based twsa despite the success achieved by grace da studies they usually directly adjust models prognostic state variables such as groundwater and soil moisture but model parameters and meteorological forcings are constant which disrupts the simulated water balance girotto et al 2021 additionally ensemble based da methods consider uncertainties only by a given a priori value zhong et al 2021 but uncertainties associated with model parameterization are not well investigated recently some studies started to investigate the downscaling of grace twsa using advanced statistical methods yin et al 2018 obtained grace based downscaled groundwater data at 2 km spatial resolution in the north china plain using a linear regression algorithm the downscaled groundwater captured sub grid heterogeneity of groundwater storage variation and showed good consistency with in situ measurements however this downscaling algorithm only works in regions where there is a strong relationship between groundwater storage and evapotranspiration yin et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 downscaled grace twsa to 5 km resolution by integrating twsa from grace and lsm using a self calibration variance component model additionally some studies investigated the use of machine learning techniques to downscale grace twsa into twsa or groundwater change with a finer spatial resolution sun 2013 miro and famiglietti 2018 chen et al 2019 seyoum et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 however due to the lack of accurate and comparable ground based twsa observations most studies focused on obtaining grace based downscaled groundwater change and evaluated results against in situ groundwater measurements zhong et al 2021 this study aimed to spatially downscale grace tws retrieval via integrating it with model based twsa and provide twsa estimates at a fine spatial resolution i e 0 125 0 125 with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty to achieve this goal a simple least square merging approach using error characteristics quantified from the triple collocation tc approach was used more specifically the objectives of the study are to

1 study area north america including the united states us and part of canada latitude from 25 n to 53 n and longitude from 67 w to 120 w fig 1 was selected as the study area the elevation map represented in fig 1 indicated that the western part of the study domain showed relatively higher elevations than the eastern study domain as the rocky mountain stretches out from western canada to the southwestern us according to the köppen climate classification the climate of the mid east coast falls into three categories humid subtropical climate warm continental climate and temperate continental climate in the western part the climate classifications are more heterogeneous including arid desert tropical subtropical and temperate climates according to the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa national climate report the annual average precipitation and temperature across the contiguous us are 760 5 mm and 11 1 c respectively both average precipitation and temperature showed an increasing trend due to global climate change in accordance the intensity and frequency of flooding have been increased across north america which leads to increased costs for recovering damages associated with floods davenport et al 2021 golnaraghi et al 2020 to evaluate regional flood potential based on the tc based twsa estimates the texas gulf watershed hydrologic unit code huc 12 obtained from https water usgs gov gis huc html is selected as the testbed fig 1b the area of the texas gulf region is approximately 471 000 km2 including 10 major river basins in texas e

terms of the climate the study domain falls into four different koppen climate categories including humid subtropical cfa warm summer mediterranean csb cold semi arid bsk and hot semi arid bsh these distinctive features highly influence the spatio temporal variation of precipitation and temperature kimmel et al 2016 lee et al 2017 this diversity of climate conditions manifests texas as one of the most flood prone states across the united states with the highest flood related fatalities sharif et al 2015 national centers for environmental information ncei reported more than 100 severe storms 30 tropical cyclones and 20 flood events which caused damage of more than a billion dollar in texas since 2000 narrowing down to the county and city level the counties nearby the four largest

noaa gov stormevents 3 methods 3 1 error analysis using triple collocation triple collocation tc is an approach first introduced by stoffelen 1998 to estimate near surface wind speed errors using three data sets with the advantages of not requiring a high quality truth tc has been widely used to estimate the errors in hydrological variables and fluxes such as soil moisture crow et al 2015 dorigo et al 2010 scipal et al 2008 su et al 2014 wu et al 2021 precipitation lyu et al 2020 and evapotranspiration khan et al 2018 however the tc approach is rarely used for twsa error estimates mainly due to the lack of ground based twsa data sets here the tc approach was used to quantify uncertainties in twsa products from 1 grace and grace fo satellites hereafter refer as grace 2 noah 2 8 lsm used in nldas2 and 3 merra 2 in order to conduct the tc analysis twsa from grace and merra 2 were re gridded onto a 0 125 0 125 grid based on nldas2 data the obtained errors of the three data sets from tc analysis will subsequently be used in the least square merging approach to provided downscaled merged twsa estimates as described in section 3 2 the error model for tc analysis equation 1 assumes a linear relationship between the true twsa and estimates of twsa yilmaz et al 2012 1 s i α i s t e i where s t is the true twsa s i i 1 2 3 denotes the three spatio temporally collocated twsa products i e grace nldas2 and merra 2 α i is the multiplicative coefficient of data set i with reference to the true state e i is the zero mean random error with variance σ i 2 as the relationship between the truth and different data sets varies rescaling is required by choosing a reference data set arbitrarily and the rescaled data sets can be written as 2 s i α s t e i where s i is the rescaled data set e i is the relative error of s i with variance σ i 2 by choosing data set s1 as reference data as an example the rescaled values s i can be expressed as follows s 1 s 1 s 2 β 2 s 2 s 2 s 1 3 s 3 β 3 s 3 s 3 s 1 where overbar represents averaging in time and β 2 and β 3 are the rescaling coefficients assuming the errors from different data sets are uncorrelated with each other and the representativeness errors i e error associated with support scale difference between data sets are zero β 2 and β 3 can be calculated as β 2 α 1 α 2 s 1 s 1 s 3 s 3 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 σ s 1 s 3 σ s 2 s 3 4 β 3 α 1 α 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 s 2 s 2 σ s 1 s 2 σ s 3 s 2 assuming the errors of the three data sets are independent from the truth the error variance of the rescaled data sets can be estimated as σ 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 3 σ 2 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 5 σ 3 2 s 3 s 1 s 3 s 2 note that the error variance estimates in equation 5 provide only relative accuracy of the three data sets which represents the noisiness of one data set relative to another data set in other words tc does not provide estimates of actual error variance but the scaled absolute error variance selecting different reference data sets the calculated error variances are different accordingly fortunately the representation of relative errors between the three data sets are independent from the arbitrary selection of the reference and the relative errors are the only required information in the optimal least square merging method yilmaz et al 2012 as discussed in section 3 2 in this study nldas2 based twsa was used as the reference data a more detailed discussion about the tc approach is available in gruber et al 2016 3 2 least square merging a simple objective based least square merging method introduced by yilmaz et al 2012 was used to merge grace based twsa with model based twsa estimates the least square method has been successfully used for merging satellite and model based soil moisture products with improved accuracy without user defined parameter assumptions yilmaz et al 2012 using three independent data sets of the same variable with error mean of zero the merged estimates sm can be written as 6 s m w x s x w y s y w z s z the fundamental idea of the least square method is to merge the three data sets in a way that minimizes the error variance of the merged estimates σ m 2 which is also defined as the cost function j 7 j σ m 2 w x 2 σ x 2 w y 2 σ y 2 w z 2 σ z 2 where w x w y and w z are the relative weights of data set s x s y and s z to achieve the least square solution for s m with an unbiased minimum error variance all three data sets should relate to the truth with the same coefficient setting j w i 0 i x y z the obtained expressions for w x w y and w z are w x σ y 2 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 w y σ x 2 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 8 w z σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 here s x s y and s z correspond to rescaled twsa data sets s 1 s 2 and s 3 in section 3 1 and σ x 2 σ y 2 and σ z 2 correspond to σ 1 2 σ 2 2 and σ 3 2 from equation 5 taking equation 5 into equation 8 the weight given to each twsa data set can be achieved and thus a least square merging solution for twsa at a finer spatial resolution relative to grace and merra 2 can be obtained by using equation 6 when the computed error variance σ i 2 i 1 2 3 is negative for any data set a weight of 1 3 is given to each data set i and an arithmetic average of the three rescaled data sets is calculated because the variance value cannot be negative 3 3 flood potential analysis the merged twsa product from section 3 2 was further used for flood potential analysis using the flood potential index fpi developed by reager and famiglietti 2009 firstly the storage deficit for each grid at given month t was calculated as 9 s def t s max s t 1 where s max represents the historical maximum storage anomaly and s t 1 represents the twsa of the previous month afterwards the storage deficit sdef was subtracted from monthly precipitation p mon to calculate the flood potential amount f 10 f t p mon t s def t the precipitation data used in this study is trmm and it is rescaled to the same grid of the downscaled twsa product i e 0 125 0 125 grid based on nldas2 a positive f value represents that rainfall exceeds the storage deficit of the current month and a negative f value may occur during the dry period when the water storage deficit is large but precipitation is low a joint influence of high precipitation and low storage deficit will lead to a high probability of flooding finally the fpi was calculated by normalizing flood potential amount f 11 f p i t f t m a x f t when the fpi value is close to 1 it indicates a higher chance of flood occurrence and the fpi value cannot be larger than 1 reager and famiglietti 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of twsa data sets tc approach is used to estimate errors in twsa derived from grace merra 2 and nldas2 as tc requires a mutual linear relationship among different data sets the cross correlations between data sets were first evaluated following yilmaz et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 a significant p 0 005 and strong positive cross correlation was found across most regions in north america fig 2 however grace showed a weak correlation with merra 2 and nldas2 in the gulf of california and florida regions the cross correlation between grace and nldas2 even became negative along the eastern coast of the gulf of california the discrepancies between grace and the other two data sets may be attributed to the coarse spatial resolution of grace twsa retrievals which cannot distinguish the signal between land and ocean with adequate accuracy bonin and chambers 2013 additionally merra 2 yielded a relatively poor correlation with either grace or nldas2 in eastern canada the poor correlation between grace and merra 2 was also found in reichle et al 2017 and it was explained by the poor quality of the gauge based precipitation product in the northern high latitudes that were used to correct precipitation in merra 2 merra 2 versus nldas2 generally provided the largest cross correlation with an average of 0 75 using nldas2 as the reference data the error standard deviation of twsa from grace merra 2 and nldas2 as well as the corresponding weight assigned to each data set in the merging process are shown in fig 3 nldas2 showed relatively lower uncertainty with a mean error standard deviation of 31 mm in the study domain the uncertainty in grace twsa is the largest with a mean error standard deviation of 48 mm and the value for merra 2 is 39 mm it is found that the spatial pattern of error standard deviation and weight are intuitively consistent with the cross correlation fig 2 among different data sets in the gulf of california and florida regions where grace showed a weaker correlation with the other two data sets the calculated error standard deviation of grace was larger and thus a small weight around 0 2 was assigned to grace data while in eastern canada where merra 2 showed discrepancies merra 2 had a larger error standard deviation thus larger weights were assigned to the other two data sets generally grace merra 2 and nldas2 were assigned a larger weight in high latitude areas eastern us and the southern us along the coast respectively a large portion of grids in the western and middle us do not have error variance estimates due to the large discrepancies among the three data sets which may be associated with human alterations that are not modeled in nldas2 and merra 2 such as groundwater pumping and irrigation leng et al 2014 reichle et al 2017 additionally the highly heterogeneous geographic characteristic in the western and middle us may degrade the performance of grace based twsa due to its coarse spatial resolution the relatively larger weights given to nldas2 along the south coastal areas may be related to its original finer spatial resolution that better distinguishes signals between land and ocean as discussed in section 3 1 the selection of reference data does not affect the relative error ranking of different data sets which means it will not influence the calculated weights for grace merra 2 and nldas2 however the selection of reference data introduces a strong dependence of the estimated error on the standard deviation of the reference data draper et al 2013 gruber et al 2016 therefore the spatial error patterns for different data sets cannot be compared as they all contain the spatial structure of the nldas2 climatology which limits the evaluation of actual data set quality although the selection of reference data does not influence the calculated weights assigned to each input data set the merging process that multiplying weights with rescaled data sets equations 3 and 6 makes the merged tc based twsa inevitably contains the climatology of reference data however such linear transformations i e rescale of data sets in equation 3 are not unusual in hydrological studies yilmaz et al 2012 such as cumulative distribution function matching and variance matching especially in the land data assimilation studies girotto et al 2016 4 2 evaluation of the merged twsa estimates after obtaining weights assigned to each data set the merged tc based twsa estimates were calculated using equation 6 watershed average twsa derived from grace merra 2 nldas2 and tc across 18 river basins in the us were evaluated fig 4 shows the watershed average twsa time series in 10 example watersheds additionally the seasonal cycle of twsa variation was removed from each twsa time series and the correlation coefficient r and unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd of watershed average deseasonalized twsa between tc and input data sets are shown in table 1 it is found that tc based twsa usually lied among the three data sets grace based twsa showed a decreasing trend in twsa in california huc 18 and lower colorado huc 15 watersheds since 2011 indicating the extended drought in western us hammond et al 2016 kuwayama et al 2019 however the trend was not obvious in twsa from merra 2 and nldas2 especially in the lower colorado watershed however due to the large discrepancies among input data sets a large portion of grids in this region do not provide a positive error variance estimate and thus a weight of 1 3 was assigned to each input data set fig 3 therefore tc based twsa yielded a more similar variation as nldas2 and merra 2 with a larger r and a smaller ubrmsd with nldas2 and merra 2 table 1 in the two watersheds grace generally provided a larger twsa relative to merra 2 and nldas2 in missouri watershed huc 10 across the study period while in upper mississippi huc 7 and great lakes huc 4 watersheds the larger values were mostly found during the end of grace mission and grace fo period when grace based twsa data had larger uncertainties fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 in these watersheds the inter annual variation of tc based twsa showed a better consistency with merra 2 relatively good agreements among the three input data sets were found in pacific northwest huc 17 and south atlantic gulf huc 3 where three input data sets all yielded good statistics with tc based twsa in terms of inter annual variation table 1 in texas gulf watershed all three input data sets showed similar inter annual variation of twsa but the tc based twsa showed the highest agreement with nldas2 in all examined 18 watersheds a better consistency between tc and grace based twsa was only witnessed in the new england watershed huc 1 which is coincident with the previous discussion that grace was assigned more weight in relatively high latitude region twsa derived from grace merra 2 nldas2 and tc in january 2003 centered on january 16 based on grace time span was selected as an example as shown in fig 5 all four twsa products showed similar spatial distribution of twsa with positive values in the southeastern and west coast of us as well as in the eastern canada negative twsa values were mostly witnessed in central us and northern mexico however discrepancies among these products were noticed grace generally represented a spatially smoothed distribution of twsa with smaller absolute twsa values due to its coarse resolution as well as the spatial smoothing process in retrieving grace twsa product merra 2 provided a larger amplitude of twsa variation that wet regions showed relatively larger twsa values and dry regions had more negative values additionally it is noticed that merra 2 and nldas2 showed opposite twsa behaviors to the northeastern of great lakes red circles in fig 5 where merra 2 indicated a wet condition while nldas2 indicated a dry condition tc based twsa estimates took the conflicts into consideration providing a slightly negative value but not as dry as indicated by nldas2 comparing the twsa estimates with reported flood from the dartmouth flood observatory dfo data accessible from https floodobservatory colorado edu it is found that the location of reported floods showed some consistency with tc based twsa estimates regions showing large twsa values generally suffered flooding during the same or next few months however the spatial pattern of flood occurrence and twsa did not completely agree with each other which is understandable as 1 dfo collects flood events from satellite observations and weather service reporting and thus not all flood events are recorded 2 positive twsa value does not necessarily always cause floods and it is also related to the precipitation and the water storage capacity of the watershed it is also noticed that in the northeast of great lakes region there was no flood event reported additionally no drought was recorded in this area in january 2003 based on the north american drought monitor therefore it is believed that tc based twsa estimates combined the information from individual input data sets and has the potential to remove the incorrect signals in each data set providing a more realistic estimate of twsa furthermore the uncertainty of tc based twsa was calculated as shown in fig 5f note that although the absolute error contains the spatial climatology of nldas2 the relative error ranking was not influenced tc based twsa estimates provided a much smaller error uncertainty relative to individual input data sets fig 3a c with a mean standard deviation of 16 mm overall tc based twsa product efficiently used information from different input data sets providing a more reliable estimates with reduced uncertainty 4 3 evaluation of flood potential using the tc based fpi in this section the applicability of merged twsa estimates in analyzing the flood potential at sub regional scale was evaluated using an example watershed the texas gulf river basin fig 2b tc based twsa estimates were utilized to calculate the fpi hereafter refer as tc based fpi and results were assessed against the ground based river discharge measurements as well as the historical flood records fig 6 represents the time series of river discharge measurements and collocated tc based fpi at two example grdc stations station 4150525 on lampasas river and station 4150500 on brazos river locations shown in fig 1 located in the brazos river basin in general tc based fpi showed good correspondence with regard to the temporal variation of river discharge comparing the two stations the positive fpi values occurred more frequently at station 4150500 the main reason is the difference in the magnitude of river discharge station 4150500 is located near the outlet of the brazos river basin while station 4150515 is located at lampasas river which is the secondary tributary of the brazos river thus a larger magnitude of river discharge was observed at the downstream station which increases the flood risk and in turn showed the higher frequency of fpi a comparison of fpi with the ncei historical flood record revealed that fpi based on the downscaled twsa product successfully captured flood events for example station 4150515 fig 6a showed that large fpi values were found during april 2004 and the summer of 2007 according to the historical flood event kempas and nearby cities underwent numerous flash floods during these specific periods because of the regional heavy rainfall e g april 2004 with the maximum daily precipitation reached up to 8 in and tornado e g occurred on 17 jun 2007 dong et al 2011 also address that texas and oklahoma were in extremely wet condition from may to july 2007 due to the abnormal atmospheric conditions at the leeward side of rocky mountain and negative anomaly of geopotential height which resulted in the development of thunderstorm and heavy rainfall fpi at station 4150500 fig 6b also matched well with the historical flood record the large fpi values during november 2004 to february 2005 correspond to the flash floods in the richmond region due to the heavy rain moreover the fpi during the late 2010 s matched well with the emergence of heavy rainfall e g heavy rainfall during may 27 28 2016 and storms e g tax day storm in 2016 tropical storm imelda in september 2019 especially tropical storm imelda caused extreme precipitation up to 43 in of the rainfall across the southeastern part of texas gebremichael et al 2020 however mismatch between tc based fpi and historical flood event records were also detected for example according to fig 6b tc based fpi showed flood potential at station 4150500 during the summer of 2004 2005 and august september of 2010 whereas flood events records were not found near the station area this mismatch maybe explained by the human activities associated with flood control and water management based on the ncei historical flood record heavy rainfall and tornado emerged near station 4150515 during the summer of 2004 and 2005 and central texas including bell williamson and travis counties during september 7 14 2010 these flood records led to the increase of river discharge at upstream and were expected to influence the river discharge at downstream e g station 4150500 however there was no recorded flood event at station 4150500 during those specific periods the main reason was due to the several reservoirs located at upper brazos river basin including lake belton lake georgetown and stillhouse hollow lake which were constructed for the efficient water supply and or flood control however fpi does not account for the human activities during the calculation and in turn led to the mismatch between the flood record and fpi another possible reason is related to the influence of soil moisture and or groundwater for example aquifers such as edwards and trinity have relatively deep and confined reservoirs yang and scanlon 2019 which leads to a relatively longer time for infiltration procedure reager et al 2014 in addition recharge of the groundwater further influences the baseflow which in general slowly releases the water thomas and famiglietti 2019 these phenomena might be captured in grace twsa while ground based measurement might have some delay which results in slight discrepancy between flood potential and runoff measurements fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of maximum fpi during 2015 fig 7a d and 2018 fig 7e h which are the two years that experienced a relatively high frequency of flood and or flash flood events the overall comparison indicated that for all four different twsas fpi showed relatively larger fpi across the northeastern and southwestern part of the study domain fig 7 historical flood records also revealed a similar pattern in that dallas forth worth metropolitan area underwent 191 flood events during 2015 and corpus christi metropolitan area suffered 64 and 55 flood events during 2015 and 2018 respectively however fpi from different twsas showed some discrepancies in that grace and merra 2 did not show any positive fpi value across the northwestern texas gulf watershed during 2015 and 2018 fig 7b and 7c while nldas 2 and tc based fpis represented positive fpi fig 7a and 7d more specifically historical flood records indicated that the counties included in the black square in fig 7a d e g tom green runnel and taylor counties had 15 flash flood events due to the large rainfalls during april may and july in 2015 while grace based fpi did not show any fpi value larger than zero during 2015 similar behavior was observed across the western part of the watershed including san angelo and midland counties eclipse shape on fig 7e h during 2018 that is historical flood records indicated 21 flash floods across this region during may to august and october due to the heavy rainfall and regional thunderstorms the maximum fpi from tc based twsa was around 0 7 in may while grace based fpi did not show any positive values in the case of merra 2 and nldas2 both fpi showed positive value with relatively larger fpi for nldas2 over the ellipse shape regions according to fig 3e and f merra 2 showed a relatively larger weight than nldas2 over the western texas gulf watershed while in the east nldas2 was assigned more weight therefore tc based fpi showed more similar characteristics with nldas2 fpi and merra 2 fpi in the eastern and western parts of the watershed respectively in 2018 it is evident that tc based fpi provided a more similar spatial pattern with historical flood records than each input data set with more flood events occurred in the eastern texas gulf region than in the west these results provide clear evidence that by considering the error characterization of each input tc based twsa provided more detailed twsa information and thus fpi captured the flood that occurred at a subregional scale another behavior was observed across the northern part of the dallas forth worth metropolitan area dashed box region in fig 7a d including denton wise and montague counties during 2015 at the specific region the maximum fpi from tc based twsa ranged from 0 34 to 0 73 while the maximum grace based fpi lied between 0 27 and 0 37 for the detailed analysis temporal variation of tc and grace based fpi during 2015 along with twsa estimates at bolivar denton county was presented in fig 8 according to the noaa ncei storm event database this region showed flash flood on 25 april 2015 influenced by the ef0 tornado that occurred at nearby counties 10 may 2015 and 20 may 2015 comparing these flood records with the fpi tc based fpi showed larger than zero values during apr and may 2015 while grace based fpi only showed positive value during may 2015 according to equations 9 11 the sign and magnitude of the fpi are highly dependent on the precipitation p of the current month and water storage deficit sdef of the previous month tc based twsa showed an increasing trend in twsa from april to july 2015 while grace based twsa did not show the same increasing trend in terms of magnitude tc based twsa showed relatively larger magnitude than the grace based twsa fig 7 with the same p and maximum water storage smax at the given month and location different behaviors in twsa resulted in the different s def as well as the calculated fpi derived from grace and tc based twsa as the tc based twsa estimates showed improvement in accuracy as well as the spatial resolution fpi calculated with the tc based twsa resulted in a better representation of the flood risk when compared against the historical flood record 5 conclusions grace based twsa has been regarded as a good indicator of flood potential but its application to sub regional flood analysis was hindered due to the coarse spatial resolution 300 km this study spatially downscaled grace twsa by integrating it with modeled twsa estimates based on an optimal least square merging method across north america moreover the capability of the merged twsa to improve flood potential analysis at sub regional to local scales across an example watershed the texas gulf watershed was evaluated to determine the weights assigned to each data set the tc approach was used to quantify error variances of input data sets i e grace merra 2 and nldas2 it is found that nldas2 provides relatively lower uncertainty with a mean error standard deviation of 31 mm in the study domain while the values for grace and merra 2 are 48 mm and 39 mm individually grace merra 2 and nldas2 were assigned more weights in the high latitude region eastern us and the southern us along coast area respectively it should be noted that tc requires the selection of reference data which results in that the calculated error estimates of input data sets are scaled absolute error estimates rather than actual error estimates however the selection of reference data does not affect the representation of relative errors in the input data sets i e weights are independent of the selection of reference data the merged twsa estimates i e tc based twsa were compared with grace merra2 and nldas2 twsa estimates results showed that tc based twsa estimates showed high consistency with nldas2 as tc based twsa contains the climatology of nldas2 but after removing the seasonal cycle from each twsa time series the similarity of inter annual variation of twsa between tc and input data sets varies depending on regions generally tc based twsa combined the information from different input data sets corrected potential wrong signals in input data sets and provided estimates with mitigated uncertainties moreover a comparison of tc based twsa with recorded flood events provided by dfo demonstrated that tc based twsa well represented the spatial distribution of water storage at the regional scale comparison of the fpi derived from tc based twsa estimates showed good correspondence with the in situ river discharge measurements as well as the ncei historical flood records however tc based fpi occasionally showed a mismatch with the historical flood records at the stations near the downstream region because of the time discrepancy between flood potential and ground based runoff as well as lack of human induced flood management plan in the model based twsa estimates comparison of the maximum fpi maps from tc and grace based fpi confirmed that tc based fpi showed a better consistency with historical flood records than grace based fpi specifically grace based fpi did not represent flood risk over the northwestern texas gulf watershed during 2015 and 2018 while tc based fpi detected the floods these results were mainly due to the advantages of tc based twsa estimates which consider the error characteristics of different input data sets to determine the weight for least squared merging and provides twsa estimates at finer spatial resolution despite the lack of ground based twsa measurements for validation the tc based twsa estimates took advantage of individual input data sets and showed good consistency with flood records additionally error uncertainty of the downscaled twsa product was provided which enables assessing product reliability although tc has been used in many hydrological studies to evaluate error estimates in different data sets its application to twsa products was not well explored furthermore the tc approach can be used to tune a twsa data assimilation system regardless of the presence of autocorrelated observation error providing unbiased error variance estimates for model and observations as part of a future follow on study temporal downscaling of twsa estimates i e from monthly to daily scale will be investigated to better capture floods that occurred at a sub monthly or sub daily scale further disaggregation of twsa estimates into its constituent components e g soil moisture groundwater and canopy water is meaningful to analyze the main trigger for the flood events across different regions credit

3897,terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa retrieved from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission can be used as a good indicator of flood potential but it is limited to regional analysis due to the coarse resolution 300 km this study proposed an optimal least square merging scheme to spatially downscale grace based twsa via integrating it with model based twsa estimates on to a finer resolution 0 125 with associated uncertainty estimates twsa products estimated from grace an advanced land surface model lsm and reanalysis data were used in the merging process error uncertainties in each input data sets and the merged twsa product were calculated based on the triple collocation approach the merged twsa was subsequently used to compute the flood potential index and results were compared against measured river discharge and historical flood records results showed that the merged twsa provides a better representation of the spatial variability of twsa at a sub regional scale relative to grace based twsa along with improved uncertainties merged twsa also showed improved capability in capturing flood events that occurred at sub regional to local scales relative to grace based twsa when compared to historical flood records keywords grace grace fo twsa triple colocation least square merging flood potential 1 introduction hydrological extremes in the form of floods are a global issue causing devastating damage to the ecosystem human lives and economics slater and villarini 2016 the frequency of extreme flood events has been increasing due to climate change and anthropogenic activities it is extremely important to characterize and quantify the timing duration and severity of flood for flood monitoring and warning but also challenging especially over data sparse regions without efficient ground based flood monitoring systems idowu and zhou 2019 traditional flood monitoring depends on in situ measurements of hydro meteorological variables e g precipitation and streamflow which are distributed unevenly labor expensive time consuming and constrained by weather conditions sun et al 2017 in recent years the remote sensing technique has been increasingly utilized for flood mapping and monitoring domeneghetti et al 2019 however this technique also has its limitations such as the lack of all weather capability for optical remote sensing e g landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and the limited spatial coverage within the specific time frame for active microwave remote sensing e g synthetic aperture radar sun et al 2017 the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission in 2002 and its successor grace follow on grace fo mission in 2018 have provided an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the variation of terrestrial water storage tws i e the sum of groundwater soil moisture snow ice surface water and biomass at the global scale tapley et al 2004 it is demonstrated that grace based tws anomaly twsa i e tws change after removing the long term mean is capable of indicating predisposition of regional flood approximately 5 to 11 months in advance reager et al 2014 reager and famiglietti 2009 also devised a flood potential index fpi to quantify flood risk at the global scale by using grace twsa and precipitation records the grace based flood index map was further compared with the dartmouth flood observatory map and results showed that grace based fpi predicted large scale flood affected areas successfully in most regions although missing some flooded areas in africa and asia reager and famiglietti 2009 afterward grace based fpi was evaluated over different regions across the globe such as the united states molodtsova et al 2016 china long et al 2014 sun et al 2017 huang et al 2021 india gupta and dhanya 2020 shah and mishra 2021 and africa idowu and zhou 2019 to examine flood features results showed that grace based fpi performed well in predicting large scale long duration floods however the application of grace for flood prediction has limitations because of the coarse resolution of grace based twsa in both space 300 km and time monthly a common practice to downscale grace twsa is to assimilate grace retrievals into land surface models lsms zaitchik et al 2008 first assimilated grace twsa into nasa catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 in the mississippi river basin using an ensemble based smoother results suggested that grace data assimilation da enhanced groundwater and river discharge estimates relative to the model only simulation zaitchik et al 2008 grace da was also implemented to improve estimates of tws components such as snowpack bahrami et al 2020 forman et al 2012 su et al 2010 soil moisture zhao and yang 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2020 and groundwater girotto et al 2017 nie et al 2019 getirana et al 2020 additionally grace da was conducted across australia schumacher et al 2018 europe li et al 2012 north america houborg et al 2012 and the entire globe li et al 2019 to analyze its efficacy for drought monitoring in the context of the flood reager et al 2015 assimilated grace twsa retrievals into clsm to evaluate the flood potential in the missouri river basin results revealed grace da as a valuable method to assess flood potential by identifying and quantifying hydrological extremes with higher resolution relative to grace based twsa despite the success achieved by grace da studies they usually directly adjust models prognostic state variables such as groundwater and soil moisture but model parameters and meteorological forcings are constant which disrupts the simulated water balance girotto et al 2021 additionally ensemble based da methods consider uncertainties only by a given a priori value zhong et al 2021 but uncertainties associated with model parameterization are not well investigated recently some studies started to investigate the downscaling of grace twsa using advanced statistical methods yin et al 2018 obtained grace based downscaled groundwater data at 2 km spatial resolution in the north china plain using a linear regression algorithm the downscaled groundwater captured sub grid heterogeneity of groundwater storage variation and showed good consistency with in situ measurements however this downscaling algorithm only works in regions where there is a strong relationship between groundwater storage and evapotranspiration yin et al 2018 zhong et al 2021 downscaled grace twsa to 5 km resolution by integrating twsa from grace and lsm using a self calibration variance component model additionally some studies investigated the use of machine learning techniques to downscale grace twsa into twsa or groundwater change with a finer spatial resolution sun 2013 miro and famiglietti 2018 chen et al 2019 seyoum et al 2019 sahour et al 2020 however due to the lack of accurate and comparable ground based twsa observations most studies focused on obtaining grace based downscaled groundwater change and evaluated results against in situ groundwater measurements zhong et al 2021 this study aimed to spatially downscale grace tws retrieval via integrating it with model based twsa and provide twsa estimates at a fine spatial resolution i e 0 125 0 125 with improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty to achieve this goal a simple least square merging approach using error characteristics quantified from the triple collocation tc approach was used more specifically the objectives of the study are to

1 study area north america including the united states us and part of canada latitude from 25 n to 53 n and longitude from 67 w to 120 w fig 1 was selected as the study area the elevation map represented in fig 1 indicated that the western part of the study domain showed relatively higher elevations than the eastern study domain as the rocky mountain stretches out from western canada to the southwestern us according to the köppen climate classification the climate of the mid east coast falls into three categories humid subtropical climate warm continental climate and temperate continental climate in the western part the climate classifications are more heterogeneous including arid desert tropical subtropical and temperate climates according to the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa national climate report the annual average precipitation and temperature across the contiguous us are 760 5 mm and 11 1 c respectively both average precipitation and temperature showed an increasing trend due to global climate change in accordance the intensity and frequency of flooding have been increased across north america which leads to increased costs for recovering damages associated with floods davenport et al 2021 golnaraghi et al 2020 to evaluate regional flood potential based on the tc based twsa estimates the texas gulf watershed hydrologic unit code huc 12 obtained from https water usgs gov gis huc html is selected as the testbed fig 1b the area of the texas gulf region is approximately 471 000 km2 including 10 major river basins in texas e g brazos river basin colorado river basin and trinity river basins mullens 2021 the annual average streamflow at these river basins accounts for 83 of the total annual average streamflow of texas in terms of the climate the study domain falls into four different koppen climate categories including humid subtropical cfa warm summer mediterranean csb cold semi arid bsk and hot semi arid bsh these distinctive features highly influence the spatio temporal variation of precipitation and temperature kimmel et al 2016 lee et al 2017 this diversity of climate conditions manifests texas as one of the most flood prone states across the united states with the highest flood related fatalities sharif et al 2015 national centers for environmental information ncei reported more than 100 severe storms 30 tropical cyclones and 20 flood events which caused damage of more than a billion dollar in texas since 2000 narrowing down to the county and city level the counties nearby the four largest metropolitan statistical areas i e dallas houston austin and san antonio showed relatively high susceptibility to flooding especially the houston area suffered several major hurricanes including

three data sets with the advantages of not requiring a high quality truth tc has been widely used to estimate the errors in hydrological variables and fluxes such as soil moisture crow et al 2015 dorigo et al 2010 scipal et al 2008 su et al 2014 wu et al 2021 precipitation lyu et al 2020 and evapotranspiration khan et al 2018 however the tc approach is rarely used for twsa error estimates mainly due to the lack of ground based twsa data sets here the tc approach was used to quantify uncertainties in twsa products from 1 grace and grace fo satellites hereafter refer as grace 2 noah 2 8 lsm used in nldas2 and 3 merra 2 in order to conduct the tc analysis twsa from grace and merra 2 were re gridded onto a 0 125 0 125 grid based on nldas2 data the obtained errors of the three data sets from tc analysis will subsequently be used in the least square merging approach to provided downscaled merged twsa estimates as described in section 3 2 the error model for tc analysis equation 1 assumes a linear relationship between the true twsa and estimates of twsa yilmaz et al 2012 1 s i α i s t e i where s t is the true twsa s i i 1 2 3 denotes the three spatio temporally collocated twsa products i e grace nldas2 and merra 2 α i is the multiplicative coefficient of data set i with reference to the true state e i is the zero mean random error with variance σ i 2 as the relationship between the truth and different data sets varies rescaling is required by choosing a reference data set arbitrarily and the rescaled data sets can be written as 2 s i α s t e i where s i is the rescaled data set e i is the relative error of s i with variance σ i 2 by choosing data set s1 as reference data as an example the rescaled values s i can be expressed as follows s 1 s 1 s 2 β 2 s 2 s 2 s 1 3 s 3 β 3 s 3 s 3 s 1 where overbar represents averaging in time and β 2 and β 3 are the rescaling coefficients assuming the errors from different data sets are uncorrelated with each other and the representativeness errors i e error associated with support scale difference between data sets are zero β 2 and β 3 can be calculated as β 2 α 1 α 2 s 1 s 1 s 3 s 3 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 σ s 1 s 3 σ s 2 s 3 4 β 3 α 1 α 3 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 s 2 s 2 σ s 1 s 2 σ s 3 s 2 assuming the errors of the three data sets are independent from the truth the error variance of the rescaled data sets can be estimated as σ 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 3 σ 2 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 5 σ 3 2 s 3 s 1 s 3 s 2 note that the error variance estimates in equation 5 provide only relative accuracy of the three data sets which represents the noisiness of one data set relative to another data set in other words tc does not provide estimates of actual error variance but the scaled absolute error variance selecting different reference data sets the calculated error variances are different accordingly fortunately the representation of relative errors between the three data sets are independent from the arbitrary selection of the reference and the relative errors are the only required information in the optimal least square merging method yilmaz et al 2012 as discussed in section 3 2 in this study nldas2 based twsa was used as the reference data a more detailed discussion about the tc approach is available in gruber et al 2016 3 2 least square merging a simple objective based least square merging method introduced by yilmaz et al 2012 was used to merge grace based twsa with model based twsa estimates the least square method has been successfully used for merging satellite and model based soil moisture products with improved accuracy without user defined parameter assumptions yilmaz et al 2012 using three independent data sets of the same variable with error mean of zero the merged estimates sm can be written as 6 s m w x s x w y s y w z s z the fundamental idea of the least square method is to merge the three data sets in a way that minimizes the error variance of the merged estimates σ m 2 which is also defined as the cost function j 7 j σ m 2 w x 2 σ x 2 w y 2 σ y 2 w z 2 σ z 2 where w x w y and w z are the relative weights of data set s x s y and s z to achieve the least square solution for s m with an unbiased minimum error variance all three data sets should relate to the truth with the same coefficient setting j w i 0 i x y z the obtained expressions for w x w y and w z are w x σ y 2 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 w y σ x 2 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 8 w z σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x 2 σ z 2 σ y 2 σ z 2 here s x s y and s z correspond to rescaled twsa data sets s 1 s 2 and s 3 in section 3 1 and σ x 2 σ y 2 and σ z 2 correspond to σ 1 2 σ 2 2 and σ 3 2 from equation 5 taking equation 5 into equation 8 the weight given to each twsa data set can be achieved and thus a least square merging solution for twsa at a finer spatial resolution relative to grace and merra 2 can be obtained by using equation 6 when the computed error variance σ i 2 i 1 2 3 is negative for any data set a weight of 1 3 is given to each data set i and an arithmetic average of the three rescaled data sets is calculated because the variance value cannot be negative 3 3 flood potential analysis the merged twsa product from section 3 2 was further used for flood potential analysis using the flood potential index fpi developed by reager and famiglietti 2009 firstly the storage deficit for each grid at given month t was calculated as 9 s def t s max s t 1 where s max represents the historical maximum storage anomaly and s t 1 represents the twsa of the previous month afterwards the storage deficit sdef was subtracted from monthly precipitation p mon to calculate the flood potential amount f 10 f t p mon t s def t the precipitation data used in this study is trmm and it is rescaled to the same grid of the downscaled twsa product i e 0 125 0 125 grid based on nldas2 a positive f value represents that rainfall exceeds the storage deficit of the current month and a negative f value may occur during the dry period when the water storage deficit is large but precipitation is low a joint influence of high precipitation and low storage deficit will lead to a high probability of flooding finally the fpi was calculated by normalizing flood potential amount f 11 f p i t f t m a x f t when the fpi value is close to 1 it indicates a higher chance of flood occurrence and the fpi value cannot be larger than 1 reager and famiglietti 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of twsa data sets tc approach is used to estimate errors in twsa derived from grace merra 2 and nldas2 as tc requires a mutual linear relationship among different data sets the cross correlations between data sets were first evaluated following yilmaz et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 a significant p 0 005 and strong positive cross correlation was found across most regions in north america fig 2 however grace showed a weak correlation with merra 2 and nldas2 in the gulf of california and florida regions the cross correlation between grace and nldas2 even became negative along the eastern coast of the gulf of california the discrepancies between grace and the other two data sets may be attributed to the coarse spatial resolution of grace twsa retrievals which cannot distinguish the signal between land and ocean with adequate accuracy bonin and chambers 2013 additionally merra 2 yielded a relatively poor correlation with either grace or nldas2 in eastern canada the poor correlation between grace and merra 2 was also found in reichle et al 2017 and it was explained by the poor quality of the gauge based precipitation product in the northern high latitudes that were used to correct precipitation in merra 2 merra 2 versus nldas2 generally provided the largest cross correlation with an average of 0 75 using nldas2 as the reference data the error standard deviation of twsa from grace merra 2 and nldas2 as well as the corresponding weight assigned to each data set in the merging process are shown in fig 3 nldas2 showed relatively lower uncertainty with a mean error standard deviation of 31 mm in the study domain the uncertainty in grace twsa is the largest with a mean error standard deviation of 48 mm and the value for merra 2 is 39 mm it is found that the spatial pattern of error standard deviation and weight are intuitively consistent with the cross correlation fig 2 among different data sets in the gulf of california and florida regions where grace showed a weaker correlation with the other two data sets the calculated error standard deviation of grace was larger and thus a small weight around 0 2 was assigned to grace data while in eastern canada where merra 2 showed discrepancies merra 2 had a larger error standard deviation thus larger weights were assigned to the other two data sets generally grace merra 2 and nldas2 were assigned a larger weight in high latitude areas eastern us and the southern us along the coast respectively a large portion of grids in the western and middle us do not have error variance estimates due to the large discrepancies among the three data sets which may be associated with human alterations that are not modeled in nldas2 and merra 2 such as groundwater pumping and irrigation leng et al 2014 reichle et al 2017 additionally the highly heterogeneous geographic characteristic in the western and middle us may degrade the performance of grace based twsa due to its coarse spatial resolution the relatively larger weights given to nldas2 along the south coastal areas may be related to its original finer spatial resolution that better distinguishes signals between land and ocean as discussed in section 3 1 the selection of reference data does not affect the relative error ranking of different data sets which means it will not influence the calculated weights for grace merra 2 and nldas2 however the selection of reference data introduces a strong dependence of the estimated error on the standard deviation of the reference data draper et al 2013 gruber et al 2016 therefore the spatial error patterns for different data sets cannot be compared as they all contain the spatial structure of the nldas2 climatology which limits the evaluation of actual data set quality although the selection of reference data does not influence the calculated weights assigned to each input data set the merging process that multiplying weights with rescaled data sets equations 3 and 6 makes the merged tc based twsa inevitably contains the climatology of reference data however such linear transformations i e rescale of data sets in equation 3 are not unusual in hydrological studies yilmaz et al 2012 such as cumulative distribution function matching and variance matching especially in the land data assimilation studies girotto et al 2016 4 2 evaluation of the merged twsa estimates after obtaining weights assigned to each data set the merged tc based twsa estimates were calculated using equation 6 watershed average twsa derived from grace merra 2 nldas2 and tc across 18 river basins in the us were evaluated fig 4 shows the watershed average twsa time series in 10 example watersheds additionally the seasonal cycle of twsa variation was removed from each twsa time series and the correlation coefficient r and unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd of watershed average deseasonalized twsa between tc and input data sets are shown in table 1 it is found that tc based twsa usually lied among the three data sets grace based twsa showed a decreasing trend in twsa in california huc 18 and lower colorado huc 15 watersheds since 2011 indicating the extended drought in western us hammond et al 2016 kuwayama et al 2019 however the trend was not obvious in twsa from merra 2 and nldas2 especially in the lower colorado watershed however due to the large discrepancies among input data sets a large portion of grids in this region do not provide a positive error variance estimate and thus a weight of 1 3 was assigned to each input data set fig 3 therefore tc based twsa yielded a more similar variation as nldas2 and merra 2 with a larger r and a smaller ubrmsd with nldas2 and merra 2 table 1 in the two watersheds grace generally provided a larger twsa relative to merra 2 and nldas2 in missouri watershed huc 10 across the study period while in upper mississippi huc 7 and great lakes huc 4 watersheds the larger values were mostly found during the end of grace mission and grace fo period when grace based twsa data had larger uncertainties fatolazadeh and goïta 2021 in these watersheds the inter annual variation of tc based twsa showed a better consistency with merra 2 relatively good agreements among the three input data sets were found in pacific northwest huc 17 and south atlantic gulf huc 3 where three input data sets all yielded good statistics with tc based twsa in terms of inter annual variation table 1 in texas gulf watershed all three input data sets showed similar inter annual variation of twsa but the tc based twsa showed the highest agreement with nldas2 in all examined 18 watersheds a better consistency between tc and grace based twsa was only witnessed in the new england watershed huc 1 which is coincident with the previous discussion that grace was assigned more weight in relatively high latitude region twsa derived from grace merra 2 nldas2 and tc in january 2003 centered on january 16 based on grace time span was selected as an example as shown in fig 5 all four twsa products showed similar spatial distribution of twsa with positive values in the southeastern and west coast of us as well as in the eastern canada negative twsa values were mostly witnessed in central us and northern mexico however discrepancies among these products were noticed grace generally represented a spatially smoothed distribution of twsa with smaller absolute twsa values due to its coarse resolution as well as the spatial smoothing process in retrieving grace twsa product merra 2 provided a larger amplitude of twsa variation that wet regions showed relatively larger twsa values and dry regions had more negative values additionally it is noticed that merra 2 and nldas2 showed opposite twsa behaviors to the northeastern of great lakes red circles in fig 5 where merra 2 indicated a wet condition while nldas2 indicated a dry condition tc based twsa estimates took the conflicts into consideration providing a slightly negative value but not as dry as indicated by nldas2 comparing the twsa estimates with reported flood from the dartmouth flood observatory dfo data accessible from https floodobservatory colorado edu it is found that the location of reported floods showed some consistency with tc based twsa estimates regions showing large twsa values generally suffered flooding during the same or next few months however the spatial pattern of flood occurrence and twsa did not completely agree with each other which is understandable as 1 dfo collects flood events from satellite observations and weather service reporting and thus not all flood events are recorded 2 positive twsa value does not necessarily always cause floods and it is also related to the precipitation and the water storage capacity of the watershed it is also noticed that in the northeast of great lakes region there was no flood event reported additionally no drought was recorded in this area in january 2003 based on the north american drought monitor therefore it is believed that tc based twsa estimates combined the information from individual input data sets and has the potential to remove the incorrect signals in each data set providing a more realistic estimate of twsa furthermore the uncertainty of tc based twsa was calculated as shown in fig 5f note that although the absolute error contains the spatial climatology of nldas2 the relative error ranking was not influenced tc based twsa estimates provided a much smaller error uncertainty relative to individual input data sets fig 3a c with a mean standard deviation of 16 mm overall tc based twsa product efficiently used information from different input data sets providing a more reliable estimates with reduced uncertainty 4 3 evaluation of flood potential using the tc based fpi in this section the applicability of merged twsa estimates in analyzing the flood potential at sub regional scale was evaluated using an example watershed the texas gulf river basin fig 2b tc based twsa estimates were utilized to calculate the fpi hereafter refer as tc based fpi and results were assessed against the ground based river discharge measurements as well as the historical flood records fig 6 represents the time series of river discharge measurements and collocated tc based fpi at two example grdc stations station 4150525 on lampasas river and station 4150500 on brazos river locations shown in fig 1 located in the brazos river basin in general tc based fpi showed good correspondence with regard to the temporal variation of river discharge comparing the two stations the positive fpi values occurred more frequently at station 4150500 the main reason is the difference in the magnitude of river discharge station 4150500 is located near the outlet of the brazos river basin while station 4150515 is located at lampasas river which is the secondary tributary of the brazos river thus a larger magnitude of river discharge was observed at the downstream station which increases the flood risk and in turn showed the higher frequency of fpi a comparison of fpi with the ncei historical flood record revealed that fpi based on the downscaled twsa product successfully captured flood events for example station 4150515 fig 6a showed that large fpi values were found during april 2004 and the summer of 2007 according to the historical flood event kempas and nearby cities underwent numerous flash floods during these specific periods because of the regional heavy rainfall e g april 2004 with the maximum daily precipitation reached up to 8 in and tornado e g occurred on 17 jun 2007 dong et al 2011 also address that texas and oklahoma were in extremely wet condition from may to july 2007 due to the abnormal atmospheric conditions at the leeward side of rocky mountain and negative anomaly of geopotential height which resulted in the development of thunderstorm and heavy rainfall fpi at station 4150500 fig 6b also matched well with the historical flood record the large fpi values during november 2004 to february 2005 correspond to the flash floods in the richmond region due to the heavy rain moreover the fpi during the late 2010 s matched well with the emergence of heavy rainfall e g heavy rainfall during may 27 28 2016 and storms e g tax day storm in 2016 tropical storm imelda in september 2019 especially tropical storm imelda caused extreme precipitation up to 43 in of the rainfall across the southeastern part of texas gebremichael et al 2020 however mismatch between tc based fpi and historical flood event records were also detected for example according to fig 6b tc based fpi showed flood potential at station 4150500 during the summer of 2004 2005 and august september of 2010 whereas flood events records were not found near the station area this mismatch maybe explained by the human activities associated with flood control and water management based on the ncei historical flood record heavy rainfall and tornado emerged near station 4150515 during the summer of 2004 and 2005 and central texas including bell williamson and travis counties during september 7 14 2010 these flood records led to the increase of river discharge at upstream and were expected to influence the river discharge at downstream e g station 4150500 however there was no recorded flood event at station 4150500 during those specific periods the main reason was due to the several reservoirs located at upper brazos river basin including lake belton lake georgetown and stillhouse hollow lake which were constructed for the efficient water supply and or flood control however fpi does not account for the human activities during the calculation and in turn led to the mismatch between the flood record and fpi another possible reason is related to the influence of soil moisture and or groundwater for example aquifers such as edwards and trinity have relatively deep and confined reservoirs yang and scanlon 2019 which leads to a relatively longer time for infiltration procedure reager et al 2014 in addition recharge of the groundwater further influences the baseflow which in general slowly releases the water thomas and famiglietti 2019 these phenomena might be captured in grace twsa while ground based measurement might have some delay which results in slight discrepancy between flood potential and runoff measurements fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of maximum fpi during 2015 fig 7a d and 2018 fig 7e h which are the two years that experienced a relatively high frequency of flood and or flash flood events the overall comparison indicated that for all four different twsas fpi showed relatively larger fpi across the northeastern and southwestern part of the study domain fig 7 historical flood records also revealed a similar pattern in that dallas forth worth metropolitan area underwent 191 flood events during 2015 and corpus christi metropolitan area suffered 64 and 55 flood events during 2015 and 2018 respectively however fpi from different twsas showed some discrepancies in that grace and merra 2 did not show any positive fpi value across the northwestern texas gulf watershed during 2015 and 2018 fig 7b and 7c while nldas 2 and tc based fpis represented positive fpi fig 7a and 7d more specifically historical flood records indicated that the counties included in the black square in fig 7a d e g tom green runnel and taylor counties had 15 flash flood events due to the large rainfalls during april may and july in 2015 while grace based fpi did not show any fpi value larger than zero during 2015 similar behavior was observed across the western part of the watershed including san angelo and midland counties eclipse shape on fig 7e h during 2018 that is historical flood records indicated 21 flash floods across this region during may to august and october due to the heavy rainfall and regional thunderstorms the maximum fpi from tc based twsa was around 0 7 in may while grace based fpi did not show any positive values in the case of merra 2 and nldas2 both fpi showed positive value with relatively larger fpi for nldas2 over the ellipse shape regions according to fig 3e and f merra 2 showed a relatively larger weight than nldas2 over the western texas gulf watershed while in the east nldas2 was assigned more weight therefore tc based fpi showed more similar characteristics with nldas2 fpi and merra 2 fpi in the eastern and western parts of the watershed respectively in 2018 it is evident that tc based fpi provided a more similar spatial pattern with historical flood records than each input data set with more flood events occurred in the eastern texas gulf region than in the west these results provide clear evidence that by considering the error characterization of each input tc based twsa provided more detailed twsa information and thus fpi captured the flood that occurred at a subregional scale another behavior was observed across the northern part of the dallas forth worth metropolitan area dashed box region in fig 7a d including denton wise and montague counties during 2015 at the specific region the maximum fpi from tc based twsa ranged from 0 34 to 0 73 while the maximum grace based fpi lied between 0 27 and 0 37 for the detailed analysis temporal variation of tc and grace based fpi during 2015 along with twsa estimates at bolivar denton county was presented in fig 8 according to the noaa ncei storm event database this region showed flash flood on 25 april 2015 influenced by the ef0 tornado that occurred at nearby counties 10 may 2015 and 20 may 2015 comparing these flood records with the fpi tc based fpi showed larger than zero values during apr and may 2015 while grace based fpi only showed positive value during may 2015 according to equations 9 11 the sign and magnitude of the fpi are highly dependent on the precipitation p of the current month and water storage deficit sdef of the previous month tc based twsa showed an increasing trend in twsa from april to july 2015 while grace based twsa did not show the same increasing trend in terms of magnitude tc based twsa showed relatively larger magnitude than the grace based twsa fig 7 with the same p and maximum water storage smax at the given month and location different behaviors in twsa resulted in the different s def as well as the calculated fpi derived from grace and tc based twsa as the tc based twsa estimates showed improvement in accuracy as well as the spatial resolution fpi calculated with the tc based twsa resulted in a better representation of the flood risk when compared against the historical flood record 5 conclusions grace based twsa has been regarded as a good indicator of flood potential but its application to sub regional flood analysis was hindered due to the coarse spatial resolution 300 km this study spatially downscaled grace twsa by integrating it with modeled twsa estimates based on an optimal least square merging method across north america moreover the capability of the merged twsa to improve flood potential analysis at sub regional to local scales across an example watershed the texas gulf watershed was evaluated to determine the weights assigned to each data set the tc approach was used to quantify error variances of input data sets i e grace merra 2 and nldas2 it is found that nldas2 provides relatively lower uncertainty with a mean error standard deviation of 31 mm in the study domain while the values for grace and merra 2 are 48 mm and 39 mm individually grace merra 2 and nldas2 were assigned more weights in the high latitude region eastern us and the southern us along coast area respectively it should be noted that tc requires the selection of reference data which results in that the calculated error estimates of input data sets are scaled absolute error estimates rather than actual error estimates however the selection of reference data does not affect the representation of relative errors in the input data sets i e weights are independent of the selection of reference data the merged twsa estimates i e tc based twsa were compared with grace merra2 and nldas2 twsa estimates results showed that tc based twsa estimates showed high consistency with nldas2 as tc based twsa contains the climatology of nldas2 but after removing the seasonal cycle from each twsa time series the similarity of inter annual variation of twsa between tc and input data sets varies depending on regions generally tc based twsa combined the information from different input data sets corrected potential wrong signals in input data sets and provided estimates with mitigated uncertainties moreover a comparison of tc based twsa with recorded flood events provided by dfo demonstrated that tc based twsa well represented the spatial distribution of water storage at the regional scale comparison of the fpi derived from tc based twsa estimates showed good correspondence with the in situ river discharge measurements as well as the ncei historical flood records however tc based fpi occasionally showed a mismatch with the historical flood records at the stations near the downstream region because of the time discrepancy between flood potential and ground based runoff as well as lack of human induced flood management plan in the model based twsa estimates comparison of the maximum fpi maps from tc and grace based fpi confirmed that tc based fpi showed a better consistency with historical flood records than grace based fpi specifically grace based fpi did not represent flood risk over the northwestern texas gulf watershed during 2015 and 2018 while tc based fpi detected the floods these results were mainly due to the advantages of tc based twsa estimates which consider the error characteristics of different input data sets to determine the weight for least squared merging and provides twsa estimates at finer spatial resolution despite the lack of ground based twsa measurements for validation the tc based twsa estimates took advantage of individual input data sets and showed good consistency with flood records additionally error uncertainty of the downscaled twsa product was provided which enables assessing product reliability although tc has been used in many hydrological studies to evaluate error estimates in different data sets its application to twsa products was not well explored furthermore the tc approach can be used to tune a twsa data assimilation system regardless of the presence of autocorrelated observation error providing unbiased error variance estimates for model and observations as part of a future follow on study temporal downscaling of twsa estimates i e from monthly to daily scale will be investigated to better capture floods that occurred at a sub monthly or sub daily scale further disaggregation of twsa estimates into its constituent components e g soil moisture groundwater and canopy water is meaningful to analyze the main trigger for the flood events across different regions credit

increased wyld as compared to those of the cropland in the yrb a humid subtropical region these new insights change the traditional views on how forests and crops affect et and wyld in the humid

yield yazoo river basin 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the sum of land surface evaporations and plant transpirations water yield wyld is the water production from the sum of surface water runoff to reach lateral flow contribution to reach and vadose zone groundwater recharge subtracting the sum of the transmission loss of water from et and soil storage evapotranspiration contributes a large amount of water loss and plays an essential role in reducing wyld in watersheds calder 1998 oren et al 2001 wilcox et al 2003 numerous studies reported that forest lands increase water losses from et and decrease wyld more than those of croplands allison et al 1990 calder 1998 scanlon et al 2007 owuor et al 2016 hornbeck et al 1993 investigated the long term change of annual wyld for 11 catchments in northeastern us and found that wyld increases substantially with a maximum of 350 mm y 1 in the first year of forest cutting but declines quickly after the cutting scanlon et al 2007 evaluated the global impacts of native vegetation conversion to agricultural land on water quantity and concluded that the increase of crop and pasture lands during the past 300 years from forest lands decreases et increases groundwater recharge by two orders of magnitude and raises streamflow by one order of magnitude owuor et al 2016 performed a literature review of land use and land cover effects on groundwater recharge in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions they argued that forests increase et and decrease wyld in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions in contrast forest et may decrease with tree age and at certain age forests increase wyld murakami et al 2000 van dijk and keenan 2007 some forests can decrease et during the periods with limited water availability through the reduction of leaf stomatal conductance oren et al 1998 bréda et al 2006 additionally forest managements such as thinning to an intermediate tree density could increase groundwater recharge and therefore wyld ilstedt et al 2016 murakami et al 2000 measured the et variations in the young age 4 7 and mature age 62 66 japanese cypress chamaecyparisobtusa catchments in japan these authors reported that annual et increases in the young forests but decrease in the mature forests mclaughlin et al 2013 developed a statistical model to estimate water yield under different forest management strategies these authors found that slash pine stands managed at lower basal areas can increase 64 more cumulative water yield over a 25 year rotation as compared to systems managed for high density timber production ilstedt et al 2016 reported that groundwater recharge and wyld are maximized or increase at the intermediate tree densities recently ouyang et al 2019 predicted the impact of forest lands on groundwater in a watershed of mississippi usa and cited that the average annual aquifer recharge in the forest land is slightly higher than that of the cropland and thereby increasing wyld climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon while human activities result in extreme climate change patterns ipcc 2012 evapotranspiration and wyld are vulnerable to climate change because this change influences precipitation and air temperature and thereby the et and wyld stone et al 2001 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat model to investigate impacts of climate change on wyld in the missouri river basin us and found that overall wyld at the outlet of the basin decreases during spring and summer but increases during fall and winter chien et al 2013 studied the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow in agricultural watersheds of the midwestern us using the swat model they projected the annual streamflows from 2051 to 2095 decrease in a range of 44 1 to 61 3 caldwell et al 2016 estimated climate change impacts on wyld from the forest mountain watersheds of the southern appalachian mountains in north carolina us these authors cited that the annual wyld increases up to 55 in some watersheds from 1938 to mid 1970 and then decreases up to 22 by 2013 whereas the opposite is true for forest et with a decrease up to 31 in the mid 1970 followed by an increase up to 29 in 2013 a literature review reveals that our understanding of et and wyld in crop and forest lands under the changing climate conditions is still fragmented to mitigate future climate impacts on et and wyld in watersheds water resource managers farmers and foresters need to understand the potential threats and develop the watershed specific strategies the goal of this study was to compare et and wyld between croplands and forest lands under the changing climate using the us environmental protection agency us epa s hydrologic and water quality system hawqs model the yazoo river basin yrb a humid subtropical region in mississippi usa was selected as a study site specific objectives were to 1 create a model or a project for the yrb using the hawqs model 2 calibrate and validate the model using field measured data 3 apply the model to compare et and wyld between the crop and forest lands over the past and future 50 years and 4 detect the temporal trends of et and wyld using the mann kendall statistics 2 materials and methods 2 1 hawqs model the us epa s hawqs model is public available for simulating water quantity and quality in watersheds of the continental usa hawqs 2020 the model used the swat model as the core simulation engine with many user friendly features such as web interfaces pre loaded past and future climate datasets online project development and execution and tabular and chart format outputs currently a couple of studies are performed using hawqs yen et al 2016 fant et al 2017 yen et al 2016 applied hawqs to predict large scale water quantity and quality in the illinois river watershed usa these authors argued that with the help of hawqs scientists can simulate a large scale watershed with minimum efforts without tedious procedures in a timesaving and cost effective manner fant et al 2017 employed hawqs to predict future water quality conditions and economic impact in usa they concluded that under the business as usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario climate change is likely to have negative economic impacts 2 2 site description the yrb is the largest river basin in mississippi fig 1 and is one of the highest crop productive regions in midsouth us mdeq mississippi department of environmental quality 2008 human activities such as forest clear cuttings for croplands stream channel alterations for navigations and recreations and groundwater pumpage for crop irrigation in the past decades resulted in frequent river flooding low streamflow wetland loss and groundwater level decline in the yrb little et al 1982 clark and hart 2009 msu extension service 2014 ouyang et al 2019 the yrb has two distinct topographic regions guedon and thomas 2004 one is the bluff hills 16 600 km2 in the east and the other is the mississippi alluvial delta about 18 200 km2 in the west which is separated by a dashed line in fig 1 the bluff hills region situates in the upland of the yrb which is primarily occupied by forests with loess and loess derived alluvium the delta region places in the lowland of the yrb with clay and fine sand from alluvial deposition of the ancestral mississippi and ohio rivers guedon and thomas 2004 the yrb has nine watersheds with a total drainage area of about 34 800 km2 and consists of 35 54 cropland 36 7 forestland 18 grassland and wetland 5 81 residential and 3 95 water the average annual temperature is 18 c with a mean minimum of 5 5 c in winter and a mean maximum of 32 c in summer southern regional climate center 1998 long term average precipitation is 1290 mm year with 120 mm month from december to april and 80 mm month from august to october berkowitz et al 2020 of the nine watersheds in the yrb the little tallahatchie river watershed ltrw 4 271 km2 with about 66 forest and wetlands was chosen as the forest dominated watershed and the big sunflower river watershed bsrw 8 171 km2 with about 88 croplands was selected as the crop dominated watershed in this study fig 1 the rest of seven watersheds were not selected in this study because most of them are the mixture of forests and crops 2 3 model creation followed the hawqs version 1 2 model s instructions https hawqs tamu edu content docs hawqs 1 2 whats new pdf the web based yrb model was developed and executed using the following four steps 1 create a project choosing the catchment resolution of huc 8 hydrologic unit code 8 selecting the huc id of 08030208 and setting the hru hydrologic response units to 1 the yrb model with nine watersheds was created in hawqs fig 1 a threshold level of 1 for hrus was used to remove the areas of land uses 1 2 create scenarios and customize inputs two simulation scenarios were chosen in this study the first assessed the past climate change impacts on et and wyld for the period from 1966 to 2015 50 years whereas the second estimated the future climate change impacts on et and wyld for the period from 2021 to 2070 50 years the future weather dataset generated from the ccsm4 community climate system model 4 with the rcp45 representative concentration pathway 45 was used for the second scenario which is readily available in hawqs 3 run the model and 4 analyze the simulation outputs 2 4 trend analysis and statistical test the temporal trends of the predicted et and wyld due to the past and future climate change impacts are detected using the mann kendall analysis mann kendall statistics is a nonparametric trend test does not require normally distributed data and is calculated as kendall and stuart 1976 gilbert 1987 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k with 2 sgn x 1 i f x 0 0 i f x 0 1 i f x 0 the mean of s is zero and the variance is 3 σ 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 m t j t j 1 2 t

dominated watersheds as well as the past and future climate impacts among the hydrological variables such as pet et surface runoff and wlyd are estimated using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test the k s test is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf given n ordered data points y1 y2 yn the ecdf can be defined as chakravarti et al 1967 7 e n n i n where en is the ecdf n i is the

theoretical cumulative distribution 2 5 model calibration and validation the yrb model was calibrated and validated using field measured data prior to its applications the model calibration was accomplished by adjusting some key input parameter values such as curve number plant uptake compensation factor and soil evaporation compensation factor within an acceptable range so that the model predictions match the field observations closely table 1 lists the input parameter values used during the model calibration after calibration the model was validated by comparing the model predictions to an independent dataset of field observations without adjusting any input parameter values in this study the field observed stream discharge data were used for model calibration and validation which were downloaded from the usgs station 07288955 in yazoo river bl steele bayou near long lake ms the statistical measures of the model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 the observed daily discharges from october 1 1996 to december 31 2005 were used for model calibration while the observed daily discharges from january 1 2008 to december 31 2016 were chosen for model validation with the values of r2 0 777 nrmse normalized root mean square error 0 587 m3 s nse nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 357 and p 0 001 a good agreement was obtained between the predicted and observed daily discharge during the model calibration fig 2a analogous to the case of the model calibration the values of r2 nrmse nse and p were statistically significant fig 2b during the model validation which confirmed the model predictions matched the field observations reasonably well 3 results and discussion 3 1 past climate change impacts annual variations of the predicted et and wyld associated with their highly relevant variables such as pet potential et air temperature and precipitation in the cropland bsrw and forest land ltrw over the past 50 year simulation period from 1966 to 2015 are shown in fig 3 the annual pet was calculated using the penman monteith method the annual air temperature and precipitation were the model input data and the dashed lines in the figure were the trend lines in general the annual et and wyld varied with times and land uses over the past 50 years fig 3a 3d for example the annual ets for the cropland and forest land were respectively 709 14 and 577 85 mm in 1975 but 539 75 and 558 24 mm in 2000 while the annual wylds for the cropland and forest land were respectively 1029 19 and 1008 77 mm in 1975 but 595 67 and 425 97 mm in 2000 this happened because pet air temperature and precipitation are among others the major factors controlling the et and wyld as these factors varied with times and land uses fig 3e 3 h so did the et and wyld what is more interesting are the annual trends of et wyld pet air temperature and precipitation fig 3 which were obtained with mann kendall analysis in mann kendall statistics the value τ ranges from 1 to 1 and measures the relationships between variables and times if τ 0 no relationship exists while τ 1 or 1 is a perfect relationship with positive τ for an increasing trend and negative τ for a decreasing trend the p value is a statistical measure of a trend and if p 0 05 there is a monotonic trend mangiafico 2016 over the past 50 years from 1966 to 2015 only the annual average air temperature had a significant increasing trend p 0 001 in both the crop and forest lands fig 3g and 3 h while the annual precipitation decreased very slightly small negative τ but was not significant statistically p 0 05 in the same land uses fig 3i and 3j results indicate that the past climate conditions had no discernable impacts on et and wyld in both the crop and forest lands it is reported that climate change has resulted in precipitation anomaly in the contiguous 48 states of us with more extreme wet than dry conditions since 1990 us epa 2021 based on this report a short term analysis was performed to assess the past climate change impacts on annual variations of et and wyld in the crop and forest lands over a recent 20 year simulation period from 1997 to 2017 fig 4 this short term period was selected according to atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo which is an index of the climate cycle that affects the sea surface temperature of the north atlantic ocean based on different modes on multi decadal timescales the negative amo index is for a cooling cycle and the positive one is for a warming cycle mccarthy et al 2015 the period from 1997 to 2017 selected in this analysis has positive amo index and belongs to a warming cycle ouyang et al 2020 in the recent 20 years there were significant increasing trends of et τ 0 403 and p 0 05 and pet τ 0 342 and p 0 05 in the cropland fig 4a and 4e while there was only a significant increasing trend of et τ 0 403 and p 0 05 in the forest land fig 4b the increasing trend of et in both the crop and forest lands could be a result of a warming amo cycle although the temporal trends of air temperature and precipitation in these land uses were not statistically significant fig 4g to 4j results show that a short term climate impact on et especially in the recent 20 years was discernable in the crop and forest lands of the yrb fig 5 shows that the 50 year 1966 2015 annual averages of pet et and air temperature in the cropland were larger than those in the forest land the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 1145 and 1068 mm for pet 656 and 592 mm for et and 17 and 16 c for air temperature there were 7 21 and 10 81 more pet and et respectively in the cropland than in the forest land these differences were confirmed using the k s test at a significant level of α 0 05 table 2 results demonstrate that over the past 50 years the cropland lost more water than that of the forest land through et this finding was contradicted to some consensuses that forest lands lost more water from et than that of croplands allison et al 1990 calder 1998 owuor et al 2016 although the scientific reasons remain to be investigated one possible explanation of the discrepancy would be the different weather conditions at different study locations while most of their studies are focused on the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions this study was aimed at the humid subtropical region i e yrb in the semi arid regions the top soil layers are drier and have lesser water available for crop et but forests have a much longer rooting depth to uptake water from the deeper soil layers as a result the et in the forest land was higher than in the cropland in the humid subtropical regions however there are more amounts of precipitation and thereby more soil water available in the top soil layers for et with the higher water content and air temperature in the cropland of the mississippi alluvial plain more et could occur in the cropland than in the forest land comparisons of the 50 year 1966 to 2015 annual averaged wyld and precipitation between the crop and forest lands are also shown in fig 5 unlike the cases of the pet et and air temperature the averaged wyld and precipitation were smaller in the cropland than in the forest land the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 711 and 834 mm for wyld and 1386 and 1462 mm for precipitation there were 17 3 and 5 481 lower wyld and precipitation respectively in the cropland than in the forest land the lower wyld in the cropland was significant at α 0 05 table 2 and occurred because of higher water loss from the crop et although topography also played an important role additionally the forest dominated watershed received more precipitation than the cropland dominated watershed fig 5 which would reduce et and increase wyld in the forest dominated watershed although the difference in precipitation between the cropland and forest land was statistically not significant based on the k s test table 2 3 2 future climate change impacts projected variations of the annual et wyld pet air temperature and precipitation over the future 50 year simulation period from 2021 to 2070 are shown in fig 6 no significant temporal trend of et was observed over the simulation period in both the crop and forest lands fig 6a and 6b although a significant increasing temporal trend of pet was found at the same simulation period and land uses fig 6e and 6f in general pet is a measure of the atmospheric ability to remove water from a surface through the processes of evaporation and transpiration when water supply is not a limiting factor which is positively correlated to air temperature as the air temperature increased fig 6g and 6 h the pet in both the crop and forest lands increased on the other hand et is the amount of water that is actual removed from the surface through the same processes that are controlled by water supply as the precipitation or water supply in this case had no statistically significant trend fig 6i and 6j so did the et in both the crop and forest lands results indicate that future climate change had a minimum effect on et in the yrb analogous to the case of et there was no significant temporal trend of wyld in the crop and forest lands over the future 50 years fig 6c and 5d this occurred primarily because there were no significant temporal trends of et fig 6a and 6b and precipitation fig 6i and 6j since the et and precipitation are the two major factors governing the wyld of watersheds results suggest that the future climate change would not affect annual wyld in the yrb fig 6 further reveals that there was a similar annual variation pattern between the wyld and the precipitation in the crop fig 6c vs fig 6i and forest fig 6d vs fig 6j lands a linear regression analysis shows the following two relationships 9 w y l d 470 1 05 p r e c i p i t a t i o n r 2 0 967 p 0 001 c r o p l a n d 10 w y l d 330 1 04 p r e c i p i t a t i o n r 2 0 951 p 0 001 f o r e s t l a n d with the very good r2 and low p values it is apparent that the annual wyld can be approximated from the annual precipitation comparisons of the future 50 year 2021 2070 annual averaged pet et air temperature wyld and precipitation between the crop and forest lands are shown in fig 7 similar to the case of the past 50 year annual averages fig 5 the future averages of the pet et and air temperature in the cropland were larger than those in the forest land fig 7 the future averages in the cropland and forest land were respectively 885 and 824 mm for pet 514 and 362 mm for et and 19 and 18 c for air temperature there were 7 4 and 41 99 more pet and et respectively in the cropland than in the forest land the differences between the cropland and forest land among the pet et and air temperature were statistically significant based on the k s test table 2 results show that over the next 50 years the cropland lost more water than that of the forest land through et this finding agreed to that of the past climate conditions due to the same reasons as described in section 3 2 fig 7 further reveals that the 50 year annual averaged wyld and precipitation were smaller in the cropland than in the forest land over the future 50 years more specifically the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 945 and 1141 mm for wyld and 1464 and 1527 mm for precipitation there were 20 7 wyld and 4 3 precipitation lower in the cropland than in the forest land although the difference was statistically significant for wyld but not for precipitation table 2 the lower wyld in the cropland primarily occurred because of higher et 3 3 past vs future climate impacts differences in 50 year annual averaged pet et air temperatures surface runoff wyld and precipitation between the past and future climate impacts can be inferred from figs 5 and 7 overall the averaged pet and et were larger under the past climate conditions than under the future climate conditions for the same land uses for example the averaged ets in the crop and forest lands were respectively 27 6 656 514 514 0 276 and 63 5 592 362 362 0 635 larger under the past climate than under the future climate conditions the differences were statistically significant with the k s test table 2 these findings contradicted to our consensus that the averaged et and pet will increase in watersheds as the future averaged air temperature and precipitation increase in this study while future averaged precipitation in both the crop and forest lands increased as compared to those of the past but not statistically significant table 2 the future averaged surface runoffs in both the crop and forest lands also increased as compared to those of the past statistically significant table 2 the annual averaged surface runoffs in the cropland and forest land were respectively 27 631 499 499 0 54 and 33 52 39 39 0 33 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions these larger future surface runoffs reduced soil water storage and provided less soil water for the future et the higher future surface runoffs in both the crop and forest lands could be the result of the larger number of precipitation days under the future climate than under the past climate conditions fig 8 in this study the number of precipitation days were the days when the precipitation events occurred regardless of their duration and intensity there were 59 i e 273 214 59 and 55 i e 254 199 55 more precipitation days respectively in the crop and forest lands under the future climate than under the past climate conditions additionally the lower monthly averaged solar radiation not significant table 2 and windspeed significant table 2 under the future climate conditions fig 8b also decreased the future pet and et as compared to those of the past fig 8a in contrast the opposite was true for the wyld and precipitation that is the 50 year annual averaged wyld and precipitation were larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions in the crop and forest lands for instance the averaged wylds in the crop and forest lands were respectively 32 9 and 26 9 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions parallel to the case of wyld the averaged precipitations in the crop and forest lands were respectively 5 6 and 4 3 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions this finding was consistent with the report that climate change resulted in precipitation anomaly in the contiguous 48 states of us with more extreme wet than dry conditions since 1990 us epa 2021 as the future precipitation increased and et decreased more wyld was produced in the yrb 4 conclusions no temporal trend of et was found under the long term past and future climate conditions but a significant increasing trend of et was observed in the recent 20 years 1997 to 2017 in both the crop and forest lands there were more et and less wyld in the cropland than in the forest land over the past 50 years 1966 1985 and future 50 years 2021 2070 in a long range the forest land reduced et and increased wyld as compared to those of the cropland in the yazoo river basin a humid subtropical region there was a very good linear relationship between the annual wyld and the annual precipitation in both the crop and forest lands and thus the annual wyld can be approximated from the annual precipitation the past and future annual average air temperatures were approximately 1 c cooler in the forest land than in the cropland the 50 year annual averaged pet and et were larger under the past climate than under the future climate conditions in both the crop and forest lands the possible reasons of this phenomenon are 1 the future number of precipitation days were larger than those of the past in the crop and forest lands which created the larger future surface water runoff and provided less water for et and 2 the solar radiation and windspeed under the future climate conditions were lower than those of the past which reduced the future pet as compared to that of the past the penman monteith method was used to estimate pet in this study recent reports show that this method may overestimate the et because it neglects the impact of atmospheric co2 concentrations under the non water stress conditions a higher atmospheric co2 concentration decreases water loss by reducing plant stomatal conductance yang et al 2019 further study is therefore warranted to tackle on this issue for a comprehensive understanding of land use impacts on et and wyld further study is warranted to synthesize the past studies on these two variables at different geographical and climate regions credit authorship contribution statement ying ouyang

simulation further reveals that the annual average air temperature over the past and future 50 years was about 1 c cooler in the forest land than in the cropland during the past 50 years there was 10 8 more water lost from et in the cropland 656 mm year than in the forest land 592 mm year while there was 17 3 less wyld in the cropland 711 mm year than in the forest land 834 mm year similar results were also obtained for the future 50 years i e there were 42 0 more et and 20 7 less wyld in the cropland than in the forest land results show that over a long range the forest land reduced et and increased wyld as compared to those of the cropland in the yrb a humid subtropical region these new insights change the traditional views on how forests and crops affect et and wyld in the humid

from et and decrease wyld more than those of croplands allison et al 1990 calder 1998 scanlon et al 2007 owuor et al 2016 hornbeck et al 1993 investigated the long term change of annual wyld for 11 catchments in northeastern us and found that wyld increases substantially with a maximum of 350 mm y 1 in the first year of forest cutting but declines quickly after the cutting scanlon et al 2007 evaluated the global impacts of native vegetation conversion to agricultural land on water quantity and concluded that the increase of crop and pasture lands during the past 300 years from forest

availability through the reduction of leaf stomatal conductance oren et al 1998 bréda et al 2006 additionally forest managements such as thinning to an intermediate tree density could increase

systems managed for high density timber production ilstedt et al 2016 reported that groundwater recharge and wyld are maximized or increase at the intermediate tree densities recently ouyang et al 2019 predicted the impact of forest lands on groundwater in a watershed of mississippi usa and cited that the average annual aquifer recharge in the forest land is slightly higher than that of the cropland and thereby increasing wyld climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon while human activities result in extreme climate change patterns ipcc 2012 evapotranspiration and wyld are vulnerable to climate change because this change influences precipitation and air temperature and thereby the et and wyld stone et al 2001 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat model to

carolina us these authors cited that the annual wyld increases up to 55 in some watersheds from 1938 to mid 1970 and then decreases up to 22 by 2013 whereas the opposite is true for forest et with a decrease up to 31 in the mid 1970 followed by an increase up to 29 in 2013 a literature review reveals that our understanding of et and wyld in crop and forest lands under the changing climate conditions is still fragmented to mitigate future climate impacts on et and wyld in watersheds water resource managers farmers and foresters need to understand the potential threats and develop the watershed specific strategies the goal of this study was to compare et and wyld between croplands and forest lands under the changing climate using the us environmental protection agency us epa s hydrologic and water quality system hawqs model the yazoo river basin yrb a humid subtropical region in mississippi usa was selected as a study site specific objectives were to 1 create a model or a project for the yrb using the hawqs model 2 calibrate and validate the model using field measured data 3 apply the model to compare et and wyld between the crop and forest lands over the past and future 50 years and 4 detect the temporal trends of et and wyld using the mann kendall statistics 2 materials and methods 2 1 hawqs model the us epa s hawqs model is public available for simulating water quantity and quality in watersheds of the continental usa hawqs 2020 the model used the swat model as the core simulation engine with many user friendly features such as web interfaces pre loaded past and future climate datasets online project development and execution and tabular and chart format outputs currently a couple of studies are performed using hawqs yen et al 2016 fant et al 2017 yen et al 2016 applied hawqs to predict large scale water quantity and quality in the illinois river watershed usa these authors argued that with the help of hawqs scientists can simulate a large scale watershed with minimum efforts without tedious procedures in a timesaving and cost effective manner fant et al 2017 employed hawqs to predict future water quality conditions and economic impact in usa they concluded that under the business as usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario climate change is likely to have negative economic impacts 2 2 site description the yrb is the largest river basin in mississippi fig 1 and is one of the highest crop productive regions in midsouth us mdeq mississippi department of environmental quality 2008 human activities such as forest clear cuttings for croplands stream channel alterations for navigations and recreations and groundwater pumpage for crop irrigation in the past decades resulted in frequent river flooding low streamflow wetland loss and groundwater level decline in the yrb little et al 1982 clark and hart 2009 msu extension service 2014 ouyang et al 2019 the yrb has two distinct topographic regions guedon and thomas 2004 one is the bluff hills 16 600 km2 in the east and the other is the mississippi alluvial delta about 18 200 km2 in the west which is separated by a dashed line in fig 1 the bluff hills region situates in the upland of the yrb which is primarily occupied by forests with loess and loess derived alluvium the delta region places in the lowland of the yrb with clay and fine sand from alluvial deposition of the ancestral mississippi and ohio rivers guedon and thomas 2004 the yrb has nine watersheds with a total drainage area of about 34 800 km2 and consists of 35 54 cropland 36 7 forestland 18 grassland and wetland 5 81 residential and 3 95 water the average annual temperature is 18 c with a mean minimum of 5 5 c in winter and a mean maximum of 32 c in summer southern regional climate center 1998 long term average precipitation is 1290 mm year with 120 mm month from december to april and 80 mm month from august to october berkowitz et al 2020 of the nine watersheds in the yrb the little tallahatchie river watershed ltrw 4 271 km2 with about 66 forest and wetlands was chosen as the forest dominated watershed and the big sunflower river watershed bsrw 8 171 km2 with about 88 croplands was selected as the crop dominated watershed in this study fig 1 the rest of seven watersheds were not selected in this study because most of them are the mixture of forests and crops 2 3 model creation followed the hawqs version 1 2 model s instructions https hawqs tamu edu content docs hawqs 1 2 whats new pdf the web based yrb model was developed and executed using the following four steps 1 create a project choosing the catchment resolution of huc 8 hydrologic unit code 8 selecting the huc id of 08030208 and setting the hru hydrologic response units to 1 the yrb model with nine watersheds was created in hawqs fig 1 a threshold level of 1 for hrus was used to remove the areas of land uses 1 2 create scenarios and customize inputs two simulation scenarios were chosen in this study the first assessed the past climate change impacts on et and wyld for the period from 1966 to 2015 50 years whereas the second estimated the future climate change impacts on et and wyld for the period from 2021 to 2070 50 years the future weather dataset generated from the ccsm4 community climate system model 4 with the rcp45 representative concentration pathway 45 was used for the second scenario which is readily available in hawqs 3 run the model and 4 analyze the simulation outputs 2 4 trend analysis and statistical test the temporal trends of the predicted et and wyld due to the past and future climate change impacts are detected using the mann kendall analysis mann kendall statistics is a nonparametric trend test does not require normally distributed data and is calculated as kendall and stuart 1976 gilbert 1987 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k with 2 sgn x 1 i f x 0 0 i f x 0 1 i f x 0 the mean of s is zero and the variance is 3 σ 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 j 1 m t j t j 1 2 t

theoretical cumulative distribution 2 5 model calibration and validation the yrb model was calibrated and validated using field measured data prior to its applications the model calibration was accomplished by adjusting some key input parameter values such as curve number plant uptake compensation factor and soil evaporation compensation factor within an acceptable range so that the model predictions match the field observations closely table 1 lists the input parameter values used during the model calibration after calibration the model was validated by comparing the model predictions to an independent dataset of field observations without adjusting any input parameter values in this study the field observed stream discharge data were used for model calibration and validation which were downloaded from the usgs station 07288955 in yazoo river bl steele bayou near long lake ms the statistical measures of the model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 the observed daily discharges from october 1 1996 to december 31 2005 were used for model calibration while the observed daily discharges from january 1 2008 to december 31 2016 were chosen for model validation with the values of r2 0 777 nrmse normalized root mean square error 0 587 m3 s nse nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 357 and p 0 001 a good agreement was obtained between the predicted and observed daily discharge during the model calibration fig 2a analogous to the case of the model calibration the values of r2 nrmse nse and p were statistically significant fig 2b during the model validation which confirmed the model predictions matched the field observations reasonably well 3 results and discussion 3 1 past climate change impacts annual variations of the predicted et and wyld associated with their highly relevant variables such as pet potential et air temperature and precipitation in the cropland bsrw and forest land ltrw over the past 50 year simulation period from 1966 to 2015 are shown in fig 3 the annual pet was calculated using the penman monteith method the annual air temperature and precipitation were the model input data and the dashed lines in the figure were the trend lines in general the annual et and wyld varied with times and land uses over the past 50 years fig 3a 3d for example the annual ets for the cropland and forest land were respectively 709 14 and 577 85 mm in 1975 but 539 75 and 558 24 mm in 2000 while the annual wylds for the cropland and forest land were respectively 1029 19 and 1008 77 mm in 1975 but 595 67 and 425 97 mm in 2000 this happened because pet air temperature and precipitation are among others the major factors controlling the et and wyld as these factors varied with times and land uses fig 3e 3 h so did the et and wyld what is more interesting are the annual trends of et wyld pet air temperature and precipitation fig 3 which were obtained with mann kendall analysis in mann kendall statistics the value τ ranges from 1 to 1 and measures the relationships between variables and times if τ 0 no relationship exists while τ 1 or 1 is a perfect relationship with positive τ for an increasing trend and negative τ for a decreasing trend the p value is a statistical measure of a trend and if p 0 05 there is a monotonic trend mangiafico 2016 over the past 50 years from 1966 to 2015 only the annual average air temperature had a significant increasing trend p 0 001 in both the crop and forest lands fig 3g and 3 h while the annual precipitation decreased very slightly small negative τ but was not significant statistically p 0 05 in the same land uses fig 3i and 3j results indicate that the past climate conditions had no discernable impacts on et and wyld in both the crop and forest lands it is reported that climate change has resulted in precipitation anomaly in the contiguous 48 states of us with more extreme wet than dry conditions since 1990 us epa 2021 based on this report a short term analysis was performed to assess the past climate change impacts on annual variations of et and wyld in the crop and forest lands over a recent 20 year simulation period from 1997 to 2017 fig 4 this short term period was selected according to atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo which is an index of the climate cycle that affects the sea surface temperature of the north atlantic ocean based on different modes on multi decadal timescales the negative amo index is for a cooling cycle and the positive one is for a warming cycle mccarthy et al 2015 the period from 1997 to 2017 selected in this analysis has positive amo index and belongs to a warming cycle ouyang et al 2020 in the recent 20 years there were significant increasing trends of et τ 0 403 and p 0 05 and pet τ 0 342 and p 0 05 in the cropland fig 4a and 4e while there was only a significant increasing trend of et τ 0 403 and p 0 05 in the forest land fig 4b the increasing trend of et in both the crop and forest lands could be a result of a warming amo cycle although the temporal trends of air temperature and precipitation in these land uses were not statistically significant fig 4g to 4j results show that a short term climate impact on et especially in the recent 20 years was discernable in the crop and forest lands of the yrb fig 5 shows that the 50 year 1966 2015 annual averages of pet et and air temperature in the cropland were larger than those in the forest land the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 1145 and 1068 mm for pet 656 and 592 mm for et and 17 and 16 c for air temperature there were 7 21 and 10 81 more pet and et respectively in the cropland than in the forest land these differences were confirmed using the k s test at a significant level of α 0 05 table 2 results demonstrate that over the past 50 years the cropland lost more water than that of the forest land through et this finding was contradicted to some consensuses that forest lands lost more water from et than that of croplands allison et al 1990 calder 1998 owuor et al 2016 although the scientific reasons remain to be investigated one possible explanation of the discrepancy would be the different weather conditions at different study locations while most of their studies are focused on the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions this study was aimed at the humid subtropical region i e yrb in the semi arid regions the top soil layers are drier and have lesser water available for crop et but forests have a much longer rooting depth to uptake water from the deeper soil layers as a result the et in the forest land was higher than in the cropland in the humid subtropical regions however there are more amounts of precipitation and thereby more soil water available in the top soil layers for et with the higher water content and air temperature in the cropland of the mississippi alluvial plain more et could occur in the cropland than in the forest land comparisons of the 50 year 1966 to 2015 annual averaged wyld and precipitation between the crop and forest lands are also shown in fig 5 unlike the cases of the pet et and air temperature the averaged wyld and precipitation were smaller in the cropland than in the forest land the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 711 and 834 mm for wyld and 1386 and 1462 mm for precipitation there were 17 3 and 5 481 lower wyld and precipitation respectively in the cropland than in the forest land the lower wyld in the cropland was significant at α 0 05 table 2 and occurred because of higher water loss from the crop et although topography also played an important role additionally the forest dominated watershed received more precipitation than the cropland dominated watershed fig 5 which would reduce et and increase wyld in the forest dominated watershed although the difference in precipitation between the cropland and forest land was statistically not significant based on the k s test table 2 3 2 future climate change impacts projected variations of the annual et wyld pet air temperature and precipitation over the future 50 year simulation period from 2021 to 2070 are shown in fig 6 no significant temporal trend of et was observed over the simulation period in both the crop and forest lands fig 6a and 6b although a significant increasing temporal trend of pet was found at the same simulation period and land uses fig 6e and 6f in general pet is a measure of the atmospheric ability to remove water from a surface through the processes of evaporation and transpiration when water supply is not a limiting factor which is positively correlated to air temperature as the air temperature increased fig 6g and 6 h the pet in both the crop and forest lands increased on the other hand et is the amount of water that is actual removed from the surface through the same processes that are controlled by water supply as the precipitation or water supply in this case had no statistically significant trend fig 6i and 6j so did the et in both the crop and forest lands results indicate that future climate change had a minimum effect on et in the yrb analogous to the case of et there was no significant temporal trend of wyld in the crop and forest lands over the future 50 years fig 6c and 5d this occurred primarily because there were no significant temporal trends of et fig 6a and 6b and precipitation fig 6i and 6j since the et and precipitation are the two major factors governing the wyld of watersheds results suggest that the future climate change would not affect annual wyld in the yrb fig 6 further reveals that there was a similar annual variation pattern between the wyld and the precipitation in the crop fig 6c vs fig 6i and forest fig 6d vs fig 6j lands a linear regression analysis shows the following two relationships 9 w y l d 470 1 05 p r e c i p i t a t i o n r 2 0 967 p 0 001 c r o p l a n d 10 w y l d 330 1 04 p r e c i p i t a t i o n r 2 0 951 p 0 001 f o r e s t l a n d with the very good r2 and low p values it is apparent that the annual wyld can be approximated from the annual precipitation comparisons of the future 50 year 2021 2070 annual averaged pet et air temperature wyld and precipitation between the crop and forest lands are shown in fig 7 similar to the case of the past 50 year annual averages fig 5 the future averages of the pet et and air temperature in the cropland were larger than those in the forest land fig 7 the future averages in the cropland and forest land were respectively 885 and 824 mm for pet 514 and 362 mm for et and 19 and 18 c for air temperature there were 7 4 and 41 99 more pet and et respectively in the cropland than in the forest land the differences between the cropland and forest land among the pet et and air temperature were statistically significant based on the k s test table 2 results show that over the next 50 years the cropland lost more water than that of the forest land through et this finding agreed to that of the past climate conditions due to the same reasons as described in section 3 2 fig 7 further reveals that the 50 year annual averaged wyld and precipitation were smaller in the cropland than in the forest land over the future 50 years more specifically the averages in the crop and forest lands were respectively 945 and 1141 mm for wyld and 1464 and 1527 mm for precipitation there were 20 7 wyld and 4 3 precipitation lower in the cropland than in the forest land although the difference was statistically significant for wyld but not for precipitation table 2 the lower wyld in the cropland primarily occurred because of higher et 3 3 past vs future climate impacts differences in 50 year annual averaged pet et air temperatures surface runoff wyld and precipitation between the past and future climate impacts can be inferred from figs 5 and 7 overall the averaged pet and et were larger under the past climate conditions than under the future climate conditions for the same land uses for example the averaged ets in the crop and forest lands were respectively 27 6 656 514 514 0 276 and 63 5 592 362 362 0 635 larger under the past climate than under the future climate conditions the differences were statistically significant with the k s test table 2 these findings contradicted to our consensus that the averaged et and pet will increase in watersheds as the future averaged air temperature and precipitation increase in this study while future averaged precipitation in both the crop and forest lands increased as compared to those of the past but not statistically significant table 2 the future averaged surface runoffs in both the crop and forest lands also increased as compared to those of the past statistically significant table 2 the annual averaged surface runoffs in the cropland and forest land were respectively 27 631 499 499 0 54 and 33 52 39 39 0 33 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions these larger future surface runoffs reduced soil water storage and provided less soil water for the future et the higher future surface runoffs in both the crop and forest lands could be the result of the larger number of precipitation days under the future climate than under the past climate conditions fig 8 in this study the number of precipitation days were the days when the precipitation events occurred regardless of their duration and intensity there were 59 i e 273 214 59 and 55 i e 254 199 55 more precipitation days respectively in the crop and forest lands under the future climate than under the past climate conditions additionally the lower monthly averaged solar radiation not significant table 2 and windspeed significant table 2 under the future climate conditions fig 8b also decreased the future pet and et as compared to those of the past fig 8a in contrast the opposite was true for the wyld and precipitation that is the 50 year annual averaged wyld and precipitation were larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions in the crop and forest lands for instance the averaged wylds in the crop and forest lands were respectively 32 9 and 26 9 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions parallel to the case of wyld the averaged precipitations in the crop and forest lands were respectively 5 6 and 4 3 larger under the future climate than under the past climate conditions this finding was consistent with the report that climate change resulted in precipitation anomaly in the contiguous 48 states of us with more extreme wet than dry conditions since 1990 us epa 2021 as the future precipitation increased and et decreased more wyld was produced in the yrb 4 conclusions no temporal trend of et was found under the long term past and future climate conditions but a significant increasing trend of et was observed in the recent 20 years 1997 to 2017 in both the crop and forest lands there were more et and less wyld in the cropland than in the forest land over the past 50 years 1966 1985 and future 50 years 2021 2070 in a long range the forest land reduced et and increased wyld as compared to those of the cropland in the yazoo river basin a humid subtropical region there was a very good linear relationship between the annual wyld and the annual precipitation in both the crop and forest lands and thus the annual wyld can be approximated from the annual precipitation the past and future annual average air temperatures were approximately 1 c cooler in the forest land than in the cropland the 50 year annual averaged pet and et were larger under the past climate than under the future climate conditions in both the crop and forest lands the possible reasons of this phenomenon are 1 the future number of precipitation days were larger than those of the past in the crop and forest lands which created the larger future surface water runoff and provided less water for et and 2 the solar radiation and windspeed under the future climate conditions were lower than those of the past which reduced the future pet as compared to that of the past the penman monteith method was used to estimate pet in this study recent reports show that this method may overestimate the et because it neglects the impact of atmospheric co2 concentrations under the non water stress conditions a higher atmospheric co2 concentration decreases water loss by reducing plant stomatal conductance yang et al 2019 further study is therefore warranted to tackle on this issue for a comprehensive understanding of land use impacts on et and wyld further study is warranted to synthesize the past studies on these two variables at different geographical and climate regions credit authorship contribution statement ying ouyang

3899,reliability of a water level ensemble prediction system wl eps is directly related to the quality of the available data and the processes integrated into each predictive layer in this project we evaluate a hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system h eps coupled to a hydraulic module hm developed on the chaudière river watershed in quebec canada ensemble streamflow forecasts account for the three main sources of uncertainty meteorology ensemble forecasts initial conditions through data assimilation and model structure multimodel the hm consists of a 1d river model that is informed at the boundary conditions by the h eps outputs in order to evaluate the forecasting system in an operational context a sampling procedure is implemented on the hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts in order to limit the simulation time of the hydraulic component without altering the description of the uncertainty provided beforehand forecasts reliability and accuracy are evaluated for events of various magnitude covering a wide range of flows based on performance metrics such as the reliability diagram and the continuous rank probability score crps overall results show that the performances of the ensemble flow and water level forecasts provided by the proposed system are quite reliable over the range of forecast horizons evaluated water level forecasts are dependent on the quality of the streamflow forecast which is coherent with the assumption that streamflow is the main source of uncertainty of the hm however at control point where flow and water level forecasts are available a slight deterioration in the forecast reliability is noted from flow to water level nonetheless the reliability of the forecasts remains comparable thus confirming the strong link between the h eps and hm uncertainties consideration of the uncertainty related to the roughness coefficient uncertainty turned out to have a negligible effect on the spread of the water level forecasts confirming once more the domination of the hydrologic uncertainty keywords flood forecasting hydrologic hydraulic modeling data uncertainty ensemble forecasts 1 introduction water level forecasting systems encompass many complex non linear physical processes acting at numerous spatial and temporal scales modeling these processes is a challenging task that requires propagating uncertainties all along a modelling chain from precipitation to catchment water flow and volume to river and lake levels many applications of water level forecasting systems are reported in literature their implementations vary on their purposes and the nature of the systems at hand for instance neural networks nn and deep learning dl models have been assessed to produce reliable water level forecasts in lakes for optimal resource management and to help maintain healthy ecosystems barzegar et al 2021 shang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 they were also considered for urban watersheds chang et al 2014 where the response time is particularly short and for coupling hydrologic and hydraulic models forced by meteorological radar precipitation liu et al 2021 machine learning strategies are interesting avenues but need a tremendous amount of training and validation data that are not always available especially for the hydraulic component of the forecasting chain water level forecasting for flood warning and mapping through coupled hydrologic hydraulic models are also explored in various configurations grimaldi et al 2013 lopes et al 2018 nguyen et al 2015 and as an integrated model lopes et al 2018 yet uncertainty propagation within the forecasting chain remains less explored barthélémy et al 2017 gomez et al 2019 xu et al 2017 important decisions are regularly made based on forecasts for flood risk management thereby helping authorities and the public in general to be better prepared against floods cloke and pappenberger 2009 gomez et al 2019 accuracy and reliability are key characteristics of the value of these prediction systems to society they directly depend on the quality of the available data on the description of the processes that are integrated into each predictive layer and on procedures that account for the many sources of uncertainty by predictive layer of a flood forecasting system we mean weather forecasting streamflow forecasting and water level forecasting as a solution ensemble prediction systems offer many outcomes for each predictive horizon in order to convey the overall uncertainty barthélémy et al 2017 liu et al 2017 thiboult et al 2016 a water level prediction system rests first on an accurate river model its implementation asks for a tremendous amount of data including river topography and bathymetry description of the hydraulic structures impairing the normal flow of the river land use data and substrate composition of the riverbed to map roughness coefficients as well as water level and flow time series to define the boundary and initial conditions of the model all that information carries errors that are often difficult to quantify since the observational uncertainty vary considerably over time and space bates et al 2014 the deployment of high resolution techniques such as lidar light detection and ranging is known to reduce topographic errors especially in urbanized floodplains as well as uncertainties in friction parameters delineation hunter et al 2008 the inflow time series at the boundary conditions are for most derived from rating curves whose accuracy depends also on a number of factors that induce interpolation and extrapolation errors domeneghetti et al 2012 the total error may then be as high as 20 of the observations pelletier 1988 all of these errors are critical in evaluating the model parameters e g roughness coefficients as calibration and validation are based on observed data bates et al 2014 furthermore in a forecasting context inflow at the boundary conditions is unknown so one has to resort to hydrological forecasts that themselves rest on weather forecasts bringing further uncertainties to the river model boundary conditions several studies addressed the quantification of uncertainties related to hydrologic forecasting processes promoting probabilistic forecasts barthélémy et al 2017 cloke and pappenberger 2009 giustarini et al 2011 gomez et al 2019 jordan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 matgen et al 2010 thiboult et al 2016 xu et al 2017 ensemble forecasts among other probabilistic approaches may account for input state and modelling uncertainties often only partially associated to each component of a prediction system the more complex a forecast system is the more sources of uncertainty are accounted for and the larger becomes the ensemble of probable outcomes thiboult et al 2016 information provided by larger ensembles typically help improve the quality of forecasts and lead to better decision making machete and smith 2016 as mentioned a water level prediction system is fed discharge forecasts issued by a hydrological prediction system that is itself fed weather forecasts issued by a meteorological prediction system several research projects

originate directly from a meteorological ensemble prediction system m eps gomez et al 2019 the use of several implementations parameters sets of the same hydrological model garcía pintado et al 2015 giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 or perturbations to the inflow data based on observations or rating curve errors garcía pintado et al 2013 this study aims to explore and assess in an operational perspective the propagation of uncertainty all along the predictive layers of a wl eps implemented in this case on the catchment of the chaudière river in the province of québec canada while trying to answer the following questions how do uncertainties propagate within the system from the weather to the water level how reliable is the wl eps explored in this study and how much its overall quality depends upon the h eps how relevant is the uncertainty associated to the hydraulic module hm for the wl eps to achieve these objectives we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a wl eps composed of a h eps and a 1d hm the h eps is built on the hoopla hydrological prediction laboratory framework developed by thiboult and anctil 2015 which has been validated on several catchments in the same region thiboult et al 2017 thiboult et al 2016 the h eps accounts for the three principal sources of hydrological uncertainty zappa et al 2011 1 weather uncertainty by resorting to ensemble precipitation and air temperature forecasts m eps 2 hydrological model uncertainty by resorting to multiple structurally different models thiboult et al 2016 and 3 initial conditions uncertainty of the catchment by resorting to a probabilistic data assimilation technique barthélémy et al 2017 garcía pintado et al 2015 2013 giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 moradkhani 2008

de lauzon hydrologic forcing is not the only potential source of uncertainty in wl eps since the river model and its implementation inevitably carry some uncertainty as well this issue was assessed in a previous study bessar et al 2020 using the same data and model but in simulation mode the updated model is calibrated using a set of adaptive factor relationships developed to depict the variation of the roughness coefficients as a function of flow focusing on ice free flood events for all segments of the river model bessar et al 2020 gomez et al 2019 xu et al 2017 the reliability of the

before joining the south shore of the st lawrence river near quebec city local climate is humid continental dfb according to köppen classification kottek et al 2006 daily averages oscillate from 18 8 c in july down to 12 0 c in january enabling the accumulation of snow and the formation of river ice hydrologic events are precipitation driven in spring and fall as well as temperature driven in spring leading to a nivo pluvial regime characterized by large spring freshets it is important to stress that the present study focuses exclusively on ice free flooding events along the quite flat 85 km river stretch from st georges de beauce to st lambert de lauzon for which a river model has been developed as part of a water level ensemble prediction system the river model is delimited upstream of saint georges de beauce by the sartigan mainstream and famine tributary flow gauging stations and by the saint lambert de lauzon station downstream all three stations are monitored by the quebec government sartigan station is located immediately downstream of an inline structure designed to limit river ice formation upstream of saint georges it drains 3074 km2 of which 25 is controlled by mégantic dam discharge consists of releases from mégantic lake 70 km upstream and inflows from intermediate catchments famine station reports discharge from the river that bares the same name 696 km2 prior to joining the chaudière river at saint georges de beauce beyond this location the chaudière river undergoes routing for more than 50 km along a reach characterized by low slopes 0 05 on average and extensive floodplains before reaching the model outlet at saint lambert de lauzon 5820 km2 discharge data at this location are used to estimate lateral inflows along the mainstream and to assess model outputs during calibration and validation the water level wl surveying network consists of five stations operated by the cobaric the local watershed organization located at cities along the reach observations are available since 2016 and relevant events wide flow range have been documented and used for model calibration and validation bessar et al 2020 2 1 water level ensemble prediction system the wl eps is composed of two layers a h eps built through the hoopla framework and a hm 1d hec ras river model that is informed by the h eps see fig 2 more details about each predictive layer are presented in the subsections below 2 2 hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system ensemble streamflow forecasts are produced specifically for the needs of the hm that is detailed below in a second step in order to explore the uncertainty of the water level forecasts it was deemed important to feed the hm with accurate and reliable forecasts as much as possible this is achieved by accounting for uncertainties related to the hydrologic model structure initial conditions of the catchment and meteorological forcing boelee et al 2019 thiboult et al 2016 zappa et al 2010 note that poulin et al 2011 confirmed that parameter uncertainty is typically small in comparison to structural uncertainty and may thus be disregarded the h eps is structured around the hoopla modular automatic framework thiboult et al 2019 that allows calibration simulation and forecasting at the time step and forecast horizon of the operator s choice the main strength of hoopla is that it can account for the three principal sources of uncertainty in this particular application hoopla exploits the ensemble weather forecasts precipitation and temperature issued each morning by the global ensemble prediction system geps of the canadian meteorological centre mai et al 2020 they consist of 20 members on a 0 5 degree grid extending up to two weeks into the future all 20 lumped hydrological models imbedded in hoopla are activated in order to depict structural uncertainty the selection was proposed by seiller et al 2012 building on an initial work by perrin et al 2001 with the objective of maximizing structural diversity while maintaining a common framework for usage simplicity most of the models are thus simplified lumped versions of the originals listed in table 1 multi modelling allows to estimate structural uncertainty by considering the responses of different models without relying on past errors of a single model and therefore avoids the constraint of model error stationarity thiboult et al 2017 all 20 models are calibrated and validated on sartigan famine and saint lambert de lauzon streamflow time series finally initial condition uncertainty is addressed through the enkf a probabilistic sequential data assimilation procedure indeed several studies have demonstrated that data assimilation improves the accuracy and reliability of forecasting systems by integrating the information contained in the observation while accounting for measurement uncertainty andreadis and schumann 2014 barthélémy et al 2017 garcía pintado et al 2015 2013 giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 moradkhani 2008 neal et al 2007 thiboult et al 2016 2017 thiboult and anctil 2015 the enkf evensen 2004 1994 updates the states of the hydrological model for each observation time step from a gaussian distribution of the measurement uncertainty the version encoded in hoopla follows recommendations from mandel 2006 this study opted for the hyper parameters identified for the same region and setup by thiboult and anctil 2015 fifty enkf members are issued at each time step all hydrological models share the same two inputs precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet fig 2 the latter is estimated from oudin s temperature t based formulation oudin et al 2005 the accumulation of solid precipitation on the ground and its subsequent melting is dealt with the cemaneige snow accounting routine valéry et al 2014 that adds two free parameters to the calibration of the hydrologic models in practice it means that cemaneige is calibrated 20 times indirectly accounting for some of the snow processes uncertainty cemaneige also brings some spatial heterogeneity to the hydrologic models as its degree day scheme in implemented on five altitudinal layers of equal area 2 3 hydraulic module the hm is built on hec ras brunner 2016 a modelling software widely used to address issues related to water level simulation and forecasting as well as floodplain delineation even if it is not the natural option for floodplain delineation the 1d implementation of saint venant equations has shown to be very efficient in model implementation computing time and real time operational forecasting costabile and macchione 2015 in practice the hm shares the hec ras unsteady implementation detailed in bessar et al 2020 a simplified diagram is illustrated in fig 3 the model geometry combines high precision lidar data and a bathymetry of the minor bed for the main sections of the model most hydraulic structures along the river are accounted for to reproduce the geometry of the chaudière river as accurately as possible 295 cross sections were extracted from the digital elevation model with an average distance of 300 m and higher density around urban centers hydraulic structures and rapids since the model geometry combines high precision lidar and bathymetric survey data of the minor bed topographic and bathymetric errors are assumed to be small and in good part compensated for by the roughness adjustments made during model calibration cea and french 2012 similarly the discretized model grid represents an approximation of the real terrain geometry whose uncertainty is partly absorbed by the friction parameterization the river model is informed directly at the upstream boundary conditions by 2 of the 3 ensemble streamflow forecasting stations famine and sartigan due to the lack of lateral inflow measurements these are estimated based on a simple volumetric approach using the forecasted hydrograph at the model outlet st lambert de lauzon and inflow hydrographs at the upstream boundary conditions as explained in bessar et al 2020 ensemble lateral inflow hydrographs are then generated based on the h eps outcomes at the forecasting stations and distributed directly at the saint victor tributary and uniformly along the river stream see fig 3 adaptive calibration is applied to improve hm performance and limit errors over flood events for all segments of the model for which water level observations are available an adaptive roughness coefficient relationship is sought based on multiple events linking roughness to flow nfaci f qi where nfac is the adaptive roughness factor applied to manning coefficient q is the flow and i is the index of the segment to which the relationship is associated bessar et al 2020 assuming that the main source of uncertainty in water level modelling is forcing data alemohammad et al 2015 barthélémy et al 2017 bessar et al 2020 dumedah and walker 2017 li et al 2016 maggioni et al 2012 we introduce the parametric uncertainty of the hm as an ensemble of possible adaptive roughness coefficients randomly generated based on a gaussian probability density function pdf with a mean value equal to calibrated nfac values and a standard deviation of 10 for each flow class and segment see fig 4 the standard deviation considered is coherent with the values used by xu et al 2017 around 8 11 and bessar et al 2020 as a result each selected member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts is associated with a set of random nfac q relationships generated for each segment of the river model 2 4 evaluation of the wl eps in contrast to hydrometeorological forecasting water level forecasting requires more time for its execution as an example and with the proposed implementation the h eps of the chaudière river provides a daily forecast with 20 000 members in only a few hours whereas for the hydraulic module it would take 2 weeks considering an average simulation time of 1 min per simulation with limited postprocessing hydrographs and maps running these forecasts in parallel may reduce this time substantially but the computing time remains important for large ensembles for example with 20 workers in parallel the simulation time can be reduced by up to 6 times in an operational context it is not feasible as the water level forecasts should be available on the same day otherwise it would be obsolete considering its short term nature up to 5 days in this instance in order to limit the size of the hm forcing data without altering the dispersion information provided by the h eps subsampling is implemented following the procedure proposed by bröcker 2012 in order to generate subsets of raw hydrologic ensembles while maintaining the mean continuous rank probability score mcrps the indices vector i of a sample of size m is determined by the general formula i n k 0 5 m where n is the size of the h eps raw ensembles and k 1 m in this study the targeted sample size m is 400 members drawn from the 20 000 member hydrologic forecasts in the same perspective of reducing computational time water level forecasts are only profitable when flood risks are present therefore we limit the study period to events with flood dynamics that exceed monitoring thresholds based on the trends of daily hydrometeorological forecasts for the period with observed water levels 2016 2020 six events of varying importance and covering a wide range of flows up to a 100 year flood at the model outlet have been selected these events are summarized in table 2 cumulating to 90 days of discharge forecasts and 76 to 79 days of water level forecasts depending on the station and the local availability of the observed data it is important to mention that the size of this forecasting sample is somewhat limited however the results will be representative of flood conditions for both forecasting layers h eps and hm the forecasting performance of the proposed system is evaluated at all locations where observation data are available sartigan famine and saint lambert de lauzon stations for the h eps and beauceville sainte marie and saint lambert de lauzon for the wl eps saint joseph and vallée jonction stations are excluded from this analysis as the observed data are sparse and restricted by a bottom threshold that limits the reported range to high water level values flow and water level forecasts are assessed based on a combination of common deterministic and probabilistic metrics anctil and ramos 2018 wilks 2011 deterministic metrics are computed on average ensemble values they include the bias percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse selected probabilistic metrics consist of the ssp mcrps and reliability diagrams they are computed on the full ensemble the ssp compares the square root of the average ensemble variance ensemble spread to the rmse providing a visual appreciation of accuracy and reliability fortin et al 2014 the crps provides an overall performance of the forecasts at each time step as it measures the quadratic distance between the cumulative distribution of the forecasts and the cumulative distribution of the observations hersbach 2000 the mcrps is the average crps value over a time series it is the probabilistic equivalent to the mae the mathematical proof of this equivalence may be found in baringhaus and franz 2004 and székely and rizzo 2005 a comparison of the mcrps and mae informs on the added value of an ensemble prediction system over its deterministic counterpart anctil and ramos 2018 finally reliability diagrams provide a visual assessment of the reliability since they display the relative frequency observed as a function of the forecast probability for which reliable predictions lead to a curve as close as possible to the diagonal considering that our sample is limited to larger events 90 forecasting days for q and 79 for wl we resorted to bootstrap to evaluate the confidence intervals of all our deterministic and probabilistic metrics for a better description of the system s accuracy and reliability as in velázquez et al 2010 to analyze all the proposed combinations of forcing data uncertainty and parametric uncertainty of the hm would be very demanding in terms of computational time hence the hm uncertainty is applied by pairing each member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts with a single set of nfac f q relations to assess the contribution of each predictive layer h eps and hm in the description of water level uncertainty the forecasts are carried separately using constant roughness factors and randomly generated ones the resulting spreads are then compared over lead times to illustrate the importance of the hm forcing data uncertainty provided by the h eps layer for further analysis the spread associated to a full combination of forcing data and hm uncertainty 400 members of the h eps 25 perturbed roughness factors is generated for a sample forecast 3 days of the 2019 spring flood and compared to the proposed wl eps implementation results 3 results and discussion the probabilistic water level forecasts are explored first using deterministic metrics calculated on the average value of the predictive distribution probabilistic scores are calculated second both make use of the full hydrologic predictive distribution 3 1 deterministic performance the deterministic performance is summarized in fig 5 for the considered events and each variable of interest q and wl from left to right are presented the bias pbias and rmse for the h eps top panels and the wl eps bottom panels each graph illustrates the evolution of the performance over lead times lt from 12 h up to day 5 for the h eps the bias and pbias scores reveal that the accuracy varies from station to station with a larger positive bias and pbias at st lambert de lauzon and sartigan and a negative bias at famine the pattern of the bias and pbias fluctuates over lt as it increases in absolute values for famine 0 to 15 decreases for st lambert de lauzon 5 to 2 5 and is quite stable at sartigan 1 to 2 5 except for lt 12 h where the pbias peaks at 10 this reveals that for sartigan and st lambert de lauzon the forecasts are overestimated for the first lt and the impact of data assimilation is perceived starting from day 1 these results are to be considered with caution as the analysis is based on selected events that represent a limited sample 90 days in total focusing on high flows over the last five years even if their bootstrap reveals narrow confidence intervals for their part rmse values tend to increase over lt for all streamflow forecasting stations and the magnitude varies depending on the catchment size and the forecasted values i e 150 250 m3 s at st lambert de lauzon 80 140 m3 s at sartigan and 30 55 m3 s at famine overall performance values of the h eps are quite satisfactory for the considered events the rmse for the ensemble mean of water level forecasts wl eps follows a similar trend at all sites as it increases over lt which makes sense since the further away from the initial time the greater the error and uncertainty bias and pbias values for the 3 monitoring stations are all positive and quite constant over lt for the considered events revealing a tendency to overestimate the water level actual values range between 0 05 m and 0 22 m which is deemed satisfactory for short term forecasts however rmse values are much higher and vary from 0 4 m to 0 7 m with more weight given to large errors as they are squared before being averaged it is also interesting to note that at saint lambert de lauzon the rmse on streamflow forecasts are the highest among the 3 stations but it does not reflect directly on the water level forecasts lowest rmse values even if the conveyed flow over the river stream depends highly on the estimated lateral inflows this shows that water levels at saint lambert de lauzon are less sensitive to streamflow forecast error than for the intermediate stations the sensitivity of the performance to sampling addressed here by calculating the 90 confidence intervals for each metric through bootstrap is small and barely noticeable in fig 5 grey areas the higher streamflow sensitivity at saint lambert de lauzon model outlet is explained by the higher flow values at this location as it drains the whole watershed at sainte marie the sensitivity of the forecasted water level bias and pbias illustrated in fig 5 is more likely related to the cross section profile where the floodplains represent around 80 of the width which influences the computed water levels more than at beauceville and saint lambert de lauzon where the sections are steep sided and overflows are rare if not absent even for high flows 3 2 probabilistic performance the accounted uncertainty of the forcing data provided by the h eps is meant to produce a spread that covers for the streamflow forecasting error rmse the ssp in fig 6 illustrate the evolution of the h eps spread and rmse at each control station as a function of lt the closer the two curves are to one another the better the ability of the forecasting system to describe the uncertainty reliability based on fig 6 top panels it may be noted that the spread is closer to the rmse for the first few lt but the distance between the two curves increases substantially from day 2 and on as the forecasts come to be less precise for streamflow and water levels spread increases over lt as uncertainty becomes higher but it does not match the rising rhythm of the rmse this means that the limited sequence of high flow ensemble forecasts available to the study is under dispersed a characteristic that will almost certainly be transmitted to the water level forecasts streamflow under dispersion culminates at famine with spread undershooting the rmse by 30 to 57 while this range is less than 32 at sartigan and 29 at st lambert de lauzon spread takes its full meaning on larger datasets as a greater number of realizations is less influenced by the misbehavior of some individual events thiboult et al 2016 nonetheless the available database 90 days for q and 79 for wl is deemed large enough to allow a correct description of the scores as revealed by the results of bootstrap procedure applied on the scores in fig 6 similar patterns exist in the water level forecasts fig 6 bottom panels for instance at beauceville the nearest wl monitoring station from the upstream flow boundary conditions famine and sartigan differences between the spread and rmse exceed 30 over lt at sainte marie and saint lambert the evolution of the under dispersion is quite similar over lt even if they are located at the lower part of the river model confirming that the under dispersed streamflows did translate into under dispersed water levels as probabilistic prediction carries more information than deterministic prediction it is common that the mcrps would be lower than the mae calculated on the mean of the predictive distribution at all lt anctil and ramos 2018 thiboult et al 2016 this behavior is confirmed in fig 7 which illustrates the evolution over lt of the mcrps gain over the mae dotted blue line for forecasted streamflow on the left and water level on the right for each control station curve lines here also the behavior is quite similar for streamflow and water level indicating again the strong link between them the added value or gain in of the mcprs over the mae is around 20 to 30 at all locations and it is quite stable at the start and end of the forecast which demonstrates the consistency of forecast quality over time reliability diagrams and their associated 90 confidence intervals are presented in figs 8 and 9 for streamflow and water level respectively from day 1 d1 to day 5 d5 at each location they are meant to complement the spread skill plots of fig 6 focusing strictly on reliability the streamflow predictive distributions are somehow under dispersed in fig 8 mainly at higher bins 50 and are quite invariant with lt the sample size is large enough to produce small bootstrap 90 confidence intervals under dispersion is more important for the water level predictive distributions at the beauceville and saint lambert de lauzon stations fig 9 which are close to the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the model respectively the water level forecasts at sainte marie station are also under dispersed and their reliability is comparable to saint lambert de lauzon and better than beauceville which is quite satisfying even though it depends on the quality of the forcing data and the lateral inflow forecasts derived from it as well as river model routing performance 3 3 contribution of the h eps and hm to the water level uncertainty as already mentioned to account for the hm parametric uncertainty and to compare its contribution to the description of the ensemble water level forecast simulations are made using constant and randomly generated roughness factors based on their related errors fig 10 compares the resulting spreads over lead times from 12 h to 5 days the two curves are perfectly aligned no differences are noticeable this reveals that according to the proposed configuration the contribution of the hm uncertainty is very small compared to that of the h eps forcing data this is confirmed again in fig 11 that compares a detailed combination of the hm parametric uncertainty to all members of the hydrometeorological forecast combined unc to the implementation proposed in our wl eps paired unc the evolution of the ensemble standard deviation for each issued forecast shows that the contribution of the hm parametric uncertainty is quite negligible compared to the one derived from streamflow forecast the only station where a slight difference 1 to 2 cm is noted is at sainte marie indicating that at this location water levels are more sensitive to the roughness for lower flow values however the curves paired and combined unc are overlapping for higher flow values at all locations and differences tend to be almost nil 4 conclusion in this study we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a wl eps for the chaudière river coupling a h eps and a hm the h eps is built on the hoopla framework and uses ensemble meteorological data from the canadian geps a multimodel hydrological processor and an enkf assimilation procedure to update the initial conditions the hm is a hec ras 1d river model that is informed by the ensemble streamflow forecasts at the upstream boundary conditions while the lateral inflows are derived from the forecasted hydrographs at the model outlet the parametric uncertainty of the hm is accounted for by perturbed adaptive roughness factors relationships for every segment of the river stream the main conclusions of this study are the h eps streamflow forecasts and the hm water level forecasts are strongly linked both forecasts are under dispersed and resulting spreads based on the accounted uncertainties and for the considered events are below the computed error rmse this under dispersion grows slightly from the hydrometeorological to the hydraulic layer but the reliability of the forecasts remains comparable at each predictive layer although the h eps is considering the main sources of uncertainty the streamflow forecasts depend on the quality of the weather forecasts which convey to the water level forecasts as well more events and larger samples will help further support those conclusions the evaluation of the wl eps proves that it is possible in an operational context to issue accurate ensemble water level forecasts by accounting for the main uncertainties associated with streamflow forecasts in the present application a relatively good reliability and accuracy were achieved despite the small size of our analyzed sample 90 days for the heps and 79 for the hm however the reliability of the water level forecasts is largely dependent on the quality of the h eps forecasts even if the water level forecasts are more under dispersed than streamflow forecasts the mcrps gain over mae are comparable if not better for the hm predictive layer which supports the proposed wl eps implementation as proposed in this study pairing each member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts with a set of adaptive roughness factors relationships to account for hm uncertainty proved to be quite effective and the reliability of the h eps forecasts is well conserved at the hm layer when compared individually the impact of the hm parametric uncertainty on the ensemble forecasts issued by the proposed implementation was negligible this confirms that the hm uncertainty contribution to the total water level uncertainty is extremely limited compared to that of forcing data furthermore the proposed pairing does not add to the overall computational cost compared to the combined uncertainty approach and thus represents an advantage in an operational forecasting perspective the under dispersed forecasts from the proposed wl eps implementation can be attributed to 1 the fact that the wl eps implementation does not account for all possible sources of uncertainty even if their impact on the results might be limited considering other sources may improve further the description of the uncertainty in addition the proposed framework resorts to some assumptions based on the state of the art and previous works that might be not fully applicable under other conditions 2 the sample size as a limited number of events inevitably increases the influence of wrong weather forecasts 3 challenging weather events for lumped hydrological models scattered or widespread precipitation sporadic thunderstorms as the performances differ for spring and summer fall events 4 the lack of data assimilation at the hm predictive layer as introducing such techniques to update the river model state based on observed water levels and or satellite derived products like the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission might further improve the reliability of the ensemble water level forecasts further investigations including sample size extension and applying this approach to other sites of different

3899,reliability of a water level ensemble prediction system wl eps is directly related to the quality of the available data and the processes integrated into each predictive layer in this project we evaluate a hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system h eps coupled to a hydraulic module hm developed on the chaudière river watershed in quebec canada ensemble streamflow forecasts account for the three main sources of uncertainty meteorology ensemble forecasts initial conditions through data assimilation and model structure multimodel the hm consists of a 1d river model that is informed at the boundary conditions by the h eps outputs in order to evaluate the forecasting system in an operational context a sampling procedure is implemented on the hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts in order to limit the simulation time of the hydraulic component without altering the description of the uncertainty provided beforehand forecasts reliability and accuracy are evaluated for events of various magnitude covering a wide range of flows based on performance metrics such as the reliability diagram and the continuous rank probability score crps overall results show that the performances of the ensemble flow and water level forecasts provided by the proposed system are quite reliable over the range of forecast horizons evaluated water level forecasts are dependent on the quality of the streamflow forecast which is coherent with the assumption that streamflow is the main source of uncertainty of the hm however at control point where flow and water level forecasts are available a slight deterioration in the forecast reliability is noted from flow to water level nonetheless the reliability of the forecasts remains comparable thus confirming the strong link between the h eps and hm uncertainties consideration of the uncertainty related to the roughness coefficient uncertainty turned out to have a negligible effect on the spread of the water level forecasts confirming once more the domination of the hydrologic uncertainty keywords flood forecasting hydrologic hydraulic modeling data uncertainty ensemble forecasts 1 introduction water level forecasting systems encompass many complex non linear physical processes acting at numerous spatial and temporal scales modeling these processes is a challenging task that requires propagating uncertainties all along a modelling chain from precipitation to catchment water flow and volume to river and lake levels many applications of water level forecasting systems are reported in literature their implementations vary on their purposes and the nature of the systems at hand for instance neural networks nn and deep learning dl models have been assessed to produce reliable water level forecasts in lakes for optimal resource management and to help maintain healthy ecosystems barzegar et al 2021 shang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 they were also considered for urban watersheds chang et al 2014 where the response time is particularly short and for coupling hydrologic and hydraulic models forced by meteorological radar precipitation liu et al 2021 machine learning strategies are interesting avenues but need a tremendous amount of training and validation data that are not always available especially for the hydraulic component of the forecasting chain water level forecasting for flood warning and mapping through coupled hydrologic hydraulic models are also explored in various configurations grimaldi et al 2013 lopes et al 2018 nguyen et al 2015 and as an integrated model lopes et al 2018 yet uncertainty propagation within the forecasting chain remains less explored barthélémy et al 2017 gomez et al 2019 xu et al 2017 important decisions are regularly made based on forecasts for flood risk management thereby helping authorities and the public in general to be better prepared against floods cloke and pappenberger 2009 gomez et al 2019 accuracy and reliability are key characteristics of the value of these prediction systems to society they directly depend on the quality of the available data on the description of the processes that are integrated into each predictive layer and on procedures that account for the many sources of uncertainty by predictive layer of a flood forecasting system we mean weather forecasting streamflow forecasting and water level forecasting as a solution ensemble prediction systems offer many outcomes for each predictive horizon in order to convey the overall uncertainty barthélémy et al 2017 liu et al 2017 thiboult et al 2016 a water level prediction system rests first on an accurate river model its implementation asks for a tremendous amount of data including river topography and bathymetry description of the hydraulic structures impairing the normal flow of the river land use data and substrate composition of the riverbed to map roughness coefficients as well as water level and flow time series to define the boundary and initial conditions of the model all that information carries errors that are often difficult to quantify since the observational uncertainty vary considerably over time and space bates et al 2014 the deployment of high resolution techniques such as lidar light detection and ranging is known to reduce topographic errors especially in urbanized floodplains as well as uncertainties in friction parameters delineation hunter et al 2008 the inflow time series at the boundary conditions are for most derived from rating curves whose accuracy depends also on a number of factors that induce interpolation and extrapolation errors domeneghetti et al 2012 the total error may then be as high as 20 of the observations pelletier 1988 all of these errors are critical in evaluating the model parameters e g roughness coefficients as calibration and validation are based on observed data bates et al 2014 furthermore in a forecasting context inflow at the boundary conditions is unknown so one has to resort to hydrological forecasts that themselves rest on weather forecasts bringing further uncertainties to the river model boundary conditions several studies addressed the quantification of uncertainties related to hydrologic forecasting processes promoting probabilistic forecasts barthélémy et al 2017 cloke and pappenberger 2009 giustarini et al 2011 gomez et al 2019 jordan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 matgen et al 2010 thiboult et al 2016 xu et al 2017 ensemble forecasts among other probabilistic approaches may account for input state and modelling uncertainties often only partially associated to each component of a prediction system the more complex a forecast system is the more sources of uncertainty are accounted for and the larger becomes the ensemble of probable outcomes thiboult et al 2016 information provided by larger ensembles typically help improve the quality of forecasts and lead to better decision making machete and smith 2016 as mentioned a water level prediction system is fed discharge forecasts issued by a hydrological prediction system that is itself fed weather forecasts issued by a meteorological prediction system several research projects

operational perspective the propagation of uncertainty all along the predictive layers of a wl eps implemented in this case on the catchment of the chaudière river in the province of québec canada while trying to answer the following questions how do uncertainties propagate within the system from the weather to the water level how reliable is the wl eps explored in this study and how much its overall quality depends upon the h eps how relevant is the uncertainty associated to the hydraulic module hm for the wl eps to achieve these objectives we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a wl eps composed of a h eps and a 1d hm the h eps is built on the hoopla hydrological prediction laboratory framework developed by thiboult and anctil 2015 which has been validated on several catchments in the same region thiboult et al 2017 thiboult et al 2016 the h eps accounts for the three principal sources of hydrological uncertainty zappa et al 2011 1 weather uncertainty by resorting to ensemble precipitation and air temperature forecasts m eps 2 hydrological model uncertainty by resorting to multiple structurally different models thiboult et al 2016 and 3 initial conditions

de lauzon hydrologic forcing is not the only potential source of uncertainty in wl eps since the river model and its implementation inevitably carry some uncertainty as well this issue was assessed in a previous study bessar et al 2020 using the same data and model but in simulation mode the updated model is calibrated using a set of adaptive factor relationships developed to depict the variation of the roughness coefficients as a function of flow focusing on ice free flood events for all segments of the river model bessar et al 2020 gomez et al 2019 xu et al 2017 the reliability of the

describes and discusses the wl eps most relevant results as well as the ensemble performance metric values the main conclusions form the last section 2 data and methods water level ensemble forecasts are issued for the lower reaches of the chaudière river which takes its source in mégantic lake southeastern quebec canada fig 1 the chaudière river extends over 200 km and drains a 6694 km2 watershed before joining the south shore of the st lawrence river near quebec city local climate is humid continental dfb according to köppen classification kottek et al 2006 daily averages oscillate from 18 8 c in july down to 12 0 c in january enabling the accumulation of snow and the formation of river ice hydrologic events are precipitation driven in spring and fall as well as temperature driven in spring leading to a nivo pluvial regime characterized by large spring freshets it is important to stress that the present study focuses exclusively on ice free flooding events along the quite flat 85 km river stretch from st georges de beauce to st lambert de lauzon for which a river model has been developed as part of a water level ensemble prediction system the river model is delimited upstream of saint georges de beauce by the sartigan mainstream and famine tributary flow gauging stations and by the saint lambert de lauzon station downstream all three stations are monitored by the quebec government sartigan station is located immediately downstream of an inline structure designed to limit river ice formation upstream of saint georges it drains 3074 km2 of which 25 is controlled by mégantic dam discharge consists of releases from mégantic lake 70 km upstream and inflows from intermediate catchments famine station reports discharge from the river that bares the same name 696 km2 prior to joining the chaudière river at saint georges de beauce beyond this location the chaudière river undergoes routing for more than 50 km along a reach characterized by low slopes 0 05 on average and extensive floodplains before reaching the model outlet at saint lambert de lauzon 5820 km2 discharge data at this location are used to estimate lateral inflows along the mainstream and to assess model outputs during calibration and validation the water level wl surveying network consists of five stations operated by the cobaric the local watershed organization located at cities along the reach observations are available since 2016 and relevant events wide flow range have been documented and used for model calibration and validation bessar et al 2020 2 1 water level ensemble prediction system the wl eps is composed of two layers a h eps built through the hoopla framework and a hm 1d hec ras river model that is informed by the h eps see fig 2 more details about each predictive layer are presented in the subsections below 2 2 hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system ensemble streamflow forecasts are produced specifically for the needs of the hm that is detailed below in a second step in order to explore the uncertainty of the water level forecasts it was deemed important to feed the hm with accurate and reliable forecasts as much as possible this is achieved by accounting for uncertainties related to the hydrologic model structure initial conditions of the catchment and meteorological forcing boelee et al 2019 thiboult et al 2016 zappa et al 2010 note that poulin et al 2011 confirmed that parameter uncertainty is typically small in comparison to structural uncertainty and may thus be disregarded the h eps is structured around the hoopla modular automatic framework thiboult et al 2019 that allows calibration simulation and forecasting at the time step and forecast horizon of the operator s choice the main strength of hoopla is that it can account for the three principal sources of uncertainty in this particular application hoopla exploits the ensemble weather forecasts precipitation and temperature issued each morning by the global ensemble prediction system geps of the canadian meteorological centre mai et al 2020 they consist of 20 members on a 0 5 degree grid extending up to two weeks into the future all 20 lumped hydrological models imbedded in hoopla are activated in order to depict structural uncertainty the selection was proposed by seiller et al 2012 building on an initial work by perrin et al 2001 with the objective of maximizing structural diversity while maintaining a common framework for usage simplicity most of the models are thus simplified lumped versions of the originals listed in table 1 multi modelling allows to estimate structural uncertainty by considering the responses of different models without relying on past errors of a single model and therefore avoids the constraint of model error stationarity thiboult et al 2017 all 20 models are calibrated and validated on sartigan famine and saint lambert de lauzon streamflow time series finally initial condition uncertainty is addressed through the enkf a probabilistic sequential data assimilation procedure indeed several studies have demonstrated that data assimilation improves the accuracy and reliability of forecasting systems by integrating the information contained in the observation while accounting for measurement uncertainty andreadis and schumann 2014 barthélémy et al 2017 garcía pintado et al 2015 2013 giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 moradkhani 2008 neal et al 2007 thiboult et al 2016 2017 thiboult and anctil 2015 the enkf evensen 2004 1994 updates the states of the hydrological model for each observation time step from a gaussian distribution of the measurement uncertainty the version encoded in hoopla follows recommendations from mandel 2006 this study opted for the hyper parameters identified for the same region and setup by thiboult and anctil 2015 fifty enkf members are issued at each time step all hydrological models share the same two inputs precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet fig 2 the latter is estimated from oudin s temperature t based formulation oudin et al 2005 the accumulation of solid precipitation on the ground and its subsequent melting is dealt with the cemaneige snow accounting routine valéry et al 2014 that adds two free parameters to the calibration of the hydrologic models in practice it means that cemaneige is calibrated 20 times indirectly accounting for some of the snow processes uncertainty cemaneige also brings some spatial heterogeneity to the hydrologic models as its degree day scheme in implemented on five altitudinal layers of equal area 2 3 hydraulic module the hm is built on hec ras brunner 2016 a modelling software widely used to address issues related to water level simulation and forecasting as well as floodplain delineation even if it is not the natural option for floodplain delineation the 1d implementation of saint venant equations has shown to be very efficient in model implementation computing time and real time operational forecasting costabile and macchione 2015 in practice the hm shares the hec ras unsteady implementation detailed in bessar et al 2020 a simplified diagram is illustrated in fig 3 the model geometry combines high precision lidar data and a bathymetry of the minor bed for the main sections of the model most hydraulic structures along the river are accounted for to reproduce the geometry of the chaudière river as accurately as possible 295 cross sections were extracted from the digital elevation model with an average distance of 300 m and higher density around urban centers hydraulic structures and rapids since the model geometry combines high precision lidar and bathymetric survey data of the minor bed topographic and bathymetric errors are assumed to be small and in good part compensated for by the roughness adjustments made during model calibration cea and french 2012 similarly the discretized model grid represents an approximation of the real terrain geometry whose uncertainty is partly absorbed by the friction parameterization the river model is informed directly at the upstream boundary conditions by 2 of the 3 ensemble streamflow forecasting stations famine and sartigan due to the lack of lateral inflow measurements these are estimated based on a simple volumetric approach using the forecasted hydrograph at the model outlet st lambert de lauzon and inflow hydrographs at the upstream boundary conditions as explained in bessar et al 2020 ensemble lateral inflow hydrographs are then generated based on the h eps outcomes at the forecasting stations and distributed directly at the saint victor tributary and uniformly along the river stream see fig 3 adaptive calibration is applied to improve hm performance and limit errors over flood events for all segments of the model for which water level observations are available an adaptive roughness coefficient relationship is sought based on multiple events linking roughness to flow nfaci f qi where nfac is the adaptive roughness factor applied to manning coefficient q is the flow and i is the index of the segment to which the relationship is associated bessar et al 2020 assuming that the main source of uncertainty in water level modelling is forcing data alemohammad et al 2015 barthélémy et al 2017 bessar et al 2020 dumedah and walker 2017 li et al 2016 maggioni et al 2012 we introduce the parametric uncertainty of the hm as an ensemble of possible adaptive roughness coefficients randomly generated based on a gaussian probability density function pdf with a mean value equal to calibrated nfac values and a standard deviation of 10 for each flow class and segment see fig 4 the standard deviation considered is coherent with the values used by xu et al 2017 around 8 11 and bessar et al 2020 as a result each selected member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts is associated with a set of random nfac q relationships generated for each segment of the river model 2 4 evaluation of the wl eps in contrast to hydrometeorological forecasting water level forecasting requires more time for its execution as an example and with the proposed implementation the h eps of the chaudière river provides a daily forecast with 20 000 members in only a few hours whereas for the hydraulic module it would take 2 weeks considering an average simulation time of 1 min per simulation with limited postprocessing hydrographs and maps running these forecasts in parallel may reduce this time substantially but the computing time remains important for large ensembles for example with 20 workers in parallel the simulation time can be reduced by up to 6 times in an operational context it is not feasible as the water level forecasts should be available on the same day otherwise it would be obsolete considering its short term nature up to 5 days in this instance in order to limit the size of the hm forcing data without altering the dispersion information provided by the h eps subsampling is implemented following the procedure proposed by bröcker 2012 in order to generate subsets of raw hydrologic ensembles while maintaining the mean continuous rank probability score mcrps the indices vector i of a sample of size m is determined by the general formula i n k 0 5 m where n is the size of the h eps raw ensembles and k 1 m in this study the targeted sample size m is 400 members drawn from the 20 000 member hydrologic forecasts in the same perspective of reducing computational time water level forecasts are only profitable when flood risks are present therefore we limit the study period to events with flood dynamics that exceed monitoring thresholds based on the trends of daily hydrometeorological forecasts for the period with observed water levels 2016 2020 six events of varying importance and covering a wide range of flows up to a 100 year flood at the model outlet have been selected these events are summarized in table 2 cumulating to 90 days of discharge forecasts and 76 to 79 days of water level forecasts depending on the station and the local availability of the observed data it is important to mention that the size of this forecasting sample is somewhat limited however the results will be representative of flood conditions for both forecasting layers h eps and hm the forecasting performance of the proposed system is evaluated at all locations where observation data are available sartigan famine and saint lambert de lauzon stations for the h eps and beauceville sainte marie and saint lambert de lauzon for the wl eps saint joseph and vallée jonction stations are excluded from this analysis as the observed data are sparse and restricted by a bottom threshold that limits the reported range to high water level values flow and water level forecasts are assessed based on a combination of common deterministic and probabilistic metrics anctil and ramos 2018 wilks 2011 deterministic metrics are computed on average ensemble values they include the bias percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse selected probabilistic metrics consist of the ssp mcrps and reliability diagrams they are computed on the full ensemble the ssp compares the square root of the average ensemble variance ensemble spread to the rmse providing a visual appreciation of accuracy and reliability fortin et al 2014 the crps provides an overall performance of the forecasts at each time step as it measures the quadratic distance between the cumulative distribution of the forecasts and the cumulative distribution of the observations hersbach 2000 the mcrps is the average crps value over a time series it is the probabilistic equivalent to the mae the mathematical proof of this equivalence may be found in baringhaus and franz 2004 and székely and rizzo 2005 a comparison of the mcrps and mae informs on the added value of an ensemble prediction system over its deterministic counterpart anctil and ramos 2018 finally reliability diagrams provide a visual assessment of the reliability since they display the relative frequency observed as a function of the forecast probability for which reliable predictions lead to a curve as close as possible to the diagonal considering that our sample is limited to larger events 90 forecasting days for q and 79 for wl we resorted to bootstrap to evaluate the confidence intervals of all our deterministic and probabilistic metrics for a better description of the system s accuracy and reliability as in velázquez et al 2010 to analyze all the proposed combinations of forcing data uncertainty and parametric uncertainty of the hm would be very demanding in terms of computational time hence the hm uncertainty is applied by pairing each member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts with a single set of nfac f q relations to assess the contribution of each predictive layer h eps and hm in the description of water level uncertainty the forecasts are carried separately using constant roughness factors and randomly generated ones the resulting spreads are then compared over lead times to illustrate the importance of the hm forcing data uncertainty provided by the h eps layer for further analysis the spread associated to a full combination of forcing data and hm uncertainty 400 members of the h eps 25 perturbed roughness factors is generated for a sample forecast 3 days of the 2019 spring flood and compared to the proposed wl eps implementation results 3 results and discussion the probabilistic water level forecasts are explored first using deterministic metrics calculated on the average value of the predictive distribution probabilistic scores are calculated second both make use of the full hydrologic predictive distribution 3 1 deterministic performance the deterministic performance is summarized in fig 5 for the considered events and each variable of interest q and wl from left to right are presented the bias pbias and rmse for the h eps top panels and the wl eps bottom panels each graph illustrates the evolution of the performance over lead times lt from 12 h up to day 5 for the h eps the bias and pbias scores reveal that the accuracy varies from station to station with a larger positive bias and pbias at st lambert de lauzon and sartigan and a negative bias at famine the pattern of the bias and pbias fluctuates over lt as it increases in absolute values for famine 0 to 15 decreases for st lambert de lauzon 5 to 2 5 and is quite stable at sartigan 1 to 2 5 except for lt 12 h where the pbias peaks at 10 this reveals that for sartigan and st lambert de lauzon the forecasts are overestimated for the first lt and the impact of data assimilation is perceived starting from day 1 these results are to be considered with caution as the analysis is based on selected events that represent a limited sample 90 days in total focusing on high flows over the last five years even if their bootstrap reveals narrow confidence intervals for their part rmse values tend to increase over lt for all streamflow forecasting stations and the magnitude varies depending on the catchment size and the forecasted values i e 150 250 m3 s at st lambert de lauzon 80 140 m3 s at sartigan and 30 55 m3 s at famine overall performance values of the h eps are quite satisfactory for the considered events the rmse for the ensemble mean of water level forecasts wl eps follows a similar trend at all sites as it increases over lt which makes sense since the further away from the initial time the greater the error and uncertainty bias and pbias values for the 3 monitoring stations are all positive and quite constant over lt for the considered events revealing a tendency to overestimate the water level actual values range between 0 05 m and 0 22 m which is deemed satisfactory for short term forecasts however rmse values are much higher and vary from 0 4 m to 0 7 m with more weight given to large errors as they are squared before being averaged it is also interesting to note that at saint lambert de lauzon the rmse on streamflow forecasts are the highest among the 3 stations but it does not reflect directly on the water level forecasts lowest rmse values even if the conveyed flow over the river stream depends highly on the estimated lateral inflows this shows that water levels at saint lambert de lauzon are less sensitive to streamflow forecast error than for the intermediate stations the sensitivity of the performance to sampling addressed here by calculating the 90 confidence intervals for each metric through bootstrap is small and barely noticeable in fig 5 grey areas the higher streamflow sensitivity at saint lambert de lauzon model outlet is explained by the higher flow values at this location as it drains the whole watershed at sainte marie the sensitivity of the forecasted water level bias and pbias illustrated in fig 5 is more likely related to the cross section profile where the floodplains represent around 80 of the width which influences the computed water levels more than at beauceville and saint lambert de lauzon where the sections are steep sided and overflows are rare if not absent even for high flows 3 2 probabilistic performance the accounted uncertainty of the forcing data provided by the h eps is meant to produce a spread that covers for the streamflow forecasting error rmse the ssp in fig 6 illustrate the evolution of the h eps spread and rmse at each control station as a function of lt the closer the two curves are to one another the better the ability of the forecasting system to describe the uncertainty reliability based on fig 6 top panels it may be noted that the spread is closer to the rmse for the first few lt but the distance between the two curves increases substantially from day 2 and on as the forecasts come to be less precise for streamflow and water levels spread increases over lt as uncertainty becomes higher but it does not match the rising rhythm of the rmse this means that the limited sequence of high flow ensemble forecasts available to the study is under dispersed a characteristic that will almost certainly be transmitted to the water level forecasts streamflow under dispersion culminates at famine with spread undershooting the rmse by 30 to 57 while this range is less than 32 at sartigan and 29 at st lambert de lauzon spread takes its full meaning on larger datasets as a greater number of realizations is less influenced by the misbehavior of some individual events thiboult et al 2016 nonetheless the available database 90 days for q and 79 for wl is deemed large enough to allow a correct description of the scores as revealed by the results of bootstrap procedure applied on the scores in fig 6 similar patterns exist in the water level forecasts fig 6 bottom panels for instance at beauceville the nearest wl monitoring station from the upstream flow boundary conditions famine and sartigan differences between the spread and rmse exceed 30 over lt at sainte marie and saint lambert the evolution of the under dispersion is quite similar over lt even if they are located at the lower part of the river model confirming that the under dispersed streamflows did translate into under dispersed water levels as probabilistic prediction carries more information than deterministic prediction it is common that the mcrps would be lower than the mae calculated on the mean of the predictive distribution at all lt anctil and ramos 2018 thiboult et al 2016 this behavior is confirmed in fig 7 which illustrates the evolution over lt of the mcrps gain over the mae dotted blue line for forecasted streamflow on the left and water level on the right for each control station curve lines here also the behavior is quite similar for streamflow and water level indicating again the strong link between them the added value or gain in of the mcprs over the mae is around 20 to 30 at all locations and it is quite stable at the start and end of the forecast which demonstrates the consistency of forecast quality over time reliability diagrams and their associated 90 confidence intervals are presented in figs 8 and 9 for streamflow and water level respectively from day 1 d1 to day 5 d5 at each location they are meant to complement the spread skill plots of fig 6 focusing strictly on reliability the streamflow predictive distributions are somehow under dispersed in fig 8 mainly at higher bins 50 and are quite invariant with lt the sample size is large enough to produce small bootstrap 90 confidence intervals under dispersion is more important for the water level predictive distributions at the beauceville and saint lambert de lauzon stations fig 9 which are close to the upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the model respectively the water level forecasts at sainte marie station are also under dispersed and their reliability is comparable to saint lambert de lauzon and better than beauceville which is quite satisfying even though it depends on the quality of the forcing data and the lateral inflow forecasts derived from it as well as river model routing performance 3 3 contribution of the h eps and hm to the water level uncertainty as already mentioned to account for the hm parametric uncertainty and to compare its contribution to the description of the ensemble water level forecast simulations are made using constant and randomly generated roughness factors based on their related errors fig 10 compares the resulting spreads over lead times from 12 h to 5 days the two curves are perfectly aligned no differences are noticeable this reveals that according to the proposed configuration the contribution of the hm uncertainty is very small compared to that of the h eps forcing data this is confirmed again in fig 11 that compares a detailed combination of the hm parametric uncertainty to all members of the hydrometeorological forecast combined unc to the implementation proposed in our wl eps paired unc the evolution of the ensemble standard deviation for each issued forecast shows that the contribution of the hm parametric uncertainty is quite negligible compared to the one derived from streamflow forecast the only station where a slight difference 1 to 2 cm is noted is at sainte marie indicating that at this location water levels are more sensitive to the roughness for lower flow values however the curves paired and combined unc are overlapping for higher flow values at all locations and differences tend to be almost nil 4 conclusion in this study we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of a wl eps for the chaudière river coupling a h eps and a hm the h eps is built on the hoopla framework and uses ensemble meteorological data from the canadian geps a multimodel hydrological processor and an enkf assimilation procedure to update the initial conditions the hm is a hec ras 1d river model that is informed by the ensemble streamflow forecasts at the upstream boundary conditions while the lateral inflows are derived from the forecasted hydrographs at the model outlet the parametric uncertainty of the hm is accounted for by perturbed adaptive roughness factors relationships for every segment of the river stream the main conclusions of this study are the h eps streamflow forecasts and the hm water level forecasts are strongly linked both forecasts are under dispersed and resulting spreads based on the accounted uncertainties and for the considered events are below the computed error rmse this under dispersion grows slightly from the hydrometeorological to the hydraulic layer but the reliability of the forecasts remains comparable at each predictive layer although the h eps is considering the main sources of uncertainty the streamflow forecasts depend on the quality of the weather forecasts which convey to the water level forecasts as well more events and larger samples will help further support those conclusions the evaluation of the wl eps proves that it is possible in an operational context to issue accurate ensemble water level forecasts by accounting for the main uncertainties associated with streamflow forecasts in the present application a relatively good reliability and accuracy were achieved despite the small size of our analyzed sample 90 days for the heps and 79 for the hm however the reliability of the water level forecasts is largely dependent on the quality of the h eps forecasts even if the water level forecasts are more under dispersed than streamflow forecasts the mcrps gain over mae are comparable if not better for the hm predictive layer which supports the proposed wl eps implementation as proposed in this study pairing each member of the ensemble streamflow forecasts with a set of adaptive roughness factors relationships to account for hm uncertainty proved to be quite effective and the reliability of the h eps forecasts is well conserved at the hm layer when compared individually the impact of the hm parametric uncertainty on the ensemble forecasts issued by the proposed implementation was negligible this confirms that the hm uncertainty contribution to the total water level uncertainty is extremely limited compared to that of forcing data furthermore the proposed pairing does not add to the overall computational cost compared to the combined uncertainty approach and thus represents an advantage in an operational forecasting perspective the under dispersed forecasts from the proposed wl eps implementation can be attributed to 1 the fact that the wl eps implementation does not account for all possible sources of uncertainty even if their impact on the results might be limited considering other sources may improve further the description of the uncertainty in addition the proposed framework resorts to some assumptions based on the state of the art and previous works that might be not fully applicable under other conditions 2 the sample size as a limited number of events inevitably increases the influence of wrong weather forecasts 3 challenging weather events for lumped hydrological models scattered or widespread precipitation sporadic thunderstorms as the performances differ for spring and summer fall events 4 the lack of data assimilation at the hm predictive layer as introducing such techniques to update the river model state based on observed water levels and or satellite derived products like the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot mission might further improve the reliability of the ensemble water level forecasts further investigations including sample size extension and applying this approach to other sites of different
