9035,supplementary irrigation area in north china is an important agricultural production area but water shortages have limited the agricultural production considerably irrigation is required to ensure crop yield during growth seasons with variable rainfall most irrigation schedules are based on typical meteorological years however it is very difficult to predict the meteorological information of irrigation year in advance which limits the planning of irrigation schedules therefore taking the central part of shanxi province supplementary irrigation area as an example this study focuses on the optimal irrigation decision making method of supplementary irrigation area the irrigation schedule of summer maize from 1970 to 2020 was firstly optimized by using dssat model and genetic algorithm on this basis a decision making method based on the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative etc between plantation date to the current date to determine the irrigation time is developed the results indicated that using p etc the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative crop water requirement as the criterion leads to superior decision making two supplementary irrigation events can meet the growth demand of summer maize irrigation events decisions were made on days 44 and 58 after summer maize sowing the accuracy of this method for two irrigation events decisions is 82 35 and 86 27 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 84 31 at the same time a support vector machine algorithm is used to make decisions about irrigation comparing the decision accuracy with the results of the decision method proposed in this paper the accuracy of the support vector machine decisions for the first and second irrigation events was 82 35 and 80 40 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 81 40 the decision model was also superior to that involving support vector machine algorithms for the irrigation decision of summer maize can be used for irrigation decision making in similar supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall keywords dssat model supplementary irrigation areas irrigation schedule decision support genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the central part of shanxi is the important grain producing area in china agricultural production in this area is limited by shortages of water resources in addition affected by the monsoon climate rainfall during the growing season of crops sown in the summer is variable from 1970 2020 the maximum and minimum rainfall were 575 8 and 154 3 mm respectively and the average rainfall was 320 7 mm supplementary irrigation is thus required to ensure food production wang 2012 jiang et al 2016 efficient irrigation water management is crucial for the sustainable development of water resources in central shanxi and the irrigation system must be optimized the traditional optimal irrigation schedule is determined through field experiments zhang et al 2006 2018 2020 hammad et al 2015 however field experiments are time consuming and laborious and the effects of irrigation and fertilization date and quantity on crop growth are difficult to quantify under various climate conditions and for each crop genotype soil type and agronomic measure across years and regions chen et al 2020 a combination of farmland experiments and crop model simulations has been widely used to determine irrigation plans and increase efficiency he et al 2013 jones et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 as a research and decision making tool for crop production and resource management the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat has been used extensively yang et al 2013 mourice et al 2014 qu et al 2019 mukand et al 2019 attia et al 2016 used the dssat ceres wheat model to simulate the effects of irrigation management in texas on winter wheat biomass yield and water use efficiency wue kisekka et al 2016 used the ceres maize model and long term weather series data to identify the optimal irrigation strategy for maize production in kansas under insufficient irrigation conditions jiang et al 2016 researched the irrigation area in the yingke oasis in the middle reaches of the heihe river and used the dssat maize model to determine the optimal irrigation strategy for maize under various climatic conditions gohain et al 2021 used dssat csm to spatially simulate crop water stress in rainy season sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench from 2000 to 2018 in 10 districts of maharashtra india and effectively determined crop water stress for different crop phenological stages and different sowing dates rugira et al 2021 applied the dssat maize model to optimize irrigation management and sowing schedules in the loess plateau fenhe river basin and ensure the stability of the spring maize yield kipkulei 2022 conducted a multiseason calibration and evaluation of the dssat ceres maize model to assess the maize yield response of two common cultivars grown in trans nzoia county in kenya under various agricultural strategies such as sowing dates nitrogen fertilization and water management with the development of computer science combining crop models with optimization algorithms has become an effective method of optimizing crop irrigation schedules song et al 2018 optimized the irrigation schedule of spring wheat by using the aquacrop model and improved the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii liu yang 2021 constructed a distributed aquacrop model and multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii for simulation optimization to formulate effective irrigation plans these studies can effectively optimize the irrigation schedule based on existing meteorological scenarios the above studies of irrigation schedule optimization are all based on a specified meteorological year for decision making the specified meteorological year can be used as a study of the irrigation process to meet the needs of designing irrigation districts however in practice it is difficult to predict rainfall scenarios for the entire crop reproductive period and there are difficulties when irrigation decisions optimized on the basis of the meteorological year are used to guide irrigation in a particular year therefore developing a comprehensive decision making method for intra seasonal irrigation is vital in supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall he et al 2011 araya et al 2015 jha et al 2019 point at above problems this study evaluated the applicability of dssat to simulate the growth of summer maize in central shanxi by using measured data to validate and calibrate the model and combines the model with a genetic algorithm to optimize the irrigation schedule of summer maize for the period 1970 2020 on the basis this study proposes an irrigation decision making method based on the cumulative rainfall p threshold the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative crop water requirement p etc in summer maize growing season the purpose is to provide a basis for irrigation decision making in similar supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experiment was conducted in dong an village guangsheng town linfen city shanxi province china 36 17 n 111 46 e 529 m above sea level the area has a warm continental climate with the meteorological characteristics shown in table 1 the soil is sandy loam usda standard the physical and chemical parameters of the 0 100 cm soil profile are shown in table 2 where 20 cm is used as a layer the field experiment on summer maize was conducted between 2018 and 2019 the most commonly planted variety of summer maize in the study area zongheng 836 was planted manually the sowing depth was 5 cm the sowing amount was 60 000 plants hm 2 the row spacing was 60 cm and the plant spacing was 28 cm various irrigation and nitrogen conditions were applied during the experiment the source of irrigation water was well water and the volume was controlled using a water

and irrigation date are shown in table 3 the application rates of the phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were the same in each treatment 90 and 120 kg hm 2 respectively the planting dates were june 12 2018 and june 16 2019 and the harvest dates were october 8 2018 and october 1 2019 respectively 2 2 experimental indicators and methods the field experiment was conducted to observe the phenological period aboveground biomass yield and leaf area index of summer maize which were used to calibrate and validate the parameters of the dssat ceres maize model a phenological period in the classic zadoks et al 1974 division method the growth season is the period in which 50 of the plants enter a specific growth stage the growth season of summer maize is divided into seedling jointing tasseling filling and harvest stages b soil water content the soil water content was measured using the drying method the depth of the measured soil layer was 100 cm and the thickness of one layer was set to 20 cm the experimental summer maize was measured at each growth stage once every 10 days c leaf area measured manually with a tape measure at each growth stage once every 7 days the maximum length and width of the summer maize leaves were measured and the leaf area index during each growth stage was calculated using eq 1 mckee 1964 1 l a i 0 75 ρ i 1 n a i b i where lai is the summer maize leaf area index 0 75 is the leaf area regression coefficient related to leaf shape ρ is the summer maize planting density 60 000 plants per hectare a i is the leaf length for summer maize m b i is the maximum leaf width for summer maize m and n is the number of leaves per summer maize plant d aboveground biomass measured by randomly selecting three summer maize plants from each experimental plot cutting off the aboveground part placing it in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and drying it to a constant weight at 75 c the dry weight represented the aboveground biomass e grain yield during the harvest of summer maize 30 ears of maize were randomly selected from each plot and dried naturally after threshing with a small thresher subsequently the water content of the samples was measured with a moisture analyzer lds 1 h hangzhou china each treatment was applied in triplicate and the average value from the three measurements was used the yield under a standard water content 14 was the final grain yield for summer maize 2 3 dssat ceres maize model the dssat ceres maize model is a module used to simulate maize growth and development in daily increments jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 it has been widely used for yield simulation irrigation schedule optimization and crop yield reduction risk assessment rugira et al 2021 menefee et al 2021 the model includes a series of non linear mechanistic equations to characterise the response of maize growth and yield formation processes to the dynamics of soil moisture and fertilizer content on a day by day basis in addition the model is driven by daily meteorological data and is able to quantify the effects of field management practices on maize growth and development in the dssat model the crop development process is simulated using a cumulative temperature equation that uses the crop to accumulate dry mass by daily photosynthetic fixation of biomass the model calculates the proportion of accumulated photosynthetic assimilates per day for different organs of the crop based on photosynthetic assimilates at each stage of reproduction and thus simulates the final yield where the magnitude of the incremental dry matter mass allocation depends on the amount of effective photosynthetic radiation intercepted by the crop canopy the soil moisture simulation module is based on the water balance principle and uses a one dimensional bucket turning method to calculate daily changes in the water content of the soil layer due to rainfall and irrigation infiltration vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and root uptake processes the basic principle of the dssat model for calculating water stress is to regulate crop water uptake and photosynthetic efficiency by comparing the magnitude of the relationship between crop water demand potential evapotranspiration and potential root water uptake under adequate irrigation conditions potential root water uptake is greater than the crop s water requirements however as soil water is gradually lost through crop transpiration and root uptake potential root uptake decreases the first water stress factor swdf1 occurs when a threshold is reached at some stage the second stress factor swdf2 occurs when crop water demand exceeds potential root water uptake and affects final crop biomass formation and leaf spreading the dssat ceres model simulates the effects of water stress on different growth stages of summer maize by adjusting different water stress factors based on the above theoretical studies the moisture stress factors were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 s w d f 1 w s p r w u e p e p 0 3 s w d f 2 w s p e p 0 where swdf1 is the first water stress factor of the crop model wsp is the potential root water uptake mm rwuep is a characteristic parameter of the species ep0 is the crop water requirement mm and swdf2 is the second water stress factor of the crop model the required data sets of the dssat model are meteorological data soil data field management data and genotype parameters 2 3 1 data sources the meteorological data required by dssat are daily maximum temperature t max c minimum

for details the maximum rooting depth used in the simulations was 120 cm 2 3 2 genotype parameters in this study the phenological period yield aboveground biomass and leaf area index were used to calibrate the six genotype parameters of summer maize and the range of parameter values was shown in table 4 shen et al 2020 a genetic algorithm was used for parameter calibration shen et al 2021 2 3

respectively 2 4 establishment and solution method of irrigation schedule optimization model 2 4 1 establishment of irrigation schedule optimization model to optimize the irrigation schedule in central shanxi province from 1970 to 2020 the potential yield of summer maize was first obtained by dssat model simulation the dssat model s water and nitrogen stress functions needed to be switched off when simulating potential summer maize yields with comprehensive consideration of these three indexes maximum relative yield was set as the optimization goal and irrigation date wue and nue were constraints the decision variables were irrigation date days after sowing and number of supplementary irrigation events a maximum of three supplementary irrigation events can be used the local border irrigation quota was used and the conventional irrigation amount is 75 mm the interval between any two irrigation dates was at least 10 days the fertilization amount was 180 kg hm 2 consistent with the amount conventionally applied in the region the optimization objective and constraints are as follows objective function 8 max y r y y p constraints 9 d i 1 d i d i 1 10 w u e β 1 w u e p 11 n u e β 2 n u e p where y and yp are optimized crop yield and potential yield respectively kg hm 2 yr is relative yield wue and wuep are optimized water use efficiency and potential water use efficiency respectively kg mm 1 nue and nuep are optimized nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency and potential nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency respectively kg kg 1 di is the time of the i th irrigation after sowing day β1and β2 is the ratio factor that guarantees the maximum wue and nue use efficiency that can be obtained for different climatic years 2 4 2 solution method of irrigation schedule optimization model to avoid the conflict between the previous irrigation and the later irrigation and reduce the redundancy of coding the following special hybrid coding method was adopted according to farming experience three supplementary irrigation events shall be considered at most during the growth period of summer maize each irrigation interval is expressed as a subsegment within a long time period and the lengths of different subsegments are expressed as l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively fig 2a for reducing the infeasible solution the ratio factors α1 α2 and α3 which reflect the length of irrigation interval are used as decision variables for coding in order to ensure the effectiveness of irrigation no irrigation for 30 days after sowing and 10 days before harvest and the interval of each irrigation is at least 10 days if the interval is less than 10 days which automatically changed to 10 days in fig 2a α1 represents the proportional factor between the interval length from the sowing date to the first irrigation date l1 and the length of whole growth period lb when decoding the subsegment the product of the length of remaining growth period lb l1 and α2 is taken as the length of the second sub segment these principles can be followed for additional irrigation interval integer coding is adopted for number of supplementary irrigation events and real coding is adopted for irrigation time respectively the irrigation interval is taken as an integer for agricultural practice therefore during decoding the calculated time value is rounded the encoding form is shown in fig 2b after the calculation accuracy and efficiency were weighted the number of individuals in the population was 50 and the evolutionary algorithm had 100 generations i t is used to represent the number of supplementary irrigation events the optimization process of irrigation schedule is shown in fig 3 2 5 irrigation decision model based on rainfall and etc 2 5 1 model construction and solution method rainfall and evaporation strongly affect irrigation decision making during growth seasons determining the irrigation schedule is crucial when the meteorological conditions of a certain growth season are unknown therefore this study used the rainfall during various period of the summer maize growth season and p etc as two criteria to determine the irrigation schedule the rainfall or p etc threshold for whether to irrigate or not was determined using yearly data the formula for calculating the etc is as follows 12 e t c k c e t 0 where kc denotes the crop coefficient and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the penman monteith formula recommended by the fao allen richard et al 1998 fig 4 presents the process of optimizing decision making with t 1 and t 2 as the thresholds for the first and second irrigation date after sowing p lim1 p lim2 and p lim3 are the thresholds of each irrigation p lim1 is the first irrigation threshold if cumulative rainfall or p etc p 1 of days 0 t 1 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise irrigation will not be applied the second irrigation event decision is influenced by the outcome of the first irrigation decision plim2 is the threshold value of cumulative rainfall or p etc for the second irrigation event decision when the first irrigation event has not occurred when cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise no irrigation will be applied plim3 is the threshold value of cumulative rainfall or p etc for the decision on the second irrigation event when the first irrigation event occurs when cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise no irrigation will be applied these principles can be followed for additional scenarios the pseudo code is shown in table 5 determining the statistical time t 1 t 2 and decision threshold p lim1 p lim2 p lim3 for fractional irrigation with reference to cumulative rainfall or p etc is essential therefore this study used a genetic algorithm to optimize the multiyear irrigation decision accuracy as a fitness function when an irrigation decision is made the irrigation decision is considered correct for that year if the irrigation results obtained from the decision are consistent with the optimization results in section 2 4 the proportion of consistent irrigation results the percentage of years in which the decision is correct across all years is taken as the fitness function of the model decisions to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this method a support vector machine in matlab 2018b classification learner toolbox was used to make decisions about irrigation and to compare the accuracy of the two decision methods the fitness function for irrigation decisions based on support vector machines is consistent with the proposed decision model fitness function which pursues the highest irrigation decision accuracy 2 5 2 evaluation of irrigation decision model to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision making method dssat was used to compare the differences in yield wue and nue between the schedule determined using the decision making model and that optimized in section 2 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of dssat model summer maize genotypic parameters must be calibrated to ensure the accuracy of model simulation yield and phenological period for treatment t1 in 2018 and 2019 were used in this study to calibrate the genotypic parameters of ceres maize table 6 the model was validated using yield and phenological stage of treatments t2 t3 and t4 in 2018 and 2019 leaf area index and 0 40 cm soil water content of all treatments in 2018 and 2019 the simulated anthesis date maturity date and yield of summer maize matched well with the observed values and nrmse was less than 20 table 7 to further evaluate the reliability of the model parameters the phenological dates and yield of the t2 t3 and t4 treatments in 2018 and 2019 leaf area index and soil water content of all treatments in 2018 and 2019 were verified table 8 figs 5 6 table 8 shows the simulated flowering date maturity date and yield fig 5 show the simulated leaf area index and fig 6 show the simulated soil water content simulated and measured values of nrmse for the above indicators were less than 20 for the treatments in 2018 and 2019 these results indicate that the calibrated and validated dssat ceres maize model can accurately simulate crop growth béchir et al 2000 patrick et al 2021 kipkulei et al 2022 3 2 optimization results of irrigation schedule over the years the optimization results of summer maize irrigation schedule over the years based on relative yield and considering wue and nue are shown in table 9 when determining wuep and nuep single objective optimization is carried out with them as the objectives respectively and the model and solution method are similar to the section 2 4 and fig 3 in the single objective optimization the constraints eqs 10 and 11 and the corresponding infeasibility ifd of the solution method are not considered after consideration the value of β1 and β2 is set at 0 9 and the value range of α1 α2 and α3 is set at 0 2 0 8 analyzing the optimal irrigation schedule over the years in table 9 two supplementary irrigation events provide sufficient water for growth in the growing season there are inter annual differences in both precipitation and crop water requirements so the optimum number of supplementary irrigation events and irrigation date for summer maize planting varies somewhat from year to year irrigation was not applied during the growth seasons of 15 years was only applied once during the growth seasons of 19 years for which the total water volume was 75 mm and was applied twice during the growth seasons of 17 years for which the total water volume was 150 mm when the water volume was 0 75 and 150 mm wue was 15 8 25 5 13 4 23 8 and 16 2 25 5 kg mm 1 respectively and nue was 35 5 59 4 35 3 60 8 and 39 2 56 6 kg mm 1 respectively the results indicate that irrigation is largely unnecessary in years where the ratio of precipitation to crop water requirement is greater than 1 at the jointing and tasseling stages and irrigation is required in all years where p etc is less than 1 at this stage crops respond differently to water stress during each growth stage meng et al 2003 maize can withstand a certain degree of water stress during the seedling stage by increasing its rooting depth the jointing and tasseling stages are the key water demand periods for summer maize which are critical for maize yield and are directly affected by water stress during the jointing stage sufficient water and nutrients are required to ensure growth tan et al 2010 adequate irrigation to alleviate stress during the tasseling stage when maize is most sensitive to water stress can increase maize yield salter and goode 1967 westgate boyer 1985 this is consistent with the findings of jiang et al 2016 and shen et al 2021 3 3 irrigation decision making for summer maize in supplementary irrigation areas and result evaluation the results indicate that optimal annual irrigation thresholds t 1 and t 2 are 30 52 d and 46 81 d respectively the meteorological data on the test area from 1970 to 2020 indicate that when the cumulative rainfall in the growth season is used as the decision making basis irrigation thresholds p lim1 p lim2 and p lim3 range from 0 to 500 mm when p etc is used as the decision making basis the irrigation threshold ranges from 0 to 2 if cumulative rainfall or p etc p 1 from days 0 to t 1 in a given year is lower than p lim1 irrigation is applied if no irrigation occurs on day t 1 of a given year and cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than p lim2 irrigation is applied on day t 2 otherwise no irrigation is applied if irrigation is applied on day t 1 of a given year and cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than p lim3 irrigation is applied on day t 2 otherwise no irrigation is applied the irrigation time and discrimination threshold were optimized by the genetic algorithm with multiyear decision accuracy as a fitness function the percentage of irrigation decision results that are the same as the multi year irrigation optimization results is used as the decision accuracy the irrigation interval is not less than 10 days as the constraint condition the number of individuals in the population was 250 and the evolutionary algorithm had 50 generations the decision making results based on p and p etc are shown in table 10 and fig 7 a d when cumulative rainfall is used as the basis the time of irrigation decision making is the 47th and 74th days after sowing the first irrigation event decision was accurate for 43 years accounting for 84 31 of the data the second irrigation event decision was accurate for 41 years accounting for 80 39 of the data the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 82 35 when p etc was used as the basis the time of irrigation decision making was the 44th and 58th days after sowing the first irrigation event decision was accurate for 42 years accounting for 82 35 of the data the second irrigation event decision was accurate for 44 years accounting for 86 27 of the data the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 84 31 the results indicate that the decision making accuracy based on p etc was higher than that based on rainfall therefore the 44th and 58th days after sowing were used as the dates for irrigation decision making when p etc on days 0 44 was lower than the irrigation decision making standard of 0 6749 irrigation was required table 10 and fig 7c for the second irrigation event decision if irrigation was applied on the 44th day irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 was lower than the decision making standard of 0 7192 if irrigation was not applied on the first date irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 days was lower than the decision making standard of 0 7057 table 10 and fig 7d inaccurate decisions occurred because the distribution of rainfall was concentrated around certain periods resulting in classification inconsistent support vector machines svm can map input to feature space through kernel transformation and handle extremely complex problems raghavendra and deka 2014 chen et al 2010 applied the model combining grey theory and least square support vector machine to the prediction of irrigation water consumption liu et al 2020 optimized the support vector machine model based on the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm igwo svm to improve the accuracy of elastic evaluation of water resources system in irrigated areas to evaluate feasibility of the decision making model the 44th and 58th days after sowing were used as the irrigation dates and p etc in the early stage of irrigation and whether irrigation occurred previously were used as the decision making basis the support vector machine algorithm from the matlab 2018b classification learning toolbox was used for irrigation decision making and the new results were compared with the previous ones irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 44 days was lower than 0 6820 and a second irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 was lower than 0 7740 fig 7e and f because the support vector machine algorithm cannot consider the previous irrigation impact on the subsequent irrigation decision there is only one threshold when using the support vector machine algorithm for the second irrigation decision the accuracy of the first and second irrigation event decisions was 82 35 and 80 40 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 81 40 comparing the results of support vector machine algorithm with the decision making model in this study the judgment threshold of two irrigation events is similar however the accuracy of the decision making model proposed in this study is higher than that of the support vector machine algorithm and the decision making model considers the impact of the previous irrigation on the subsequent irrigation it can be considered that the decision making model proposed in this study can accurately predict whether irrigation should occur during the growing season of summer maize this has substantial practical implications however because of uncertainty related to rainfall differences between the simulated and actual irrigation decisions were observed for several years 3 4 reliability analysis of irrigation decision a difference between the irrigation schedule determined by the proposed model and the optimized irrigation schedule in section 3 2 to determine the effectiveness of the decision model this study used dssat to analyze the differences in yield wue and nue between the irrigation schedule determined by the decision model and the optimized irrigation schedule it can be seen from fig 8 that the irrigation plan proposed in this paper ensures that the yield wue and nue in most years are similar to the optimized results however in 1984 1994 and 2018 due to the extremely uneven distribution of precipitation the inconsistent decision making led to insufficient irrigation resulting in the yield wue and nue deviated from the optimal value to some extent overall the model error is within an acceptable range thus the proposed method can ensure the efficient production of summer maize in central shanxi and provide a basis for irrigation decision making in supplementary irrigation areas 4 conclusion to facilitate seasonal irrigation decision making of crops in supplementary irrigation area based on the construction of irrigation plan optimization model this paper focuses on an irrigation optimization decision making method use the cumulative rainfall threshold or p etc in a specific period of summer maize growing season the research shows that the combination of dssat and genetic algorithm can be used to optimize the irrigation schedule using the method proposed in this paper based on the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative etc can more accurately determine the irrigation time in summer maize and the average accuracy is 84 31 therefore the model proposed in this paper can provide a method reference for irrigation decision making of summer maize in supplementary irrigation area it should be noted that this paper only studies summer maize in the supplementary irrigation area of central shanxi china in the future it needs to further verify a variety of rainy season crops in more areas conflict of interest statement the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national key r d

9035,supplementary irrigation area in north china is an important agricultural production area but water shortages have limited the agricultural production considerably irrigation is required to ensure crop yield during growth seasons with variable rainfall most irrigation schedules are based on typical meteorological years however it is very difficult to predict the meteorological information of irrigation year in advance which limits the planning of irrigation schedules therefore taking the central part of shanxi province supplementary irrigation area as an example this study focuses on the optimal irrigation decision making method of supplementary irrigation area the irrigation schedule of summer maize from 1970 to 2020 was firstly optimized by using dssat model and genetic algorithm on this basis a decision making method based on the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative etc between plantation date to the current date to determine the irrigation time is developed the results indicated that using p etc the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative crop water requirement as the criterion leads to superior decision making two supplementary irrigation events can meet the growth demand of summer maize irrigation events decisions were made on days 44 and 58 after summer maize sowing the accuracy of this method for two irrigation events decisions is 82 35 and 86 27 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 84 31 at the same time a support vector machine algorithm is used to make decisions about irrigation comparing the decision accuracy with the results of the decision method proposed in this paper the accuracy of the support vector machine decisions for the first and second irrigation events was 82 35 and 80 40 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 81 40 the decision model was also superior to that involving support vector machine algorithms for the irrigation decision of summer maize can be used for irrigation decision making in similar supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall keywords dssat model supplementary irrigation areas irrigation schedule decision support genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the central part of shanxi is the important grain producing area in china agricultural production in this area is limited by shortages of water resources in addition affected by the monsoon climate rainfall during the growing season of crops sown in the summer is variable from 1970 2020 the maximum and minimum rainfall were 575 8 and 154 3 mm respectively and the average rainfall was 320 7 mm supplementary irrigation is thus required to ensure food production wang 2012 jiang et al 2016 efficient irrigation water management is crucial for the sustainable development of water resources in central shanxi and the irrigation system must be optimized the traditional optimal irrigation schedule is determined through field experiments zhang et al 2006 2018 2020 hammad et al 2015 however field experiments are time consuming and laborious and the effects of irrigation and fertilization date and quantity on crop growth are difficult to quantify under various climate conditions and for each crop genotype soil type and agronomic measure across years and regions chen et al 2020 a combination of farmland experiments and crop model simulations has been widely used to determine irrigation plans and increase efficiency he et al 2013 jones et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 as a research and decision making tool for crop production and resource management the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat has been used extensively yang et al 2013 mourice et al 2014 qu et al 2019 mukand et al 2019 attia et al 2016 used the dssat ceres wheat model to simulate the effects of irrigation management in texas on winter wheat biomass yield and water use efficiency wue kisekka et al 2016 used the ceres maize model and long term weather series data to identify the optimal irrigation strategy for maize production in kansas under insufficient irrigation conditions jiang et al 2016 researched the irrigation area in the yingke oasis in the middle reaches of the heihe river and used the dssat maize model to determine the optimal irrigation strategy for maize under various climatic conditions gohain et al 2021 used dssat csm to spatially simulate crop water stress in rainy season sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench from 2000 to 2018 in 10 districts of maharashtra india and effectively determined crop water stress for different crop phenological stages and different sowing dates rugira et al 2021 applied the dssat maize model to optimize irrigation management and sowing schedules in the loess plateau fenhe river basin and ensure the stability of the spring maize yield kipkulei 2022 conducted a multiseason calibration and evaluation of the dssat ceres maize model to assess the maize yield response of two common cultivars grown in trans nzoia county in kenya under various agricultural strategies such as sowing dates nitrogen fertilization and water management with the development of computer science combining crop models with optimization algorithms has become an effective method of optimizing crop irrigation schedules song et al 2018 optimized the irrigation schedule of spring wheat by using the aquacrop model and improved the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii liu yang 2021 constructed a distributed aquacrop model and multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii for simulation optimization to formulate effective irrigation plans these studies can effectively optimize the irrigation schedule based on existing meteorological scenarios the above studies of irrigation schedule optimization are all based on a specified meteorological year for decision making the specified meteorological year can be used as a study of the irrigation process to meet the needs of designing irrigation districts however in practice it is difficult to predict rainfall scenarios for the entire crop reproductive period and there are difficulties when irrigation decisions optimized on the basis of the meteorological year are used to guide irrigation in a particular year therefore developing a comprehensive decision making method for intra seasonal irrigation is vital in supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall he et al 2011 araya et al 2015 jha et al 2019 point at above problems this study evaluated the applicability of dssat to simulate the growth of summer maize in central shanxi by using measured data to validate and calibrate the model and combines the model with a genetic algorithm to optimize the irrigation schedule of summer maize for the period 1970 2020 on the basis this study proposes an irrigation decision making method based on the cumulative rainfall p threshold the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative crop water requirement p etc in summer maize growing season the purpose is to provide a basis for irrigation decision making in similar supplementary irrigation areas with variable rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experiment was conducted in dong an village guangsheng town

and irrigation date are shown in table 3 the application rates of the phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were the same in each treatment 90 and 120 kg hm 2 respectively the planting dates were june 12 2018 and june 16 2019 and the harvest dates were october 8 2018 and october 1 2019 respectively 2 2 experimental indicators and methods the field experiment was conducted to observe the phenological period aboveground biomass yield and leaf area index of summer maize which were used to calibrate and validate the parameters of the dssat ceres maize model a phenological period in the classic zadoks et al 1974 division method the growth season is the period in which 50 of the plants enter a specific growth stage the growth season of summer maize is divided into seedling jointing tasseling filling and harvest stages b soil water content the soil water content was measured using the drying method the depth of the measured soil layer was 100 cm and the thickness of one layer was set to 20 cm the experimental summer maize was measured at each growth stage once every 10 days c leaf area measured manually with a tape measure at each growth stage once every 7 days the maximum length and width of the summer maize leaves were measured and the leaf area index during each growth stage was calculated using eq 1 mckee 1964 1 l a i 0 75 ρ i 1 n a i b i where lai is the summer maize leaf area index 0 75 is the leaf area regression coefficient related to leaf shape ρ is the summer maize planting density 60 000 plants per hectare a i is the leaf length for summer maize m b i is the maximum leaf width for summer maize m and n is the number of leaves per summer maize plant d aboveground biomass measured by randomly selecting three summer maize plants from each experimental plot cutting off the aboveground part placing it in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and drying it to a constant weight at 75 c the dry weight represented the aboveground biomass e grain yield during the harvest of summer maize 30 ears of maize were randomly selected from each plot and dried naturally after threshing with a small thresher subsequently the water content of the samples was measured with a moisture analyzer lds 1 h hangzhou china each treatment was applied in triplicate and the average value from the three measurements was used the yield under a standard water content 14 was the final grain yield for summer maize 2 3 dssat ceres maize model the dssat ceres maize model is a module used to simulate maize growth and development in daily increments jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 it has been widely used for yield simulation irrigation schedule optimization and crop yield reduction risk assessment rugira et al 2021 menefee et al 2021 the model includes a series of non linear mechanistic equations to characterise the response of maize growth and yield formation processes to the dynamics of soil moisture and fertilizer content on a day by day basis in addition the model is driven by daily meteorological data and is able to quantify the effects of field management practices on maize growth and development in the dssat model the crop development process is simulated using a cumulative temperature equation that uses the crop to accumulate dry mass by daily photosynthetic fixation of biomass the model calculates the proportion of accumulated photosynthetic assimilates per day for different organs of the crop based on photosynthetic assimilates at each stage of reproduction and thus simulates the final yield where the magnitude of the incremental dry matter mass allocation depends on the amount of effective photosynthetic radiation intercepted by the crop canopy the soil moisture simulation module is based on the water balance principle and uses a one dimensional bucket turning method to calculate daily changes in the water content of the soil layer due to rainfall and irrigation infiltration vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and root uptake processes the basic principle of the dssat model for calculating water stress is to regulate crop water uptake and photosynthetic efficiency by comparing the magnitude of the relationship between crop water demand potential evapotranspiration and potential root water uptake under adequate irrigation conditions potential root water uptake is greater than the crop s water requirements however as soil water is gradually lost through crop transpiration and root uptake potential root uptake decreases the first water stress factor swdf1 occurs when a threshold is reached at some stage the second stress factor swdf2 occurs when crop water demand exceeds potential root water uptake and affects final crop biomass formation and leaf spreading the dssat ceres model simulates the effects of water stress on different growth stages of summer maize by adjusting different water stress factors based on the above theoretical studies the moisture stress factors were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 s w d f 1 w s p r w u e p e p 0 3 s w d f 2 w s p e p 0 where swdf1 is the first water stress factor of the crop model wsp is the potential root water uptake mm rwuep is a characteristic parameter of the species ep0 is the crop water requirement mm and swdf2 is the second water stress factor of the crop model the required data sets of the dssat model are meteorological data soil data field management data and genotype parameters 2 3 1 data sources the meteorological data required by dssat are daily maximum temperature t max c minimum temperature t min c precipitation mm and solar radiation mj m 2 the maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall data were provided by the china meteorological data network http data cma cn

basic physical and chemical parameters table 2 the soil texture parameters comprise soil particle composition which is measured using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical malvern uk the soil water characteristic parameters are field water capacity and saturated water content which are measured using the centrifuge method the soil bulk density is measured using the ring knife method the field management data required by dssat are planting information farming methods initial water and nutrient conditions and irrigation and fertilization see section 2 1 for details the maximum rooting depth used in the simulations was 120 cm 2 3 2 genotype parameters in this study the phenological period yield aboveground biomass and leaf area index were used to calibrate the six genotype parameters of summer maize and the range of parameter values was shown in table 4 shen et al 2020 a genetic algorithm was used for parameter calibration shen et al 2021 2 3 3 model evaluation mean error me coefficient of determination r 2 and relative root mean square error nrmse were used to evaluate the differences between the simulated and observed values 5 m e 1 n i

respectively 2 4 establishment and solution method of irrigation schedule optimization model 2 4 1 establishment of irrigation schedule optimization model to optimize the irrigation schedule in central shanxi province from 1970 to 2020 the potential yield of summer maize was first obtained by dssat model simulation the dssat model s water and nitrogen stress functions needed to be switched off when simulating potential summer maize yields with comprehensive consideration of these three indexes maximum relative yield was set as the optimization goal and irrigation date wue and nue were constraints the decision variables were irrigation date days after sowing and number of supplementary irrigation events a maximum of three supplementary irrigation events can be used the local border irrigation quota was used and the conventional irrigation amount is 75 mm the interval between any two irrigation dates was at least 10 days the fertilization amount was 180 kg hm 2 consistent with the amount conventionally applied in the region the optimization objective and constraints are as follows objective function 8 max y r y y p constraints 9 d i 1 d i d i 1 10 w u e β 1 w u e p 11 n u e β 2 n u e p where y and yp are optimized crop yield and potential yield respectively kg hm 2 yr is relative yield wue and wuep are optimized water use efficiency and potential water use efficiency respectively kg mm 1 nue and nuep are optimized nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency and potential nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency respectively kg kg 1 di is the time of the i th irrigation after sowing day β1and β2 is the ratio factor that guarantees the maximum wue and nue use efficiency that can be obtained for different climatic years 2 4 2 solution method of irrigation schedule optimization model to avoid the conflict between the previous irrigation and the later irrigation and reduce the redundancy of coding the following special hybrid coding method was adopted according to farming experience three supplementary irrigation events shall be considered at most during the growth period of summer maize each irrigation interval is expressed as a subsegment within a long time period and the lengths of different subsegments are expressed as l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively fig 2a for reducing the infeasible solution the ratio factors α1 α2 and α3 which reflect the length of irrigation interval are used as decision variables for coding in order to ensure the effectiveness of irrigation no irrigation for 30 days after sowing and 10 days before harvest and the interval of each irrigation is at least 10 days if the interval is less than 10 days which automatically changed to 10 days in fig 2a α1 represents the proportional factor between the interval length from the sowing date to the first irrigation date l1 and the length of whole growth period lb when decoding the subsegment the product of the length of remaining growth period lb l1 and α2 is taken as the length of the second sub segment these principles can be followed for additional irrigation interval integer coding is adopted for number of supplementary irrigation events and real coding is adopted for irrigation time respectively the irrigation interval is taken as an integer for agricultural practice therefore during decoding the calculated time value is rounded the encoding form is shown in fig 2b after the calculation accuracy and efficiency were weighted the number of individuals in the population was 50 and the evolutionary algorithm had 100 generations i t is used to represent the number of supplementary irrigation events the optimization process of irrigation schedule is shown in fig 3 2 5 irrigation decision model based on rainfall and etc 2 5 1 model construction and solution method rainfall and evaporation strongly affect irrigation decision making during growth seasons determining the irrigation schedule is crucial when the meteorological conditions of a certain growth season are unknown therefore this study used the rainfall during various period of the summer maize growth season and p etc as two criteria to determine the irrigation schedule the rainfall or p etc threshold for whether to irrigate or not was determined using yearly data the formula for calculating the etc is as follows 12 e t c k c e t 0 where kc denotes the crop coefficient and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated using the penman monteith formula recommended by the fao allen richard et al 1998 fig 4 presents the process of optimizing decision making with t 1 and t 2 as the thresholds for the first and second irrigation date after sowing p lim1 p lim2 and p lim3 are the thresholds of each irrigation p lim1 is the first irrigation threshold if cumulative rainfall or p etc p 1 of days 0 t 1 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise irrigation will not be applied the second irrigation event decision is influenced by the outcome of the first irrigation decision plim2 is the threshold value of cumulative rainfall or p etc for the second irrigation event decision when the first irrigation event has not occurred when cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise no irrigation will be applied plim3 is the threshold value of cumulative rainfall or p etc for the decision on the second irrigation event when the first irrigation event occurs when cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than the threshold irrigation will be applied otherwise no irrigation will be applied these principles can be followed for additional scenarios the pseudo code is shown in table 5 determining the statistical time t 1 t 2 and decision threshold p lim1 p lim2 p lim3 for fractional irrigation with reference to cumulative rainfall or p etc is essential therefore this study used a genetic algorithm to optimize the multiyear irrigation decision accuracy as a fitness function when an irrigation decision is made the irrigation decision is considered correct for that year if the irrigation results obtained from the decision are consistent with the optimization results in section 2 4 the proportion of consistent irrigation results the percentage of years in which the decision is correct across all years is taken as the fitness function of the model decisions to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this method a support vector machine in matlab 2018b classification learner toolbox was used to make decisions about irrigation and to compare the accuracy of the two decision methods the fitness function for irrigation decisions based on support vector machines is consistent with the proposed decision model fitness function which pursues the highest irrigation decision accuracy 2 5 2 evaluation of irrigation decision model to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision making method dssat was used to compare the differences in yield wue and nue between the schedule determined using the decision making model and that optimized in section 2 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of dssat model summer maize genotypic parameters must be calibrated to ensure the accuracy of model simulation yield and phenological period for treatment t1 in 2018 and 2019 were used in this study to calibrate the genotypic parameters of ceres maize table 6 the model was validated using yield and phenological stage of treatments t2 t3 and t4 in 2018 and 2019 leaf area index and 0 40 cm soil water content of all treatments in 2018 and 2019 the simulated anthesis date maturity date and yield of summer maize matched well with the observed values and nrmse was less than 20 table 7 to further evaluate the reliability of the model parameters the phenological dates and yield of the t2 t3 and t4 treatments in 2018 and 2019 leaf area index and soil water content of all treatments in 2018 and 2019 were verified table 8 figs 5 6 table 8 shows the simulated flowering date maturity date and yield fig 5 show the simulated leaf area index and fig 6 show the simulated soil water content simulated and measured values of nrmse for the above indicators were less than 20 for the treatments in 2018 and 2019 these results indicate that the calibrated and validated dssat ceres maize model can accurately simulate crop growth béchir et al 2000 patrick et al 2021 kipkulei et al 2022 3 2 optimization results of irrigation schedule over the years the optimization results of summer maize irrigation schedule over the years based on relative yield and considering wue and nue are shown in table 9 when determining wuep and nuep single objective optimization is carried out with them as the objectives respectively and the model and solution method are similar to the section 2 4 and fig 3 in the single objective optimization the constraints eqs 10 and 11 and the corresponding infeasibility ifd of the solution method are not considered after consideration the value of β1 and β2 is set at 0 9 and the value range of α1 α2 and α3 is set at 0 2 0 8 analyzing the optimal irrigation schedule over the years in table 9 two supplementary irrigation events provide sufficient water for growth in the growing season there are inter annual differences in both precipitation and crop water requirements so the optimum number of supplementary irrigation events and irrigation date for summer maize planting varies somewhat from year to year irrigation was not applied during the growth seasons of 15 years was only applied once during the growth seasons of 19 years for which the total water volume was 75 mm and was applied twice during the growth seasons of 17 years for which the total water volume was 150 mm when the water volume was 0 75 and 150 mm wue was 15 8 25 5 13 4 23 8 and 16 2 25 5 kg mm 1 respectively and nue was 35 5 59 4 35 3 60 8 and 39 2 56 6 kg mm 1 respectively the results indicate that irrigation is largely unnecessary in years where the ratio of precipitation to crop water requirement is greater than 1 at the jointing and tasseling stages and irrigation is required in all years where p etc is less than 1 at this stage crops respond differently to water stress during each growth stage meng et al 2003 maize can withstand a certain degree of water stress during the seedling stage by increasing its rooting depth the jointing and tasseling stages are the key water demand periods for summer maize which are critical for maize yield and are directly affected by water stress during the jointing stage sufficient water and nutrients are required to ensure growth tan et al 2010 adequate irrigation to alleviate stress during the tasseling stage when maize is most sensitive to water stress can increase maize yield salter and goode 1967 westgate boyer 1985 this is consistent with the findings of jiang et al 2016 and shen et al 2021 3 3 irrigation decision making for summer maize in supplementary irrigation areas and result evaluation the results indicate that optimal annual irrigation thresholds t 1 and t 2 are 30 52 d and 46 81 d respectively the meteorological data on the test area from 1970 to 2020 indicate that when the cumulative rainfall in the growth season is used as the decision making basis irrigation thresholds p lim1 p lim2 and p lim3 range from 0 to 500 mm when p etc is used as the decision making basis the irrigation threshold ranges from 0 to 2 if cumulative rainfall or p etc p 1 from days 0 to t 1 in a given year is lower than p lim1 irrigation is applied if no irrigation occurs on day t 1 of a given year and cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than p lim2 irrigation is applied on day t 2 otherwise no irrigation is applied if irrigation is applied on day t 1 of a given year and cumulative rainfall or p etc p 2 on days 0 t 2 is lower than p lim3 irrigation is applied on day t 2 otherwise no irrigation is applied the irrigation time and discrimination threshold were optimized by the genetic algorithm with multiyear decision accuracy as a fitness function the percentage of irrigation decision results that are the same as the multi year irrigation optimization results is used as the decision accuracy the irrigation interval is not less than 10 days as the constraint condition the number of individuals in the population was 250 and the evolutionary algorithm had 50 generations the decision making results based on p and p etc are shown in table 10 and fig 7 a d when cumulative rainfall is used as the basis the time of irrigation decision making is the 47th and 74th days after sowing the first irrigation event decision was accurate for 43 years accounting for 84 31 of the data the second irrigation event decision was accurate for 41 years accounting for 80 39 of the data the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 82 35 when p etc was used as the basis the time of irrigation decision making was the 44th and 58th days after sowing the first irrigation event decision was accurate for 42 years accounting for 82 35 of the data the second irrigation event decision was accurate for 44 years accounting for 86 27 of the data the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 84 31 the results indicate that the decision making accuracy based on p etc was higher than that based on rainfall therefore the 44th and 58th days after sowing were used as the dates for irrigation decision making when p etc on days 0 44 was lower than the irrigation decision making standard of 0 6749 irrigation was required table 10 and fig 7c for the second irrigation event decision if irrigation was applied on the 44th day irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 was lower than the decision making standard of 0 7192 if irrigation was not applied on the first date irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 days was lower than the decision making standard of 0 7057 table 10 and fig 7d inaccurate decisions occurred because the distribution of rainfall was concentrated around certain periods resulting in classification inconsistent support vector machines svm can map input to feature space through kernel transformation and handle extremely complex problems raghavendra and deka 2014 chen et al 2010 applied the model combining grey theory and least square support vector machine to the prediction of irrigation water consumption liu et al 2020 optimized the support vector machine model based on the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm igwo svm to improve the accuracy of elastic evaluation of water resources system in irrigated areas to evaluate feasibility of the decision making model the 44th and 58th days after sowing were used as the irrigation dates and p etc in the early stage of irrigation and whether irrigation occurred previously were used as the decision making basis the support vector machine algorithm from the matlab 2018b classification learning toolbox was used for irrigation decision making and the new results were compared with the previous ones irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 44 days was lower than 0 6820 and a second irrigation was required when p etc on days 0 58 was lower than 0 7740 fig 7e and f because the support vector machine algorithm cannot consider the previous irrigation impact on the subsequent irrigation decision there is only one threshold when using the support vector machine algorithm for the second irrigation decision the accuracy of the first and second irrigation event decisions was 82 35 and 80 40 respectively and the average accuracy of the two irrigation event decisions was 81 40 comparing the results of support vector machine algorithm with the decision making model in this study the judgment threshold of two irrigation events is similar however the accuracy of the decision making model proposed in this study is higher than that of the support vector machine algorithm and the decision making model considers the impact of the previous irrigation on the subsequent irrigation it can be considered that the decision making model proposed in this study can accurately predict whether irrigation should occur during the growing season of summer maize this has substantial practical implications however because of uncertainty related to rainfall differences between the simulated and actual irrigation decisions were observed for several years 3 4 reliability analysis of irrigation decision a difference between the irrigation schedule determined by the proposed model and the optimized irrigation schedule in section 3 2 to determine the effectiveness of the decision model this study used dssat to analyze the differences in yield wue and nue between the irrigation schedule determined by the decision model and the optimized irrigation schedule it can be seen from fig 8 that the irrigation plan proposed in this paper ensures that the yield wue and nue in most years are similar to the optimized results however in 1984 1994 and 2018 due to the extremely uneven distribution of precipitation the inconsistent decision making led to insufficient irrigation resulting in the yield wue and nue deviated from the optimal value to some extent overall the model error is within an acceptable range thus the proposed method can ensure the efficient production of summer maize in central shanxi and provide a basis for irrigation decision making in supplementary irrigation areas 4 conclusion to facilitate seasonal irrigation decision making of crops in supplementary irrigation area based on the construction of irrigation plan optimization model this paper focuses on an irrigation optimization decision making method use the cumulative rainfall threshold or p etc in a specific period of summer maize growing season the research shows that the combination of dssat and genetic algorithm can be used to optimize the irrigation schedule using the method proposed in this paper based on the ratio of cumulative rainfall to cumulative etc can more accurately determine the irrigation time in summer maize and the average accuracy is 84 31 therefore the model proposed in this paper can provide a method reference for irrigation decision making of summer maize in supplementary irrigation area it should be noted that this paper only studies summer maize in the supplementary irrigation area of central shanxi china in the future it needs to further verify a variety of rainy season crops in more areas conflict of interest statement the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national key r d

9036,the optimal allocation of agricultural water rights is of great importance in promoting the efficient management of water resources in irrigation areas in the process of agricultural water rights allocation problems develop when the dynamics and uncertainties caused by changes in water cycle elements are ignored to balance socioeconomic development and environmental protection this study develops a model framework for evaluating and optimizing the synergistic management of agricultural water rights allocation trading under multiple uncertainties awras tcme the model is capable of reflecting the dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall evapotranspiration and runoff and quantitatively measures the synergistic effect of multidimensional objectives of the economy society resources environment on water rights allocations and transactions the awras tcme model integrates a two level multiobjective nonlinear programming model and a projection tracking model into a framework to measure the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation based on an analysis of the sustainability of water rights prices in multiple dimensions fully considering the influence of uncertainties in hydrological and social systems the model was applied to an actual irrigation area and the results showed that 1 total optimized water rights allocation was reduced by 4 7 20 9 at different levels of water supply and demand 2 the total volume of water rights transfer among regions was increased by 4 8 12 9 and the trading volume of the water rights market was increased to account for 5 16 2 of the total revenue and 3 the optimal net income of water rights allocation was increased by 1 2 3 3 and the equity of water rights allocation was increased by 0 06 0 09 the developed model promotes the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigated areas keywords agricultural water rights management two tier planning models sustainability assessment dynamism multiple uncertainties 1 introduction as water scarcity increases water conservation and protection have become some of the controlling factors necessary to ensure human survival and social development liu and shang 2022 agriculture consumes the most water accounting for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater li et al 2020 in china more than half of arable land is cultivated through irrigation irrigation districts are the mainstay and important foundation for national food security and socioeconomic development huang et al 2022 however irrigation districts are also the main agricultural water using and water consuming sector accounting for approximately 65 of the total agricultural irrigation water used in the country zhang et al 2019 as water use continues to increase better management of water resources in irrigation areas has become an effective means of addressing agricultural water stress wang et al 2017 water rights trading can facilitate the optimal allocation of water resources chen et al 2021 the optimal allocation of agricultural water rights can maintain the relative balance of agroecosystems and achieve sustainable use of water resources cheng et al 2021 therefore agricultural water rights management is an important tool to achieve sustainable use of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas the reduction in water rights distribution means that the consumption of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas is eased and the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas can be realized through effective management of agricultural water rights the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture and the trading of water rights are two important components of agricultural water rights management lin and lin 2020 many scholars have developed mathematical models for water rights and or trading from different angles for example zeng et al 2015 and zeng et al 2016b developed water trading models for water resource management that address uncertainty to optimize the water trading amount water allocation pattern and system benefit under different probabilities for the kaidu qongque river basin the results show that water trading can effectively allocate limited water resources to competitive users with a maximized system benefit delorit and block 2018 developed a coupled agricultural economic water rights trading model based on cooperative demand balance and showed that the average annual expected profit generated by water rights trading was significantly higher than the profit obtained without interaction cheng al 2021 developed a modeling approach for agricultural water rights allocation that considers the carrying capacity of agricultural water resources the results of which show that the model increased the economic benefit and enhanced the agricultural water carrying capacity by optimally adjusting water quantity quality and planting and breeding structure these works have verified that water rights allocation and trading have the ability to improve regional economic development and moreover they have provided ideas for water rights allocation and trading modeling to support future studies the initial allocation of water rights limits the trading volume of water rights reasonable allocation of water rights according to regional water demand requirements is the equity basis of water rights trading and an increase in water rights allocation may reduce the frequency and quantity of water rights trading in addition the income or expenditure share of water rights trading directly affects the comprehensive benefits of a region and can prompt a region to adjust its water rights allocation strategy to improve production benefits li et al 2019 however most existing studies focus on only one of these aspects initial water rights allocation or water rights trading therefore an optimal two tier allocation system for agricultural initial water rights and water trading has an important role to play in the sustainable use of water resources reasonable initial allocation of water rights in agriculture is an important prerequisite for the scientific allocation of water rights lin and lin 2020 many studies regarding the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture often involve complex stochastic and interdependent structural information and it is particularly important to objectively determine the methodology the initial allocation of water rights in agriculture is based on an initial weighting of each region and previous studies have generally used the assignment method to determine the initial water rights in agriculture with distinct regional characteristics and subjective considerations for example zhang et al 2021 constructed an optimal allocation model of irrigation water rights in arid areas in which the allocation of initial water rights was determined according to crop planting area and crop water demand per unit area linker 2020 established an optimization model of planting area and water rights allocation and the allocation of initial water rights was determined according to the historical experience data of various regions in reality the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture often involves complex stochastic and interdependent structural information and it is particularly important to objectively determine the methodology initial water rights allocation models that reflect equity are an effective way to address subjective empowerment eras and fandio 2022 ye et al 2022 a model for the initial allocation of water rights in agriculture that considers fairness can guide the rational trading of water rights leading to better decisions on the final allocation of water rights willis et al 2021 water rights trading is affected by the water cycle water quality and other economic social resource and environmental factors berbel and expósito 2022 most current studies ignore the impact of multidimensional factors on water rights trading or consider the static response of only a few dimensions resource and environmental factors are often closely linked to the water cycle and agronomic practices tend to change over time and are dynamic and time sensitive zhao et al 2022 static representations of the impact of multiple dimensions on water rights trading clearly do not provide a comprehensive guide to water rights allocation the construction of a dynamic water rights trading evaluation indicator weighting system that assigns indicator weights to water prices in agricultural water rights trading can quantitatively characterize the impact of the dynamics of indicators closely linked to the water cycle and agronomic measures on water rights trading and is of great practical importance in obtaining a reasonable water rights allocation scheme however there are few reports on the construction of a two level optimal allocation system of water rights trading based on the fairness of initial agricultural water rights allocation and a multidimensional dynamic evaluation system agricultural water rights allocation is affected by multiple factors such as the hydrological environment and management system resulting in uncertainty risks brought by uncertainty can impact agricultural water rights allocation schemes therefore the impact of uncertainty on water rights allocation must be reduced delorit and block 2018 in the case of water supply and demand systems uncertainty may be driven by a combination of hydrological environmental variability and hydrological changes caused by social systems milly et al 2008 with the increasing complexity of water supply and demand accurate information on random variable distributions is difficult to predict to provide warnings some scholars have considered the uncertainties in water rights allocation and trading for example zeng et al 2016a developed a fuzzy stochastic programming with green z score criterion method for water resources allocation and water quality management with a trading mechanism under uncertainty which can handle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and can quantify objective subjective fuzziness in the decision making process zhang et al 2022 constructed an evaluation model of agricultural water resource allocation in irrigation areas which considered the random uncertainty of inflow levels and different risk levels of irrigation areas such studies focused on thoroughly understanding the uncertainty of the water supply on water rights allocation or trading however in addition to water supply the data source statistical deviation or deficiency of the management system and other reasons can affect the water price in water rights trading leading to uncertainty in the data and affecting the water rights trading model and water rights allocation scheme comprehensive consideration of the hydrological environment and management system uncertainty is of practical significance for the objective management of agricultural water rights in summary this study proposes an optimization model framework for the cooperative management evaluation of agricultural water rights allocation and transaction awras tcme under multiple uncertainties to balance the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation in irrigated areas the awras tcme model weighs the impact of economic social resource and environmental factors on water rights trading and considers the effects of multiple uncertainties in the hydrological environment and management system on the model to reflect the impact of dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological elements on water rights allocation the model allocates initial agricultural water rights and trades unreasonable water rights after allocation applying the model to actual irrigated areas the management of water rights in irrigated areas can reduce agricultural water use and increase the value of agricultural benefits while ensuring adequate agricultural production providing valuable insights for current and future water resource management 2 research method this section is divided into five main modules the data module the evaluation module where the projection pursuit model is used to construct an evaluation model for 13 indicators related to the economy society resources and environment and the price of water rights determined by the cobbdouglas production function c d production function is evaluated and the optimization module where the coupled equity agricultural initial water rights allocation model and water rights trading model are connected through a two level multiobjective nonlinear programming model the weight output by the evaluation module is assigned to the water rights price the water rights price after weighting is inserted into the optimization module and the evaluation module and optimization module are connected the evaluation index affects the final allocation scheme of the optimization model by influencing the real value of water resources the whole evaluation optimization model framework is quantified in an uncertain environment the uncertainty of hydrologic supply and demand is quantified by means of a chance programming constraint and the uncertainty in the management water price is quantified by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers which constitutes the uncertainty module finally for the model output module the specific technical roadmap is as follows fig 1 2 1 evaluation index system for sustainable use of agricultural water rights trading the water rights allocation scheme of the awras tcme model is often affected by the water price of water rights trading the determination of the water price is significantly affected by the economy society resources and environment and the dynamic change in indicators is reflected by changes in various dimensions peng and deng 2015 changes in the index are caused by dynamic changes in the water cycle and agronomic measures so the construction of a dynamic weight system of the water rights allocation evaluation index has a significant impact on the final water rights allocation scheme the sustainability evaluation system follows the three principles of equity efficiency and sustainability siddiqi 2021 according to the above principles and considering the four dimensions of economy society resources and environment 13 evaluation indexes closely related to the allocation of water rights and the water cycle are selected and the dynamic index parameters must be monitored and obtained 2 1 1 evaluation indicators 2 1 1 1 economic factors 2 1 1 1 1 gross production an important indicator for measuring agricultural productivity in different regions reflects the effectiveness of water users in improving water use efficiency and crop yield by relying on various cropping methods yu et al 2021 the total output of each region is calculated by the product of the output per unit area and the area of each region 2 1 1 1 2 water consumption per gdp this value reflects the dependence of different regions on resources to obtain the same income and promote maximum economic benefits at the lowest water cost li c et al 2022 the water consumption per unit

current distribution of arable land the amount of arable land affects the use of water resources the degree of water resource waste and the potential for irrigation water savings li et al 2020 these data are obtained by data query 2 1 1 3 2 soil water content and soil infiltration rate these are dynamic parameters that change over time changes in the soil water content and soil infiltration rate impact the soil properties and the farmland water cycle in turn changes in the farmland water cycle affect the amount of irrigation water and the allocation of water rights the data are obtained through dynamic monitoring by a soil moisture meter the green water footprint is the minimum value of the total actual evapotranspiration e t c a c t of crops and effective rainfall and the total green water footprint is the result of the sum of the green water footprints in each growth stage of rice ma et al 2022 e t c a c t and effective rainfall are parameters that vary with temperature

1 1 the construction of the evaluation index system of the dynamic sustainable use of agricultural water rights reflects the real water rights allocation conditions but there are uncertainties and ambiguities among the evaluation indexes to address the problems of human interference and incompatibility among the results of various evaluation indexes this study uses the projection pursuit model kanatani 1985 to link all evaluation indexes projection pursuit is a new statistical method for processing and analyzing high dimensional data that has obvious advantages in overcoming the curse of dimensionality and solving problems such as small sample sizes and extremely high dimensionality a brief summary of the algorithm of the projection pursuit evaluation model for sustainable evaluation of water resource allocation is as follows 1 data preprocessing the data set of the evaluation index system of sustainable utilization of irrigation water is x i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the sustainable evaluation index value of the j of the i zone is obtained by normalization m and n are the total number of zones and the total number of sustainable evaluation indicators respectively 2 construct the projection index function ppe is the one dimensional projection value z i that integrates m dimensional data x i j j 1 2 n into a a 1 a 2 a m as the projection direction 3 optimizing the projection index function the problem of searching for the optimal projection direction is transformed into a nonlinear optimal solution problem 4 calculate the best projection direction and value given the sample set of sustainable evaluation index values the projection index function changes only with changes in the projection direction different projection directions reflect different features of the data and the best projection direction is the one that reflects a certain feature of high dimensional data to the greatest extent in this study a genetic algorithm is applied to solve the high dimensional global optimization problem 2 2 uncertainty the awras tcme model optimizes the two objectives of agricultural water rights distribution fairness and the economic benefits of water rights to determine the allocation of water rights in this section chance constrained programming and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to quantify the uncertainty caused by the hydrological environment and management systems 2 2 1 chance constrained planning the awras tcme model focuses on the allocation and optimization of water rights hence the supply and demand of water resources becomes an important parameter of the model however the supply and demand of water resources are greatly affected by the hydrological environment which leads to an unpredictable distribution of random variables of water supply and demand and affects the final water rights transaction and designation of the water rights allocation scheme therefore the chance constrained programming model is used to quantify the uncertainty of water supply and demand chance constrained programming can be used to quantify the relationship between the optimal value of the objective function and the optimal solution set of decision variables and the random coefficients in the model the optimal value of the random objective function and the optimal solution set of decision variables can be estimated at a specified level of confidence opportunity constrained programming is widely used because it can address the occurrence of adverse situations and allow the decision to not meet the constraints to a certain extent and the decision results can be established when the constraints are satisfied and not less than a certain confidence level probability to effectively solve the problem of fuzzy random variable information zhou et al 2022 chance constrained programming can address random parameters in the left and right side terms of the constraint guo et al 2008 linear programming problems with random variables in the constraints can be expressed as follows 15a max f r 1 r c r x r constraints 15b pr r 1 r a p r x r b p ξ 1 q p 1 2 p 15c x r 0 r 1 2 r where f is the objective function x r is the decision variable and a p r and b p ξ are input parameters where b p ξ is a random parameter to simplify the model transformation process it is assumed that b p ξ follows a normal distribution that is b p ξ n μ b p σ b p 2 1 q q 0 1 is the predetermined confidence level for the corresponding random constraints and q represents the violation probability of the corresponding random constraints the higher the confidence level is the smaller the probability of violation 2 2 2 intuitionistic fuzzy set intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can effectively reflect the uncertainty of numerical values compared to conventional fuzzy numbers intuitionistic fuzzy numbers provide more abundant information and can represent components of the management system of the data source the statistical deviation and uncertainty this paper builds a model of water resource values such as the fuzzy membership degree the degree of membership of uncertain parameters and hesitation degrees mahajan and gupta 2020 intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can address the uncertainty of such data an intuitionistic fuzzy number is an uncertain fuzzy model that can be solved only after the model is determined the accuracy function is deterministic and the intuitionistic fuzzy number transforms the uncertainty model into a deterministic model through the accuracy function in this study the price of water resources for many years can be obtained after the value of water resources is determined by the c d production function the influence of water price data on the awras tcme model is obvious and the fluctuation of data will produce different water rights allocation schemes so the ambiguity of water prices in many years data is eliminated by using intuitive fuzzy sets see the supplementary materials for the specific formula 2 3 optimization model the awras tcme model optimization module discusses the relationship between the upper level water rights allocation model considering equity and the lower level water rights economic benefit model under this framework the upper model has a higher priority in allocating the initial water rights to each zone the initial allocation of water rights is conducted based on the principle of fairness when a district obtains the decision of the irrigation district administration the lower model is used to redistribute water rights and trade water rights to each branch channel of the district based on the principle of maximum economic benefits and the optimal allocation strategy is obtained in this way we can optimize the allocation of water rights and analyze the potential income and water saving potential brought by water rights trading 2 3 1 objective functions 2 3 1 1 upper level objective function maximum fairness the upper model of the awras tcme model determines initial water rights which affect water rights trading comprehensive and objective determination of initial water rights is important for subsequent water rights trading zhang et al 2018 initial water rights allocation based on equity can narrow the gap in benefits of the initial water rights allocation of each zoning unit yan et al 2022 the gini coefficient can objectively and intuitively reflect the resource gap between regions and forecast and warn about and prevent the polarization of resource allocation among regions because it reflects the quantitative boundary of resource differences between regions therefore the gini coefficient which captures the extent of resource differences among regions was used to construct the upper level decision model ye et al 2022 the objective function is as follows 16a min w a e g i n i 1 2 m i 1 m x i a i r i i 1 m i 2 m x i a i r i x i a i r i where w a e g i n i is a dimensionless objective function of the equity of the initial water rights allocation i is the subregion serial number m is the total number of subregions and x i represents the initial water rights in region i in m3 ha which is determined by higher level decision makers and is a decision variable in the upper level model a i is the planting area of partition i ha r i is the net income of subdivision yuan the function expression is as follows 1b x i a i r i is the amount of water rights allocation per unit economic benefit of zone i m3 ha thus the simulation looks for the best water allocation pattern for growing more rice with less water the net income function is the profit of crop yield 16b r i j 1 n p i j f i j c i j a i j γ x i a i c i w r t i a i c i w r t i a i where j stands for the branch channel number n is the total number of branch channels p i j represents the crop unit price of branch channel j of subdivision i yuan kg f i j is the crop yield of branch channel j of subdivision i kg ha indicates that the data are processed via intuitionistic fuzzy numbers c i j is the crop planting cost of branch channel j of subdivision i yuan ha including seeds fertilizers pesticides machinery labor etc a i j is the crop planting area of branch channel j of subdivision i ha γ represents the current agricultural water price in the irrigated area yuan m3 c i represents the price of water in water rights trading in subregion i yuan m3 which is quantified through the evaluation system in chapter 2 2 w r t i represents the amount of water rights purchased by subarea i from other subareas and w r t i represents the amount of water rights sold to other subregions by subregion i according to marginal equilibrium theory the increase in output resulting from an increase in a unit of water i e the contribution of water to the total output of the productive sector is numerically equivalent to the value of water in a water rights transaction and the other influencing factors are constant it is calculated as follows shao et al 2017 16c b t i y t i w t i ε w y t i w t i where b t i represents the value of water resources in subregion i yuan m3 ε w represents the output elasticity of water resources dimensionless y t i is the gross agricultural product of subregion i yuan w t i represents the water consumption of subregion i in year t m3 one of the influencing factors affecting production and t is the historical year for which the value of water resources is calculated the final c i is obtained by passing b t i through the evaluation system in section 2 2 gross agricultural product y t i was calculated from the cobbdouglas production function douglas 1976 this production function was proposed to quantify the response of output in each water sector to capital and labor inputs and is widely used due to its simplicity and precision li et al 2020 improved the function to allow it to express output in light of technological developments and a wider range of factors the improved c d production function is shown below 16d y t i a 0 e λ t k 1 k x t k ε k where a 0 represents the comprehensive technical level and is dimensionless in the model of this paper the comprehensive production capacity level of different regions is concretely reflected λ represents the coefficient of technological progress which is dimensionless reflecting the change degree of comprehensive production capacity over time x k represents the input of the k influence coefficient which reflects the input amount of production factors such as labor water resources and planting costs ε k represents the output elasticity of the k impact coefficient which is dimensionless and reflects the impact degree of different production factors on the gross product assuming that the production function satisfies the assumption of constant returns to scale then k 1 k ε k 1 2 3 1 2 lower level objective function maximum net economic benefit the lower model of the awras tcme model is the economic benefit model of water rights the establishment of water markets is considered a measure of water rights management allowing zones to conduct water rights transactions in a decentralized manner and attenuating the impact of water shortages zuo et al 2015 zone managers are inclined to maximize economic benefits hu et al 2021 when the upper decision making model allows water rights trading managers pursue more economic benefits for their subregions the objective function is as follows 17 max c e b s u b i 1 m r i i 1 m j 1 n p i j f i j c i j a i j γ x i a i c i w r t i a i c i w r t i a i where c e b s u b represents the objective function of comprehensive economic benefits considering water rights trading 2 3 2 constraints the above objective functions are subject to the following constraints 2 3 2 1 irrigation district water supply constraints the sum of the initial water rights allocation of all users should not exceed the total water allocation of the irrigated area the constraints can be expressed as follows 18 pr i 1 m x i a i q s u r ξ 1 q i where pr represents the probability of meeting the constraint q represents the probability of violation in chance constrained programming q s u r ξ is a random variable representing the water supply of the irrigated area and ξ represents the uncertainty of parameters where uncertainty analysis is performed via chance constrained programming see section 2 2 for details 2 3 2 2 water demand constraint the safe production of food and the fair market of water rights trading are guaranteed by stipulating the distributable water of each area to meet the water demand of crops 19 pr i 1 m x i η i w ξ 1 q i where η i represents the utilization coefficient of irrigation water in zone i which is dimensionless and w ξ represents the minimum water requirement of crops in partition i mm 2 3 2 3 water distribution availability each subregion has three types of water supply that can be allocated to the next level of water demand units water rights allocated from upper leaders water purchased from water markets and effective rainfall that is the total amount of water allocated to crops in the subregion

branch channel i of subdivision m3 ha 2 3 2 4 the transaction constraint the water market also requires some constraints first the water resource sale quantity cannot exceed the water resource sale quantity of the district second the purchase and sale of water resources cannot be performed simultaneously the constraints are expressed as follows 21a w r t i a i x i a i j 1 n y i j a i j i j 21b w

method based on multiple uncertainties and sustainable water rights trading the initial agricultural water rights allocation model in irrigated areas constructed in this study weighs the equity and economic benefits of water rights allocation fig 2 the specific steps used to solve the model are as follows step 1 select 13 indicators from economic social resource and environmental dimensions to build a sustainable evaluation index system and collect investigation data and dynamic monitoring data in table 1 to quantify the 13 indexes section 2 1 1 step 2 normalize the selected indicators from different dimensions in each region put the normalized indicators into the projection pursuit model and solve the model with a genetic algorithm to obtain the best projection direction and the corresponding value the optimal projection direction represents the degree of influence of different indicators on the regional sustainable development level and finally outputs the projection values of different regions as the sustainable development indexes for each region which are input into the c d production function to obtain real water prices step 3 fit the c d production function with historical values of gross agricultural production and the corresponding water consumption labor and costs quantify parameters in the c d model with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers then use the accuracy function to deal with the intuitionistic fuzziness to transfer the uncertain parameter into deterministic ones step 4 input the sustainable development indexes for each region that were obtained in step 2 into the fitted c d model to obtain the weight of water rights trading prices which can reflect the level of regional sustainable development then input this data to the awras tcme model step 5 based on historical data of water supply and demand estimate the parameters of water supply and demand with the moment estimation model and select the piii distribution for probability distribution fitting based on which the different water supply and demand values of wet normal and dry hydrological years with 25 and 75 as the dividing points can be obtained step 6 give different violation probabilities of the ccp model then based on the ccp algorithm obtain different water supply values under different violation probabilities of different hydrological years step 7 construct the awras tcme model including objective functions formulas 16a 16b and 17 constraints formulas 18 23 and decision variables x i y i j w r t i w r t i the main structure of the awras tcme model is bilevel multiobjective nonlinear programming in which the upper model is the initial water rights allocation model and the lower model is the water rights transaction model step 8 based on the above treatment input water supply and demand under different scenarios into the bilevel model and solve it the upper model determines the initial water rights of different regions by maximizing the fairness of water resources and then regards different regions as trading entities in the lower model the water rights are traded by the nash equilibrium strategy and the maximum total income of agricultural production in the irrigation area included in the water rights trading income is taken as the objective function to determine the initial water rights allocation scheme with the greatest income under the premise of water rights trading the decision result is the water rights of different branches in each region the optimization results of the lower model are fed back to the upper model to optimize the decision results of water rights allocation fairness again and the optimal solution is obtained by continuously weighing the target values of the upper and lower models through fuzzy goal programming step 7 after solving the model water rights allocation and transfer schemes with different violation probabilities in different hydrological years can be obtained 3 application 3 1 study area a real case study was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed framework the case study involves the changgang irrigation district cid located in heilongjiang province northeast china with geographical coordinates e126 24 16 126 26 38 and n46 15 21 46 17 46 the total irrigated area is 2800 ha including four zones r1 4 this study considers only one crop rice the irrigated area has a cold temperate subhumid monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 470 mm and an average annual evaporation of 1200 mm the irrigation area is a water carrying irrigation area with the hulan river as the water source and a total of 1000 ha of paddy field is irrigated the annual water consumption is 1134 104 m3 and there is 1 main channel and 11 branch channels which are evenly distributed fig 3 cid has several problems 1 the mechanism for water rights is unclear and water rights use is unreasonable leading to the inefficient use of water in low flow years and water waste in high flow years 2 the trading of water rights in irrigated areas cannot satisfy the role of market regulation and there is a lack of a reasonable initial water rights distribution mechanism and water rights trading price and 3 significant variations in the hulan river and precipitation which are the two main water sources for cid lead to dynamic water cycles in addition the flow of the rural population and the usage of water in an environmentally hazardous way bring uncertainty to irrigation district management these factors increase the complexity of water management for cid based on the above practical problems we adopted the developed awras tcme model to help increase economic benefits and promote the sustainable use of water resources for cid 3 2 input data the data involved in the awras tcme model include hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data irrigation data and river data data sources include the china geospatial data cloud china earth system science data sharing network china meteorological science data sharing service network and changgang irrigation area feasibility study report the awras tcme model is applied to the changgang irrigated area since only one crop is irrigated only rice related parameters are considered the study is based on data from 2020 the awras tcme model includes area yield cost effective rainfall coefficient of irrigation actual flow price and net income data which are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material the relation between yield and irrigation quantity was fitted by the c d production function as follows f i j 0 00114 η i y i j 2 11 85 η i y i j 23194 34 i j the minimum crop water requirement w min in the constraint is equal to the actual evapotranspiration minus the effective rainfall calculated using penman s formula see the supplementary material for the formula rice growth cycles and crop coefficients are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials the improved c d production function was used to calculate the water resource value of the four districts in the irrigated area the elastic coefficients of each region are shown in table 2 and the time related parameter λ is negative thus the output is adversely affected by other factors 3 3 data on evaluation indicators for sustainable use of agricultural water rights trading related parameters in the evaluation indicators are shown in tables s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary material the results of each evaluation index are shown in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 water rights allocation under uncertainty 4 1 1 uncertainty of water supply and demand the awras tcme model considers the uncertainty of water supply and demand for water rights allocation via ccp long series data of water supply and demand quantified by actual evapotranspiration of the cid were shown in fig 4 the piii distribution recognized hydrologic frequency curve line in china song 1988 was selected for probability distribution fitting of water supply and demand as shown in fig 5 based on steps 4 and 5 in section 2 4 the water supply and demand with different violation probabilities q 0 05 0 1 1 5 0 2 and 0 5 under the three scenarios of wet normal and dry were obtained table 4 the changing trends of water supply and water demand were opposites more specifically the value of water supply gradually increased as the violation probabilities increased and the value also increased from dry to wet during the hydrological years while the reverse changing tendency appeared for water demand these changing values of water supply and demand reflect the randomness of hydrological elements and they were input into the developed awras tcme model to gain insight into how the randomness of natural elements affects water rights allocation and trading 4 1 2 water rights allocation the awras tcme model adopts a two level programming model the influence of the upper and lower layers on the decision was mutual and the strategy must be adjusted repeatedly to achieve a relatively stable state based on the randomness inputs of water supply and demand the initial water rights of each branch channel in the irrigated area under different violation probabilities were obtained table 5 in dry years for example fig 6 shows that as the probability of violations increases the lateral canal slightly increases the amount of water rights because the model of water rights for each partition in dry years was less the results show that the changes in water supply caused by the violation probability directly affect the lower level of water rights allocation however water rights allocation in normal and dry years remains unchanged taking the violation probability q 0 05 as an example the optimization results of water rights in wet normal and dry years were 810 28 104 m3 796 87 104 m3 and 704 93 104 m3 respectively compared with the actual irrigation water volume in the current year the total water rights allocation after optimization was reduced by 4 7 20 9 in the process of initial water rights allocation we obtained that excessive attention to regional equity was not conducive to regional sustainable development based on the upper level of water rights allocation the lower level of the model conducts secondary allocation of initial water rights by considering the economic benefits of water resources in different regions based on the water price that was obtained by a comprehensive assessment see section 4 2 1 according to the distribution results fig 7 compared with the current situation the water rights of branch channels c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 and c10 were reduced by varying degrees the largest reduction in water allocation was in branch c5 with a reduction of 26 8 and the smallest reduction was in branch c10 with a reduction of 4 7 an average reduction of 13 5 in water allocation which was helpful to promote a water saving consciousness to farmers in these areas the water rights of the other branches increased indicating that an appropriate increase in water resource input would be beneficial to improve the economic benefits of rice cultivation 4 2 water rights trading 4 2 1 comprehensive water price assessment in this paper projection pursuit was used to evaluate the dynamic sustainability index the water price was evaluated and analyzed based on 13 indexes and the real value of water resources was finally output based on the investigation the cost of planting and the input of labor and other factors were relatively average and stable among regions the evaluation results show that the change trend of the water resource value in the four regions was roughly the same the change in the marginal value of water resources can be obtained by calculating the c d production function as shown in fig 8 to comprehensively consider the uncertainty of the water resource value in each year intuitionistic fuzzy numbers were used to remove the ambiguity in the data finally the real values of water resources in zones r1 r4 were calculated as 1 15 1 34 1 43 and 1 29 yuan m3 the value of water resources in zones r2 and r3 was slightly greater than that in zones r1 and r4 which was the result of comprehensive quantification of various factors such as soil properties topography and production inputs the projection pursuit model was used to conduct a multidimensional comprehensive evaluation of the four zones in the cid the basic data set in table 2 was used as the input of the model the optimal projection directions were 0 44 0 36 0 35 0 38 0 17 0 26 0 41 0 02 0 02 0 34 0 03 0 07 and 0 16 and the projection value was 0 59 the sustainability index of the four zones was 0 12 0 12 0 33 and 0 42 by weighting the real value of water resources with the sustainable index the trading prices of sustainable water rights were calculated as 1 15 1 34 1 64 and 1 57 yuan m3 among which the trading prices of r1 and r2 were relatively low therefore when trading water rights the circulation of water rights will tend to occur in regions with higher comprehensive benefits and higher sustainable development levels r3 and r4 the water rights trading price obtained from the comprehensive evaluation of each dimension fully reflects the regional sustainable development level and takes into account the real value of water resources which has practical significance for the formulation of water rights trading prices in irrigated areas 4 2 2 water rights trading schemes excess use of water requires water rights to be purchased from the water banks of other districts to satisfy the irrigation demand for the year such measures will force the planting industry in the region to implement water saving measures and improve the utilization efficiency of water resources surplus water rights can be sold through a water bank at a reasonable price converting the water rights savings into additional water saving income taking the current year as an example the maximum profit of water rights trading brought by water saving potential can reach 38 45 104 yuan in summary water rights trading can effectively transfer water rights to areas with higher planting benefits and encourage farmers to implement water saving irrigation in addition the maximum amount of water right trading in wet and normal years was 132 40 104 m3 and 39 06 104 m3 accounting for 4 8 12 9 of the total water rights the maximum system net income was 1335 54 104 yuan and 1307 66 104 yuan 1 2 3 3 higher than that in the current year the maximum trading volume of water rights was 216 61 104 yuan and 63 90 104 yuan accounting for 5 16 2 of the system s net income additionally the equity index of water right trading decreased by 0 06 0 09 moreover as shown in fig 9 as the violation probability increases the net revenue of the system increases but the fairness decreases in this case managers can choose different water right trading schemes based on their different decision making preferences in general the model can effectively optimize the water right trading scheme under the combination of multiple supply and demand scenarios and violation probabilities and provide decision support for the trading of water rights in irrigation areas under different scenarios this study allocates water rights in irrigated areas but not all possible components and processes were described in detail for example uncertainties caused by the correlation between the supply and demand of water should be quantified the estimation of the true value of water resources can further consider the input of multiple production factors and damage to the production environment and decision makers can develop their own site specific applications based on the framework of the model 4 3 model performance the variance was used to evaluate the performance of the model a smaller value indicates a higher level of regional sustainability the results show that the variance based on the improved model was 0 29 which was 22 9 lower than the current situation indicating that the sustainability of the irrigation area has been improved moreover the harmony degree was used to present the superiority of the developed model in improving regional sustainability a higher value of the harmony degree means a higher level of regional sustainability the results show that the harmony degree from the optimal water rights allocation was 30 higher than that in the current situation the above results manifest that synergistically considering the fairness efficiency and benefit for water rights optimal allocation and transfer has practical significance for water rights trading in modern irrigation areas 5 conclusions this study constructs an initial agricultural water rights allocation and trading model for irrigation districts under multiple uncertainties the following characteristics make the developed model unique 1 water rights allocation and trading were optimized simultaneously in a robust system based on a two level multiobjective programming framework to achieve a balance of economic benefit water savings and water resources use equity 2 the dynamics of hydrological elements and multiple factors from economic social and environmental dimensions were considered together and evaluated to realize their comprehensive effect on water prices and water trading 3 randomness uncertainty of water supply and demand and fuzzy uncertainty of management factors were quantified to gain insight into how the external changing environment affects water rights allocation and trading and thus the corresponding water management plans were generated to help make decisions in different conditions the constructed model was applied to the changgang irrigation district in heilongjiang province northeast china and the main findings were as follows the transfer of water rights tends to occur in regions with higher comprehensive benefits and higher sustainable development levels compared with the current level the optimal net income was expected to increase by 1 2 3 3 and the equity of water rights allocation can be increased by 6 9 the average water right of each branch canal was reduced by 13 30 which was helpful to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources for the irrigation area in this study the water rights of irrigation areas were allocated to achieve the synergy of water use economic benefit and social equity considering the uncertainty and changing impacts of natural elements however changes in the external environment make the water rights allocation process more complicated for example different uncertain factors such as water supply and demand were linked and their impacts on water rights allocation and transfer were not independent this relationship will affect the accuracy of the model to some extent and requires future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9036,the optimal allocation of agricultural water rights is of great importance in promoting the efficient management of water resources in irrigation areas in the process of agricultural water rights allocation problems develop when the dynamics and uncertainties caused by changes in water cycle elements are ignored to balance socioeconomic development and environmental protection this study develops a model framework for evaluating and optimizing the synergistic management of agricultural water rights allocation trading under multiple uncertainties awras tcme the model is capable of reflecting the dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall evapotranspiration and runoff and quantitatively measures the synergistic effect of multidimensional objectives of the economy society resources environment on water rights allocations and transactions the awras tcme model integrates a two level multiobjective nonlinear programming model and a projection tracking model into a framework to measure the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation based on an analysis of the sustainability of water rights prices in multiple dimensions fully considering the influence of uncertainties in hydrological and social systems the model was applied to an actual irrigation area and the results showed that 1 total optimized water rights allocation was reduced by 4 7 20 9 at different levels of water supply and demand 2 the total volume of water rights transfer among regions was increased by 4 8 12 9 and the trading volume of the water rights market was increased to account for 5 16 2 of the total revenue and 3 the optimal net income of water rights allocation was increased by 1 2 3 3 and the equity of water rights allocation was increased by 0 06 0 09 the developed model promotes the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigated areas keywords agricultural water rights management two tier planning models sustainability assessment dynamism multiple uncertainties 1 introduction as water scarcity increases water conservation and protection have become some of the controlling factors necessary to ensure human survival and social development liu and shang 2022 agriculture consumes the most water accounting for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater li et al 2020 in china more than half of arable land is cultivated through irrigation irrigation districts are the mainstay and important foundation for national food security and socioeconomic development huang et al 2022 however irrigation districts are also the main agricultural water using and water consuming sector accounting for approximately 65 of the total agricultural irrigation water used in the country zhang et al 2019 as water use continues to increase better management of water resources in irrigation areas has become an effective means of addressing agricultural water stress wang et al 2017 water rights trading can facilitate the optimal allocation of water resources chen et al 2021 the optimal allocation of agricultural water rights can maintain the relative balance of agroecosystems and achieve sustainable use of water resources cheng et al 2021 therefore agricultural water rights management is an important tool to achieve sustainable use of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas the reduction in water rights distribution means that the consumption of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas is eased and the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources in irrigation areas can be realized through effective management of agricultural water rights the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture and the trading of water rights are two important components of agricultural water rights management lin and lin 2020 many scholars have developed mathematical models for water rights and or trading from different angles for example zeng et al 2015 and zeng et al 2016b developed water trading models for water resource management that address uncertainty to optimize the water trading amount water allocation pattern and system benefit under different probabilities for the kaidu qongque river basin the results show that water trading can effectively allocate limited water resources to competitive users with a maximized system benefit delorit and block 2018 developed a coupled agricultural economic water rights trading model based on cooperative demand balance and showed that the average annual expected profit generated by water rights trading was significantly higher than the profit obtained without interaction cheng al 2021 developed a modeling approach for agricultural water rights allocation that considers the carrying capacity of agricultural water resources the results of which show that the model increased the economic benefit and enhanced the agricultural water carrying capacity by optimally adjusting water quantity quality and planting and breeding structure these works have verified that water rights allocation and trading have the ability to improve regional economic development and moreover they have provided ideas for water rights allocation and trading modeling to support future studies the initial allocation of water rights limits the trading volume of water rights reasonable allocation of water rights according to regional water demand requirements is the equity basis of water rights trading and an increase in water rights allocation may reduce the frequency and quantity of water rights trading in addition the income or expenditure share of water rights trading directly affects the comprehensive benefits of a region and can prompt a region to adjust its water rights allocation strategy to improve production benefits li et al 2019 however most existing studies focus on only one of these aspects initial water rights allocation or water rights trading therefore an optimal two tier allocation system for agricultural initial water rights and water trading has an important role to play in the sustainable use of water resources reasonable initial allocation of water rights in agriculture is an important prerequisite for the scientific allocation of water rights lin and lin 2020 many studies regarding the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture often involve complex stochastic and interdependent structural information and it is particularly important to objectively determine the methodology the initial allocation of water rights in agriculture is based on an initial weighting of each region and previous studies have generally used the assignment method to determine the initial water rights in agriculture with distinct regional characteristics and subjective considerations for example zhang et al 2021 constructed an optimal allocation model of irrigation water rights in arid areas in which the allocation of initial water rights was determined according to crop planting area and crop water demand per unit area linker 2020 established an optimization model of planting area and water rights allocation and the allocation of initial water rights was determined according to the historical experience data of various regions in reality the allocation of initial water rights in agriculture often involves complex stochastic and interdependent structural information and it is particularly important to objectively determine the methodology initial water rights allocation models that reflect equity are an effective way to address subjective empowerment eras and fandio 2022 ye et al 2022 a model for the initial allocation of water rights in agriculture that considers fairness can guide the rational trading of water rights leading to better decisions on the final allocation of water rights willis et al 2021 water rights trading is affected by the water cycle water quality and other economic social resource and environmental factors berbel and expósito 2022 most current studies ignore the impact of multidimensional factors on water rights trading or consider the static response of only a few dimensions resource and environmental factors are often closely linked to the water cycle and agronomic practices tend to change over time and are dynamic and time sensitive zhao et al 2022 static representations of the impact of multiple dimensions on water rights trading clearly do not provide a comprehensive guide to water rights allocation the construction of a dynamic water rights trading evaluation indicator weighting system that assigns indicator weights to water prices in agricultural water rights trading can quantitatively characterize the impact of the dynamics of indicators closely linked to the water cycle and agronomic measures on water rights trading and is of great practical importance in obtaining a reasonable water rights allocation scheme however there are few reports on the construction of a two level optimal allocation system of water rights trading based on the fairness of initial agricultural water rights allocation and a multidimensional dynamic evaluation system agricultural water rights allocation is affected by multiple factors such as the hydrological environment and management system resulting in uncertainty risks brought by uncertainty can impact agricultural water rights allocation schemes therefore the impact of uncertainty on water rights allocation must be reduced delorit and block 2018 in the case of water supply and demand systems uncertainty may be driven by a combination of hydrological environmental variability and hydrological changes caused by social systems milly et al 2008 with the increasing complexity of water supply and demand accurate information on random variable distributions is difficult to predict to provide warnings some scholars have considered the uncertainties in water rights allocation and trading for example zeng et al 2016a developed a fuzzy stochastic programming with green z score criterion method for water resources allocation and water quality management with a trading mechanism under uncertainty which can handle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and can quantify objective subjective fuzziness in the decision making process zhang et al 2022 constructed an evaluation model of agricultural water resource allocation in irrigation areas which considered the random uncertainty of inflow levels and different risk levels of irrigation areas such studies focused on thoroughly understanding the uncertainty of the water supply on water rights allocation or trading however in addition to water supply the data source statistical deviation or deficiency of the management system and other reasons can affect the water price in water rights trading leading to uncertainty in the data and affecting the water rights trading model and water rights allocation scheme comprehensive consideration of the hydrological environment and management system uncertainty is of practical significance for the objective management of agricultural water rights in summary this study proposes an optimization model framework for the cooperative management evaluation of agricultural water rights allocation and transaction awras tcme under multiple uncertainties to balance the fairness and economic benefits of water rights allocation in irrigated areas the awras tcme model weighs the impact of economic social resource and environmental factors on water rights trading and considers the effects of multiple uncertainties in the hydrological environment and management system on the model to reflect the impact of dynamic changes in meteorological and hydrological elements on water rights allocation the model allocates initial agricultural water rights and trades unreasonable water rights after allocation applying the model to actual irrigated areas the management of water rights in irrigated areas can reduce agricultural water use and increase the value of agricultural benefits while ensuring adequate agricultural production providing valuable insights for current and future water resource management 2 research method this section is divided into five main modules the data module the evaluation module where the projection pursuit model is used to construct an evaluation model for 13 indicators related to the economy society resources and environment and the price of water rights determined by the cobbdouglas production function c d production function is evaluated and the optimization module where the coupled equity agricultural initial water rights allocation model and water rights trading model are connected through a two level multiobjective nonlinear programming model the weight output by the evaluation module is assigned to the water rights price the water rights price after weighting is inserted into the optimization module and the evaluation module and optimization module are connected the evaluation index affects the final allocation scheme of the optimization model by influencing the real value of water resources the whole evaluation optimization model framework is quantified in an uncertain environment the uncertainty of hydrologic supply and demand is quantified by means of a chance programming constraint and the uncertainty in the management water price is quantified by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers which constitutes the uncertainty module finally for the model output module the specific technical roadmap is as follows fig 1 2 1 evaluation index system for sustainable use of agricultural water rights trading the water rights allocation scheme of the awras tcme model is often affected by the water price of water rights trading the determination of the water price is significantly affected by the economy society resources and environment and the dynamic change in indicators is reflected by changes in various dimensions peng and deng 2015 changes in the index are caused by dynamic changes in the water cycle and agronomic measures so the construction of a dynamic weight system of the water rights allocation evaluation index has a significant impact on the final water rights allocation scheme the sustainability evaluation system follows the three principles of equity efficiency and sustainability siddiqi 2021 according to the above principles and considering the four dimensions of economy society resources and environment 13 evaluation indexes closely related to the allocation of water rights and the water cycle are selected and the dynamic index parameters must be monitored and obtained 2 1 1 evaluation indicators 2 1 1 1 economic factors 2 1 1 1 1 gross production an important indicator for measuring agricultural productivity in different regions reflects the effectiveness of water users in improving water use efficiency and crop yield by relying on various cropping methods yu et al 2021 the total output of each region is calculated by the product of the output per unit area and the area of each region 2 1 1 1 2 water consumption per gdp this value reflects the dependence of different regions on resources to obtain the same income and promote maximum economic benefits at the lowest water cost li c et al 2022 the water consumption per unit gdp is calculated by dividing the gdp of each region by the total water consumption 2 1 1 2 social factors 2 1 1 2 1 labor force population the larger the regional population is the more land to be confirmed and the greater the agricultural water demand diallo et al 2020 this indicator is obtained by actual data investigation 2 1 1 2 2 water consumption per unit area this parameter reflects the consumption of regional irrigation water resources and has guiding significance for the application and consumption of irrigation water chen et al 2020 this indicator is obtained by actual data investigation 2 1 1 2 3 the water efficiency of irrigation this indicator represents the utilization efficiency of regional irrigation water resources which is an important index of efficiency li et al 2021 the water efficiency of irrigation is obtained by dividing the total output by the total irrigation water 2 1 1 3 resource factors 2 1 1 3 1 crop planting area this indicator reflects the current distribution of arable land the amount of arable land affects the use of water resources the degree of water resource waste and the potential for irrigation water savings li et al 2020 these data are obtained by data query 2 1 1 3 2 soil water content and soil infiltration rate these are dynamic parameters that change over time changes in the soil water content and soil infiltration rate impact the soil properties and the farmland water cycle in turn changes in the farmland water cycle affect the amount of irrigation water and the allocation of water rights the data are obtained through dynamic monitoring by a soil moisture meter the green water footprint is the minimum value of the total actual evapotranspiration e t c a c t of crops and effective rainfall and the total green water footprint is the result of the sum of the green water footprints in each growth stage of rice ma et al 2022 e t c a c t and effective rainfall are parameters that vary with temperature

certain standard ansorge 2021 the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in various stages of crop production is a dynamic process that leads to different levels of water pollution on the basis of the different contents of fertilizers applied in the monitored crop growth process nitrogen fertilizer is selected as the representative pollutant to estimate the gray water footprint of the planting industry the formula is as follows see table 1 for parameter meanings 2 w f g r e y p l a n t α d o s f e r c max c n a t crop carbon footprint this value is an estimate of the carbon footprint of the

1 1 the construction of the evaluation index system of the dynamic sustainable use of agricultural water rights reflects the real water rights allocation conditions but there are uncertainties and ambiguities among the evaluation indexes to address the problems of human interference and incompatibility among the results of various evaluation indexes this study uses the projection pursuit model kanatani 1985 to link all evaluation indexes projection pursuit is a new statistical method for processing and analyzing high dimensional data that has obvious advantages in overcoming the curse of dimensionality and solving problems such as small sample sizes and extremely high dimensionality a brief summary of the algorithm of the projection pursuit evaluation model for sustainable evaluation of water resource allocation is as follows 1 data preprocessing the data set of the evaluation index system of sustainable utilization of irrigation water is x i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the sustainable evaluation index value of the j of the i zone is obtained by normalization m and n are the total number of zones and the total number of sustainable evaluation indicators respectively 2 construct the projection index function ppe is the one dimensional projection value z i that integrates m dimensional data x i j j 1 2 n into a a 1 a 2 a m as the projection direction 3 optimizing the projection index function the problem of searching for the optimal projection direction is transformed into a nonlinear optimal solution problem 4 calculate the best projection direction and value given the sample set of sustainable evaluation index values the projection index function changes only with changes in the projection direction different projection directions reflect different features of the data and the best projection direction is the one that reflects a certain feature of high dimensional data to the greatest extent in this study a genetic algorithm is applied to solve the high dimensional global optimization problem 2 2 uncertainty the awras tcme model optimizes the two objectives of agricultural water rights distribution fairness and the economic benefits of water rights to determine the allocation of water rights in this section chance constrained programming and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to quantify the uncertainty caused by the hydrological environment and management systems 2 2 1 chance constrained planning the awras tcme model focuses on the allocation and optimization of water rights hence the supply and demand of water resources becomes an important parameter of the model however the supply and demand of water resources are greatly affected by the hydrological environment which leads to an unpredictable distribution of random variables of water supply and demand and affects the final water rights transaction and designation of the water rights allocation scheme therefore the chance constrained programming model is used to quantify the uncertainty of water supply and demand chance constrained programming can be used to quantify the relationship between the optimal value of the objective function and the optimal solution set of decision variables and the random coefficients in the model the optimal value of the random objective function and the optimal solution set of decision variables can be estimated at a specified level of confidence opportunity constrained programming is widely used because it can address the occurrence of adverse situations and allow the decision to not meet the constraints to a certain extent and the decision results can be established when the constraints are satisfied and not less than a certain confidence level probability to effectively solve the problem of fuzzy random variable information zhou et al 2022 chance constrained programming can address random parameters in the left and right side terms of the constraint guo et al 2008 linear programming problems with random variables in the constraints can be expressed as follows 15a max f r 1 r c r x r constraints 15b pr r 1 r a p r x r b p ξ 1 q p 1 2 p 15c x r 0 r 1 2 r where f is the objective function x r is the decision variable and a p r and b p ξ are input parameters where b p ξ is a random parameter to simplify the model transformation process it is assumed that b p ξ follows a normal distribution that is b p ξ n μ b p σ b p 2 1 q q 0 1 is the predetermined confidence level for the corresponding random constraints and q represents the violation probability of the corresponding random constraints the higher the confidence level is the smaller the probability of violation 2 2 2 intuitionistic fuzzy set intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can effectively reflect the uncertainty of numerical values compared to conventional fuzzy numbers intuitionistic fuzzy numbers provide more abundant information and can represent components of the management system of the data source the statistical deviation and uncertainty this paper builds a model of water resource values such as the fuzzy membership degree the degree of membership of uncertain parameters and hesitation degrees mahajan and gupta 2020 intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can address the uncertainty of such data an intuitionistic fuzzy number is an uncertain fuzzy model that can be solved only after the model is determined the accuracy function is deterministic and the intuitionistic fuzzy number transforms the uncertainty model into a deterministic model through the accuracy function in this study the price of water resources for many years can be obtained after the value of water resources is determined by the c d production function the influence of water price data on the awras tcme model is obvious and the fluctuation of data will produce different water rights allocation schemes so the ambiguity of water prices in many years data is eliminated by using intuitive fuzzy sets see the supplementary materials for the specific formula 2 3 optimization model the awras tcme model optimization module discusses the relationship between the upper level water rights allocation model considering equity and the lower level water rights economic benefit model under this framework the upper model has a higher priority in allocating the initial water rights to each zone the initial allocation of water rights is conducted based on the principle of fairness when a district obtains the decision of the irrigation district administration the lower model is used to redistribute water rights and trade water rights to each branch channel of the district based on the principle of maximum economic benefits and the optimal allocation strategy is obtained in this way we can optimize the allocation of water rights and analyze the potential income and water saving potential brought by water rights trading 2 3 1 objective functions 2 3 1 1 upper level objective function maximum fairness the upper model of the awras tcme model determines initial water rights which affect water rights trading comprehensive and objective determination of initial water rights is important for subsequent water rights trading zhang et al 2018 initial water rights allocation based on equity can narrow the gap in benefits of the initial water rights allocation of each zoning unit yan et al 2022 the gini coefficient can objectively and intuitively reflect the resource gap between regions and forecast and warn about and prevent the polarization of resource allocation among regions because it reflects the quantitative boundary of resource differences between regions therefore the gini coefficient which captures the extent of resource differences among regions was used to construct the upper level decision model ye et al 2022 the objective function is as follows 16a min w a e g i n i 1 2 m i 1 m x i a i r i i 1 m i 2 m x i a i r i x i a i r i where w a e g i n i is a dimensionless objective function of the equity of the initial water rights allocation i is the subregion serial number m is the total number of subregions and x i represents the initial water rights in region i in m3 ha which is determined by higher level decision makers and is a decision variable in the upper level model a i is the planting area of partition i ha r i is the net income of subdivision yuan the function expression is as follows 1b x i a i r i is the amount of water rights allocation per unit economic benefit of zone i m3 ha thus the simulation looks for the best water allocation pattern for growing more rice with less water the net income function is the profit of crop yield 16b r i j 1 n p i j f i j c i j a i j γ x i a i c i w r t i a i c i w r t i a i where j stands for the branch channel number n is the total number of branch channels p i j represents the crop unit price of branch channel j of subdivision i yuan kg f i j is the crop yield of branch channel j of subdivision i kg ha indicates that the data are processed via intuitionistic fuzzy numbers c i j is the crop planting cost of branch channel j of subdivision i yuan ha including seeds fertilizers pesticides machinery labor etc a i j is the crop planting area of branch channel j of subdivision i ha γ represents the current agricultural water price in the irrigated area yuan m3 c i represents the price of water in water rights trading in subregion i yuan m3 which is quantified through the evaluation system in chapter 2 2 w r t i represents the amount of water rights purchased by subarea i from other subareas and w r t i represents the amount of water rights sold to other subregions by subregion i according to marginal equilibrium theory the increase in output resulting from an increase in a unit of water i e the contribution of water to the total output of the productive sector is numerically equivalent to the value of water in a water rights transaction and the other influencing factors are constant it is calculated as follows shao et al 2017 16c b t i y t i w t i ε w y t i w t i where b t i represents the value of water resources in subregion i yuan m3 ε w represents the output elasticity of water resources dimensionless y t i is the gross agricultural product of subregion i yuan w t i represents the water consumption of subregion i in year t m3 one of the influencing factors affecting production and t is the historical year for which the value of water resources is calculated the final c i is obtained by passing b t i through the evaluation system in section 2 2 gross agricultural product y t i was calculated from the cobbdouglas production function douglas 1976 this production function was proposed to quantify the response of output in each water sector to capital and labor inputs and is widely used due to its simplicity and precision li et al 2020 improved the function to allow it to express output in light of technological developments and a wider range of factors the improved c d production function is shown below 16d y t i a 0 e λ t k 1 k x t k ε k where a 0 represents the comprehensive technical level and is dimensionless in the model of this paper the comprehensive production capacity level of different regions is concretely reflected λ represents the coefficient of technological progress which is dimensionless reflecting the change degree of comprehensive production capacity over time x k represents the input of the k influence coefficient which reflects the input amount of production factors such as labor water resources and planting costs ε k represents the output elasticity of the k impact coefficient which is dimensionless and reflects the impact degree of different production factors on the gross product assuming that the production function satisfies the assumption of constant returns to scale then k 1 k ε k 1 2 3 1 2 lower level objective function maximum net economic benefit the lower model of the awras tcme model is the economic benefit model of water rights the establishment of water markets is considered a measure of water rights management allowing zones to conduct water rights transactions in a decentralized manner and attenuating the impact of water shortages zuo et al 2015 zone managers are inclined to maximize economic benefits hu et al 2021 when the upper decision making model allows water rights trading managers pursue more economic benefits for their subregions the objective function is as follows 17 max c e b s u b i 1 m r i i 1 m j 1 n p i j f i j c i j a i j γ x i a i c i w r t i a i c i w r t i a i where c e b s u b represents the objective function of comprehensive economic benefits considering water rights trading 2 3 2 constraints the above objective functions are subject to the following constraints 2 3 2 1 irrigation district water supply constraints the sum of the initial water rights allocation of all users should not exceed the total water allocation of the irrigated area the constraints can be expressed as follows 18 pr i 1 m x i a i q s u r ξ 1 q i where pr represents the probability of meeting the constraint q represents the probability of violation in chance constrained programming q s u r ξ is a random variable representing the water supply of the irrigated area and ξ represents the uncertainty of parameters where uncertainty analysis is performed via chance constrained programming see section 2 2 for details 2 3 2 2 water demand constraint the safe production of food and the fair market of water rights trading are guaranteed by stipulating the distributable water of each area to meet the water demand of crops 19 pr i 1 m x i η i w ξ 1 q i where η i represents the utilization coefficient of irrigation water in zone i which is dimensionless

method based on multiple uncertainties and sustainable water rights trading the initial agricultural water rights allocation model in irrigated areas constructed in this study weighs the equity and economic benefits of water rights allocation fig 2 the specific steps used to solve the model are as follows step 1 select 13 indicators from economic social resource and environmental dimensions to build a sustainable evaluation index system and collect investigation data and dynamic monitoring data in table 1 to quantify the 13 indexes section 2 1 1 step 2 normalize the selected indicators from different dimensions in each region put the normalized indicators into the projection pursuit model and solve the model with a genetic algorithm to obtain the best projection direction and the corresponding value the optimal projection direction represents the degree of influence of different indicators on the regional sustainable development level and finally outputs the projection values of different regions as the sustainable development indexes for each region which are input into the c d production function to obtain real water prices step 3 fit the c d production function with historical values of gross agricultural production and the corresponding water consumption labor and costs quantify parameters in the c d model with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers then use the accuracy function to deal with the intuitionistic fuzziness to transfer the uncertain parameter into deterministic ones step 4 input the sustainable development indexes for each region that were obtained in step 2 into the fitted c d model to obtain the weight of water rights trading prices which can reflect the level of regional sustainable development then input this data to the awras tcme model step 5 based on historical data of water supply and demand estimate the parameters of water supply and demand with the moment estimation model and select the piii distribution for probability distribution fitting based on which the different water supply and demand values of wet normal and dry hydrological years with 25 and 75 as the dividing points can be obtained step 6 give different violation probabilities of the ccp model then based on the ccp algorithm obtain different water supply values under different violation probabilities of different hydrological years step 7 construct the awras tcme model including objective functions formulas 16a 16b and 17 constraints formulas 18 23 and decision variables x i y i j w r t i w r t i the main structure of the awras tcme model is bilevel multiobjective nonlinear programming in which the upper model is the initial water rights allocation model and the lower model is the water rights transaction model step 8 based on the above treatment input water supply and demand under different scenarios into the bilevel model and solve it the upper model determines the initial water rights of different regions by maximizing the fairness of water resources and then regards different regions as trading entities in the lower model the water rights are traded by the nash equilibrium strategy and the maximum total income of agricultural production in the irrigation area included in the water rights trading income is taken as the objective function to determine the initial water rights allocation scheme with the greatest income under the premise of water rights trading the decision result is the water rights of different branches in each region the optimization results of the lower model are fed back to the upper model to optimize the decision results of water rights allocation fairness again and the optimal solution is obtained by continuously weighing the target values of the upper and lower models through fuzzy goal programming step 7 after solving the model water rights allocation and transfer schemes with different violation probabilities in different hydrological years can be obtained 3 application 3 1 study area a real case study was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed framework the case study involves the changgang irrigation district cid located in heilongjiang province northeast china with geographical coordinates e126 24 16 126 26 38 and n46 15 21 46 17 46 the total irrigated area is 2800 ha including four zones r1 4 this study considers only one crop rice the irrigated area has a cold temperate subhumid monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 470 mm and an average annual evaporation of 1200 mm the irrigation area is a water carrying irrigation area with the hulan river as the water source and a total of 1000 ha of paddy field is irrigated the annual water consumption is 1134 104 m3 and there is 1 main channel and 11 branch channels which are evenly distributed fig 3 cid has several problems 1 the mechanism for water rights is unclear and water rights use is unreasonable leading to the inefficient use of water in low flow years and water waste in high flow years 2 the trading of water rights in irrigated areas cannot satisfy the role of market regulation and there is a lack of a reasonable initial water rights distribution mechanism and water rights trading price and 3 significant variations in the hulan river and precipitation which are the two main water sources for cid lead to dynamic water cycles in addition the flow of the rural population and the usage of water in an environmentally hazardous way bring uncertainty to irrigation district management these factors increase the complexity of water management for cid based on the above practical problems we adopted the developed awras tcme model to help increase economic benefits and promote the sustainable use of water resources for cid 3 2 input data the data involved in the awras tcme model include hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data irrigation data and river data data sources include the china geospatial data cloud china earth system science data sharing network china meteorological science data sharing service network and changgang irrigation area feasibility study report the awras tcme model is applied to the changgang irrigated area since only one crop is irrigated only rice related parameters are considered the study is based on data from 2020 the awras tcme model includes area yield cost effective rainfall coefficient of irrigation actual flow price and net income data which are shown in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material the relation between yield and irrigation quantity was fitted by the c d production function as follows f i j 0 00114 η i y i j 2 11 85 η i y i j 23194 34 i j the minimum crop water requirement w min in the constraint is equal to the actual evapotranspiration minus the effective rainfall calculated using penman s formula see the supplementary material for the formula rice growth cycles and crop coefficients are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials the improved c d production function was used to calculate the water resource value of the four districts in the irrigated area the elastic coefficients of each region are shown in table 2 and the time related parameter λ is negative thus the output is adversely affected by other factors 3 3 data on evaluation indicators for sustainable use of agricultural water rights trading related parameters in the evaluation indicators are shown in tables s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary material the results of each evaluation index are shown in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 water rights allocation under uncertainty 4 1 1 uncertainty of water supply and demand the awras tcme model considers the uncertainty of water supply and demand for water rights allocation via ccp long series data of water supply and demand quantified by actual evapotranspiration of the cid were shown in fig 4 the piii distribution recognized hydrologic frequency curve line in china song 1988 was selected for probability distribution fitting of water supply and demand as shown in fig 5 based on steps 4 and 5 in section 2 4 the water supply and demand with different violation probabilities q 0 05 0 1 1 5 0 2 and 0 5 under the three scenarios of wet normal and dry were obtained table 4 the changing trends of water supply and water demand were opposites more specifically the value of water supply gradually increased as the violation probabilities increased and the value also increased from dry to wet during the hydrological years while the reverse changing tendency appeared for water demand these changing values of water supply and demand reflect the randomness of hydrological elements and they were input into the developed awras tcme model to gain insight into how the randomness of natural elements affects water rights allocation and trading 4 1 2 water rights allocation the awras tcme model adopts a two level programming model the influence of the upper and lower layers on the decision was mutual and the strategy must be adjusted repeatedly to achieve a relatively stable state based on the randomness inputs of water supply and demand the initial water rights of each branch channel in the irrigated area under different violation probabilities were obtained table 5 in dry years for example fig 6 shows that as the probability of violations increases the lateral canal slightly increases the amount of water rights because the model of water rights for each partition in dry years was less the results show that the changes in water supply caused by the violation probability directly affect the lower level of water rights allocation however water rights allocation in normal and dry years remains unchanged taking the violation probability q 0 05 as an example the optimization results of water rights in wet normal and dry years were 810 28 104 m3 796 87 104 m3 and 704 93 104 m3 respectively compared with the actual irrigation water volume in the current year the total water rights allocation after optimization was reduced by 4 7 20 9 in the process of initial water rights allocation we obtained that excessive attention to regional equity was not conducive to regional sustainable development based on the upper level of water rights allocation the lower level of the model conducts secondary allocation of initial water rights by considering the economic benefits of water resources in different regions based on the water price that was obtained by a comprehensive assessment see section 4 2 1 according to the distribution results fig 7 compared with the current situation the water rights of branch channels c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 and c10 were reduced by varying degrees the largest reduction in water allocation was in branch c5 with a reduction of 26 8 and the smallest reduction was in branch c10 with a reduction of 4 7 an average reduction of 13 5 in water allocation which was helpful to promote a water saving consciousness to farmers in these areas the water rights of the other branches increased indicating that an appropriate increase in water resource input would be beneficial to improve the economic benefits of rice cultivation 4 2 water rights trading 4 2 1 comprehensive water price assessment in this paper projection pursuit was used to evaluate the dynamic sustainability index the water price was evaluated and analyzed based on 13 indexes and the real value of water resources was finally output based on the investigation the cost of planting and the input of labor and other factors were relatively average and stable among regions the evaluation results show that the change trend of the water resource value in the four regions was roughly the same the change in the marginal value of water resources can be obtained by calculating the c d production function as shown in fig 8 to comprehensively consider the uncertainty of the water resource value in each year intuitionistic fuzzy numbers were used to remove the ambiguity in the data finally the real values of water resources in zones r1 r4 were calculated as 1 15 1 34 1 43 and 1 29 yuan m3 the value of water resources in zones r2 and r3 was slightly greater than that in zones r1 and r4 which was the result of comprehensive quantification of various factors such as soil properties topography and production inputs the projection pursuit model was used to conduct a multidimensional comprehensive evaluation of the four zones in the cid the basic data set in table 2 was used as the input of the model the optimal projection directions were 0 44 0 36 0 35 0 38 0 17 0 26 0 41 0 02 0 02 0 34 0 03 0 07 and 0 16 and the projection value was 0 59 the sustainability index of the four zones was 0 12 0 12 0 33 and 0 42 by weighting the real value of water resources with the sustainable index the trading prices of sustainable water rights were calculated as 1 15 1 34 1 64 and 1 57 yuan m3 among which the trading prices of r1 and r2 were relatively low therefore when trading water rights the circulation of water rights will tend to occur in regions with higher comprehensive benefits and higher sustainable development levels r3 and r4 the water rights trading price obtained from the comprehensive evaluation of each dimension fully reflects the regional sustainable development level and takes into account the real value of water resources which has practical significance for the formulation of water rights trading prices in irrigated areas 4 2 2 water rights trading schemes excess use of water requires water rights to be purchased from the water banks of other districts to satisfy the irrigation demand for the year such measures will force the planting industry in the region to implement water saving measures and improve the utilization efficiency of water resources surplus water rights can be sold through a water bank at a reasonable price converting the water rights savings into additional water saving income taking the current year as an example the maximum profit of water rights trading brought by water saving potential can reach 38 45 104 yuan in summary water rights trading can effectively transfer water rights to areas with higher planting benefits and encourage farmers to implement water saving irrigation in addition the maximum amount of water right trading in wet and normal years was 132 40 104 m3 and 39 06 104 m3 accounting for 4 8 12 9 of the total water rights the maximum system net income was 1335 54 104 yuan and 1307 66 104 yuan 1 2 3 3 higher than that in the current year the maximum trading volume of water rights was 216 61 104 yuan and 63 90 104 yuan accounting for 5 16 2 of the system s net income additionally the equity index of water right trading decreased by 0 06 0 09 moreover as shown in fig 9 as the violation probability increases the net revenue of the system increases but the fairness decreases in this case managers can choose different water right trading schemes based on their different decision making preferences in general the model can effectively optimize the water right trading scheme under the combination of multiple supply and demand scenarios and violation probabilities and provide decision support for the trading of water rights in irrigation areas under different scenarios this study allocates water rights in irrigated areas but not all possible components and processes were described in detail for example uncertainties caused by the correlation between the supply and demand of water should be quantified the estimation of the true value of water resources can further consider the input of multiple production factors and damage to the production environment and decision makers can develop their own site specific applications based on the framework of the model 4 3 model performance the variance was used to evaluate the performance of the model a smaller value indicates a higher level of regional sustainability the results show that the variance based on the improved model was 0 29 which was 22 9 lower than the current situation indicating that the sustainability of the irrigation area has been improved moreover the harmony degree was used to present the superiority of the developed model in improving regional sustainability a higher value of the harmony degree means a higher level of regional sustainability the results show that the harmony degree from the optimal water rights allocation was 30 higher than that in the current situation the above results manifest that synergistically considering the fairness efficiency and benefit for water rights optimal allocation and transfer has practical significance for water rights trading in modern irrigation areas 5 conclusions this study constructs an initial agricultural water rights allocation and trading model for irrigation districts under multiple uncertainties the following characteristics make the developed model unique 1 water rights allocation and trading were optimized simultaneously in a robust system based on a two level multiobjective programming framework to achieve a balance of economic benefit water savings and water resources use equity 2 the dynamics of hydrological elements and multiple factors from economic social and environmental dimensions were considered together and evaluated to realize their comprehensive effect on water prices and water trading 3 randomness uncertainty of water supply and demand and fuzzy uncertainty of management factors were quantified to gain insight into how the external changing environment affects water rights allocation and trading and thus the corresponding water management plans were generated to help make decisions in different conditions the constructed model was applied to the changgang irrigation district in heilongjiang province northeast china and the main findings were as follows the transfer of water rights tends to occur in regions with higher comprehensive benefits and higher sustainable development levels compared with the current level the optimal net income was expected to increase by 1 2 3 3 and the equity of water rights allocation can be increased by 6 9 the average water right of each branch canal was reduced by 13 30 which was helpful to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources for the irrigation area in this study the water rights of irrigation areas were allocated to achieve the synergy of water use economic benefit and social equity considering the uncertainty and changing impacts of natural elements however changes in the external environment make the water rights allocation process more complicated for example different uncertain factors such as water supply and demand were linked and their impacts on water rights allocation and transfer were not independent this relationship will affect the accuracy of the model to some extent and requires future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9037,soil salinization has seriously affected crop growth and fertilizer utilization efficiency in agricultural production thus restricting the food production and sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas therefore how to improve the saline alkali land improvement and fertilizer utilization efficiency will directly affect agricultural development in arid areas bacillus subtilis had certain advantages in saline alkali land improvement by inhibiting the accumulation of excessive sodium and improving the absorption of nutrients by crops so this study proposed to use the functional advantages of bacillus subtilis in the root layer soil and establish a bacteria fertilizer coupling improvement strategy to improve cotton growth and soil nitrogen use efficiency under salt stress in this study the physiological characteristics of crops under different soil salt stress were analyzed by pot planting cotton four application amounts of bacillus subtilis agent 2 5 5 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg kg 1 and three application amounts of nitrogen fertilizer 150 300 and 450 kg hm 2 were applied in four kinds of soil with different salinity nonsalinized mildly salinized moderately salinized and severely salinized through the 3414 experimental design method a total of 15 cross treatments were set including blank control and three groups of control repetition were set in the experimental design the results showed that the application of bacillus subtilis improved the water retention and nitrate nitrogen retention of saline alkali soil when the application amount of nitrogen fertilizer was 300 kg hm 2 and the application amount of bacillus subtilis agent was 5 0 mg kg 1 the growth index plant height stem diameter and biomass of cotton reached the maximum value malondialdehyde content increased with the increase of soil salt content which showed salt stress could cause oxidative damage to leaves application bacillus subtilis agent promoted the activity of peroxidase and catalase enzymes in leaves and protected plants against the damage caused by salt stress the application of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer could improve the physiological activity of leaves and reduce oxidative damage under salt stress according to the cotton yield the coupling application of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the dry matter accumulation and final yield of cotton compared with the control treatment the cotton yields of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer applications treatments increased by 10 47 65 52 which has a positive effect on improving the cotton yield in saline alkali soil based on the above results this study could serve as a theoretical basis for harnessing saline alkali land and promoting sustainable development of agriculture in arid regions keywords bacillus subtilis agent soil salinization cotton growth nitrogen utilization efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinity is one of the main variables influencing agricultural productivity in arid and semiarid areas where salinity is increasing at an annual growth rate of 1 0 1 5 106 hm2 ghonaim et al 2021 quamruzzaman et al 2022 soil salinization has negative consequences in terms of farmland utilization agricultural productivity and sustainable development zhao et al 2013 there is an unprecedented demand for agricultural food production especially in developing countries where it is a major challenge to produce sufficient food to feed a growing population inappropriate cultivation and irrigation methods can aggravate soil salinization and lead to secondary salinization thereby degrading farmland quality jones and ejeta 2016 zhou et al 2022 xinjiang uygur autonomous region was one of the major grain cotton and fruit planting areas in china it had a vast land area and rich agricultural natural resources what cannot be neglected the local climate characteristics of high evaporation and low precipitation made saline alkali soil widely distributed in xinjiang which had adverse effects on local crop growth and yield zhou et al 2021 many studies in china and other places had focused on the formation current situation and improvement of saline alkali lands based on these studies researchers had proposed a series of saline alkali land improvement methods including water saving chemical and biological measures zhang et al 2005 zhang 2020 heng et al 2022 traditional water conservation measures required substantial economic investment and freshwater resources furthermore water conservation measures posed a challenge in water scarce arid and semi arid areas chemical based improvement methods such as increasing the amount of soil salt ions were costly and might result in soil reinfection thereby limiting their application in large areas biological based improvement methods mainly involved planting salt tolerant crops using halophytes to absorb salt and then removing salt by harvesting above ground biomass but with low efficiency and long cycle therefore the major focus of agricultural research was development of agronomic measures including improving the soil microenvironment in arid regions adjusting water and salt migration in saline alkali soil reducing salt stress and improving salt stress tolerance in crops many recent studies had reported that plant rhizosphere growth promoting bacteria could improve crop drought resistance effectively alleviate salt stress and improve crop yield saline alkali resistance and disease resistance nadeem et al 2009 ahmad et al 2014 majeed et al 2015 singh and trivedi 2017 bacillus subtilis b subtilis a plant rhizosphere growth promoting bacterium was widespread in the environment according to previous research b subtilis could inhibit the accumulation of excess sodium in the aboveground parts of crops significantly improve the absorption of nutrients by crops and promote crop growth abbasi et al 2011 krey et al 2011 based on this research b subtilis had begun to be applied in agricultural production hashem et al 2019 reported that b subtilis promoted nitrogen absorption by synthesizing substances e g auxin and had a direct effect on crop growth and development b subtilis could change the form of phosphorus in the soil to facilitate crop uptake ultimately increasing crop yield bochow et al 2001 showed that b subtilis significantly improved the salt tolerance of eggplant and pepper with similar results obtained in tomato woitke et al 2004 and wheat zhang et al 2014 plant experiments in addition b subtilis effectively reduced the malondialdehyde mda content in cucumber leaves improved the activity of protective enzymes in leaves and increased yields by promoting growth and improving physiological metabolism yin et al 2006 in their study the total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium content in bitter gourd leaves increased by 9 55 15 38 and 4 00 respectively compared with control group ben khedher et al 2015 revealed that b subtilis significantly promoted potato growth in pot experiments therefore the present studies indicated that b subtilis improved mineral nutrient absorption plant physiology metabolism and crop quality and yield under salt stress adequate fertilization could offset the adverse effects of salt stress on crops at appropriate times and in the correct amounts and reduce the adverse effects of salt stress on crops to improve fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield in saline soils yousaf et al 2016 studied the effect of soil fertilizer applications under different salinity and fertilizer application rates through analyzing the effects of topdressing with different nitrogen levels on the growth of suaeda salsa and ion accumulation s salsa biomass showed a linear growth trend and the accumulation of potassium k sodium na calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions increased with topdressing in the range of 0 450 kg hm 2 liang et al 2013 pessarakli 1985 discussed the relationship between soil salinity and cotton growth and showed that an increase in salinity caused a decrease in osmotic potential which in turn led to a significant reduction in cotton dry matter accumulation low and medium levels of salinity had no significant effect on nitrogen uptake rates but high levels significantly inhibited uptake rates the effect of salinity was more evident in the cotton seeding stage than in the maturity stage van hoorn et al 2001 reported that crop nitrogen uptake decreased with the increase of the soil salt concentration and soil salinity affected soil nitrogen distribution and transformation other researchers demonstrated that the appropriate addition of nitrogen fertilizer reduced the adverse effects of salinity and improved crop yield under low and medium salinity levels but these beneficial effects of nitrogen application were not observed at high salinity levels cámara zapata et al 2004 chen et al 2010 semiz et al 2014 while applying nitrogen fertilizer in an appropriate amount how to optimize and improve the agricultural production effect of different saline alkali lands in dry areas through other measures which was very important for the agricultural development of saline alkali land cotton exhibited strong salt tolerance thus it had the potential to improve land utilization and promote regional economic development in arid regions characterized by saline alkali soil this study took cotton as the target crop and investigated the combined effects of different application amounts of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizers on cotton growth yield and nitrogen transformation in an arid region the aim was to shed light on the optimal combination of bacterium fertilizer to improve cotton production and aid sustainable land utilization in saline alkali soil in arid regions the results could provide a theoretical basis and technical support for addressing salt stress and increasing the cotton yield in arid regions such as xinjiang china 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and tests the potting experiments were carried out at bazhou irrigation experimental station 41 33 n 86 12 e korla xinjiang uygur autonomous region china fig 1a soil samples were taken from the surface soil of the experimental station after the

amounts in the experimental treatments the bacterial agent b subtilis wettable powder 100 billion cfu g 1 was mixed evenly with the sieved soil samples the potting plants were buried underground to reduce the influence of external temperature on cotton growth the conventional agricultural management measures such as pest control and weeding were consistent with the local cotton management methods the experimental cotton selected the cotton varieties no 50 chuangmian commonly used locally cotton planting started on 6 may 2021 and was harvested on 30 sep 2021 in each pot barrel cotton with four spacing was planted separately after germination seedlings of the same size were selected for cultivation during the whole growth period plants were irrigated 30 times the irrigation amounts in each growth period were shown in table 3 the 3414 orthogonal scheme was adopted in this experiment with 14 treatments and 6 replicates of each treatment giving a total of 84 groups of potted plants the nitrogen fertilizer application amounts were as follows 0 kg hm 2 n0 150 kg hm 2 n1 300 kg hm 2 n2 and 450 kg hm 2 n3 sodium chloride nacl was added to each pot according to the classification of soil salinization of lu 2000 the salt application amounts were 0 80 g kg 1 s0 1 61 g kg 1 s1 2 57 g kg 1 s2 and 4 41 g kg 1 s3 which was equal to nonsalinized soil mildly salinized soil moderately

is shown in table 2 2 3 data collection and calculation 2 3 1 soil water salt and nutrient content soil samples were collected at five cotton growth stages seedling bud flowering boll and boll opening respectively in each pot barrel the soil sample was taken every 5 cm from the surface layer down by using a soil drill with an internal diameter of 1 cm each soil sample was divided into three parts for the determination of water content salt content and nutrients among them soil water content was determined by the drying method 105 c 10 h thermostatic oven dephyris china soil salt content was determined by measuring electrical conductivity in a 1 5 soil water extract dd s307 conductivity meter yidian scientific instrument co ltd china and soil nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen content were determined by colorimetry methods smartchem 450 automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer ams alliance italy 2 3 2 crop index determination in each experimental treatment three representative cotton seedlings with uniform growth were selected for measuring their heights and stem diameter plant height was measured using a measuring tape and stem diameter was measured using an electronic vernier caliper to analyze physiological changes the malondialdehyde mda content antioxidant enzyme activity including peroxidase and catalase and soluble protein content of cotton plants were

automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer smartchem 450 ams alliance italy the dry matter content of cotton in each treatment was also determined the stems leaves and roots of cotton were taken from three randomly selected cotton plants after fixing at 105 c for 30 min and drying to constant weight at 80 c the dry matter content of cotton roots stems and leaves are weighed the cotton yield was obtained by calculating the effective boll number and single boll weight of each potted plant 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was applied to compare differences using spss package 20 0 spss inc for all the analyses p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on soil water and salt distribution under different soil salt content 3 1 1 soil volumetric water content as cotton grew the water content first increased and then decreased fig 2 high rates of evaporation reduced the soil water content in order to satisfy the cotton water consumption the irrigation amount and frequency were increased the water content reached the maximum at the flowering and boll stages water requirements of cotton were decreased at the boll oping stage and reduced irrigation amount which decreased soil water content fig 3a showed the change in the average volumetric water content of the cotton plants throughout the whole growth period with soil depth under different combinations of b subtilis agent salt and nitrogen in terms of the volumetric water content it was lowest in the surface soil the water content increased with the increase of soil depth however each treatment had an extreme point of water content in the range of the 5 15 cm soil layer which was due mainly to high evapotranspiration at the soil surface and continuous upward migration of soil moisture from deep soil layers through capillary force in the treatments of applying b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer n2s2b0 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 the soil water content of soil profile first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount compared with the no application b subtilis agent treatment b0 the soil water content in the soil profile was higher in the b subtilis agent application treatments and the soil average water content in the soil profile was the largest in the b2 treatment which indicated that b subtilis enhanced the soil water retention capacity and improved the soil profile water content zhou et al 2018 found that organic acid produced by b subtilis in the soil affects metal ions release from mineral surfaces reduces soil micropores and improves the soil structure and soil water retention performance however excessive application of b subtilis inoculum increased the negative charge on the surface of soil particles resulting in the increase of soil micropores and soil water loss thus b subtilis agent appeared to enhance the soil water retention capacity at an appropriate application amount which was beneficial in terms of water absorption of the crop root system in the treatments of different soil salt content n2s0b2 n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 the increase of soil salt content resulted in a decrease in the soil profile water content followed by an increase the latter was due to higher soil salt content reducing the root water absorption capacity which led to soil hardening and a decline in soil aeration water permeability and internal evaporation a comparison of the four nitrogen fertilizer treatments n0s2b2 n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 revealed that increasing the nitrogen application amount decreased the soil profile water content 3 1 2 soil salt content the average salt contents in different treatments were analyzed to determine the effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on soil salt content in the whole growth period under different salt levels fig 3b the average salt content of soil profile under different treatments changed with soil depth showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing the salt content was high at the soil surface and 30 cm layer this was due mainly to the soil surface was not covered with film and evaporation was large which led to the accumulation of salt at the soil surface along with moisture migration at the same time surface irrigation was adopted and irrigation frequency was frequent resulting in salt migration and accumulation to the deep soil layer in the treatments of applying b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer when the application amounts of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer increased the soil salt content within 0 15 cm of the soil profile decreased and the soil water content between 15 and 30 cm layers increased compared with the control treatment n2s2b0 the average salt content in the n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments reduced by 5 73 8 97 and 0 67 respectively the results showed that the application of b subtilis agent could reduce the cumulative evaporation of soil and the content of salt upward migration which was similar to the research conclusion of hou et al 2018 in addition the average salt content decreased first and then increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer 3 2 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on the soil nitrogen transport and utilization under different soil salt content 3 2 1 soil nitrate nitrogen content periodic changes in soil nitrate nitrogen content during the whole growth period under each treatment were shown in fig 4a to meet the nitrogen requirements for cotton growth urea was applied again before the flowering stage which significantly increased soil nitrate nitrogen content at the flowering stage nitrate nitrogen content decreased in other growth stages due to crop uptake distribution of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile was similar in the different treatments fig 4c the change curve of soil nitrate nitrogen content with soil depth under each treatment showed a trend toward a decrease first followed by an increase this finding was attributed primarily to the negative charge of nitrate nitrogen ions which are not readily adsorbed and are easily leached into deep soil with irrigation water hou et al 2021 additional reasons were the application of nitrogen fertilizer enriching the nitrate nitrogen content of the surface soil and a high rate of evapotranspiration at the soil surface hou et al 2021 in addition with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount the soil nitrate nitrogen content first increased and then decreased with an overall trend of n2s2b0 n2s2b3 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 under the same application amount of nitrogen and b subtilis agent soil salt content increased firstly then decreased with a trend toward the increase of the soil profile nitrate nitrogen content this finding might be due to the increase in the soil salt content increasing the soil nitrification rate under the low salt condition and the nitrification rate decreasing under the high salt condition zeng et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 and the increase of the nitrogen application amount resulted nitrate nitrogen content increasing in the soil profile which provided more available nitrogen for cotton growth 3 2 2 soil ammonium nitrogen content as cotton grew soil ammonium nitrogen content first decreased and then increased reaching a high level at the flowering stage fig 4b mainly because urea was applied again before the flowering stage and urea was hydrolyzed into ammonium nitrogen in contrast to the soil nitrate nitrogen content which was concentrated in 30 110 mg kg 1 the ammonium nitrogen content was concentrated in 5 12 mg kg 1 with some small variation fig 4d the vertical distribution pattern of ammonium nitrogen under each treatment was similar with the highest content in the surface layer in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the increase of b subtilis agent application amount led to a decrease in soil ammonium nitrogen content indicating that the application of b subtilis agent could promote soil nitrification and accelerate ammonium nitrogen depletion in the treatments of different soil salt content the soil ammonium nitrogen content showed a trend of decreasing and then increased with increasing soil salt content reaching a maximum in the n2s3b2 treatment this was due mainly to the effect of soil nitrification on soil salt content with sail salt promoting the conversion of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n to nitrate nitrogen no3 n under low soil salt content whereas the nitrification rate decreased when soil salt content was above a threshold value zeng et al 2013 in the treatments of nitrogen fertilizer application the soil ammonium nitrogen content increased with the increase of the nitrogen application amount sun et al 2019b reported a similar result in their study urease activity had a significant effect on urea conversion with the increase of the application rate enhancing soil urease activity thus promoting hydrolysis of urea and the formation of large amounts of nh4 with a consequent rise in ammonium nitrogen content 3 2 3 soil nitrogen utilization apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency can be used to characterize plant nitrogen utilization fang et al 2006 the nitrogen balance principle was used to calculate the soil nitrogen balance under different treatments table 4 in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments the increase of nitrogen application amount caused a significant rise in soil nitrogen residue and apparent nitrogen loss leading to a nitrogen surplus the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency decreased in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments to 46 65 39 68 and 26 64 respectively similar to previous findings luo et al 2018 hou et al 2021 this results showed that the reduction of nitrogen fertilizer application amount improved the nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency the reduction in apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments may be because the nitrogen application amount exceeding crop growth needs thereby increasing nitrogen loss to soil and air causing environmental pollution therefore only the amount of nitrogen fertilizer required to ensure sufficient plant nitrogen uptake and an adequate soil nutrient supply should be applied yu et al 2013 wang et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n2s0b2 n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments was 40 99 45 79 39 68 and 34 42 respectively thus the increase of soil salt content caused a trend of increasing and then decreasing the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency reaching a maximum in the n2s1b2 treatment i e mildly salinized soil this finding may be due to mild salt stress promoting sodium na and potassium k ions uptake which promotes cytoplasmic streaming and photosynthesis in plants and facilitates nitrogen movement to growth centers yao et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content nitrogen residuals decreased and the observed nitrogen surplus and apparent nitrogen loss tended to decrease and then increase the latter may be related to ammonia volatilization due to competitive adsorption between na and nh4 n in soil the na concentration may have affected ammonium nitrogen adsorption and increased the likelihood of ammonia volatilization in a study by murtaza et al 2017 the rate of ammonia volatilization increased in accordance with the increase of soil salinization in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n2s2b0 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments was 24 34 39 14 39 68 and 37 37 respectively and the increase of b subtilis agent application amount resulted in a tendency toward the increase of apparent utilization efficiency followed by a decrease with the maximum value found in the n2s2b2 treatment this finding indicated that b subtilis agent application at an appropriate amount could promote crop nitrogen uptake improve plant use of soil nutrients and fertilizer and play a role in nitrogen fixation lastochkina et al 2017 hashem et al 2019 kang et al 2019 fonseca et al 2022 3 3 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on cotton growth under different soil salt content 3 3 1 cotton plant height and stem diameter plant height and stem diameter are important indicators of the physiological condition of cotton in this study plant height of cotton and stem diameter were measured throughout the growth period as shown in fig 5 cotton plant heights and stem diameters under the different treatments showed an increasing trend with the advancement of the reproductive period and the growth rate slowed after entering the flowering stage during the flowering stage nutrients are reserved mainly for reproductive growth as a result plant height and stem diameter did not increase greatly during this stage in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application plant height and stem diameter showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount one hundred days after sowing plant height and stem diameter in the n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments increased by 5 50 and 28 80 2 91 and 7 48 and 0 89 and 0 53 respectively compared to the control treatment n2s2b0 with the lowest plant heights and stem diameters found in the n2s2b3 treatment in all the saline treatment groups plant heights and stem diameters tended to decrease as compared with those in the control group nonsalinized and the increase in soil salt stress inhibited plant growth as compared with the control treatment n2s0b2 plant heights and stem diameters decreased in the salinized n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments by 4 39 and 2 92 7 80 and 14 2 and 13 51 and 15 04 respectively in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments plant heights and stem diameters first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount one hundred days after sowing plant heights and stem diameters increased in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments by 5 74 and 14 36 12 07 and 2 71 and 6 09 and 7 68 respectively compared to the control no nitrogen n0s2b2 indicating that nitrogen affected soil nutrients and cotton growth thus nitrogen fertilizer application at an appropriate amount could promote soil nutrient accumulation and reduce plant damage caused by salt stress 3 3 2 dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulation in cotton growth period is a continuous process the dry matter mass of cotton includes the total biomass of cotton leaves stems buds flowers and bolls fig 6 showed the variation in cotton dry matter mass during different growth stages in the different treatments at the seedling and bud stages the cotton plants grew slowly soil nutrients were used mainly for the growth of vegetative organs and dry matter accumulation was less after the flowering stage the biomass of cotton reproductive organs increased and the dry matter mass increased sharply at the cotton boll opening stage applying b subtilis agent showed advantages in dry matter accumulation of cotton in n2s2 series of treatments applying b subtilis agent increased the dry matter accumulation of cotton by 8 99 33 59 respectively when the application amount of b subtilis agent was 5 0 mg kg 1 the increment of dry matter accumulation was the most significant in the comparison of different soil salt content the increase of soil salt content significantly reduced the accumulation of dry matter quality of cotton the accumulation of dry matter in n2s3b2 treatment decreased the most reaching 27 55 applying nitrogen fertilizer could also increase the accumulation of dry matter quality applying nitrogen fertilizer could also increase the accumulation of dry matter quality compared with the control treatment the dry matter accumulation of n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 increased by 27 92 39 68 and 46 26 respectively above results indicated that the moderate application of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizers could reduce the effects of environmental stress on plant growth and promote the aboveground growth of cotton bacterial inoculation enhanced the production of auxin in the rhizosphere limited the absorption of na and increased the uptake of k and ca2 thereby regulating the k na ratio tahir et al 2019 hamid et al 2021 the application of b subtilis agent could regulate the ratio of salt ions by secreting root auxin thus improving the accumulation of plant growth in addition to dry matter accumulation cotton yield depends on the proportion of dry matter allocated to reproductive organs the application of microbial and nitrogen fertilizers could improve the distribution ratio of dry matter to the reproductive organs of cotton fertilizer application would aid the transfer of cotton from nutritional growth to reproductive growth thereby improving cotton yield 3 4 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on plant enzymes different soil salt content 3 4 1 malondialdehyde content malondialdehyde mda is the final decomposition product of membrane lipid peroxidation in plants under stress and changes in its content can reflect the degree of membrane damage fang et al 2021 in this study the mda content of cotton leaves increased continuously with the advancement of the growing period fig 7a in the treatments of different soil salt content the mda content increased in accordance with a rise in the level of salt stress pointing to lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage leading to increased salt stress zhang et al 2017 ye et al 2021 in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the mda content decreased first and then increased with the increase of the application amount of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer indicating that b subtilis could alleviate the damage caused to leaf cells by salt stress at an appropriate application amount in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments in the seedling stage the average mda content in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments was reduced by 13 78 19 53 and 17 43 respectively compared to that in the control treatment n0s2b2 indicating that the application of nitrogen fertilizer improved the salinity tolerance of cotton and reduced membrane lipid peroxidation under stress the latter may be explained be nitrogen applications under high salt stress increasing plant antioxidant enzyme activity thus reducing mda accumulation in seedling leaves ali et al 2021 3 4 2 antioxidant enzyme activity plant cell damage under salt stress is mainly due to the accumulation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species ros the resulting imbalance between ros production and removal causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative induced cell membrane damage xue and liu 2008 antioxidant enzymes such as pod and cat are the main regulators of antioxidant processes in plants scavenging harmful ros and maintaining the integrity and stability of cell membranes yasar et al 2008 in the present study the pod activity of cotton leaves increased throughout the growing period fig 7b in contrast cat activity increased and then decreased fig 7c in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application pod and cat activity increased in accordance with the increase of the b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount indicating that b subtilis removed excess ros from cotton leaves under salt stress maintained the metabolic balance of ros and protected cells against the damage caused by salt stress pod and cat activity increased after the nitrogen fertilizer treatments at the boll opening stage pod activity increased by 6 53 14 17 and 7 20 and cat activity increased by 11 60 24 31 and 33 70 in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments respectively as compared with that in the control treatment n0s2b2 this finding showed that additional nitrogen fertilizer under salt stress could improve ros scavenging help compensate for the ionic imbalance caused by salt stress ali et al 2021 and enhance salt resistance in cotton in the treatments of different soil salt content pod and cat activity exhibited a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing soil salt content suggesting that mild salt stress induced the increase of pod and cat activity in cotton leaves this increase effectively alleviated ros induced damage however salt stress tolerance was depleted at a high level of salt stress n2s3b2 treatment resulting in a decrease in pod and cat activity to different degrees the results revealed a threshold for ros scavenging in plant cells under salt stress below moderate levels of salt stress plants can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes enhance antioxidant capacity regulate the cell balance of ros and effectively alleviate cell damage caused by saline alkali stress fu et al 2017 fang et al 2021 the latter has been verified in jerusalem artichoke xue and liu 2008 and wheat mandhania et al 2006 3 4 3 soluble protein content osmotic regulation is one way in which plants resist environmental stress soluble plant proteins function as osmotic regulating agents maintaining cell expansion pressure and protecting the biofilm structure sun et al 2019a the soluble protein content responds to the degree of leaf senescence sun et al 2019a as shown in fig 7d the soluble protein content of cotton leaves in each treatment tended to increase and then decrease with the advance of the growth period reaching a maximum in the bud stage in this study soluble protein synthesis in cotton leaves increased from the seedling to the bud stage soluble protein synthesis decreased in the boll opening stage when the leaves entered the senescence stage in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the leaf soluble protein content was higher than that in the control group n2s2b0 the leaf soluble protein content showed a trend toward increasing and then decreasing with the rise of the nitrogen fertilizer application amount this finding indicated that b subtilis could promote soluble protein accumulation in cotton and mitigate salt stress induced damage of the plant s regulatory system thereby ensuring the maintenance of normal physiological activities in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments the soluble protein content increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application amount for example in the boll opening stage the soluble protein content in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments increased by 2 34 5 09 and 2 83 respectively compared with that in the control treatment n0s2b2 this finding suggested that nitrogen fertilizer applications could improve plant stress tolerance by reducing the osmotic potential of leaves and enhancing osmotic regulation ability ali et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content with increasing soil salt stress the soluble protein content increased by 10 69 7 29 and 5 08 in the n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments respectively compared to that in the control treatment n2s0b2 indicating that low salt stress could stimulate cotton to increase the soluble protein content and alleviate cotton damage however the ability to withstand salt stress decreased as the soil salt increased due to the impact of salt stress on the plant s metabolic balance this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies which reported that salt stress induced changes in the soluble protein content of sorghum bicolor l moench seedlings sun et al 2019a and spring wheat ashraf and o leary 1999 in other studies salt stress appeared to inhibit nitrogen uptake by hazera tomato doganlar et al 2010 and tioga strawberry gulen et al 2006 thereby reducing the rate of plant protein synthesis thus the effect of salt stress on soluble protein content depends upon the plant species and variety 3 5 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on cotton yield different soil salt content the dry matter accumulation of cotton bolls in the boll opening stage is positively correlated with the yield of cotton cotton yield components and yield changes under the different treatments are shown in table 5 as shown in the table cotton yield first increased and then decreased with the increase of the b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount with the maximum yield in the n2s2b2 treatment where the yield increased by 48 82 as compared with that in the control treatment n2s2b0 in the treatments of different soil salt content yield reductions occurred with the increase of soil salt content with the reductions ranging from 2 97 to 40 39 in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments cotton yields tended to increase and then decrease with the increase of nitrogen application amount cotton yield was higher in the nitrogen treatments than the no nitrogen treatment which was similar to the observations of hou et al 2021 the cotton yield increased by 33 12 45 33 numerous studies have shown that nitrogen fertilizer has significant impacts on cotton yield and that an optimal application of nitrogen can provide ideal conditions for growth and productivity thind et al 2008 singh et al 2010 luo et al 2018 in arid areas the lack of water resources not only made the available water resources of agriculture scarce but also the secondary salinization problems occur frequently how to keep the limited water resources in the soil for crop absorption and utilization was the key to agricultural development the above research results showed that the distribution and activity of b subtilis in the root zone of crops could increase the water content of the root zone soil and reduce the evaporation of the soil zheng et al 2018 also confirmed this through indoor experiments b subtilis incubation or production of extracellular polymeric substances eps were potentially responsible for the changes in hydraulic properties and soil evaporation eps altered soil matrix structure and connectivity of pore space and modified the physicochemical properties of water surface tension and viscosity however van der ploeg et al 2011 studied that environmental conditions such as salinity can determine the specificity and need for the secretion of a bacterial tat substrate due to the differences in the secretion of b subtilis whether it could present the same action characteristics in different soil environments needed further study and analysis the increase of water content in the root zone could alleviate the stress of soil salt accumulation on crop water absorption the application of nitrogen fertilizer changes the distribution proportion of soil mineral ions while supplementing the nutrient elements required by crops which was also a way to alleviate soil salt stress the combined use of b subtilis and nitrogen fertilizer has changed the distribution characteristics of soil salt from the physical and chemical aspects respectively the bacillus nitrogen coupling strategy was a good choice for agricultural production in saline soil however b subtilis had biological activity and need high application conditions only when its living environment was relatively stable could b subtilis play its key role in this study b subtilis was kept 10 20 cm below the soil surface through tillage and the living environment was relatively stable when considering further large scale application of b subtilis it was necessary to consider the adaptability of local climate and soil environment 3 6 determination of coupling effect and production function of bacteria and nitrogen under different soil salt content 3 6 1 two factor coupling effect of bacteria salt and nitrogen the three experimental variables in this study were soil salt content b subtilis application amounts and nitrogen application amounts we used the following binary quadratic equations to determine the coupling effects of these variables 1 nitrogen salt interaction y 398 93 43 06 n 79 63 s 53 79 n 2 50 20 s 2 16 75 ns 2 nitrogen bacteria interaction y 398 93 43 06 n 23 9 b 53 79 n 2 62 84 b 2 62 44 nb 3 salt bacteria interaction y 398 93 79 63 s 23 9 b 50 20 s 2 62 84 b 2 12 19 sb where y was the cotton yield kg hm 2 n was the nitrogen fertilizer application amount kg hm 2 s was the soil salt content and b was the b subtilis agent application amount mg kg 1 fig 8 showed the combined effects of two of each of the three experimental variables on cotton yield as shown in fig 8 a cotton yield tended to increase and then decrease with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount this finding may be attributed to mutual competition between microorganisms and the crop under nutrient poor conditions this negative effect was reduced by an increase in the application amount of nitrogen at moderate nitrogen rates the optimum cotton yield of 6044 15 6154 49 kg hm 2 was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 5 7 mg kg 1 at high nitrogen rates soil nutrient enrichment soil nutrient and microbial activity showed a spiral upward trend as a result when b subtilis agent application amount was 6 8 mg kg 1 the cotton yield could be maintained at 6209 66 6264 83 kg hm 2 from fig 8 b it could be found that the increased application of nitrogen fertilizer alleviated crop damage caused by salt stress combined with consideration of environmental effects the best yield range can be achieved by the nitrogen application amount of about 300 kg hm 2 fig 8 c referred to the combination effects of b subtilis agent nitrogen fertilizer and soil salt content as shown in fig 8 c in the nonsalinized and mildly salinized soil treatments cotton yields first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount the best cotton yield 6530 kg hm 2 was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 5 7 mg kg 1 in the moderately salinized soils cotton yield tended to decrease and then increase with the increase of the b subtilis agent application amount and the optimal yield was around 5625 6078 kg hm 2 in the severely salinized soils the optimal yield was 3815 4268 kg hm 2 when the application amount of b subtilis agent was 3 7 mg kg 1 3 6 2 optimal combinations of b subtilis agent salt and nitrogen to further clarify the combined effects of b subtilis agent nitrogen fertilizer application and soil salt content on cotton yield three experimental variables were taken as independent variables in the ternary quadratic regression model ternary quadratic regression model under the combined effects of b subtilis salt and nitrogen

content and b was the b subtilis agent application amount mg kg 1 through fitting calculation when the soil salt content was 1 61 g kg 1 the maximum cotton yield was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 6 mg kg 1 and nitrogen application amount of 381 195 kg hm 2 4 conclusions bacillus subtilis could inhibited the accumulation of excessive sodium and improve the absorption of nutrients by crops this study proposed to use the functional advantages of b subtilis in the root layer soil and establish a bacteria fertilizer coupling improvement strategy the application of b subtilis agent under salt stress increased the soil profile water content and enhanced soil water retention meanwhile b subtilis agent application promoted soil nitrate nitrogen retention capacity increased nitrogen utilization the increase of soil salt content promoted mda accumulation mild salt stress stimulated the production of pod and cat enzymes in cotton leaves b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer applications under salt stress improved the physiological activity in leaves and alleviated oxidative damage under salt stress according to the cotton yield under salt stress coupling application of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the dry matter accumulation and final yield of cotton the results could provide a theoretical basis and

9037,soil salinization has seriously affected crop growth and fertilizer utilization efficiency in agricultural production thus restricting the food production and sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas therefore how to improve the saline alkali land improvement and fertilizer utilization efficiency will directly affect agricultural development in arid areas bacillus subtilis had certain advantages in saline alkali land improvement by inhibiting the accumulation of excessive sodium and improving the absorption of nutrients by crops so this study proposed to use the functional advantages of bacillus subtilis in the root layer soil and establish a bacteria fertilizer coupling improvement strategy to improve cotton growth and soil nitrogen use efficiency under salt stress in this study the physiological characteristics of crops under different soil salt stress were analyzed by pot planting cotton four application amounts of bacillus subtilis agent 2 5 5 0 5 0 and 10 0 mg kg 1 and three application amounts of nitrogen fertilizer 150 300 and 450 kg hm 2 were applied in four kinds of soil with different salinity nonsalinized mildly salinized moderately salinized and severely salinized through the 3414 experimental design method a total of 15 cross treatments were set including blank control and three groups of control repetition were set in the experimental design the results showed that the application of bacillus subtilis improved the water retention and nitrate nitrogen retention of saline alkali soil when the application amount of nitrogen fertilizer was 300 kg hm 2 and the application amount of bacillus subtilis agent was 5 0 mg kg 1 the growth index plant height stem diameter and biomass of cotton reached the maximum value malondialdehyde content increased with the increase of soil salt content which showed salt stress could cause oxidative damage to leaves application bacillus subtilis agent promoted the activity of peroxidase and catalase enzymes in leaves and protected plants against the damage caused by salt stress the application of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer could improve the physiological activity of leaves and reduce oxidative damage under salt stress according to the cotton yield the coupling application of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the dry matter accumulation and final yield of cotton compared with the control treatment the cotton yields of bacillus subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer applications treatments increased by 10 47 65 52 which has a positive effect on improving the cotton yield in saline alkali soil based on the above results this study could serve as a theoretical basis for harnessing saline alkali land and promoting sustainable development of agriculture in arid regions keywords bacillus subtilis agent soil salinization cotton growth nitrogen utilization efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinity is one of the main variables influencing agricultural productivity in arid and semiarid areas where salinity is increasing at an annual growth rate of 1 0 1 5 106 hm2 ghonaim et al 2021 quamruzzaman et al 2022 soil salinization has negative consequences in terms of farmland utilization agricultural productivity and sustainable development zhao et al 2013 there is an unprecedented demand for agricultural food production especially in developing countries where it is a major challenge to produce sufficient food to feed a growing population inappropriate cultivation and irrigation methods can aggravate soil salinization and lead to secondary salinization thereby degrading farmland quality jones and ejeta 2016 zhou et al 2022 xinjiang uygur autonomous region was one of the major grain cotton and fruit planting areas in china it had a vast land area and rich agricultural natural resources what cannot be neglected the local climate characteristics of high evaporation and low precipitation made saline alkali soil widely distributed in xinjiang which had adverse effects on local crop growth and yield zhou et al 2021 many studies in china and other places had focused on the formation current situation and improvement of saline alkali lands based on these studies researchers had proposed a series of saline alkali land improvement methods including water saving chemical and biological measures zhang et al 2005 zhang 2020 heng et al 2022 traditional water conservation measures required substantial economic investment and freshwater resources furthermore water conservation measures posed a challenge in water scarce arid and semi arid areas chemical based improvement methods such as increasing the amount of soil salt ions were costly and might result in soil reinfection thereby limiting their application in large areas biological based improvement methods mainly involved planting salt tolerant crops using halophytes to absorb salt and then removing salt by harvesting above ground biomass but with low efficiency and long cycle therefore the major focus of agricultural research was development of agronomic measures including improving the soil microenvironment in arid regions adjusting water and salt migration in saline alkali soil reducing salt stress and improving salt stress tolerance in crops many recent studies had reported that plant rhizosphere growth promoting bacteria could improve crop drought resistance effectively alleviate salt stress and improve crop yield saline alkali resistance and disease resistance nadeem et al 2009 ahmad et al 2014 majeed et al 2015 singh and trivedi 2017 bacillus subtilis b subtilis a plant rhizosphere growth promoting bacterium was widespread in the environment according to previous research b subtilis could inhibit the accumulation of excess sodium in the aboveground parts of crops significantly improve the absorption of nutrients by crops and promote crop growth abbasi et al 2011 krey et al 2011 based on this research b subtilis had begun to be applied in agricultural production hashem et al 2019 reported that b subtilis promoted nitrogen absorption by synthesizing substances e g auxin and had a direct effect on crop growth and development b subtilis could change the form of phosphorus in the soil to facilitate crop uptake ultimately increasing crop yield bochow et al 2001 showed that b subtilis significantly improved the salt tolerance of eggplant and pepper with similar results obtained in tomato woitke et al 2004 and wheat zhang et al 2014 plant experiments in addition b subtilis effectively reduced the malondialdehyde mda content in cucumber leaves improved the activity of protective enzymes in leaves and increased yields by promoting growth and improving physiological metabolism yin et al 2006 in their study the total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium content in bitter gourd leaves increased by 9 55 15 38 and 4 00 respectively compared with control group ben khedher et al 2015 revealed that b subtilis significantly promoted potato growth in pot experiments therefore the present studies indicated that b subtilis improved mineral nutrient absorption plant physiology metabolism and crop quality and yield under salt stress adequate fertilization could offset the adverse effects of salt stress on crops at appropriate times and in the correct amounts and reduce the adverse effects of salt stress on crops to improve fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield in saline soils yousaf et al 2016 studied the effect of soil fertilizer applications under different salinity and fertilizer application rates through analyzing the effects of topdressing with different nitrogen levels on the growth of suaeda salsa and ion accumulation s salsa biomass showed a linear growth trend and the accumulation of potassium k sodium na calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 ions increased with topdressing in the range of 0 450 kg hm 2 liang et al 2013 pessarakli 1985 discussed the relationship between soil salinity and cotton growth and showed that an increase in salinity caused a decrease in osmotic potential which in turn led to a significant reduction in cotton dry matter accumulation low and medium levels of salinity had no significant effect on nitrogen uptake rates but high levels significantly inhibited uptake rates the effect of salinity was more evident in the cotton seeding stage than in the maturity stage van hoorn et al 2001 reported that crop nitrogen uptake decreased with the increase of the soil salt concentration and soil salinity affected soil nitrogen distribution and transformation other researchers demonstrated that the appropriate addition of nitrogen fertilizer reduced the adverse effects of salinity and improved crop yield under low and medium salinity levels but these beneficial effects of nitrogen application were not observed at high salinity levels cámara zapata et al 2004 chen et al 2010 semiz et al 2014 while applying nitrogen fertilizer in an appropriate amount how to optimize and improve the agricultural production effect of different saline alkali lands in dry areas through other measures which was very important for the agricultural development of saline alkali land cotton exhibited strong salt tolerance thus it had the potential to improve land utilization and promote regional economic development in arid regions characterized by saline alkali soil this study took cotton as the target crop and investigated the combined effects of different application amounts of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizers on cotton growth yield and nitrogen transformation in an arid region the aim was to shed light on the optimal combination of bacterium fertilizer to improve cotton production and aid sustainable land utilization in saline alkali soil in arid regions the results could provide a theoretical basis and technical support for addressing salt stress and increasing the cotton yield in arid regions such as xinjiang china 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and tests the potting experiments were carried out

with four spacing was planted separately after germination seedlings of the same size were selected for cultivation during the whole growth period plants were irrigated 30 times the irrigation amounts in each growth period were shown in table 3 the 3414 orthogonal scheme was adopted in this experiment with 14 treatments and 6 replicates of each treatment giving a total of 84 groups of potted plants

is shown in table 2 2 3 data collection and calculation 2 3 1 soil water salt and nutrient content soil samples were collected at five cotton growth stages seedling bud flowering boll and boll opening respectively in each pot barrel the soil sample was taken every 5 cm from the surface layer down by using a soil drill with an internal diameter of 1 cm each soil sample was divided into three parts for the determination of water content salt content and nutrients among them soil water content was determined by the drying method 105 c 10 h thermostatic oven dephyris china soil salt content was determined by measuring electrical conductivity in a 1 5 soil water extract dd s307 conductivity meter yidian scientific instrument co ltd china and soil nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen content were determined by colorimetry methods smartchem 450 automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer ams alliance italy 2 3 2 crop index determination in each experimental treatment three representative cotton seedlings with uniform growth were selected for measuring their heights and stem diameter plant height was measured using a measuring tape and stem diameter was measured using an electronic vernier caliper to analyze physiological changes the malondialdehyde mda content antioxidant enzyme activity including peroxidase and catalase and soluble protein content of cotton plants were

obtained by calculating the effective boll number and single boll weight of each potted plant 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was applied to compare differences using spss package 20 0 spss inc for all the analyses p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on soil water and salt distribution under different soil salt content 3 1 1 soil volumetric water content as cotton grew the water content first increased and then decreased fig 2 high rates of evaporation reduced the soil water content in order to satisfy the cotton water consumption the irrigation amount and frequency were increased the water content reached the maximum at the flowering and boll stages water requirements of cotton were decreased at the boll oping stage and reduced irrigation amount which decreased soil water content fig 3a showed the change in the average volumetric water content of the cotton plants throughout the whole growth period with soil depth under different combinations of b subtilis agent salt and nitrogen in terms of the volumetric water content it was lowest in the surface soil the water content increased with the increase of soil depth however each treatment had an extreme point of water content in the range of the 5 15 cm soil layer which was due mainly to high evapotranspiration at the soil surface and continuous upward migration of soil moisture from deep soil layers through capillary force in the treatments of applying b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer n2s2b0 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 the soil water content of soil profile first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount compared with the no application b subtilis agent treatment b0 the soil water content in the soil profile was higher in the b subtilis agent application treatments and the soil average water content in the soil profile was the largest in the b2 treatment which indicated that b subtilis enhanced the soil water retention capacity and improved the soil profile water content zhou et al 2018 found that organic acid produced by b subtilis in the soil affects metal ions release from mineral surfaces reduces soil micropores and improves the soil structure and soil water retention performance however excessive application of b subtilis inoculum increased the negative charge on the surface of soil particles resulting in the increase of soil micropores and soil water loss thus b subtilis agent appeared to enhance the soil water retention capacity at an appropriate application amount which was beneficial in terms of water absorption of the crop root system in the treatments of different soil salt content n2s0b2 n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 the increase of soil salt content resulted in a decrease in the soil profile water content followed by an increase the latter was due to higher soil salt content reducing the root water absorption capacity which led to soil hardening and a decline in soil aeration water permeability and internal evaporation a comparison of the four nitrogen fertilizer treatments n0s2b2 n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 revealed that increasing the nitrogen application amount decreased the soil profile water content 3 1 2 soil salt content the average salt contents in different treatments were analyzed to determine the effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on soil salt content in the whole growth period under different salt levels fig 3b the average salt content of soil profile under different treatments changed with soil depth showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing the salt content was high at the soil surface and 30 cm layer this was due mainly to the soil surface was not covered with film and evaporation was large which led to the accumulation of salt at the soil surface along with moisture migration at the same time surface irrigation was adopted and irrigation frequency was frequent resulting in salt migration and accumulation to the deep soil layer in the treatments of applying b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer when the application amounts of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer increased the soil salt content within 0 15 cm of the soil profile decreased and the soil water content between 15 and 30 cm layers increased compared with the control treatment n2s2b0 the average salt content in the n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments reduced by 5 73 8 97 and 0 67 respectively the results showed that the application of b subtilis agent could reduce the cumulative evaporation of soil and the content of salt upward migration which was similar to the research conclusion of hou et al 2018 in addition the average salt content decreased first and then increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer 3 2 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on the soil nitrogen transport and utilization under different soil salt content 3 2 1 soil nitrate nitrogen content periodic changes in soil nitrate nitrogen content during the whole growth period under each treatment were shown in fig 4a to meet the nitrogen requirements for cotton growth urea was applied again before the flowering stage which significantly increased soil nitrate nitrogen content at the flowering stage nitrate nitrogen content decreased in other growth stages due to crop uptake distribution of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile was similar in the different treatments fig 4c the change curve of soil nitrate nitrogen content with soil depth under each treatment showed a trend toward a decrease first followed by an increase this finding was attributed primarily to the negative charge of nitrate nitrogen ions which are not readily adsorbed and are easily leached into deep soil with irrigation water hou et al 2021 additional reasons were the application of nitrogen fertilizer enriching the nitrate nitrogen content of the surface soil and a high rate of evapotranspiration at the soil surface hou et al 2021 in addition with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount the soil nitrate nitrogen content first increased and then decreased with an overall trend of n2s2b0 n2s2b3 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 under the same application amount of nitrogen and b subtilis agent soil salt content increased firstly then decreased with a trend toward the increase of the soil profile nitrate nitrogen content this finding might be due to the increase in the soil salt content increasing the soil nitrification rate under the low salt condition and the nitrification rate decreasing under the high salt condition zeng et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 and the increase of the nitrogen application amount resulted nitrate nitrogen content increasing in the soil profile which provided more available nitrogen for cotton growth 3 2 2 soil ammonium nitrogen content as cotton grew soil ammonium nitrogen content first decreased and then increased reaching a high level at the flowering stage fig 4b mainly because urea was applied again before the flowering stage and urea was hydrolyzed into ammonium nitrogen in contrast to the soil nitrate nitrogen content which was concentrated in 30 110 mg kg 1 the ammonium nitrogen content was concentrated in 5 12 mg kg 1 with some small variation fig 4d the vertical distribution pattern of ammonium nitrogen under each treatment was similar with the highest content in the surface layer in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the increase of b subtilis agent application amount led to a decrease in soil ammonium nitrogen content indicating that the application of b subtilis agent could promote soil nitrification and accelerate ammonium nitrogen depletion in the treatments of different soil salt content the soil ammonium nitrogen content showed a trend of decreasing and then increased with increasing soil salt content reaching a maximum in the n2s3b2 treatment this was due mainly to the effect of soil nitrification on soil salt content with sail salt promoting the conversion of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n to nitrate nitrogen no3 n under low soil salt content whereas the nitrification rate decreased when soil salt content was above a threshold value zeng et al 2013 in the treatments of nitrogen fertilizer application the soil ammonium nitrogen content increased with the increase of the nitrogen application amount sun et al 2019b reported a similar result in their study urease activity had a significant effect on urea conversion with the increase of the application rate enhancing soil urease activity thus promoting hydrolysis of urea and the formation of large amounts of nh4 with a consequent rise in ammonium nitrogen content 3 2 3 soil nitrogen utilization apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency can be used to characterize plant nitrogen utilization fang et al 2006 the nitrogen balance principle was used to calculate the soil nitrogen balance under different treatments table 4 in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments the increase of nitrogen application amount caused a significant rise in soil nitrogen residue and apparent nitrogen loss leading to a nitrogen surplus the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency decreased in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments to 46 65 39 68 and 26 64 respectively similar to previous findings luo et al 2018 hou et al 2021 this results showed that the reduction of nitrogen fertilizer application amount improved the nitrogen fertilizer utilization efficiency the reduction in apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments may be because the nitrogen application amount exceeding crop growth needs thereby increasing nitrogen loss to soil and air causing environmental pollution therefore only the amount of nitrogen fertilizer required to ensure sufficient plant nitrogen uptake and an adequate soil nutrient supply should be applied yu et al 2013 wang et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n2s0b2 n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments was 40 99 45 79 39 68 and 34 42 respectively thus the increase of soil salt content caused a trend of increasing and then decreasing the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency reaching a maximum in the n2s1b2 treatment i e mildly salinized soil this finding may be due to mild salt stress promoting sodium na and potassium k ions uptake which promotes cytoplasmic streaming and photosynthesis in plants and facilitates nitrogen movement to growth centers yao et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content nitrogen residuals decreased and the observed nitrogen surplus and apparent nitrogen loss tended to decrease and then increase the latter may be related to ammonia volatilization due to competitive adsorption between na and nh4 n in soil the na concentration may have affected ammonium nitrogen adsorption and increased the likelihood of ammonia volatilization in a study by murtaza et al 2017 the rate of ammonia volatilization increased in accordance with the increase of soil salinization in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the apparent nitrogen utilization efficiency in the n2s2b0 n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments was 24 34 39 14 39 68 and 37 37 respectively and the increase of b subtilis agent application amount resulted in a tendency toward the increase of apparent utilization efficiency followed by a decrease with the maximum value found in the n2s2b2 treatment this finding indicated that b subtilis agent application at an appropriate amount could promote crop nitrogen uptake improve plant use of soil nutrients and fertilizer and play a role in nitrogen fixation lastochkina et al 2017 hashem et al 2019 kang et al 2019 fonseca et al 2022 3 3 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on cotton growth under different soil salt content 3 3 1 cotton plant height and stem diameter plant height and stem diameter are important indicators of the physiological condition of cotton in this study plant height of cotton and stem diameter were measured throughout the growth period as shown in fig 5 cotton plant heights and stem diameters under the different treatments showed an increasing trend with the advancement of the reproductive period and the growth rate slowed after entering the flowering stage during the flowering stage nutrients are reserved mainly for reproductive growth as a result plant height and stem diameter did not increase greatly during this stage in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application plant height and stem diameter showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount one hundred days after sowing plant height and stem diameter in the n2s2b1 n2s2b2 and n2s2b3 treatments increased by 5 50 and 28 80 2 91 and 7 48 and 0 89 and 0 53 respectively compared to the control treatment n2s2b0 with the lowest plant heights and stem diameters found in the n2s2b3 treatment in all the saline treatment groups plant heights and stem diameters tended to decrease as compared with those in the control group nonsalinized and the increase in soil salt stress inhibited plant growth as compared with the control treatment n2s0b2 plant heights and stem diameters decreased in the salinized n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments by 4 39 and 2 92 7 80 and 14 2 and 13 51 and 15 04 respectively in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments plant heights and stem diameters first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount one hundred days after sowing plant heights and stem diameters increased in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments by 5 74 and 14 36 12 07 and 2 71 and 6 09 and 7 68 respectively compared to the control no nitrogen n0s2b2 indicating that nitrogen affected soil nutrients and cotton growth thus nitrogen fertilizer application at an appropriate amount could promote soil nutrient accumulation and reduce plant damage caused by salt stress 3 3 2 dry matter accumulation the dry matter accumulation in cotton growth period is a continuous process the dry matter mass of cotton includes the total biomass of cotton leaves stems buds flowers and bolls fig 6 showed the variation in cotton dry matter mass during different growth stages in the different treatments at the seedling and bud stages the cotton plants grew slowly soil nutrients were used mainly for the growth of vegetative organs and dry matter accumulation was less after the flowering stage the biomass of cotton reproductive organs increased and the dry matter mass increased sharply at the cotton boll opening stage applying b subtilis agent showed advantages in dry matter accumulation of cotton in n2s2 series of treatments applying b subtilis agent increased the dry matter accumulation of cotton by 8 99 33 59 respectively when the application amount of b subtilis agent was 5 0 mg kg 1 the increment of dry matter accumulation was the most significant in the comparison of different soil salt content the increase of soil salt content significantly reduced the accumulation of dry matter quality of cotton the accumulation of dry matter in n2s3b2 treatment decreased the most reaching 27 55 applying nitrogen fertilizer could also increase the accumulation of dry matter quality applying nitrogen fertilizer could also increase the accumulation of dry matter quality compared with the control treatment the dry matter accumulation of n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 increased by 27 92 39 68 and 46 26 respectively above results indicated that the moderate application of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizers could reduce the effects of environmental stress on plant growth and promote the aboveground growth of cotton bacterial inoculation enhanced the production of auxin in the rhizosphere limited the absorption of na and increased the uptake of k and ca2 thereby regulating the k na ratio tahir et al 2019 hamid et al 2021 the application of b subtilis agent could regulate the ratio of salt ions by secreting root auxin thus improving the accumulation of plant growth in addition to dry matter accumulation cotton yield depends on the proportion of dry matter allocated to reproductive organs the application of microbial and nitrogen fertilizers could improve the distribution ratio of dry matter to the reproductive organs of cotton fertilizer application would aid the transfer of cotton from nutritional growth to reproductive growth thereby improving cotton yield 3 4 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on plant enzymes different soil salt content 3 4 1 malondialdehyde content malondialdehyde mda is the final decomposition product of membrane lipid peroxidation in plants under stress and changes in its content can reflect the degree of membrane damage fang et al 2021 in this study the mda content of cotton leaves increased continuously with the advancement of the growing period fig 7a in the treatments of different soil salt content the mda content increased in accordance with a rise in the level of salt stress pointing to lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage leading to increased salt stress zhang et al 2017 ye et al 2021 in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the mda content decreased first and then increased with the increase of the application amount of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer indicating that b subtilis could alleviate the damage caused to leaf cells by salt stress at an appropriate application amount in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments in the seedling stage the average mda content in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments was reduced by 13 78 19 53 and 17 43 respectively compared to that in the control treatment n0s2b2 indicating that the application of nitrogen fertilizer improved the salinity tolerance of cotton and reduced membrane lipid peroxidation under stress the latter may be explained be nitrogen applications under high salt stress increasing plant antioxidant enzyme activity thus reducing mda accumulation in seedling leaves ali et al 2021 3 4 2 antioxidant enzyme activity plant cell damage under salt stress is mainly due to the accumulation of large amounts of reactive oxygen species ros the resulting imbalance between ros production and removal causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative induced cell membrane damage xue and liu 2008 antioxidant enzymes such as pod and cat are the main regulators of antioxidant processes in plants scavenging harmful ros and maintaining the integrity and stability of cell membranes yasar et al 2008 in the present study the pod activity of cotton leaves increased throughout the growing period fig 7b in contrast cat activity increased and then decreased fig 7c in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application pod and cat activity increased in accordance with the increase of the b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount indicating that b subtilis removed excess ros from cotton leaves under salt stress maintained the metabolic balance of ros and protected cells against the damage caused by salt stress pod and cat activity increased after the nitrogen fertilizer treatments at the boll opening stage pod activity increased by 6 53 14 17 and 7 20 and cat activity increased by 11 60 24 31 and 33 70 in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments respectively as compared with that in the control treatment n0s2b2 this finding showed that additional nitrogen fertilizer under salt stress could improve ros scavenging help compensate for the ionic imbalance caused by salt stress ali et al 2021 and enhance salt resistance in cotton in the treatments of different soil salt content pod and cat activity exhibited a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing soil salt content suggesting that mild salt stress induced the increase of pod and cat activity in cotton leaves this increase effectively alleviated ros induced damage however salt stress tolerance was depleted at a high level of salt stress n2s3b2 treatment resulting in a decrease in pod and cat activity to different degrees the results revealed a threshold for ros scavenging in plant cells under salt stress below moderate levels of salt stress plants can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes enhance antioxidant capacity regulate the cell balance of ros and effectively alleviate cell damage caused by saline alkali stress fu et al 2017 fang et al 2021 the latter has been verified in jerusalem artichoke xue and liu 2008 and wheat mandhania et al 2006 3 4 3 soluble protein content osmotic regulation is one way in which plants resist environmental stress soluble plant proteins function as osmotic regulating agents maintaining cell expansion pressure and protecting the biofilm structure sun et al 2019a the soluble protein content responds to the degree of leaf senescence sun et al 2019a as shown in fig 7d the soluble protein content of cotton leaves in each treatment tended to increase and then decrease with the advance of the growth period reaching a maximum in the bud stage in this study soluble protein synthesis in cotton leaves increased from the seedling to the bud stage soluble protein synthesis decreased in the boll opening stage when the leaves entered the senescence stage in the treatments of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application the leaf soluble protein content was higher than that in the control group n2s2b0 the leaf soluble protein content showed a trend toward increasing and then decreasing with the rise of the nitrogen fertilizer application amount this finding indicated that b subtilis could promote soluble protein accumulation in cotton and mitigate salt stress induced damage of the plant s regulatory system thereby ensuring the maintenance of normal physiological activities in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments the soluble protein content increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application amount for example in the boll opening stage the soluble protein content in the n1s2b2 n2s2b2 and n3s2b2 treatments increased by 2 34 5 09 and 2 83 respectively compared with that in the control treatment n0s2b2 this finding suggested that nitrogen fertilizer applications could improve plant stress tolerance by reducing the osmotic potential of leaves and enhancing osmotic regulation ability ali et al 2021 in the treatments of different soil salt content with increasing soil salt stress the soluble protein content increased by 10 69 7 29 and 5 08 in the n2s1b2 n2s2b2 and n2s3b2 treatments respectively compared to that in the control treatment n2s0b2 indicating that low salt stress could stimulate cotton to increase the soluble protein content and alleviate cotton damage however the ability to withstand salt stress decreased as the soil salt increased due to the impact of salt stress on the plant s metabolic balance this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies which reported that salt stress induced changes in the soluble protein content of sorghum bicolor l moench seedlings sun et al 2019a and spring wheat ashraf and o leary 1999 in other studies salt stress appeared to inhibit nitrogen uptake by hazera tomato doganlar et al 2010 and tioga strawberry gulen et al 2006 thereby reducing the rate of plant protein synthesis thus the effect of salt stress on soluble protein content depends upon the plant species and variety 3 5 effects of bacteria nitrogen coupling on cotton yield different soil salt content the dry matter accumulation of cotton bolls in the boll opening stage is positively correlated with the yield of cotton cotton yield components and yield changes under the different treatments are shown in table 5 as shown in the table cotton yield first increased and then decreased with the increase of the b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount with the maximum yield in the n2s2b2 treatment where the yield increased by 48 82 as compared with that in the control treatment n2s2b0 in the treatments of different soil salt content yield reductions occurred with the increase of soil salt content with the reductions ranging from 2 97 to 40 39 in the nitrogen fertilizer treatments cotton yields tended to increase and then decrease with the increase of nitrogen application amount cotton yield was higher in the nitrogen treatments than the no nitrogen treatment which was similar to the observations of hou et al 2021 the cotton yield increased by 33 12 45 33 numerous studies have shown that nitrogen fertilizer has significant impacts on cotton yield and that an optimal application of nitrogen can provide ideal conditions for growth and productivity thind et al 2008 singh et al 2010 luo et al 2018 in arid areas the lack of water resources not only made the available water resources of agriculture scarce but also the secondary salinization problems occur frequently how to keep the limited water resources in the soil for crop absorption and utilization was the key to agricultural development the above research results showed that the distribution and activity of b subtilis in the root zone of crops could increase the water content of the root zone soil and reduce the evaporation of the soil zheng et al 2018 also confirmed this through indoor experiments b subtilis incubation or production of extracellular polymeric substances eps were potentially responsible for the changes in hydraulic properties and soil evaporation eps altered soil matrix structure and connectivity of pore space and modified the physicochemical properties of water surface tension and viscosity however van der ploeg et al 2011 studied that environmental conditions such as salinity can determine the specificity and need for the secretion of a bacterial tat substrate due to the differences in the secretion of b subtilis whether it could present the same action characteristics in different soil environments needed further study and analysis the increase of water content in the root zone could alleviate the stress of soil salt accumulation on crop water absorption the application of nitrogen fertilizer changes the distribution proportion of soil mineral ions while supplementing the nutrient elements required by crops which was also a way to alleviate soil salt stress the combined use of b subtilis and nitrogen fertilizer has changed the distribution characteristics of soil salt from the physical and chemical aspects respectively the bacillus nitrogen coupling strategy was a good choice for agricultural production in saline soil however b subtilis had biological activity and need high application conditions only when its living environment was relatively stable could b subtilis play its key role in this study b subtilis was kept 10 20 cm below the soil surface through tillage and the living environment was relatively stable when considering further large scale application of b subtilis it was necessary to consider the adaptability of local climate and soil environment 3 6 determination of coupling effect and production function of bacteria and nitrogen under different soil salt content 3 6 1 two factor coupling effect of bacteria salt and nitrogen the three experimental variables in this study were soil salt content b subtilis application amounts and nitrogen application amounts we used the following binary quadratic equations to determine the coupling effects of these variables 1 nitrogen salt interaction y 398 93 43 06 n 79 63 s 53 79 n 2 50 20 s 2 16 75 ns 2 nitrogen bacteria interaction y 398 93 43 06 n 23 9 b 53 79 n 2 62 84 b 2 62 44 nb 3 salt bacteria interaction y 398 93 79 63 s 23 9 b 50 20 s 2 62 84 b 2 12 19 sb where y was the cotton yield kg hm 2 n was the nitrogen fertilizer application amount kg hm 2 s was the soil salt content and b was the b subtilis agent application amount mg kg 1 fig 8 showed the combined effects of two of each of the three experimental variables on cotton yield as shown in fig 8 a cotton yield tended to increase and then decrease with the increase of b subtilis agent application amount this finding may be attributed to mutual competition between microorganisms and the crop under nutrient poor conditions this negative effect was reduced by an increase in the application amount of nitrogen at moderate nitrogen rates the optimum cotton yield of 6044 15 6154 49 kg hm 2 was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 5 7 mg kg 1 at high nitrogen rates soil nutrient enrichment soil nutrient and microbial activity showed a spiral upward trend as a result when b subtilis agent application amount was 6 8 mg kg 1 the cotton yield could be maintained at 6209 66 6264 83 kg hm 2 from fig 8 b it could be found that the increased application of nitrogen fertilizer alleviated crop damage caused by salt stress combined with consideration of environmental effects the best yield range can be achieved by the nitrogen application amount of about 300 kg hm 2 fig 8 c referred to the combination effects of b subtilis agent nitrogen fertilizer and soil salt content as shown in fig 8 c in the nonsalinized and mildly salinized soil treatments cotton yields first increased and then decreased with the increase of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer application amount the best cotton yield 6530 kg hm 2 was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 5 7 mg kg 1 in the moderately salinized soils cotton yield tended to decrease and then increase with the increase of the b subtilis agent application amount and the optimal yield was around 5625 6078 kg hm 2 in the severely salinized soils the optimal yield was 3815 4268 kg hm 2 when the application amount of b subtilis agent was 3 7 mg kg 1 3 6 2 optimal combinations of b subtilis agent salt and nitrogen to further clarify the combined effects of b subtilis agent nitrogen fertilizer application and soil salt content on cotton yield three experimental variables were taken as independent variables in the ternary quadratic regression model ternary quadratic regression model under the combined effects of b subtilis salt and nitrogen

content and b was the b subtilis agent application amount mg kg 1 through fitting calculation when the soil salt content was 1 61 g kg 1 the maximum cotton yield was obtained at b subtilis agent application amount of 6 mg kg 1 and nitrogen application amount of 381 195 kg hm 2 4 conclusions bacillus subtilis could inhibited the accumulation of excessive sodium and improve the absorption of nutrients by crops this study proposed to use the functional advantages of b subtilis in the root layer soil and establish a bacteria fertilizer coupling improvement strategy the application of b subtilis agent under salt stress increased the soil profile water content and enhanced soil water retention meanwhile b subtilis agent application promoted soil nitrate nitrogen retention capacity increased nitrogen utilization the increase of soil salt content promoted mda accumulation mild salt stress stimulated the production of pod and cat enzymes in cotton leaves b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer applications under salt stress improved the physiological activity in leaves and alleviated oxidative damage under salt stress according to the cotton yield under salt stress coupling application of b subtilis agent and nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the dry matter accumulation and final yield of cotton the results could provide a theoretical basis and

biomass established five times faster on controlled seeded fans 10 days compared to fans left to naturally establish 7 weeks in the second experiment both oedogonium sp and mixed species algal assemblages seeded through controlled seeding established uniformly on fans within two weeks overall the seeding method and species composition of algal seeded on fans did not significantly affect biomass productivity and nutrient removal performance however biomass washed off from oedogonium sp fans was four and a half times lower than the amount washed off the mixed species fans resulting in a higher standing crop on oedogonium sp fans and a subsequently higher nutrient removal rate due to algal assimilation furthermore fans seeded with oedogonium sp had a lower contamination rate in terms of percentage coverage of non target species than mixed species fans these results demonstrate that controlled seeding and cultivation of a single target filamentous algae species will help maintain a higher abundance of a target species over a longer period enabling the recovery of high quality biomass keywords algae turf scrubber bioremediation diffuse pollution monoculture polyculture

freshwater quality especially in the form of diffuse nutrients ripa et al 2006 howard williams et al 2010 duncan 2017 agricultural drainage is a major source of diffuse nutrients to freshwaters

blooms and can result in the degradation of ecosystems anderson et al 2008 abell et al 2011 paerl and otten 2013 diffuse nutrients in agricultural drainage mainly nitrogen and phosphorus result from the use of fertiliser and the deposition of faeces and urine by grazing livestock which are transported into waterways through surface runoff and shallow groundwater through subsurface drainage heathwaite and dils 2000 nguyen and sukias 2002 heathwaite et al 2005 reducing nutrient concentrations in agricultural drainage is therefore critical to significantly reduce the eutrophication of new zealand s waterways ballantine and davies colley 2014 scarsbrook and melland 2015 filamentous algae nutrient scrubbers fans could provide a natural effective and sustainable approach to reduce nutrient concentrations in agricultural drainage fans are ecologically engineered floways that grow attached filamentous algae and associated periphyton to assimilate dissolved nutrients through algal photosynthesis craggs 2001 adey et al 2011 sutherland and craggs 2017 fans have been successfully operated for extended periods of time under varying outdoor conditions and across multiple seasons to bioremediate a wide range of polluted water craggs et al 1996 mulbry et al 2008 2010 sandefur et al 2011 adey et al 2013 kangas and mulbry 2014 d aiuto et al 2015 kangas et al 2017 marella et al 2019 fans have the potential to not only bioremediate the diffuse nutrients in agricultural drainage but also to store these nutrients in the form of algal biomass that can be regularly harvested thereby reusing the nutrients as a feedstock for the production of value added products smith 2014 lawton et al 2017 in addition fans may only require half of the land area to achieve the same nitrogen removal compared to other approaches such as constructed wetlands that are commonly used to treat agricultural drainage sutherland and craggs 2017 park et al 2022 filamentous algae naturally grow attached to a substrate aided by several biological mechanisms including algal biofilm establishment microbial succession and symbiotic relationships with bacteria riding 2000 mieszkin et al 2013 therefore fans are typically seeded by allowing algae from nearby waterways to establish naturally on the fans liner wilkie and mulbry 2002 mulbry et al 2008 adey et al 2013 d aiuto et al 2015 however filamentous algal attachment can also be achieved through the novel approach of controlled seeding by rubbing algal biomass onto the fans liner hariz et al 2022 this provides initial attachment through physically hooking algal filaments onto the fans liner secondary attachment then occurs through the subsequent development of holdfasts through two biological attachment mechanisms rhizoid formation and zoospore formation and settling there are several ways that the seeding approach e g natural establishment vs controlled seeded may affect overall fans performance natural establishment fans take longer to establish a uniform attached biomass three weeks to two months mulbry et al 2008 compared to controlled seeded fans as little as four days hariz et al 2023a this could be due to an uncontrolled or insufficient amount of algal seed introduced as inoculum when using a natural establishment seeding approach as the amount of algal seed is highly dependent on the abundance of algae in the waterway used for seeding phang et al 2004 carl et al 2014 in contrast a large amount of algal seed can be added to the fans liner at the start of seeding through the controlled seeding method subsequently promoting a higher rate of settlement on fans liner by algal spores hariz et al 2023b in addition faster and more uniform biomass establishment across the entire fans surface can be achieved through controlled seeding by adding more biomass or conducting daily reseeding on selected areas that are lacking coverage aside from differences between seeding methods in the time taken to establish a uniform biomass attachment and coverage the dominance of algal species that establish on natural establishment fans may be difficult to control and can vary widely through time with potential significant effects on overall fans performance craggs et al 1996 craggs 2001 fans are typically seeded with mixed algal assemblages sandefur et al 2011 liu et al 2016 park et al 2022 however it is also possible to establish and maintain a single selected filamentous algae species on fans hariz et al 2022 while the cultivation of a single species on fans may not be required for effective nutrient removal targeting a single high performing species that can grow under a broad range of conditions could reduce the impact of environmental variation on biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency hariz et al 2023b furthermore selecting a single target species could provide a consistent source of high quality biomass lawton et al 2013 neveux et al 2016 and facilitate the optimization of operational parameters for a specific aim e g bioremediation biomass production or both hariz et al 2023a however maintaining a single species on outdoor fans treating polluted water could be challenging if the target species has been previously maintained under controlled laboratory conditions as it may be poorly adapted to varying ambient environmental conditions and water quality liu et al 2020 seeding fans with a mixed species assemblage collected from a nearby waterway may help the algae establish faster as it is likely be adapted to ambient conditions however the algal biomass may contain a significant amount of non target competing species such as diatoms and cyanobacteria that could grow faster than the green filamentous algae and quickly come to dominate the biomass on the fans lawton et al 2013 cole et al 2015 hariz et al 2023b this could significantly affect the overall fans performance in terms of biomass productivity and nutrient removal rates and result in a harvested biomass of low quality hariz et al 2023b despite the potential large influence of using a single vs mixed species assemblage on the performance of fans this issue has only been addressed in two studies using suspension non attached algal cultivation systems lawton et al 2013 valero rodriguez et al 2020 thus far the effects of single vs mixed species assemblages on growth nutrient removal rates and algal composition dynamics in attached algal cultivation systems such as fans have not been investigated and remain a critical knowledge gap liu et al 2020 karimi et al 2022 the overall aim of this study was to compare the effects of seeding approach and single species vs mixed species algal assemblages on the performance of pilot scale fans for the in situ treatment of agricultural drainage on a dairy farm the specific aims were i to compare the time taken to establish a uniform algal standing crop biomass productivity nutrient removal and species dominance on fans seeded by either natural establishment or by controlled seeding of a single target species and ii to compare the time taken to establish a uniform algal standing crop biomass productivity nutrient removal and dominance of species on fans seeded through controlled seeding of a single target species and fans seeded through controlled seeding of an adapted mixed species algal assemblage this study was conducted in two separate experiments the first experiment compared the performance of fans seeded with the target species oedogonium sp and fans naturally seeded with filamentous algae originating from an on farm drainage stream the second experiment compared the performance of fans seeded using controlled seeding with the target species oedogonium sp and fans seeded using controlled seeding with a mixed algal assemblage collected from a nearby drainage stream on the farm oedogonium sp was selected as the target species to be seeded on fans as it had up to 4 fold higher biomass productivity and the highest nutrient removal rate compared to cladophora sp rhizoclonium sp and spirogyra sp when cultivated on outdoor pilot scale fans under ambient summer and winter conditions hariz et al 2023b in addition oedogonium sp had the highest zoospore production and strongest secondary attachment capability of these four species in small scale microfans cultivation systems hariz et al 2022 2 methods 2 1 pilot scale filamentous algae nutrient scrubber the pilot scale fans system used in this study consisted of six floways made from aluminium i beams size 6 m length x 0 12 m width x 0 05 m depth with a high density polyethylene hdpe textured liner size 6 m x 0 12 m or 0 72 m2 the textured liner was permanently attached to the base of the floways using a multi purpose permanent elastic sealant adhesive glue brand bostik isr 70 03 this liner was chosen as studies have shown that textured substratum or surfaces with variable topography can enhance algal attachment maggs and callow 2003 blersch et al 2017 2 2 study site the study was conducted by an agricultural drainage stream on a 94 hectare low land dairy farm near morrisville new zealand 37 41 41

approximately 420 cows which are pasture fed the pasture is predominantly covered by ryegrass the farm drainage stream receives water from surface runoff and subsurface runoff from the paddocks through subsurface drain pipes tiles the stream flows between paddocks with electric fences installed along the stream embankment to exclude cows the first experiment was conducted next to a small stream that was 1 m wide and 1 5 m deep site 1 fig a 1 the stream continually flowed all year but had minimal flow during the autumn april to june the second experiment was located approximately 200 m downstream from the location of the first experiment next to a small river 10 m wide and 3 m deep site 2 fig a 1 this river flowed year round as it received water from multiple streams and drainage ditches on the farm including the stream used in the first experiment 2 3 controlled seeded single species fans vs natural establishment mixed species fans the on farm performance of fans seeded with the single species oedogonium sp controlled seeded and fans seeded through the natural establishment of mixed species algal assemblages to treat agricultural drainage was compared in a three month study six fans floways were installed on three horizontal lengths of scaffolding steel tubes approximately 50 cm above the stream water level on the embankment next to the stream the floways were placed to flow in the same direction as the stream fig 1 the horizontal scaffolding tubes were adjusted so that the floways had a slope of approximately 2 to provide gravity flow from the top inflow to the bottom outflow during the day water from the stream was pumped into a 200 l black water hdpe header tank 58 cm diameter x 98 cm high using a solar powered pump a 200 w solar panel provided power to the pump through two 7 amp hour 12 v batteries the 24 v dc submersible pump 3 phase was installed underwater at approximately 30 cm above the stream bottom and pumped water through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe into the header tank which was placed on the stream embankment the submersible water pump intake was covered with a 1 mm mesh to filter out sediment particles sand silt and clay and plant debris accumulated sediment was regularly removed at least once a week by cleaning and backwashing the mesh an additional 25 mm pvc water pipe was installed approximately 10 cm from the top of the water tank to channel water back into the stream to prevent water from overflowing when the tank was full water collected in the water tank was channeled to an inflow water distribution sump 100 l x 25 cm width x 21 cm height uv resistant plastic through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe additional water was channeled into the same inflow water distribution sump through a separate water pipe 32 mm diameter x 25 m length uv resistant flexible pool hose that collected water from upstream through gravity flow intake point approximately 25 m upstream from where the fans were installed the gravity flow intake water hose was covered with a 1 mm mesh and was regularly cleaned as described above flow from the water collection tank and the gravity flow water hose to the inflow water distribution sump was controlled by two 32 mm ball valves installed inside the inflow water distribution sump these ball valves were adjusted to deliver 6 l min 1 from the 200 l black water collection tank and 3 l min 1 from the gravity flow into the inflow distribution sump the inflow water distribution sump was placed at the top of all fans and had six inflow pipes each with adjustable valves 25 mm brass gate valve installed to channel water to the top of each fans the inflow flow rate to each fans was adjusted to 1 l min 1 equivalent to 8 l min 1 m width of floway using a digital flow rate meter digiflow 6710 m vyair each floway received 1 l min 1 of flow during the day average of 10 h through a combination of water pumped through solar power and the gravity flow and approximately 0 4 l min 1 equivalent to 3 l min 1 m width of floway of flow during the night where the system was completely dependent on the gravity flow flow rates were maintained throughout the experimental period and checked volumetrically twice a week the outflow water from each fans was collected and channeled back into the stream using a 3 m length of pvc spouting the outflow of each floway was equipped with 0 5 mm mesh to collect any algal biomass that washed off three replicate fans were seeded with a single species of oedogonium sp at the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa facility at ruakura hamilton new zealand the fans were seeded by evenly distributing and rubbing 30 g fresh weight fw oedogonium sp biomass equivalent to 5 g dry weight dw or a loading rate of 7 g dw m 2 onto the textured liner to hook algae filaments and provide initial physical attachment controlled seeding hariz et al 2023b a continuous influent flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 equivalent to 4 l min 1 m width of floway was used for the first seven days after seeding thereafter an influent flow rate of 1 l min 1 equivalent to 8 l min 1 m width of floway was used throughout the seeding phase over time secondary biological attachment occurred through the growth of holdfasts from the settlement of oedogonium sp zoospores onto the liner it took ten days from 10th to 20th december 2021 to establish a dense algal turf on the liner surface the three oedogonium sp seeded fans were then transported to the farm and installed along the stream on the 21st december 2021 each fans received a stream water inflow of 1 l min 1 for 10 h during the day and then only 0 4 l min 1 during the night as described above the three oedogonium sp seeded fans were harvested once every seven days by drawing a metal scraper down the surface of the liner to maintain a target initial algal standing crop of approximately 0 5 1 cm height on the 13th december 2021 the natural establishment fans were installed unseeded and operated to allow algae from the stream to begin to naturally establish the natural establishment fans took approximately seven weeks until 1st february 2022 to form a uniform algal turf on all replicate fans weekly biomass monitoring and water sampling was conducted from 4th of january 2022 providing time for the controlled seeded oedogonium sp biomass to adjust to the new growing conditions and farm drainage water and for the natural establishment fans algal turf to establish on the liner at the start of this monitoring period the biomass on the oedogonium sp seeded fans was harvested by drawing a metal scraper down the surface of the liner to leave a comparable initial standing crop on all replicates of approximately 65 g dw m2 algal turf of approximately 0 5 1 cm height however the natural establishment fans had uneven algal biomass coverage on the liner 50 surface area covered and an initial standing crop of only approximately 16 g dw m2 algal turf of approximately 0 5 cm height and so were left unharvested weekly biomass monitoring and water sampling were then conducted over the following 91 days as described below

rainfall hobo pendant event data logger and water temperature hobo pendant mx2200 water temperature data logger the water temperature data logger was placed inside the inflow water distribution sump and the outflow fans drainage gutter the light data logger was secured next to the fans on a levelled horizontal surface the ambient temperature data logger was placed inside a solar radiation shield to avoid direct solar radiation the study was conducted during the summer months from mid december 2021 to early april 2022 the maximum sunlight intensity of each day ranged from 194 to 2072 µmol m 2

method was used to quantify the initial standing crop and the biomass productivity dw g m 2 d of each replicate fans once per week for the duration of the experiment the initial standing crop was determined by entirely scrapping the attached algal biomass off the floway in a horizontal strip area 0 12 m x 0 025 m at 3 points along the length of the fans top middle and bottom a different metal scrapper was used for oedogonium sp seeded fans and natural establishment fans to avoid cross contamination the scrapped biomass samples were dried overnight in an oven at 65 ⁰c subsequently weighed and used to calculate the dw initial standing crop the total fans initial standing crop was then estimated as follows total fans area 0 12 m x 6 m 0 72 m 2 strip monitoring area 0 12 m x 0 025 m 0 003

metal scraper leaving a uniform cover of attached algal biomass with 0 5 1 cm height the natural establishment fans were only harvested from week five of the experiment onwards as a dense uniform algal turf did not form until four weeks after the biomass monitoring and water sampling had started immediately after harvesting the strip biomass monitoring steps were repeated as described above to determine the dw initial standing crop standing crop following harvest for each replicate fans for the next weekly growth cycle each week a 50 ml water sample was collected from the inflow and outflow of each replicate fans immediately before harvest and 20 min following flow being restored following harvest the sample was filtered using a 0 7 µm glass microfiber filter brand whatman gf f and the concentration of nitrate n no3 and dissolved reactive phosphate drp in each water sample was determined on a microplate reader using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method standard method nitrate

total volatile solids vss and ash content once every four weeks according to standard methods standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2005 fig a 8 every fortnight immediately before harvesting a small subsample of attached algal biomass was collected from the strip monitoring area 0 12 m x 0 025 m or 0 003 m2 on each replicate fans and used to microscopically quantify the relative abundance of algae species and other contamination samples were preserved in a 15 ml vial with a few drops of lugol s solution and were analyzed within five days of collection immediately before analysis each sample was filtered using a 200 µm sieve and then washed with 10 ml of filtered water which was collected for analysis filtrate this step separated epiphytic diatoms midges and any other visible organisms attached to algal filaments to make it easier to see cellular detail and identify algae species under the microscope the retained algal biomass and 10 ml filtrate were analysed using an inverted microscope leica dmi1 the combined biomass and filtrate were proportionately divided onto each of ten microscope slides for each sample then a photograph of each slide was taken under 100 x magnification giving a total of ten photos for each sample in each photo the percentage composition of green filamentous algae genera and other contaminants diatoms and cyanobacteria was estimated based on the surface area covered the percentage compositions were then averaged to provide a measure of the relative abundance of each genera of green filamentous algae and other contaminants for each replicate fans the ash content of the harvested algal biomass on each replicate fans was analysed once every four weeks fig a 9 total harvested biomass was blended using a handheld blender living co sro8310 600 w stick stainless steel mixer and a 100 ml subsample of blended biomass was dried overnight in an oven at 65 c the dried subsample was weighed as total dried

flowed in the same direction as the river fig 2 the scaffolding tubes were adjusted so that the floways had a slope of approximately 2 to provide gravity flow from the top inflow to the end outflow a solar powered pump was used to transfer river water to a water storage system consisting of eight 1000 l black ibc water tanks a solar power system was installed at the site to only pump water during daylight hours it consisted of six 455 w solar panels directly connected to six 220 amp hour 12 v batteries with an inverter connected to two submersible pumps xylem lowara doc 3 submersible pump the submersible water pump was installed underwater at approximately 30 cm above the river bottom and pumped water through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe into the eight 1000 l water tanks which were placed on the stream embankment two tanks were used for intermediate water storage during the day and the remaining six tanks stored water to enable continuous flow during the night water collected in the tanks was channeled to an inflow water distribution sump 100 l x 25 cm width x 21 cm height uv resistant plastic through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe water flow from the day and night water tanks were controlled by two 32 mm ball valves installed inside the inflow water distribution sump these ball valves were adjusted to deliver 6 l min 1 from the day flow tank and 4 l min 1 from the night flow tank into the inflow distribution sump the daytime inflow flow rate to each fans was adjusted to 1 l min 1 equivalent to 8 l min 1 m width of floway pumped through solar power at night when the solar pump had stopped pumping and water was sourced from the collected water stored in the tanks the flow reduced to approximately 0 5 l min 1 equivalent to 4 l min 1 m width of floway of flow

more than 50 of the established biomass for the first 60 days after seeding and thereafter oedogonium sp relative abundance fluctuated between 20 and 30 until the end of the experiment the relative abundance of filamentous diatoms increased gradually between weeks 1 and 7 and then rapidly increased between weeks 7 and 9 and then continued to increase slightly until the end of the experiment the

5 towards the end of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 controlled seeding vs natural establishment the ability of filamentous algae to quickly establish and form a dense uniform cover on the fans liner is desirable when operating fans this can significantly speed up the seeding stage and establishment of a target initial standing crop in the first experiment we found considerable differences in the time taken to establish a dense uniform biomass cover on the liner between seeding methods the controlled seeded fans established a uniform algal turf about five times faster 10 days than the natural establishment fans 50 days the rapid establishment of oedogonium sp biomass on controlled seeded fans is most likely due to the large amount of algal biomass added on a single occasion at the start of seeding which promoted the rapid development of secondary algal attachment through the growth of rhizoids and holdfasts from spores hariz et al 2022 in contrast the natural establishment fans were gradually seeded over several weeks by algal spores and fragments from the stream water that were caught on and subsequently attached to the liner this natural seeding could have been faster if there had been greater algal biomass growing in the stream at the time the low abundance of filamentous algae in the stream may have been due to a range of factors including time of year sub optimal light and temperature lack of attachment substrate unfavourable stream current high water turbidity low nutrient availability and grazing by stream invertebrates which made conditions in the stream suboptimal for growth ghosh and gaur 1998 álvarez and peckarsky 2005 dzialowski et al 2008 mccall et al 2017 in particular seasonal variation in temperature and irradiance are likely to have large influence on the abundance of algae in the stream as algae are typically naturally abundant from spring through summer until early autumn when temperatures are warm and have lower abundance during cooler temperatures in winter de vries and hillebrand 1986 berry and lembi 2000 salovius and bonsdorff 2004 sousa dias and melo 2008 however we observed a higher abundance of algae in the stream in the late summer early autumn compared to when we first installed the natural establishment fans in early summer december 2021 when algal biomass in the stream was hardly seen in addition we observed the water flow in the stream was higher when we first started the experiment and thereafter the water flow gradually decreased until the end of the experiment a higher water flow increases physical disturbance to naturally occurring algae in the stream leading to higher rate of algal biomass washing off and a subsequent lower algal abundance our results show that the success of the natural establishment method is highly dependent on the season and stream current when seeding occurs in particular the establishment of a dense biomass coverage on fans will be faster when natural algal abundance is high and is likely to take longer during periods when natural algal abundance is low throughout the three month experiment the average biomass productivity was 3 1 2 2 g dw m 2 d for controlled seeding fans and 3 0 2 2 g dw m 2 d for natural establishment fans these productivities are comparable to the average biomass productivity reported for fans treating agricultural drainage 4

g dw m 2 d wilkie and mulbry 2002 our results show there was no significant difference in biomass productivity between seeding methods however there was a significant effect of growth cycle suggesting that environmental conditions potentially had a stronger effect on biomass productivity than seeding method several environmental conditions are known to contribute to changes in algal biomass productivity including inflow nutrient concentration temperature and solar irradiance sand jensen 1989 sutherland et al 2013 cole et al 2016 however biomass productivity did not appear to vary predictably with changes in any one of these factors instead variation in biomass productivity between growth cycles may have been driven by interactive effects between environmental factors most likely irradiance and temperature such a result has been demonstrated previously for oedogonium sp where biomass productivity increased under lower temperatures below optimal range of 20 35 c when irradiance was high but decreased under higher temperatures 35 c when irradiance was high cole et al 2018 temperatures and irradiances fluctuated considerably throughout the experiment and were not always correlated with each other or biomass productivity for example our results show that while productivity appeared to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in temperature in some growth cycles in five of the 13 growth cycles there appeared to be an inverse relationship where productivity decreased with an increase in temperature e g cycles 2 and 8 or increased with a decrease in temperature e g cycles 5 9 and 12 fig a 18 and table a 1 similarly productivity appeared to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in light intensity in only four of the 13 cycles cycles 3 5 11 and 13 these results suggest a similar interactive effect between temperature and irradiance on biomass productivity could have been occurring nitrate and phosphate removal rates varied significantly between seeding methods however the best performing seeding method varied throughout the experiment this variation in nitrate and phosphate removal rates appeared to be driven by the concentration of nitrate and phosphate in the fans inflow which varied markedly throughout the experiment 2 1 g n m 3 to 5 7 g n m 3 and 0 04 g p m 3 to 0 87 g p m 3 with higher nutrient concentrations resulting in higher nutrient removal rates fig a 19 this finding of nutrient concentrations having a stronger effect on nutrient removal than seeding method is another example of environmental variation driving performance rather than seeding method as was found for biomass productivity notably our results provide no clear indication whether the increase in nutrient loading enhanced the nutrient removal efficiency of the algae as the uptake of nutrients per unit of algal biomass was not determined for the harvested biomass of each growth cycle but as recent studies have reported increases in algal nutrient removal efficiency with an increase in nitrate and phosphate loading mhatre naik et al 2021 sutherland and ralph 2021 we expect that a similar effect was occurring here the potential of the target species to maintain dominance on a floway over other non target species e g diatoms and cyanobacteria under varying environmental conditions for an extended period is a desirable characteristic to consider when selecting the best seeding method for fans a high relative abundance of a single green filamentous algal species on fans provides a higher consistency of biomass composition and therefore higher quality of biomass than a mixed species assemblage which can have a variable species abundance and therefore a variable biomass composition through time the controlled seeded fans maintained a high relative abundance 50 of oedogonium sp over 40 days after seeding in contrast the natural establishment fans took over 60 days to establish at least a 50 relative abundance of green filamentous algae e g oedogonium sp that originated from the stream this result suggests that controlled seeding allows a higher relative abundance of a target filamentous algae species to be maintained for a longer duration on fans than the natural establishment method this may be because there were fewer empty spaces on the controlled seeded fans compared to the natural establishment fans which resulted in a lower rate of colonization of non target species such as competitively dominant diatoms filamentous diatoms are highly competitive against other green algae biggs 1990 which probably enabled them to grow and establish rapidly on fans especially when space was available following harvest consequently non target species such as filamentous diatoms can establish rapidly on fans that start with an empty liner e g natural establishment fans compared to fans that have already been seeded with a dominant species e g oedogonium sp controlled seeded fans 4 2 single species vs mixed species assemblages we found reasonable similarity in the time taken to establish a dense uniform algal turf on fans between single species of oedogonium sp and mixed species when controlled seeding was used for all fans in the second experiment both fans took approximately two weeks to establish a uniform turf on the liner however there was a considerable difference in the ability of the seeded algae to maintain the established standing crop on the fans in most growth cycles oedogonium sp fans had a higher standing crop than the mixed species fans resulting from a lower rate of biomass washing off the floway in contrast to oedogonium sp fans the standing crop established on mixed species fans was easily fragmented especially when there was a high current and rainfall we found that filamentous diatoms established twice as quickly on the mixed species fans 60 relative abundance in 35 days than on the single species oedogonium sp seeded fans 56 relative abundance in 63 days therefore a higher rate of biomass wash off may be a consequence of the higher relative abundance of filamentous diatoms e g melosira sp established on mixed species fans as filamentous diatoms are known to fragment easily compared to green filamentous algae tapolczai et al 2016 park et al 2022 although the filament characteristics and attachment strength may vary depending on the algal species this finding suggests that maintaining a single target species that does not fragment easily could minimize the rate of biomass wash off from the floways due to filament fragmentation biomass productivity varied significantly between oedogonium sp fans and mixed species fans however this variation was not consistent throughout the experiment as we found for experiment 1 environmental conditions in particular rainfall and temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on biomass productivity than the seeded species we observed a notable decline in biomass productivity in growth cycle 3 from 17th to 24th of may 2022 which coincided with a significant period of high rainfall sum of rainfall for this period 59 2 mm fig 8 and fig a 17 in contrast biomass productivity was highest in growth cycle 11 12th to 19th of july 2022 when the rainfall was two and half times lower sum of rainfall for this growth cycle 23 8 mm compared to cycle 3 similarly we observed a decrease in biomass productivity from growth cycle 1 3 5th to 24th may 2022 that coincided with a substantial drop in inlet water temperature to as low as 2 ⁰c but overall biomass productivity subsequently started to increase when water temperature rose above 0 ⁰c after 29th may 2022 rainfall can result in increased biomass fragmentation that leads to increased rates of biomass washing off the floway due to higher flow disturbance furthermore rainfall can result in increased siltation in the influent causing a negative impact on algal photosynthesis and growth due to light attenuation and smothering of the algal biomass by sediments chen et al 2015 while lower water temperature reduces membrane fluidity limits electron exchange and decreases photosynthetic efficiency cardinale et al 2013 smith and crews 2014 newby et al 2016 which could significantly affect biomass production notably the maximum biomass productivity in the second experiment was about one and a half times lower than in the first experiment this lower overall biomass productivity of both seeded species may have been due to the lower water temperature lower irradiance shorter daylight period lower ambient temperature including the occasional night frost and higher cumulative rainfall in the second experiment compared to the first experiment which resulted in suboptimal growth conditions a strong seasonal effect on fans biomass productivity has been reported previously with oedogonium sp productivity on fans under outdoor ambient conditions being almost three fold higher in summer compared to winter due to the differences in water and ambient temperatures and solar irradiance between seasons hariz et al 2023b these results further highlight the strong influence of environmental conditions on fans performance nitrate and phosphate removal rates varied significantly between species however as for biomass productivity this variation was not consistent throughout the experiment the nitrate removal rate increased with increasing nitrate concentration in the fans inflow however this relationship was not evident for phosphate removal and phosphate concentration in the fans inflow the lack of an apparent trend for phosphate removal rate relative to inflow phosphate concentration may be a result of the variation in the concentration of phosphate in the fans inflow range 0 02 g p m 3 and 0 45 g p m 3 being considerably lower than the variation in the concentration of nitrate in the fans inflow range 0 67 g n m 3 and 6 72 g n m 3 we found a considerable difference in overall nutrient removal rates between the first and second experiments the removal rates of nitrate and phosphate were at least 1 7 fold and 1 3 fold respectively lower in the second experiment compared to the first experiment most likely as a result of lower biomass productivities in the second experiment due to lower ambient temperature and irradiance and higher rainfall these findings suggest that there is strong positive relationship between nutrient removal and biomass productivity for fans where high nutrient removal rates are correlated with high biomass productivity a further difference in fans performance between seeded species was their ability to maintain a higher relative abundance of the seeded species on the fans floway fans seeded with the single species oedogonium sp maintained a relative abundance of oedogonium sp of more than 50 over 60 days after seeding in contrast the relative abundance of each green filamentous algal species seeded on mixed species fans varied greatly throughout the experiment and none of the seeded mixed green filamentous algae species dominated the fans all had 50 relative abundance the larger amount of pure oedogonium sp added to the single species fans during seeding may have resulted in their higher relative abundance over other non target species for an extended period in contrast the total amount of each green filamentous algae species that was added onto the mixed species fans during seeding was lower potentially making it difficult for any one species to gain dominance these results suggest that differences in the total amount of each species added upon seeding in particular whether a single species or multiple species are seeded can influence their long term abundance on fans this conclusion is supported by a recent study assessing the performance of pilot scale fans treating river water over a three month period park et al 2022 fans were initially seeded using controlled seeding with a mixed assemblage of green filamentous algae comprised of equal proportions of oedogonium sp cladophora sp rhizoclonium sp and spirogyra sp however despite the higher initial loading rates of algal biomass on the floway during seeding 40 g dw m 2 compared to 7 g dw m 2 in the current study no single seeded species was able to dominate and non target diatoms eventually accounted for more than 80 of the total biomass park et al 2022 in comparison to the first experiment mixed species seeded through controlled seeding in the second experiment maintained the initially seeded abundance of filamentous algae longer than mixed species seeded through natural establishment in the first experiment in particular the mixed species fans seeded through controlled seeding maintained an abundance of oedogonium sp of up to 40 for the first 50 days compared to natural establishment fans where oedogonium sp took 60 days to establish 50 relative abundance but was unable to maintain this abundance for longer than two weeks and showed a marked decline towards the end of the experiment in combination these results demonstrate that controlled seeding provides faster higher and longer control of fans species composition than natural establishment 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that controlled seeding promotes faster biomass establishment on fans than the natural establishment method however environmental conditions had a stronger effect on biomass productivity and nutrient removal than seeding method and seeded species single species vs mixed species seeded species did influence the standing crop that was able to be maintained on fans with single oedogonium sp fans having a lower rate of biomass wash off compared to filamentous diatom dominated mixed species fans moreover these results clearly demonstrate that fans seeded with a single target species have the potential to be operated with a higher relative abundance for a longer period compared to fans seeded with a mixed species assemblage our findings provide insights into how controlled seeding and targeting single filamentous algae species can influence nutrient removal and the production of high quality biomass on fans the cultivation approach used in this study can be applied in other locations to promote year round fans operation and treat various types of polluted water however further improvement on the cultivation approach is required to overcome some limitations of fans seeding through rubbing a larger scale fans out in the field statement of informed consent human animal rights no conflicts informed consent

9038,fans have potential for on farm treatment to remove and recover nutrients from agricultural drainage the performance of fans can be influenced by the seeding method and the species composition of the algal biomass this study compared the effects of seeding approach controlled seeded vs natural establishment experiment 1 and single species oedogonium sp vs mixed species algal assemblages experiment 2 on the biomass productivity and nutrient removal rates of fans treating agricultural drainage in two on farm experiments each conducted over a three month period in the first experiment biomass established five times faster on controlled seeded fans 10 days compared to fans left to naturally establish 7 weeks in the second experiment both oedogonium sp and mixed species algal assemblages seeded through controlled seeding established uniformly on fans within two weeks overall the seeding method and species composition of algal seeded on fans did not significantly affect biomass productivity and nutrient removal performance however biomass washed off from oedogonium sp fans was four and a half times lower than the amount washed off the mixed species fans resulting in a higher standing crop on oedogonium sp fans and a subsequently higher nutrient removal rate due to algal assimilation furthermore fans seeded with oedogonium sp had a lower contamination rate in terms of percentage coverage of non target species than mixed species fans these results demonstrate that controlled seeding and cultivation of a single target filamentous algae species will help maintain a higher abundance of a target species over a longer period enabling the recovery of high quality biomass keywords algae turf scrubber bioremediation diffuse pollution monoculture polyculture

fans have the potential to not only bioremediate the diffuse nutrients in agricultural drainage but also to store these nutrients in the form of algal biomass that can be regularly harvested thereby reusing the nutrients as a feedstock for the production of value added products smith 2014 lawton et al 2017 in addition fans may only require half of the land area to achieve the same nitrogen removal compared to other approaches such as constructed wetlands that are commonly used to treat agricultural drainage sutherland and craggs 2017 park et al 2022 filamentous algae naturally grow attached to a substrate aided by several biological mechanisms including algal biofilm establishment microbial succession and symbiotic relationships with bacteria riding 2000 mieszkin et al 2013 therefore fans are typically seeded by allowing algae from nearby waterways to establish naturally on the fans liner wilkie and mulbry 2002 mulbry et al 2008 adey et al 2013 d aiuto et al 2015 however filamentous algal attachment can also be achieved through the novel approach of controlled seeding by rubbing algal biomass onto the fans liner hariz et al 2022 this provides initial attachment through physically hooking algal filaments onto the fans liner secondary attachment then occurs through the subsequent development of holdfasts through two biological attachment mechanisms rhizoid formation and zoospore formation and settling there are several ways that the seeding approach e g natural establishment vs controlled seeded may affect overall fans performance natural establishment fans take longer to establish a uniform attached biomass three weeks to two months mulbry et al 2008 compared to controlled seeded fans as little as four days hariz et al 2023a this could be due to an uncontrolled or insufficient amount of algal seed introduced as inoculum when using a natural establishment seeding approach as the amount of algal seed is highly dependent on the abundance of algae in the waterway used for seeding phang et al 2004 carl et al 2014 in contrast a large amount of algal seed can be added to the fans liner at the start of seeding through the controlled seeding method subsequently promoting a higher rate of settlement on fans liner by algal spores hariz et al 2023b in addition faster and more uniform biomass establishment across the entire fans surface can be achieved through controlled seeding by adding more biomass or conducting daily reseeding on selected areas that are lacking coverage aside from differences between seeding methods in the time taken to establish a uniform biomass attachment and coverage the dominance of algal species that establish on natural establishment fans may be difficult to control and can vary widely through time with potential significant effects on overall fans performance craggs et al 1996 craggs 2001 fans are typically seeded with mixed algal assemblages sandefur et al 2011 liu et al 2016 park et al 2022 however it is also possible to establish and maintain a single selected filamentous algae species on fans hariz et al 2022 while the cultivation of a single species on fans may not be required for effective nutrient removal targeting a single high performing species that can grow under a broad range of conditions could reduce the impact of environmental variation on biomass productivity and nutrient removal efficiency hariz et al 2023b furthermore selecting a single target species could provide a consistent source of high quality biomass lawton et al 2013 neveux et al 2016 and facilitate the optimization of operational parameters for a specific aim e g bioremediation biomass production or both hariz et al 2023a however maintaining a single species on outdoor fans treating polluted water could be challenging if the target species has been previously maintained under controlled laboratory conditions as it may be poorly adapted to varying ambient environmental conditions and water quality liu et al 2020 seeding fans with a mixed species assemblage collected from a nearby waterway may help the algae establish faster as it is likely be adapted to ambient conditions however the algal biomass may contain a significant amount of non target competing species such as diatoms and cyanobacteria that could grow faster than the green filamentous algae and quickly come to dominate the biomass on the fans lawton et al 2013 cole et al 2015 hariz et al 2023b this could significantly affect the overall fans performance in terms of biomass productivity and nutrient removal rates and result in a harvested biomass of low quality hariz et al 2023b despite the potential large influence of using a single vs mixed species assemblage on the performance of fans this issue has only been addressed in two studies using suspension non attached algal cultivation systems lawton et al 2013 valero rodriguez et al 2020 thus far the effects of single vs mixed species assemblages on growth nutrient removal rates and algal composition dynamics in attached algal cultivation systems such as fans have not been investigated and remain a critical knowledge gap liu et al 2020 karimi et al 2022 the overall aim of this study was to compare the effects of seeding approach and single species vs mixed species algal assemblages on the performance of pilot scale fans for the in situ treatment of agricultural drainage on a dairy farm the specific aims were i to compare the time taken to establish a uniform algal standing crop biomass productivity nutrient removal and species dominance on fans seeded by either natural establishment or by controlled seeding of a single target species and ii to compare the time taken to establish a uniform algal standing crop biomass productivity nutrient removal and dominance of species on fans seeded through controlled seeding of a single target species and fans seeded through controlled seeding of an adapted mixed species algal assemblage this study was conducted in two separate experiments the first experiment compared the performance of fans seeded with the target species oedogonium sp and fans naturally seeded with filamentous algae originating from an on farm drainage stream the second experiment compared the performance of fans seeded using controlled seeding with the target species oedogonium sp and fans seeded using controlled seeding with a mixed algal assemblage collected from a nearby drainage stream on the farm oedogonium sp was selected as the target species to be seeded on fans as it had up to 4 fold higher biomass productivity and the highest nutrient removal rate compared to cladophora sp rhizoclonium sp and spirogyra sp when cultivated on outdoor pilot scale fans under ambient summer and winter conditions hariz et al 2023b in addition oedogonium sp had the highest zoospore production and strongest secondary attachment capability of these four species in small scale microfans cultivation

0 s 175 34 19 2 e the farm drainage ultimately discharges into the piako river which drains into the firth of thames on the north island of new zealand fig a 1 the farm produces milk from a herd of approximately 420 cows which are pasture fed the pasture is predominantly covered by ryegrass the farm drainage stream receives water from surface runoff and subsurface runoff from the paddocks through subsurface drain pipes tiles the stream flows between paddocks with electric fences installed along the stream embankment to exclude cows the first experiment was conducted next to a small stream that was 1 m wide and 1 5 m deep site 1 fig a 1 the stream continually flowed all year but had minimal flow during the autumn april to june the second experiment was located approximately 200 m downstream from the location of the first experiment next to a small river 10 m wide and 3 m deep site 2 fig a 1 this river flowed year round as it received water from multiple streams and drainage ditches on the farm including the stream used in the first experiment 2 3 controlled seeded single species fans vs natural establishment mixed species fans the on farm performance of fans seeded with the single species oedogonium sp controlled seeded and fans seeded through the natural establishment of mixed species algal assemblages to treat agricultural drainage was compared in a three month study six fans floways were installed on three horizontal lengths of scaffolding steel tubes approximately 50 cm above the stream water level on the embankment next to the stream the floways were placed to flow in the same direction as the stream fig 1 the horizontal scaffolding tubes were adjusted so that the floways had a slope of approximately 2 to provide gravity flow from the top inflow to the bottom outflow during the day water from the stream was pumped into a 200 l black water hdpe header tank 58 cm diameter x 98 cm high using a solar powered pump a 200 w solar panel provided power to the pump through two 7 amp hour 12 v batteries the 24 v dc submersible pump 3 phase was installed underwater at approximately 30 cm above the stream bottom and pumped water through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe into the header tank which was placed on the stream embankment the submersible water pump intake was covered with a 1 mm mesh to filter out sediment particles sand silt and clay and plant debris accumulated sediment was regularly removed at least once a week by cleaning and backwashing the mesh an additional 25 mm pvc water pipe was installed approximately 10 cm from the top of the water tank to channel water back into the stream to prevent water from overflowing when the tank was full water collected in the water tank was channeled to an inflow water distribution sump 100 l x 25 cm width x 21 cm height uv resistant plastic through a 32 mm pressure pvc water pipe additional water was channeled into the same inflow water distribution sump through a separate water pipe 32 mm diameter x 25 m length uv resistant flexible pool hose that collected water from upstream through gravity flow intake point approximately 25 m upstream from where the fans were installed the gravity flow intake water hose was covered with a 1 mm mesh and was regularly cleaned as described above flow from the water collection tank and the gravity flow water hose to the inflow water distribution sump was controlled by two 32 mm ball valves installed inside the inflow water distribution sump these ball valves were adjusted to deliver 6 l min 1 from the 200 l black water collection tank and 3 l min 1 from the gravity flow into the inflow distribution sump the inflow water distribution sump was placed at the top of all fans and had six inflow pipes each with adjustable valves 25 mm brass gate valve installed to channel water to the top of each fans the inflow flow rate to each fans was adjusted to 1 l min 1 equivalent to 8 l min 1 m width of floway using a digital flow rate meter digiflow 6710 m vyair each floway received 1 l min 1 of flow during the day average of 10 h through a combination of water pumped through solar power and the gravity flow and approximately 0 4 l min 1 equivalent to 3 l min 1 m width of floway of flow during the night where the system was completely dependent on the gravity flow flow rates were maintained throughout the experimental period and checked volumetrically twice a week the outflow water from each fans was collected and channeled back into the stream using a 3 m length of pvc spouting the outflow of each floway was equipped with 0 5 mm mesh to collect any algal biomass that washed off three replicate fans were seeded with a single species of oedogonium sp at the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa facility at ruakura hamilton new zealand the fans were seeded by evenly distributing and rubbing 30 g fresh weight fw oedogonium sp biomass equivalent to 5 g dry weight dw or a loading rate of 7 g dw m 2 onto the textured liner to hook algae filaments and provide initial physical attachment controlled seeding hariz et al 2023b a continuous influent flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 equivalent to 4 l min 1 m width of floway was used for the first seven days after seeding thereafter an influent flow rate of 1 l min 1 equivalent to 8 l min 1 m width of floway was used throughout the seeding phase over time secondary biological attachment occurred through the growth of holdfasts from the settlement of oedogonium sp zoospores onto the liner it took ten days from 10th to 20th december 2021 to establish a dense algal turf on the liner surface the three oedogonium sp seeded fans were then transported to the farm and installed along the stream on the 21st december 2021 each fans received a stream water inflow of 1 l min 1 for 10 h during the day and then only 0 4 l min 1 during the night as described above the three oedogonium sp seeded fans were harvested once every seven days by drawing a metal scraper down the surface of the liner to maintain a target initial algal standing crop of approximately 0 5 1 cm height on the 13th december 2021 the natural establishment fans were installed unseeded and operated to allow algae from the stream to begin to naturally establish the natural establishment fans took approximately seven weeks until 1st february 2022 to form a uniform algal turf on all replicate fans weekly biomass monitoring and water sampling was conducted from 4th of january 2022 providing time for the controlled seeded oedogonium sp biomass to adjust to the new growing conditions and farm drainage water and for the natural establishment fans algal turf to establish on the liner at the start of this monitoring period the biomass on the oedogonium sp seeded fans was harvested by drawing a metal scraper down the surface of the liner to leave a comparable initial standing crop on all replicates of approximately 65 g dw m2 algal turf of approximately 0 5 1 cm height however the natural establishment fans had uneven algal biomass coverage on the liner 50 surface area covered and an initial standing crop of only approximately

relative abundance of algae species and other contamination samples were preserved in a 15 ml vial with a few drops of lugol s solution and were analyzed within five days of collection immediately before analysis each sample was filtered using a 200 µm sieve and then washed with 10 ml of filtered water which was collected for analysis filtrate this step separated epiphytic diatoms midges and any other visible organisms attached to algal filaments to make it easier to see cellular detail and identify algae species under the microscope the retained algal biomass and 10 ml filtrate were analysed using an inverted microscope leica dmi1 the combined biomass and filtrate were proportionately divided onto each of ten microscope slides for each sample then a photograph of each slide was taken under 100 x magnification giving a total of ten photos for each sample in each photo the percentage composition of green filamentous algae genera and other contaminants diatoms and cyanobacteria was estimated based on the surface area covered the percentage compositions were then averaged to provide a measure of the relative abundance of each genera of green filamentous algae and other

5 towards the end of the experiment 4 discussion 4 1 controlled seeding vs natural establishment the ability of filamentous algae to quickly establish and form a dense uniform cover on the fans liner is desirable when operating fans this can significantly speed up the seeding stage and establishment of a target initial standing crop in the first experiment we found considerable differences in the time taken to establish a dense uniform biomass cover on the liner between seeding methods the controlled seeded fans established a uniform algal turf about five times faster 10 days than the natural establishment fans 50 days the rapid establishment of oedogonium sp biomass on controlled seeded fans is most likely due to the large amount of algal biomass added on a single occasion at the start of seeding which promoted the rapid development of secondary algal attachment through the growth of rhizoids and holdfasts from spores hariz et al 2022 in contrast the natural establishment fans were gradually seeded over several weeks by algal spores and fragments from the stream water that were caught on and subsequently attached to the liner this natural seeding could have been faster if there had been greater algal biomass growing in the stream at the time the low abundance of filamentous algae in the stream may have been due to a range of factors including time of year sub optimal light and temperature lack of attachment substrate unfavourable stream current high water turbidity low nutrient availability and grazing by stream invertebrates which made conditions in the stream suboptimal for growth ghosh and gaur 1998 álvarez and peckarsky 2005 dzialowski et al 2008 mccall et al 2017 in particular seasonal variation in temperature and irradiance are likely to have large influence on the abundance of algae in the stream as algae are typically naturally abundant from spring through summer until early autumn when temperatures are warm and have lower abundance during cooler temperatures in winter de vries and hillebrand 1986 berry and lembi 2000 salovius and bonsdorff 2004 sousa dias and melo 2008 however we observed a higher abundance of algae in the stream in the late summer early autumn compared to when we first installed the natural establishment fans in early summer december 2021 when algal biomass in the stream was hardly seen in addition we observed the water flow in the stream was higher when we first started the experiment and thereafter the water flow gradually decreased until the end of the experiment a higher water flow increases physical disturbance to naturally occurring algae in the stream leading to higher rate of algal biomass washing off and a subsequent lower algal abundance our results show that the success of the natural establishment method is highly dependent on the season and stream current when seeding occurs in particular the establishment of a dense biomass coverage on fans will be faster when natural algal abundance is high and is likely to take longer during periods when natural algal abundance is low throughout the three month experiment the average biomass productivity was 3 1 2 2 g dw m 2 d for controlled seeding fans and 3 0 2 2 g dw m 2 d for natural establishment fans these productivities are comparable to the average biomass productivity reported for fans treating agricultural drainage 4 9 1 6 g dw m 2 d kangas and mulbry 2014 5 5 3 5 g dw m 2 d d aiuto et al 2015 horticultural wastewater 1 4 0 6 g dw m 2 d liu et al 2016 and anaerobically digested and undigested dairy manure 5 4 0 1 g dw m 2 d wilkie and mulbry 2002 our results show there was no significant difference in biomass productivity between seeding methods however there was a significant effect of growth cycle suggesting that environmental conditions potentially had a stronger effect on biomass productivity than seeding method several environmental conditions are known to contribute to changes in algal biomass productivity including inflow nutrient concentration temperature and solar irradiance sand jensen 1989 sutherland et al 2013 cole et al 2016 however biomass productivity did not appear to vary predictably with changes in any one of these factors instead variation in biomass productivity between growth cycles may have been driven by interactive effects between environmental factors most likely irradiance and temperature such a result has been demonstrated previously for oedogonium sp where biomass productivity increased under lower temperatures below optimal range of 20 35 c when irradiance was high but decreased under higher temperatures 35 c when irradiance was high cole et al 2018 temperatures and irradiances fluctuated considerably throughout the experiment and were not always correlated with each other or biomass productivity for example our results show that while productivity appeared to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in temperature in some growth cycles in five of the 13 growth cycles there appeared to be an inverse relationship where productivity decreased with an increase in temperature e g cycles 2 and 8 or increased with a decrease in temperature e g cycles 5 9 and 12 fig a 18 and table a 1 similarly productivity appeared to increase or decrease with corresponding increases or decreases in light intensity in only four of the 13 cycles cycles 3 5 11 and 13 these results suggest a similar interactive effect between temperature and irradiance on biomass productivity could have been occurring nitrate and phosphate removal rates varied significantly between seeding methods however the best performing seeding method varied throughout the experiment this variation in nitrate and phosphate removal rates appeared to be driven by the concentration of nitrate and phosphate in the fans inflow which varied markedly throughout the experiment 2 1 g n m 3 to 5 7 g n m 3 and 0 04 g p m 3 to 0 87 g p m 3 with higher nutrient concentrations resulting in higher nutrient removal rates fig a 19 this finding of nutrient concentrations having a stronger effect on nutrient removal than seeding method is another example of environmental variation driving performance rather than seeding method as was found for biomass productivity notably our results provide no clear indication whether the increase in nutrient loading enhanced the nutrient removal efficiency of the algae as the uptake of nutrients per unit of algal biomass was not determined for the harvested biomass of each growth cycle but as recent studies have reported increases in algal nutrient removal efficiency with an increase in nitrate and phosphate loading mhatre naik et al 2021 sutherland and ralph 2021 we expect that a similar effect was occurring here the potential of the target species to maintain dominance on a floway over other non target species e g diatoms and cyanobacteria under varying environmental conditions for an extended period is a desirable characteristic to consider when selecting the best seeding method for fans a high relative abundance of a single green filamentous algal species on fans provides a higher consistency of biomass composition and therefore higher quality of biomass than a mixed species assemblage which can have a variable species abundance and therefore a variable biomass composition through time the controlled seeded fans maintained a high relative abundance 50 of oedogonium sp over 40 days after seeding in contrast the natural establishment fans took over 60 days to establish at least a 50 relative abundance of green filamentous algae e g oedogonium sp that originated from the stream this result suggests that controlled seeding allows a higher relative abundance of a target filamentous algae species to be maintained for a longer duration on fans than the natural establishment method this may be because there were fewer empty spaces on the controlled seeded fans compared to the natural establishment fans which resulted in a lower rate of colonization of non target species such as competitively dominant diatoms filamentous diatoms are highly competitive against other green algae biggs 1990 which probably enabled them to grow and establish rapidly on fans especially when space was available following harvest consequently non target species such as filamentous diatoms can establish rapidly on fans that start with an empty liner e g natural establishment fans compared to fans that have already been seeded with a dominant species e g oedogonium sp controlled seeded fans 4 2 single species vs mixed species assemblages we found reasonable similarity in the time taken to establish a dense uniform algal turf on fans between single species of oedogonium sp and mixed species when controlled seeding was used for all fans in the second experiment both fans took approximately two weeks to establish a uniform turf on the liner however there was a considerable difference in the ability of the seeded algae to maintain the established standing crop on the fans in most growth cycles oedogonium sp fans had a higher standing crop than the mixed species fans resulting from a lower rate of biomass washing off the floway in contrast to oedogonium sp fans the standing crop established on mixed species fans was easily fragmented especially when there was a high current and rainfall we found that filamentous diatoms established twice as quickly on the mixed species fans 60 relative abundance in 35 days than on the single species oedogonium sp seeded fans 56 relative abundance in 63 days therefore a higher rate of biomass wash off may be a consequence of the higher relative abundance of filamentous diatoms e g melosira sp established on mixed species fans as filamentous diatoms are known to fragment easily compared to green filamentous algae tapolczai et al 2016 park et al 2022 although the filament characteristics and attachment strength may vary depending on the algal species this finding suggests that maintaining a single target species that does not fragment easily could minimize the rate of biomass wash off from the floways due to filament fragmentation biomass productivity varied significantly between oedogonium sp fans and mixed species fans however this variation was not consistent throughout the experiment as we found for experiment 1 environmental conditions in particular rainfall and temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on biomass productivity than the seeded species we observed a notable decline in biomass productivity in growth cycle 3 from 17th to 24th of may 2022 which coincided with a significant period of high rainfall sum of rainfall for this period 59 2 mm fig 8 and fig a 17 in contrast biomass productivity was highest in growth cycle 11 12th to 19th of july 2022 when the rainfall was two and half times lower sum of rainfall for this growth cycle 23 8 mm compared to cycle 3 similarly we observed a decrease in biomass productivity from growth cycle 1 3 5th to 24th may 2022 that coincided with a substantial drop in inlet water temperature to as low as 2 ⁰c but overall biomass productivity subsequently started to increase when water temperature rose above 0 ⁰c after 29th may 2022 rainfall can result in increased biomass fragmentation that leads to increased rates of biomass washing off the floway due to higher flow disturbance furthermore rainfall can result in increased siltation in the influent causing a negative impact on algal photosynthesis and growth due to light attenuation and smothering of the algal biomass by sediments chen et al 2015 while lower water temperature reduces membrane fluidity limits electron exchange and decreases photosynthetic efficiency cardinale et al 2013 smith and crews 2014 newby et al 2016 which could significantly affect biomass production notably the maximum biomass productivity in the second experiment was about one and a half times lower than in the first experiment this lower overall biomass productivity of both seeded species may have been due to the lower water temperature lower irradiance shorter daylight period lower ambient temperature including the occasional night frost and higher cumulative rainfall in the second experiment compared to the first experiment which resulted in suboptimal growth conditions a strong seasonal effect on fans biomass productivity has been reported previously with oedogonium sp productivity on fans under outdoor ambient conditions being almost three fold higher in summer compared to winter due to the differences in water and ambient temperatures and solar irradiance between seasons hariz et al 2023b these results further highlight the strong influence of environmental conditions on fans performance nitrate and phosphate removal rates varied significantly between species however as for biomass productivity this variation was not consistent throughout the experiment the nitrate removal rate increased with increasing nitrate concentration in the fans inflow however this relationship was not evident for phosphate removal and phosphate concentration in the fans inflow the lack of an apparent trend for phosphate removal rate relative to inflow phosphate concentration may be a result of the variation in the concentration of phosphate in the fans inflow range 0 02 g p m 3 and 0 45 g p m 3 being considerably lower than the variation in the concentration of nitrate in the fans inflow range 0 67 g n m 3 and 6 72 g n m 3 we found a considerable difference in overall nutrient removal rates between the first and second experiments the removal rates of nitrate and phosphate were at least 1 7 fold and 1 3 fold respectively lower in the second experiment compared to the first experiment most likely as a result of lower biomass productivities in the second experiment due to lower ambient temperature and irradiance and higher rainfall these findings suggest that there is strong positive relationship between nutrient removal and biomass productivity for fans where high nutrient removal rates are correlated with high biomass productivity a further difference in fans performance between seeded species was their ability to maintain a higher relative abundance of the seeded species on the fans floway fans seeded with the single species oedogonium sp maintained a relative abundance of oedogonium sp of more than 50 over 60 days after seeding in contrast the relative abundance of each green filamentous algal species seeded on mixed species fans varied greatly throughout the experiment and none of the seeded mixed green filamentous algae species dominated the fans all had 50 relative abundance the larger amount of pure oedogonium sp added to the single species fans during seeding may have resulted in their higher relative abundance over other non target species for an extended period in contrast the total amount of each green filamentous algae species that was added onto the mixed species fans during seeding was lower potentially making it difficult for any one species to gain dominance these results suggest that differences in the total amount of each species added upon seeding in particular whether a single species or multiple species are seeded can influence their long term abundance on fans this conclusion is supported by a recent study assessing the performance of pilot scale fans treating river water over a three month period park et al 2022 fans were initially seeded using controlled seeding with a mixed assemblage of green filamentous algae comprised of equal proportions of oedogonium sp cladophora sp rhizoclonium sp and spirogyra sp however despite the higher initial loading rates of algal biomass on the floway during seeding 40 g dw m 2 compared to 7 g dw m 2 in the current study no single seeded species was able to dominate and non target diatoms eventually accounted for more than 80 of the total biomass park et al 2022 in comparison to the first experiment mixed species seeded through controlled seeding in the second experiment maintained the initially seeded abundance of filamentous algae longer than mixed species seeded through natural establishment in the first experiment in particular the mixed species fans seeded through controlled seeding maintained an abundance of oedogonium sp of up to 40 for the first 50 days compared to natural establishment fans where oedogonium sp took 60 days to establish 50 relative abundance but was unable to maintain this abundance for longer than two weeks and showed a marked decline towards the end of the experiment in combination these results demonstrate that controlled seeding provides faster higher and longer control of fans species composition than natural establishment 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that controlled seeding promotes faster biomass establishment on fans than the natural establishment method however environmental conditions had a stronger effect on biomass productivity and nutrient removal than seeding method and seeded species single species vs mixed species seeded species did influence the standing crop that was able to be maintained on fans with single oedogonium sp fans having a lower rate of biomass wash off compared to filamentous diatom dominated mixed species fans moreover these results clearly demonstrate that fans seeded with a single target species have the potential to be operated with a higher relative abundance for a longer period compared to fans seeded with a mixed species assemblage our findings provide insights into how controlled seeding and targeting single filamentous algae species can influence nutrient removal and the production of high quality biomass on fans the cultivation approach used in this study can be applied in other locations to promote year round fans operation and treat various types of polluted water however further improvement on the cultivation approach is required to overcome some limitations of fans seeding through rubbing a larger scale fans out in the field statement of informed consent human animal rights no conflicts informed consent

9039,rational irrigation plays an important role in increasing crop yield and reducing water use with a typical sand layered farmland in the hetao irrigation district as an example field experiments were conducted during the growth period of maize and a numerical model of soil water movement was applied to explore the field evapotranspiration crop water consumption and soil water transport in the sand layered soil cropwat 8 0 software was applied to formulate the irrigation schedule under the fixed irrigation interval in each growth stage of maize the soil water movement in sand layered soil under different irrigation schedules was simulated by the hydrus 1d model results show that the hydrus 1d model could well simulate the soil water movement during the growth period of crops in the typical sand layered farmland in addition the deep percolation loss of water could be reduced by approximately 20 4 37 6 with appropriate increase in the irrigation frequency and reduction in the irrigation quota however under the minimum irrigation interval there were still 19 5 of irrigation water and rainfall lost by seepage through the deep sand layer the water stress in the rhizosphere during the mid stage of crop growth was only 13 9 mm with the irrigation frequency as every 10 days i10 while that was 107 97 mm with the irrigation frequency as every 25 days i25 the maximum ratio of actual transpiration rate of crops to actual evapotranspiration of the land was 73 6 with i10 irrigation and the minimum was 63 4 with i25 indicating that increasing the irrigation frequency and reducing the irrigation quota each time are highly beneficial to increasing the water holding capacity for crop growth in the root zone in the sand layered farmland the study provides a basis for

sand layered structure can alter the water infiltration and distribution in the farmland and affect the root distribution of crops samani et al 1989 zhao et al 2010 some scholars have studied the characteristics of water movement under layered soil selim 2011 but most of these studies were carried out indoors few have been performed in field conditions in actual climate and with crops in this study the one dimensional hydrus 1d model was applied to study the water movement in a typical sand layered farmland the hydrus 1d model can simulate the one dimensional movement of water in multi layer saturated soil li 2020 this model has also been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological process salinization nutrient leaching and crop growth in aeration zones the spatial variation of soil texture in the farmland is the main reason for the difference of crop yield meanwhile few farmers are aware of the necessity to implement irrigation schemes tailored to local conditions thereby resulting in excessive water use wang et al 2006 zhou and zhao 2019 therefore it is urgent to understand the evapotranspiration and water movement in farmland soil under different irrigation

uptake by the root root growth and evaporation min et al 2015 in the present study the soil depth of 1 2 m was divided into 121 nodes with an interval of 1 cm the variable time step method was used to simulate the water movement in the soil and the time step was automatically adjusted according to the number of iterations twarakavi et al 2008 taking the measured water content in the study as the

simulating soil evaporation the hydrus 1d model assumes that the actual evaporation rate ea mm d 1 is equal to the potential evaporation rate ep mm d 1 when the surface soil water supply is sufficient that is the soil moisture content is greater than soil field capacity when the soil negative pressure is less than the critical value the surface soil suction remains the critical value and the upper boundary condition changes from the flux boundary to the constant water head boundary thus no evaporation occurs since the model cannot fully consider the presence of evaporation under water stress

smaller and the accuracy of the soil layer was higher during model calibration and verification as the average groundwater depth in 2021 was greater than that in 2020 and the rainfall was smaller the soil water content below the sand layer in 2021 was smaller than that in 2020 by comparing the fittings between the measured and simulated soil matrix potential and water evaporation in 2020 fig 4 the simulation accuracy of the model was indirectly verified the maximum effective range of the soil tensiometer atsd beijing china was about 800 cm water column height as shown in fig 4a when the soil water potential exceeding the range of the soil tensiometer the reading of the soil tensiometer bears no reference significance due to the condensation of water vapor in the soil the weight of the micro lysimeter was higher than the actual value thus the calculated e a was underestimated as shown in fig 4b overall the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated parameters exhibited higher accuracy 3 2 evapotranspiration of the maize field the actual evapotranspirations during maize growth period were 575 1 and 589 18 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively accounting for 89 7 and 84 3 of the potential evapotranspiration indicating the water stress was greater in 2021 fig 5 in addition at the seed germination stage the water uptake by the root system was limited and the proportion of transpiration was small due to the small leaf area of maize at the initial growth stage of maize growth the surface vegetation coverage was small with the increase of temperature the soil evaporation rate gradually increased in the crop growth stage of maize the e p and t p increased synchronously and rapidly allen et al 1998 at the late stage of crop development stage of maize t p was greater than e p the e p dominated stage transitioned into the t p dominated stage at this stage t p was much larger than e p and mainly influenced by lai at the middle stage of maize growth t p reached the maximum due to vigorous growth large leaf area and deep root distribution of maize even e p also increased with the increase of temperature the transpiration consumption far exceeded the evaporation in the later stage of maize growth the leaf area and water demand gradually decreased while the transpiration also decreased as the light intensity was high in august and september the evaporation increased again in which the respective ratios of e a to eta were 39 3 in 2020 and 46 6 in 2021 3 3 root water uptake fig 6 shows the results of daily and cumulative root water uptake for two consecutive maize growth periods in 2020 a and 2021 b the root water uptake mainly depended on the growth stage of maize at the initial stage of maize growth may 4 to may 28 in 2020 and may 4 to may 28 in 2021 the root water uptake was small during the crop development stage of maize the root water uptake rate gradually increased and the actual root rate was basically synchronized with the potential root water uptake rate the respective potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration during the crop development stage of maize were 64 7 mm and 61 0 mm in 2020 and 70 5 mm and 65 9 mm in 2021 the root water uptake rate was the largest in the middle growth period of maize in 2020 and 2021 the respective actual root water uptake in the middle growth period of maize were 206 3 mm and 215 1 mm in the middle growth period of maize due to the consumption of soil water there was a large root water uptake stress the respective ratios of actual root water uptake to potential root water uptake were 65 3 and 70 9 in the two growth periods the ratios in the whole maize growth period in 2020 and 2021 were 65 4 and 61 9 respectively and the daily average actual root water uptake rates were 4 6 mm d and 4 8 mm d respectively in 2020 and 2021 the root water uptake rate decreased at the crop maturity stage but there was still water stress of root water uptake 3 4 deep percolation deep soil water percolation accounts for a large proportion of farmland water loss which mainly depends on the soil type permeability coefficient of each soil layer irrigation and rainfall intensity fig 7 shows the soil water flux at the bottom boundary of the maize root zone 120 cm soil depth and the upper boundary of the sand layer 75 cm soil depth the total deep percolations at the bottom boundary of the plough layer during the maize growth period in 2020 and 2021 were 162 5 mm and 147 6 mm respectively as the depth of groundwater was 2 4 2 9 m only a small amount of water could rise through the capillary fig 7 and the two maize growth periods were 5 8 and 2 7 mm the deep percolation of soil water mainly occurred during the crop development stage of maize because the irrigation water exceeded the water holding capacity of the soil layer and the water consumption by crops intensified the maximum percolation rate at the bottom boundary were 6 9 and 4 9 mm d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively as shown in fig 7 the difference of percolation between the two stages was mainly caused by different irrigation quota as the soil pores in the upper part of the sand layer are fine and have high suction they can absorb water from the lower sand layer when the water content of the sand layer decreased a capillary barrier was formed with the rapid reduction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cheng et al 2013 the sand layer would then hinder the downward percolation of soil water thus the soil water percolation at the bottom boundary of the root zone is obviously lagging behind that at the upper boundary of the sand layer fig 7 3 5 irrigation schedule formulated by cropwat the irrigation of the hetao irrigation district is mainly based on the water inflow time of the yellow river and the actual needs of crops are not fully considered which easily leads to excessive or untimely irrigation due to the rather low rainfall in 2021 only 26 5 mm it was considered a dry year to ensure the representativeness of irrigation system the meteorological and crop data for 2020 were selected as the input of the cropwat 8 0 model to calculate the irrigation quota under different irrigation intervals in each crop growth stage in our study no root distribution was observed below the 25 cm sand layer therefore the maximum root depth was set as the upper boundary of the sand layer namely at the depth of the 75 cm soil layer previous studies have shown that proper irrigation can ensure the reduction of no3 n and other nutrient loss li 2020 prevent salt stress and improve grain yield in 2020 irrigation frequency was set every 10 days i10 15 days i15 20 days i20 and 25 days i25 in the maize growth stages initial growth stage crop development stage middle stage and late stage the irrigation quota and irrigation time are shown in fig 8 3 5 1 effects of irrigation on root uptake the water uptake by maize roots under different irrigation systems is shown in fig 9 previous studies have shown that water deficit occurring in the rapid and middle growth periods of maize has the greatest impact on the growth development and final yield of maize shen et al 2020 in addition root water uptake in the shallower soil layer is more sensitive to soil moisture content soylu et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 9 water deficit occurred with each irrigation frequency when the irrigation frequency was i10 the potential root water uptake of maize in the initial growth stage crop development stage and middle growth stage is basically synchronized with the actual root water uptake when the irrigation frequency decreased the stress increased on water uptake by maize root which mainly occurred in the middle growth stage of maize under the irrigation treatments of i10 i15 i20 and i25 the total amounts of water stress on root water uptake are 91 09 112 15 111 1 and 164 62 mm respectively in the full growth period of maize the root water uptake stress under each irrigation treatment began from the middle and late growth period of maize the water uptake deficit by maize root accounts respectively for 15 25 and 82 48 of the total water deficit in the middle and late growth period of maize with irrigation treatment of i10 46 85 and 51 15 with i15 59 55 and 38 72 with i20 and 65 59 and 33 16 with i20 table 4 3 5 2 the field evapotranspiration field evapotranspiration is an important route of water consumption the ratio of e to t in et determines the water use efficiency by crops and is also critical to quantitatively study the dynamic distribution of irrigation water during the crop growth period he et al 2020 wang et al 2010 the farmland evapotranspiration rate from may 4 2020 to september 25 2020 is shown in table 5 the total eta was 553 8 575 1 mm throughout the growth period of maize under each irrigation scenario field evapotranspiration mainly occurred in the crop development stage and middle growth period of maize which respectively accounted for 29 9 and 46 6 of the total eta throughout the growth period e a at the initial growth stage was dominant but t a gradually increased with the rapid growth and development of maize e a was very large at the early growth stage because the lai of maize was very small at the crop development stage the temperature increased with the increase of vegetation coverage and lai causing e a to reach the maximum while t a exhibited the opposite changing pattern the respective average ratios of e a to eta of the four irrigation treatments were 26 4 30 7 30 1 and 36 6 indicating that the irrigation efficiency under i10 and i20 irrigation was relatively high in the crop development stage and middle growth stage of maize 3 5 3 soil water flux under different irrigation treatments a strong correlation was observed between the initial soil moisture content and soil moisture flux fig 10 at the initial stage of maize growth the soil moisture percolation was small due to the lack of irrigation because of the irrigation of the previous autumn the soil moisture at the bottom was large which caused the soil water to move upward therefore there was a small amount of water supply at the initial growth stage of maize growth as shown in fig 10 with irrigation soil water percolation mainly occurred in the crop development stage and the middle growth period of maize however due to the relatively low water consumption the deep percolation of soil water was still large in the early growth period of maize due to the low soil moisture content prior to irrigation part of the irrigation water was stored in the soil layer and the water consumption by crops was also large the amount of deep percolation was relatively small in the crop development stage the bottom boundary percolation of the crop root zone with sand layer was the smallest under the irrigation of i10 with a total amount of 101 3 mm which was 19 5 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the percolation without sand layer was 114 9 mm which was 22 1 of the irrigation quota and rainfall with the increase of irrigation interval the soil water percolation increased significantly when the irrigation was i25 the upper soil moisture content was higher due to the larger irrigation quota meanwhile large irrigation intervals also resulted in low soil moisture before the next irrigation which required more water to re wet the soil driven by the water potential difference and violent vertical movement of water zheng et al 2017 the percolation loss was the greatest the total percolation with sand layer was 129 3 mm which was 26 6 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the percolation without sand layer was 143 1 mm which was 29 5 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the soil water flux at the upper boundary of sand layer was also affected by irrigation due to the low water content of sand layer and high negative water pressure sand particles form water free pores thus causing a small percolation at the interface between soil layer and sand layer with the increase of irrigation interval the soil water percolation at the boundary of sand layer increased significantly the total percolation of upper boundary of sand layer with i10 irrigation was 80 8 mm and that with i25 irrigation was 112 8 mm under appropriate irrigation the sand layer could effectively reduce the loss of water percolation the water loss by percolation in the above simulation is similar to the previously research zhou and zhao 2019 3 5 4 volumetric water content the soil moisture profiles under different irrigation regimes were significantly different fig 11 the soil moisture content near the boundary of the sand layer larger than soil without sand layer during the growth period of maize when the moisture content of the sand layer is high the upper saturated soil moisture leaks through the deep sand layer when the moisture content of the sand layer decreases a capillary barrier is formed to prevent the upward and downward movement of water as the root system of maize is mainly distributed at the depth of 0 40 cm ji et al 2007 the soil moisture content at the depth of 0 40 cm in all the growth periods of maize was large when the irrigation was i10 with the increase of irrigation interval the soil moisture content in the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased and the percolation of soil moisture from above to below the sand layer increased with the increase of irrigation quota the soil moisture increased significantly qi et al 2018 due to the irrigation and rainfall a humid zone was formed from the surface to the upper boundary of the sand layer the humid zone with the largest moisture content was mainly located at the depth of 60 80 cm the upper boundary of the sand layer and changed little over time due to the surface soil evaporation and root water uptake the wet area at 0 40 cm changed rapidly when there was no sand layer soil water seeped below the sand layer causing the soil moist area in the 0 40 cm root zone to become smaller and the sand layered cultivated land is more conducive to crop water use however in the existing irrigation practice of sand layered soil more than 20 of the soil water was lost by deep percolation which not only led to the waste of water resources but also the waste of nutrient resources and caused nitrate pollution to groundwater lyu et al 2018 nguyen et al 2022 zhou and zhao 2019 3 5 5 soil water storage the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water storage varies greatly and there is a negative correlation between soil water storage and crop yield yost et al 2019 the change of soil water storage in the root zone during crop growth is shown in fig 12 the soil water storage was mainly affected by irrigation and rainfall the soil water storage in the root zone increased significantly after irrigation affected by the sand layer the soil water storage in the root zone changed little when the irrigation quota of the sand layered cultivated land was small the main reason for this is that the sand layer retains more infiltration water after rainfall or irrigation compared with the farmland without sand layer the farmland with sand layer retains more water in the soil layer above the sand layer chen et al 2020 excessive irrigation causes the soil water storage to change greatly during the crop growth period iqbal et al 2020 the change of soil water storage was negative under all the irrigation regimes during the maize growth period indicating that the irrigation and rainfall and local groundwater level could not meet the crop water consumption the minimum reduction of cumulative soil water storage in the root zone of cultivated land with sand layer was 150 56 mm under i10 irrigation and the maximum was 191 75 mm under i25 irrigation fig 12 when there was no sand layer the minimum change of cumulative soil water storage in the maize root zone was 161 33 mm under i20 irrigation and 170 33 mm under i15 irrigation compared with the same depth as the upper boundary of the sand layer the cumulative change of soil water storage without the sand layer was smaller 4 discussion in this study hydrus 1d combined with the cropwat model was used to simulate the soil water transport of typical sand layered farmland in the hetao irrigation district under different irrigation strategies the improvement of irrigation should comprehensively consider the irrigation frequency and quota a reasonable irrigation should increase the irrigation frequency and reduce the irrigation quota each time li 2020 rix et al 2022 which can reduce the deep percolation of water by approximately 20 4 37 6 yost et al 2019 the application of the cropwat model in this study successfully simulated different irrigation regimes however in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation it is necessary to further observe the water movement in the farmland under different soil conditions on a regional scale nie et al 2021 xue and ren 2017 because the water movement is affected by the sand layer the existing irrigation strategies exhibited low irrigation water use efficiency in the sand layered farmland the deep percolation of soil water not only wasted water resources but also caused nitrate nitrogen and other pollutants into the groundwater gu et al 2013 yang et al 2022 seriously endangering the health of local residents with groundwater as their main drinking water source therefore it is urgent to improve local irrigation measures and farmland water use efficiency as shown in fig 8 water stress occurred under the i15 i20 and i25 irrigation systems in the simulation of the cropwat model and water deficit that reduces crop yield occurs while i10 irrigation did not exhibit yield reduction due to water stress this contradicts with the simulation of water stress under four irrigation systems by hydrus 1d indicating the particularity of crop water movement in sand layered soil liu et al 2019 purandara et al 2021 and it is difficult to fully describe the water movement in the farmland with sandy soil using a single model previous studies have shown that the layered structure in soils with large differences in soil texture leads to the discontinuity of soil hydraulic properties forming capillary and hydraulic barriers which may limit the downward soil water movement and soil solute transport alfnes al 2004 the results of hydras 1d model on the bottom boundary flux of salt in the water movement in farmland containing sand layer under different irrigation systems and the salt content of soil are shown in fig 13 because the salt content in the soil is affected by many factors such as sand layer irrigation rainfall farmland evapotranspiration the salt transport process between the sand layer and the soil was different the impact of rainfall was more obvious at the initial growth stage of crop growth on the farmland without sand inclusion the amount of salt leaching from the bottom of the farmland without sand inclusion was 89 7 more than that of farmland with sand inclusion during the crop development stage with irrigation the difference in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity between the finer loam layer and the sand layer with better quality decreased and the capillary barrier effect disappeared scott 2000 the salt in the soil moved with water to the deeper soil layer the soil salt was mainly washed out of the farming area with the increase of irrigation frequency more salt was washed out of the farming layer the salt leaching amount was the largest under the i10 irrigation system because of the existence of hydraulic barriers the farmland without sand layer was 57 9 more than the farmland with sand layer it shows that the sand layer kept the upper soil water storage while leaving the salt in the soil layer above the sand layer with the increase of irrigation interval the soil moisture content of each soil layer decreased which increased the hydraulic conductivity between loam and sandy soil and the salt content was more difficult to leach below the cultivation layer higher irrigation frequency during the crop development stage of crops was more beneficial to reduce the salt stress on crops in the middle period of crop growth soil salt migrated with soil water to the main root zone of the soil due to the high water consumption rate of crops the irrigation with small irrigation quota and high frequency had a negative effect on soil salt leaching the salt leaching efficiency of farmland cultivation areas with and without sand inclusion was the highest under i25 irrigation with the sand layer the salt leaching efficiency of irrigation in the middle growth stage of crops in the sand layer was 63 4 76 2 45 0 and 14 5 less than that of farmland without sand layer under i10 i15 i20 and i25 irrigation scenarios in the same irrigation mode the difference in salt content was obvious between the farmland cultivation area with and without sand inclusion which was mainly reflected between the border and the bottom of maize root zone fig 13 the sand layer effectively reduced the salt transport efficiency and salt content in the root zone while the sand layer effectively reduced the salt stress on crop water use at the same time because the irrigation frequency was too high and the irrigation quota was small it was difficult for the irrigation water to reach the sand layer the water blocking effect of the non conductive pores formed by the sand layer with low water content locked the salt and irrigation water in the soil layer above the sand layer when the irrigation frequency decreased and the irrigation quota increased the water conductivity of the sand layer increased in the sand layer and the salt dissolved in the irrigation water leached to the deep soil below the sand layer in this way salt could be leached out but waste water was also increased to improve the irrigation strategy we should focus on the improvement of soil hydraulic properties and the support of numerical and physical models kumar et al 2022 the results of this research study can be applied in farmland with similar soil structure 5 conclusion this study simulated the water and salt movement in the farmland with a typical sand layer in hetao irrigation district under different irrigation intervals at each growth stage of maize by integrating cropwat 8 0 model and hydrus 1d model the model was calibrated and verified with the results from the field study in 2020 and 2021 respectively the results show that deep water percolation increases significantly with the increase of irrigation quota and mainly occurs in the rapid and middle growth periods of maize due to the discontinuity of soil hydraulic properties caused by the soil structure of the sand layer a capillary barrier is formed and the water is trapped at the boundary between the soil layer and the sand layer after irrigation while the sand layer can effectively reduce the deep water percolation loss with the decrease of irrigation frequency and the increase of irrigation quota the stress degree of crop root water uptake gradually enhances and the wet area of the soil layer decreases above the sand layer the root water uptake stress under i10 irrigation mainly occurs in the later stage of crop growth the root water uptake stress water in the middle stage of crop growth under i15 irrigation is 52 54 mm which is approximately 46 85 of the total stress water the minimum ratio of e a to eta under i10 irrigation is 26 4 and the maximum is 36 6 corresponding to i25 in addition when the irrigation interval is smaller the change of soil water storage in the 0 40 cm soil layer is smaller which is conducive to providing necessary water for crop growth in this layer although the risk of water stress on farmland crops in sand layered soil is different in various hydrological year in the long run it is still possible to reduce the waste of water resources and leach out the soil salt with reasonable irrigation scheme while providing effective water for crop growth this study can provide a theoretical basis for water saving irrigation and saline soil treatment of

9039,rational irrigation plays an important role in increasing crop yield and reducing water use with a typical sand layered farmland in the hetao irrigation district as an example field experiments were conducted during the growth period of maize and a numerical model of soil water movement was applied to explore the field evapotranspiration crop water consumption and soil water transport in the sand layered soil cropwat 8 0 software was applied to formulate the irrigation schedule under the fixed irrigation interval in each growth stage of maize the soil water movement in sand layered soil under different irrigation schedules was simulated by the hydrus 1d model results show that the hydrus 1d model could well simulate the soil water movement during the growth period of crops in the typical sand layered farmland in addition the deep percolation loss of water could be reduced by approximately 20 4 37 6 with appropriate increase in the irrigation frequency and reduction in the irrigation quota however under the minimum irrigation interval there were still 19 5 of irrigation water and rainfall lost by seepage through the deep sand layer the water stress in the rhizosphere during the mid stage of crop growth was only 13 9 mm with the irrigation frequency as every 10 days i10 while that was 107 97 mm with the irrigation frequency as every 25 days i25 the maximum ratio of actual transpiration rate of crops to actual evapotranspiration of the land was 73 6 with i10 irrigation and the minimum was 63 4 with i25 indicating that increasing the irrigation frequency and reducing the irrigation quota each time are highly beneficial to increasing the water holding capacity for crop growth in the root zone in the sand layered farmland the study provides a basis for farmland water management in the arid and semi arid areas keywords sand layered soil soil water flux hydrus 1d model cropwat model data availability the data already exists in the manuscript 1 introduction agricultural irrigation accounts for 90 of global freshwater consumption in order to achieve the sustainable development of agriculture it is urgent to optimize the utilization of irrigation water beyene et al 2018 cen et al 2021 puy et al 2022 li et al 2023 water shortage and soil salinization are increasingly restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in the arid

a simple uniform distribution fu et al 2018 2011c zhao et al 2010 the soil sand interlayer is a common soil structure in northwestern china due to the sediment siltation and deposition in the yellow river the soil structure of cultivated land along the yellow river in the hetao irrigation district is clearly layered forming a widely distributed clay sand interlaced soil structure in general the sand layered structure can alter the water infiltration and distribution in the farmland and affect the root distribution of crops samani et al 1989 zhao et al 2010 some scholars have studied the characteristics of water movement under layered soil selim 2011 but most of these studies were carried out indoors few have been performed in field conditions in actual climate and with crops in this study the one dimensional hydrus 1d model was applied to study the water movement in a typical sand layered farmland the hydrus 1d model can simulate the one dimensional movement of water in multi layer saturated soil li 2020 this model has also been successfully applied to simulate the hydrological process salinization nutrient leaching and crop growth in aeration zones the spatial variation of soil texture in the farmland is the main reason for the difference of crop yield meanwhile few farmers are aware of the necessity to implement irrigation schemes tailored to local conditions thereby resulting in excessive water use wang et al 2006 zhou and zhao 2019 therefore it is urgent to understand the evapotranspiration and water movement in farmland soil under different irrigation modes for water management in the arid and semi arid areas based on the observation of the typical sand layered farmlands in the hetao irrigation district with the application of the hydrus 1d model this study aims to a simulate and analyze the water use of crops in water layered farmland during crop growth period b simulate the soil water change at the boundary of sand layer and root zone and c

uptake by the root root growth and evaporation min et al 2015 in the present study the soil depth of 1 2 m was divided into 121 nodes with an interval of 1 cm the variable time step method was used to simulate the water movement in the soil and the time step was automatically adjusted according to the number of iterations twarakavi et al 2008 taking the measured water content in the study as the initial input the upper boundary condition of the water movement model was considered as the atmospheric boundary including irrigation quota rainfall meteorology and other parameters since the bottom

simulating soil evaporation the hydrus 1d model assumes that the actual evaporation rate ea mm d 1 is equal to the potential evaporation rate ep mm d 1 when the surface soil water supply is sufficient that is the soil moisture content is greater than soil field capacity when the soil negative pressure is less than the critical value the surface soil suction remains the critical value and the upper boundary condition changes from the flux boundary to the constant water head boundary thus no evaporation occurs since the model cannot fully consider the presence of evaporation under water stress conditions but less than potential evaporation it was modified as follows li et al 2020 2018 2011c 12 e a e p θ 0 65 θ f e p 0 65 θ f θ 0 65 θ f θ r θ r θ 0 65 θ f 0 θ θ r where θ and θ f are surface

speed solar radiation and daily rainfall were collected from the micro meteorological stations a water meter was used to measure the amount of water injected into the field and the irrigation time was recorded by a stopwatch all of these data were used as the input of the hydrus 1d model 2 3 7 model parameters for hydrus 1d the root mean square error rmse tan et al 2014 and mean absolute error mae

respectively an electronic scale cany mp51001 shanghai china with an accuracy of 0 1 g was used to weigh the micro lysimeter every day and the difference between the measurements every two days was calculated to determine the daily water evaporation from the soil eq 15 in order to ensure accuracy aside from soil replacement after irrigation and rainfall soil in the micro lysimeter was replaced

numerical modeling with cropwat cropwat 8 0 http www fao org nr water infores databases cropwat html version 8 0 for windows is a program to calculate the irrigation requirements of crops based on the condition of the soil climate and crops in addition the program allows the development of irrigation schedules for different management strategies gabr 2021 and the calculation of scheme water supply for varying crop patterns cropwat 8 0 can also be used to evaluate irrigation practice and estimate crop performance in both rainfed and irrigated conditions all calculation procedures used in cropwat 8 0 are adapted from the two fao publications of the irrigation and drainage series namely no 56 crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements and no 33 titled yield response to water allen et al 1998 2 6 water balance in the soil to investigate the interaction between groundwater and maize the water balance in the root zone was formulated as yin et al 2015 16 s p

drainage from the root zone mm d 1 and r is the surface runoff mm d 1 positive values of d represent upward flux the surface runoff during the study could be neglected because no runoff was observed li 2020 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the hydrus 1d model the results from the hydrus 1d model were compared with the observed data in the field study in a graphical and statistical manner and the soil hydraulic parameters were calibrated fig 3 the measured soil moisture and bulk electrical conductivity at the depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 75 100 cm sand layer and 100 120 cm below the surface was used to verify the hydrus 1d model during the maize growing stage in 2021 the fitting curve of the observed and simulated values is shown in fig 3 the initial inputs of soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by fitting the measurements of water content and pressure by the pressure film instrument with retc software beyene et al 2018 nie et al 2021 the calibrated soil water parameters and salt transport parameters are shown in table 2 during the calibration period maize growing stage in 2020 and accuracy verification period maize growing stage in 2021 of surface soil water content the rmse was less than 0 06 and mae was less than 0 035 table 3 because the water content of sand layer 75 100 cm was much lower than that of the soil layer the rmse and mae were also smaller and the accuracy of the soil layer was higher during model calibration and verification as the average groundwater depth in 2021 was greater than that in 2020 and the rainfall was smaller the soil water content below the sand layer in 2021 was smaller than that in 2020 by comparing the fittings between the measured and simulated soil matrix potential and water evaporation in 2020 fig 4 the simulation accuracy of the model was indirectly verified the maximum effective range of the soil tensiometer atsd beijing china was about 800 cm water column height as shown in fig 4a when the soil water potential exceeding the range of the soil tensiometer the reading of the soil tensiometer bears no reference significance due to the condensation of water vapor in the soil the weight of the micro lysimeter was higher than the actual value thus the calculated e a was underestimated as shown in fig 4b overall the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated parameters exhibited higher accuracy 3 2 evapotranspiration of the maize field the actual evapotranspirations during maize growth period were 575 1 and 589 18 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively accounting for 89 7 and 84 3 of the potential evapotranspiration indicating the water stress was greater in 2021 fig 5 in addition at the seed germination stage the water uptake by the root system was limited and the proportion of transpiration was small due to the small leaf area of maize at the initial growth stage of maize growth the surface vegetation coverage was small with the increase of temperature the soil evaporation rate gradually increased in the crop growth stage of maize the e p and t p increased synchronously and rapidly allen et al 1998 at the late stage of crop development stage of maize t p was greater than e p the e p dominated stage transitioned into the t p dominated stage at this stage t p was much larger than e p and mainly influenced by lai at the middle stage of maize growth t p reached the maximum due to vigorous growth large leaf area and deep root distribution of maize even e p also increased with the increase of temperature the transpiration consumption far exceeded the evaporation in the later stage of maize growth the leaf area and water demand gradually decreased while the transpiration also decreased as the light intensity was high in august and september the evaporation increased again in which the respective ratios of e a to eta were 39 3 in 2020 and 46 6 in 2021 3 3 root water uptake fig 6 shows the results of daily and cumulative root water uptake for two consecutive maize growth periods in 2020 a and 2021 b the root water uptake mainly depended on the growth stage of maize at the initial stage of maize growth may 4 to may 28 in 2020 and may 4 to may 28 in 2021 the root water uptake was small during the crop development stage of maize the root water uptake rate gradually increased and the actual root rate was basically synchronized with the potential root water uptake rate the respective potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration during the crop development stage of maize were 64 7 mm and 61 0 mm in 2020 and 70 5 mm and 65 9 mm in 2021 the root water uptake rate was the largest in the middle growth period of maize in 2020 and 2021 the respective actual root water uptake in the middle growth period of maize were 206 3 mm and 215 1 mm in the middle growth period of maize due to the consumption of soil water there was a large root water uptake stress the respective ratios of actual root water uptake to potential root water uptake were 65 3 and 70 9 in the two growth periods the ratios in the whole maize growth period in 2020 and 2021 were 65 4 and 61 9 respectively and the daily average actual root water uptake rates were 4 6 mm d and 4 8 mm d respectively in 2020 and 2021 the root water uptake rate decreased at the crop maturity stage but there was still water stress of root water uptake 3 4 deep percolation deep soil water percolation accounts for a large proportion of farmland water loss which mainly depends on the soil type permeability coefficient of each soil layer irrigation and rainfall intensity fig 7 shows the soil water flux at the bottom boundary of the maize root zone 120 cm soil depth and the upper boundary of the sand layer 75 cm soil depth the total deep percolations at the bottom boundary of the plough layer during the maize growth period in 2020 and 2021 were 162 5 mm and 147 6 mm respectively as the depth of groundwater was 2 4 2 9 m only a small amount of water could rise through the capillary fig 7 and the two maize growth periods were 5 8 and 2 7 mm the deep percolation of soil water mainly occurred during the crop development stage of maize because the irrigation water exceeded the water holding capacity of the soil layer and the water consumption by crops intensified the maximum percolation rate at the bottom boundary were 6 9 and 4 9 mm d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively as shown in fig 7 the difference of percolation between the two stages was mainly caused by different irrigation quota as the soil pores in the upper part of the sand layer are fine and have high suction they can absorb water from the lower sand layer when the water content of the sand layer decreased a capillary barrier was formed with the rapid reduction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cheng et al 2013 the sand layer would then hinder the downward percolation of soil water thus the soil water percolation at the bottom boundary of the root zone is obviously lagging behind that at the upper boundary of the sand layer fig 7 3 5 irrigation schedule formulated by cropwat the irrigation of the hetao irrigation district is mainly based on the water inflow time of the yellow river and the actual needs of crops are not fully considered which easily leads to excessive or untimely irrigation due to the rather low rainfall in 2021 only 26 5 mm it was considered a dry year to ensure the representativeness of irrigation system the meteorological and crop data for 2020 were selected as the input of the cropwat 8 0 model to calculate the irrigation quota under different irrigation intervals in each crop growth stage in our study no root distribution was observed below the 25 cm sand layer therefore the maximum root depth was set as the upper boundary of the sand layer namely at the depth of the 75 cm soil layer previous studies have shown that proper irrigation can ensure the reduction of no3 n and other nutrient loss li 2020 prevent salt stress and improve grain yield in 2020 irrigation frequency was set every 10 days i10 15 days i15 20 days i20 and 25 days i25 in the maize growth stages initial growth stage crop development stage middle stage and late stage the irrigation quota and irrigation time are shown in fig 8 3 5 1 effects of irrigation on root uptake the water uptake by maize roots under different irrigation systems is shown in fig 9 previous studies have shown that water deficit occurring in the rapid and middle growth periods of maize has the greatest impact on the growth development and final yield of maize shen et al 2020 in addition root water uptake in the shallower soil layer is more sensitive to soil moisture content soylu et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 9 water deficit occurred with each irrigation frequency when the irrigation frequency was i10 the potential root water uptake of maize in the initial growth stage crop development stage and middle growth stage is basically synchronized with the actual root water uptake when the irrigation frequency decreased the stress increased on water uptake by maize root which mainly occurred in the middle growth stage of maize under the irrigation treatments of i10 i15 i20 and i25 the total amounts of water stress on root water uptake are 91 09 112 15 111 1 and 164 62 mm respectively in the full growth period of maize the root water uptake stress under each irrigation treatment began from the middle and late growth period of maize the water uptake deficit by maize root accounts respectively for 15 25 and 82 48 of the total water deficit in the middle and late growth period of maize with irrigation treatment of i10 46 85 and 51 15 with i15 59 55 and 38 72 with i20 and 65 59 and 33 16 with i20 table 4 3 5 2 the field evapotranspiration field evapotranspiration is an important route of water consumption the ratio of e to t in et determines the water use efficiency by crops and is also critical to quantitatively study the dynamic distribution of irrigation water during the crop growth period he et al 2020 wang et al 2010 the farmland evapotranspiration rate from may 4 2020 to september 25 2020 is shown in table 5 the total eta was 553 8 575 1 mm throughout the growth period of maize under each irrigation scenario field evapotranspiration mainly occurred in the crop development stage and middle growth period of maize which respectively accounted for 29 9 and 46 6 of the total eta throughout the growth period e a at the initial growth stage was dominant but t a gradually increased with the rapid growth and development of maize e a was very large at the early growth stage because the lai of maize was very small at the crop development stage the temperature increased with the increase of vegetation coverage and lai causing e a to reach the maximum while t a exhibited the opposite changing pattern the respective average ratios of e a to eta of the four irrigation treatments were 26 4 30 7 30 1 and 36 6 indicating that the irrigation efficiency under i10 and i20 irrigation was relatively high in the crop development stage and middle growth stage of maize 3 5 3 soil water flux under different irrigation treatments a strong correlation was observed between the initial soil moisture content and soil moisture flux fig 10 at the initial stage of maize growth the soil moisture percolation was small due to the lack of irrigation because of the irrigation of the previous autumn the soil moisture at the bottom was large which caused the soil water to move upward therefore there was a small amount of water supply at the initial growth stage of maize growth as shown in fig 10 with irrigation soil water percolation mainly occurred in the crop development stage and the middle growth period of maize however due to the relatively low water consumption the deep percolation of soil water was still large in the early growth period of maize due to the low soil moisture content prior to irrigation part of the irrigation water was stored in the soil layer and the water consumption by crops was also large the amount of deep percolation was relatively small in the crop development stage the bottom boundary percolation of the crop root zone with sand layer was the smallest under the irrigation of i10 with a total amount of 101 3 mm which was 19 5 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the percolation without sand layer was 114 9 mm which was 22 1 of the irrigation quota and rainfall with the increase of irrigation interval the soil water percolation increased significantly when the irrigation was i25 the upper soil moisture content was higher due to the larger irrigation quota meanwhile large irrigation intervals also resulted in low soil moisture before the next irrigation which required more water to re wet the soil driven by the water potential difference and violent vertical movement of water zheng et al 2017 the percolation loss was the greatest the total percolation with sand layer was 129 3 mm which was 26 6 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the percolation without sand layer was 143 1 mm which was 29 5 of the irrigation quota and rainfall the soil water flux at the upper boundary of sand layer was also affected by irrigation due to the low water content of sand layer and high negative water pressure sand particles form water free pores thus causing a small percolation at the interface between soil layer and sand layer with the increase of irrigation interval the soil water percolation at the boundary of sand layer increased significantly the total percolation of upper boundary of sand layer with i10 irrigation was 80 8 mm and that with i25 irrigation was 112 8 mm under appropriate irrigation the sand layer could effectively reduce the loss of water percolation the water loss by percolation in the above simulation is similar to the previously research zhou and zhao 2019 3 5 4 volumetric water content the soil moisture profiles under different irrigation regimes were significantly different fig 11 the soil moisture content near the boundary of the sand layer larger than soil without sand layer during the growth period of maize when the moisture content of the sand layer is high the upper saturated soil moisture leaks through the deep sand layer when the moisture content of the sand layer decreases a capillary barrier is formed to prevent the upward and downward movement of water as the root system of maize is mainly distributed at the depth of 0 40 cm ji et al 2007 the soil moisture content at the depth of 0 40 cm in all the growth periods of maize was large when the irrigation was i10 with the increase of irrigation interval the soil moisture content in the 0 40 cm soil layer decreased and the percolation of soil moisture from above to below the sand layer increased with the increase of irrigation quota the soil moisture increased significantly qi et al 2018 due to the irrigation and rainfall a humid zone was formed from the surface to the upper boundary of the sand layer the humid zone with the largest moisture content was mainly located at the depth of 60 80 cm the upper boundary of the sand layer and changed little over time due to the surface soil evaporation and root water uptake the wet area at 0 40 cm changed rapidly when there was no sand layer soil water seeped below the sand layer causing the soil moist area in the 0 40 cm root zone to become smaller and the sand layered cultivated land is more conducive to crop water use however in the existing irrigation practice of sand layered soil more than 20 of the soil water was lost by deep percolation which not only led to the waste of water resources but also the waste of nutrient resources and caused nitrate pollution to groundwater lyu et al 2018 nguyen et al 2022 zhou and zhao 2019 3 5 5 soil water storage the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water storage varies greatly and there is a negative correlation between soil water storage and crop yield yost et al 2019 the change of soil water storage in the root zone during crop growth is shown in fig 12 the soil water storage was mainly affected by irrigation and rainfall the soil water storage in the root zone increased significantly after irrigation affected by the sand layer the soil water storage in the root zone changed little when the irrigation quota of the sand layered cultivated land was small the main reason for this is that the sand layer retains more infiltration water after rainfall or irrigation compared with the farmland without sand layer the farmland with sand layer retains more water in the soil layer above the sand layer chen et al 2020 excessive irrigation causes the soil water storage to change greatly during the crop growth period iqbal et al 2020 the change of soil water storage was negative under all the irrigation regimes during the maize growth period indicating that the irrigation and rainfall and local groundwater level could not meet the crop water consumption the minimum reduction of cumulative soil water storage in the root zone of cultivated land with sand layer was 150 56 mm under i10 irrigation and the maximum was 191 75 mm under i25 irrigation fig 12 when there was no sand layer the minimum change of cumulative soil water storage in the maize root zone was 161 33 mm under i20 irrigation and 170 33 mm under i15 irrigation compared with the same depth as the upper boundary of the sand layer the cumulative change of soil water storage without the sand layer was smaller 4 discussion in this study hydrus 1d combined with the cropwat model was used to simulate the soil water transport of typical sand layered farmland in the hetao irrigation district under different irrigation strategies the improvement of irrigation should comprehensively consider the irrigation frequency and quota a reasonable irrigation should increase the irrigation frequency and reduce the irrigation quota each time li 2020 rix et al 2022 which can reduce the deep percolation of water by approximately 20 4 37 6 yost et al 2019 the application of the cropwat model in this study successfully simulated different irrigation regimes however in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation it is necessary to further observe the water movement in the farmland under different soil conditions on a regional scale nie et al 2021 xue and ren 2017 because the water movement is affected by the sand layer the existing irrigation strategies exhibited low irrigation water use efficiency in the sand layered farmland the deep percolation of soil water not only wasted water resources but also caused nitrate nitrogen and other pollutants into the groundwater gu et al 2013 yang et al 2022 seriously endangering the health of local residents with groundwater as their main drinking water source therefore it is urgent to improve local irrigation measures and farmland water use efficiency as shown in fig 8 water stress occurred under the i15 i20 and i25 irrigation systems in the simulation of the cropwat model and water deficit that reduces crop yield occurs while i10 irrigation did not exhibit yield reduction due to water stress this contradicts with the simulation of water stress under four irrigation systems by hydrus 1d indicating the particularity of crop water movement in sand layered soil liu et al 2019 purandara et al 2021 and it is difficult to fully describe the water movement in the farmland with sandy soil using a single model previous studies have shown that the layered structure in soils with large differences in soil texture leads to the discontinuity of soil hydraulic properties forming capillary and hydraulic barriers which may limit the downward soil water movement and soil solute transport alfnes al 2004 the results of hydras 1d model on the bottom boundary flux of salt in the water movement in farmland containing sand layer under different irrigation systems and the salt content of soil are shown in fig 13 because the salt content in the soil is affected by many factors such as sand layer irrigation rainfall farmland evapotranspiration the salt transport process between the sand layer and the soil was different the impact of rainfall was more obvious at the initial growth stage of crop growth on the farmland without sand inclusion the amount of salt leaching from the bottom of the farmland without sand inclusion was 89 7 more than that of farmland with sand inclusion during the crop development stage with irrigation the difference in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity between the finer loam layer and the sand layer with better quality decreased and the capillary barrier effect disappeared scott 2000 the salt in the soil moved with water to the deeper soil layer the soil salt was mainly washed out of the farming area with the increase of irrigation frequency more salt was washed out of the farming layer the salt leaching amount was the largest under the i10 irrigation system because of the existence of hydraulic barriers the farmland without sand layer was 57 9 more than the farmland with sand layer it shows that the sand layer kept the upper soil water storage while leaving the salt in the soil layer above the sand layer with the increase of irrigation interval the soil moisture content of each soil layer decreased which increased the hydraulic conductivity between loam and sandy soil and the salt content was more difficult to leach below the cultivation layer higher irrigation frequency during the crop development stage of crops was more beneficial to reduce the salt stress on crops in the middle period of crop growth soil salt migrated with soil water to the main root zone of the soil due to the high water consumption rate of crops the irrigation with small irrigation quota and high frequency had a negative effect on soil salt leaching the salt leaching efficiency of farmland cultivation areas with and without sand inclusion was the highest under i25 irrigation with the sand layer the salt leaching efficiency of irrigation in the middle growth stage of crops in the sand layer was 63 4 76 2 45 0 and 14 5 less than that of farmland without sand layer under i10 i15 i20 and i25 irrigation scenarios in the same irrigation mode the difference in salt content was obvious between the farmland cultivation area with and without sand inclusion which was mainly reflected between the border and the bottom of maize root zone fig 13 the sand layer effectively reduced the salt transport efficiency and salt content in the root zone while the sand layer effectively reduced the salt stress on crop water use at the same time because the irrigation frequency was too high and the irrigation quota was small it was difficult for the irrigation water to reach the sand layer the water blocking effect of the non conductive pores formed by the sand layer with low water content locked the salt and irrigation water in the soil layer above the sand layer when the irrigation frequency decreased and the irrigation quota increased the water conductivity of the sand layer increased in the sand layer and the salt dissolved in the irrigation water leached to the deep soil below the sand layer in this way salt could be leached out but waste water was also increased to improve the irrigation strategy we should focus on the improvement of soil hydraulic properties and the support of numerical and physical models kumar et al 2022 the results of this research study can be applied in farmland with similar soil structure 5 conclusion this study simulated the water and salt movement in the farmland with a typical sand layer in hetao irrigation district under different irrigation intervals at each growth stage of maize by integrating cropwat 8 0 model and hydrus 1d model the model was calibrated and verified with the results from the field study in 2020 and 2021 respectively the results show that deep water percolation increases significantly with the increase of irrigation quota and mainly occurs in the rapid and middle growth periods of maize due to the discontinuity of soil hydraulic properties caused by the soil structure of the sand layer a capillary barrier is formed and the water is trapped at the boundary between the soil layer and the sand layer after irrigation while the sand layer can effectively reduce the deep water percolation loss with the decrease of irrigation frequency and the increase of irrigation quota the stress degree of crop root water uptake gradually enhances and the wet area of the soil layer decreases above the sand layer the root water uptake stress under i10 irrigation mainly occurs in the later stage of crop growth the root water uptake stress water in the middle stage of crop growth under i15 irrigation is 52 54 mm which is approximately 46 85 of the total stress water the minimum ratio of e a to eta under i10 irrigation is 26 4 and the maximum is 36 6 corresponding to i25 in addition when the irrigation interval is smaller the change of soil water storage in the 0 40 cm soil layer is smaller which is conducive to providing necessary water for crop growth in this layer although the risk of water stress on farmland crops in sand layered soil is different in various hydrological year in the long run it is still possible to reduce the waste of water resources and leach out the soil salt with reasonable irrigation scheme while providing effective water for crop growth this study can provide a theoretical basis for water saving irrigation and saline soil treatment of
