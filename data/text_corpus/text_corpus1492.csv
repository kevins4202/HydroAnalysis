7460,temporal and spatial monitoring play a significant role in evaluating and examining the riverbank morphology and its spatiotemporal changes unlike the terrestrial laser scanners other previously used methods such as satellite images total station surveying and erosion pins have limited application to quantify the small scale bank variations due to the lack of rapid survey and resolution in data acquisition high cost lack of availability specialized equipment and hard movement of laser scanners make it necessary to develop new accurate economical and easily available methods the present study aims to test the kinect photogrametric technology for measuring and assessing riverbank variations in laboratory environment for this purpose three models of layered soil blocks for three different levels of groundwater i e 24 34 and 44 cm were designed to investigate the seepage erosion behavior experimentally the results indicate the high accuracy of kinect in measuring the bank erosion cavity dimensions i e 0 5 error with high spatial resolution data i e 300 000 points per frame the high speed of kinect in riverbank scanning enables the analysis of time variations of mechanisms such as seepage erosion which occurs rather rapidly the results confirmed that there is a power relationship between the seepage gradient and the time of the bank failure with a determination coefficient of 0 97 moreover an increase in the level of groundwater on the riverbank increases the rate of undercutting retreat that caused more rapid failure of the riverbank keywords short range photogrammetry kinect seepage riverbank erosion monitoring groundwater 1 introduction riverbank erosion as one of the most dynamic processes in riverbank morphology is one of the essential problems in river management darby et al 2000 xia et al 2014 the estimation of river erosion is of great importance due to negative effects on the river such as the loss of fertile agricultural soil amiri tokaldany et al 2003 haddadchi et al 2014 surface water contamination by sediment transport hassan et al 2013 midgley et al 2012 an increase in the suspended sediment load evans et al 2006 simon and rinaldi 2006 morphological deformation of the river which can affect submerged structures dotterweich 2008 millar 2000 rinaldi and darby 2007 and a reduction of the volume of reservoirs amitrano et al 2013 de araújo et al 2006 riverbank erosion processes are categorized into two groups based on the factors affecting the stability 1 the fluvial erosion due to excess shear stresses imposed on the riverbank and 2 the mass wasting due to the role of the geotechnical instability factors such as seepage flow and subaerial process crosta and prisco 1999 lawler et al 1997 rinaldi and darby 2007 the lateral subsurface flow is known as one of the significant factors in destruction of riverbanks and production of sediment loads in many geographical regions of the world fox and wilson 2010 fox et al 2005 masoodi et al 2017 wilson et al 2007 the subsurface flow leads to erosion of non consolidated materials along the riverbank by applying the shear stress on the cavities through the water flow or by utilizing drag force to the particles and entraining them by seepage flow dunne 1990 fox et al 2006 jones 1997 the occurrence of subsurface erosion requires establishment of certain conditions such as excess flow and the exit point of water from the soil in this regard the excess flow is defined as the difference between seepage flow and the flow at which sediment is on the threshold of motion hagerty 1991a hagerty 1991b wilson et al 2007 wilson et al 2007 suggested that the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductive in the riverbanks such as a conductive layer bounded by two less conductive layers at the top and bottom causes concentration of subsurface flow resulting in seepage from the conductive layer high stage conditions can also increase the water level in riverbanks which impacts riverbank stability as the water level in the river decreases the lateral subsurface water stored in the bank flows from the riverbank back into the river results in seepage erosion cavities fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the seepage erosion is the particle entrainment by the seepage flow from the riverbank which causes undercutting and mass failure of the topsoil layer hagerty 1991a to investigate and recognize this failure mechanism of the riverbank it is necessary to measure the volume of undercutting due to the seepage flow chu agor et al 2008a most of the applied techniques in river morphology studies are related to large scale morphological changes such as coastline displacement river bed widening and river pathway changes over time which are unable to monitor small scale changes of the riverbank nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 in this regard most studies on erosion and sediment have suffered from a lack of continuous measurements as well as many constraints in spatial and temporal changes based on morphological and sediment transport approaches ferguson 1993 one of the factors causing the complexity of seepage erosion analysis is related to its three dimensional nature chu agor et al 2009 crosta and prisco 1999 although the non uniform distribution of seepage erosion on the riverbank is evident in field they are generally distinct by preferred flow pathways the undercutting dimensions are substantial in terms of estimation of the eroded sediment and bank instability cancienne 2008 chu agor et al 2008b karmaker and dutta 2013 lawler et al 1997 reviewed and categorized the various methods used to monitoring riverbank erosion and its changes e g erosion pins terrain photogrammetry and peep 1 photo electronic erosion pin 1 erosion mechanisms identification and their roles are required to estimate sedimentation rate pizzuto et al 2010 argued that the study of temporal and spatial variations of riverbank erosion is important based on two perspectives 1 improved recognition of the riverbank erosion process can help to develop the conceptual models of the river response and 2 spatial and temporal variations of riverbank erosion can be useful in estimating sediment load and riverbank retreat which is required for river management programs with the advancement of technology in hardware and software surveying and data acquisition can be performed with higher accuracy and speed both in field and laboratory recently various approaches have been used to study the morphology of the riverbank for example fuller et al 2003 measured the sediment transport values for the fluvial equilibrium after the chute cutoff using surveying with total station camera and producing a digital elevation model dem although total station technique is highly accurate it includes a low spatial resolution and is associated with a considerable error in the steep or vertical slopes nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 with the development of the photogrammetric techniques brasington et al 2000 studied the three dimensional morphodynamics of braided rivers using a high precision real time global positioning system gps the gps technique has a limited utilization on steep and vertical slopes and it is less accurate than the total station recently wells et al 2016 presented a method for monitoring rill and ephemeral gully erosion spatiotemporally based on close range digital photogrammetric techniques aerial laser scanning als method is regarded as another application of remote sensing techniques in rivers which is based on the limitation and identification of light longoni et al 2016 this technique could measure the retreat of the riverbank surficially from the plan however it may not distinguish the erosion on the riverbank accurate enough because the banks have often steep slopes and the viewing angle in these techniques is oblique therefore it is preferable to record the erosion variations from above and to understand morphological changes of the banks the changes may appear as undermining and small scale frequent failures of the banks which are not generally recorded and could only be recordable when the failure affects the upper surface of the bank hicks et al 2007 mitasova et al 2002 thoma et al 2005 despite the high precision and high spatial resolution this method may be suffering from high uncertainties for example it may be confronted with time resolution limit to interpret at large levels heritage and hetherington 2007 milan et al 2007 terrestrial laser scanning tls is another technique used in recent years in geomorphic studies and large scale riverbank erosion measurements due to its high accuracy bitelli et al 2004 milan et al 2007 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 rosser et al 2005 recorded changes in the dimensions of a coastal cliff using tls techniques which can measure the failure variations on vertical or relatively vertical slopes with high speed and accuracy in addition the time series of terrestrial scanning was used to measure volumetric variations of stratigraphic layers at the riverbank lyons et al 2015 starek et al 2013 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 conducted their studies on riverbank erosion and how it was relocated using tls techniques milan et al 2007 used this technique to evaluate the displacement and riverbank deformation for this purpose they monitored a small reach of the river in two flood periods by tls by creating dtms and their comparison they analyzed how the erosion and sedimentation processes affect the riverbank to understand more about the relationship between the extent of riverbank erosion as well as weather conditions and river flow rates longoni et al 2016 applied tls techniques to monitor the riverbank over a period of time and found that the method is an efficient and effective way for achieving the purpose chu agor et al 2009 also studied geometry and dimensions of undercutting using 3d high accuracy medium range laser scanner to monitor for different periods a single layer simulated riverbank of sand material by 50 20 25 cm dimensions was utilized in this regard although laser scanners have high accuracy their heavy weight causes problems for their movement on the other hand it is expensive and costly in comparison to other procedures according to the mentioned methods it is not possible to introduce an optimal method for all applications practically as each includes a different ability fitting to the intended application to select the type of measurement method some factors such as accuracy cost number of measurement points and their disparity deformation rate environmental conditions adequate time for measurement access to the target body the material of the target body texture status and the color of the body surface should be taken into consideration salvi et al 1998 wells et al 2016 most of the previous studies are based on long periods of time such as satellite images sediment traps and als despite all the techniques previously introduced there are problems to obtain high resolution morphological data this is due to the fact that the adequacy of the data plays an influential role in examining the changes on short temporal and medium spatial scales based on the economic conditions to scan morphological changes resulting from seepage erosion it is necessary to have a measuring device with high spatial and temporal accuracy due to the rapid temporal variations and the probability of occurrence in small spatial reaches as the seepage erosion process often lasts less than a few hours it is necessary to make surveys more rapidly and frequently measurement methods which have been used in the riverbank erosion often provide a set of data which are spatially or temporally dispersed and have high uncertainty or sometimes limited to a short reach of the river which is not generalizable for the whole location estimating the exact volume of the undercutting at each stage of the erosion process is necessary for modeling the development of undercutting and recognizing the seepage erosion mechanism the frequent use of terrestrial laser scanners in the field is not economical due to its high cost and being research oriented until now there is not any study that has demonstrated an appropriate and cost effective method to measure seepage erosion and its effect on the riverbank retreat this study proposes an innovative approach to monitor seepage erosion using kinect which is commonly used for human body tracing and indoor mapping chang et al 2011 khoshelham and elberink 2012 oikonomidis et al 2011 this study focused on scrutinizing the features and capabilities of this technique for scanning undercutting cavity in laboratory studies to achieve this goal the rate of erosion and temporal variations of the cavity is estimated and monitored from the beginning to the end of the experiments high resolution data were collected by kinect from the erosion cavity volume in short time intervals on the stratified bank to quantify its temporal and spatial changes 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study site was a stream in atrak river watershed bazkhaneh in the north khorasan province in north eastern iran with semi arid environment the atrak river flows from the hezar masjed mountain range from east to west and ends in the caspian sea bank erosion plays a key role in the morphology of atrak river masoodi et al 2017 the geographical location of the soil sampling site was 37 27 25 2 n and 57 21 17 1 e which the seepage erosion problem is frequently observed three field surveys were made in three different times for site selection soil sampling and transporting materials to the laboratory stratification of the riverbank is composed of 2 4 m of cohesive clay loam underlaid by sandy soil with 10 cm thickness as a conductive layer this overlays consolidated clay loam layer with 1 m thickness fig 2 soil and geotechnical parameters for the layers were measured in laboratory including cohesion friction angle bulk density particle size distribution and hydraulic conductivity about 1000 kg of upper layer was collected and transferred to laboratory for physical modeling of the riverbank erosion 2 2 laboratory model to simulate seepage erosion in the laboratory a 3d block of soil was tested within a plexiglas lysimeter with dimensions of 100 cm height 50 cm width and 100 cm length which was kept by a metal framework fig 3 the lysymeter consists of the water reservoir for setting the water head and the soil reservoir as shown in fig 3 the direction of the seepage is in the z axis perpendicular to the bank face while y is along the bank face and x is normal to z y plane the two reservoirs are separated by a perforated sheet made of plexiglas with holes of 3 mm in diameter and a center to center distance of 1 cm a geotextile sheet was used between the perforated sheet and the soil to prevent soil movement into the water reservoir the front face of the lysimeter was closed with a metal plate to compacted soil to simulate a riverbank on the left wall of the lysimeter and at a height of 7 cm from the bed 5 holes with 3 mm diameter were embedded by pipe piezometers for measuring the water head in the non cohesive layer physical and geotechnical properties of soil samples were measured in the laboratory and presented in table 1 the simulated soil block in the experiments includes three layers of soil the lysimeter was packed to a height of 3 cm of clay with a dry bulk density of 1 7 gr cm3 to simulate a cohesive consolidated layer then the sieved sand with an average particles diameter of 0 09 mm which is equal to average diameters of particles in the non cohesive layer of the atrak riverbanks was compacted into the flume with a bulk density of 1 5 gr cm3 with a thickness of 10 cm the soil of in situ riverbank was used as the topsoil layer and was compacted in the lysimeter to 60 cm height and with a density of 1 56 g cm 1 the stratification was based on field observations table 1 it is worth noting that the percent soil water by weight of the topsoil layer was considered 10 on the basis of field data after compacting the soil block the water level reservoir was first raised to the intended head for the groundwater level allowing the soil block to be saturated and then it was left to drain for 24 h to make it a uniform field capacity condition prior to causing seepage by a establishing a pressure head to start the test the head was kept constant in a water reservoir by a valve which is controlled by the overflow at three heights of 24 34 and 44 cm 2 3 duration of experiments during erosion of the middle layer the undercut was scanned at different times using kinect placed on the front face of the lysimeter the beginning of the experiment was defined as observation of seepage outflow from the bank face while the end was determined by failure of the topsoil layer the test ends when the depth of the undercutting increased to an extent that instability resulted in bank failure based on the previous studies e g jaspers focks 2006 micheli and kirchner 2002 samadi et al 2013 thorne and tovey 1981 there are three main types of cantilever failure mechanisms in the topsoil layer on composite riverbanks including shear radial or tensile failures fig 4 in the critical state of bank stability the resistant and driving forces in the horizontal and vertical directions as well as the moments are in equilibrium as the balance of forces is disturbed by increasing driving forces the bank becomes unstable and failure occurs in this case the mass of the topsoil layer separates from the soil block and collapses as illustrated in fig 5 by a cantilever failure in the laboratory 2 4 kinect with the development of technology various sensors are provided for 3d scanning of the objects in addition to the advanced features of the various tools their cost effectiveness is very important for practical uses low cost sensors are more attractive especially in field survey compared to expensive sensors such as laser scanners kinect is a consumer grade device designed by microsoft for pc games microsoft 2016 due to above limitations in previous methods kinect was selected to be selected as a proposed tool for river surveying in this research for example the disadvantages of sensors based on marker based system technology are high cost unportability and time consuming markers installation bonnechere et al 2012 leardini et al 2005 with the advent of kinect this technique was significantly utilized by researchers for 3d scanning and mapping chang et al 2011 henry et al 2014 zollhöfer et al 2011 the device equipped with an infrared camera an rgb camera and the infrared projector that can record the 3d motion of the body and recognize faces by creating a light speckle structure freedman et al 2008 the kginect sensor can simultaneously capture color and depth images in a frame at speeds of more than 30 fps the total depth and color data create a color point cloud of around 300 000 points per frame it is possible to increase the density of the points or to create a point cloud as real time by recording successive depth images khoshelham and elberink 2012 the minimum and maximum distances for the kinect were about 0 6 m and 4 m respectively the advantages of kinect are easy application mark less motion capture mmc cost effective and its portability based on the studies conducted on indoor mapping khoshelham and elberink 2012 investigated the systematic and random errors of kinect data and calibrated the geometric quality of the depth captured further they used a theoretical error model and compared the data from the kinect as well as the point cloud obtained from the calibrated laser scanner kinect allows for measuring the object dimensions with high accuracy in millimeters when collecting data continuously and quickly attempts are made to find the relationship among these data with the riverbank response by collecting high resolution data on soil erosion and displacement the frequent scanning of scouring cavity surface in short time intervals help to investigate the effect of frequent depth capturing on the measured volume of erosion and bank displacements this demonstrates the role of the data scanning tool and a new approach to improve riverbank erosion studies by focusing on changes in scour volume due to seepage erosion occurring in short time intervals the method requires limited ground control points which facilitates and accelerates the process of data scanning until now no research to the best of our knowledge has been undertaken on the kinect application in small scale morphological studies in riverbanks 3 surveying technique short range photogrammetric techniques such as mmc can be used to survey irregular objects e g riverbank whose shape is not already defined surveying physical models in the laboratory was performed using the proposed technique by kinect device fig 3 initially the point cloud was scanned by the kinect which lasted approximately one minute when the soil block was ready for the experiment after draining the bank face was scanned to obtain a pre erosion point cloud also the scanning process was conducted after each collapsing of the non cohesive layer of soil as post erosion the number of the captured points in the riverbank scans averaged 110 523 the collected data in each epoch requires a common reference system to perform a comparison across different recording times at least three fixed points such as lysimetric corners were used as reference points for the bank these points were selected as the coordinates of scans the use of a series of points in the body or around the target object is regarded as one of the common methods for determining the accuracy of measurements in photogrammetry the coordinates of these points are usually measured by another method with precisely defined accuracy and compared with the measured results of these points by photogrammetry these points should be distributed approximately uniformly in the image and object space points should not strictly be located on a plan surface and have to be selected such that the best marking could be made to determine the kinect error rate in the scans performed on the walls and to verify its values two different operations were performed 1 measuring sides of a cubic block by a caliper with a precision of 0 2 μm to validate the accuracy of kinect in measuring distances and depths fig 6 2 making two gypsum blocks with two cavities and specific hemisphere and cone volumes inside fig 7 volumes of the objects were measured by archimedes law i e actual volume and kinect 4 data processing initially the removal of the extra point cloud mesh generation of points and smoothing on the mesh were performed since each set of the scanned points is defined by a coordinates system the point clouds in each epoch have to be defined in a unit coordinates system in the data registration raja and fernandes 2007 the registration process for two point clouds is determined by the geometric transformation of one point cloud with another point cloud in an absolute coordinate system xie et al 2010 there are various algorithms for the registration process the iterative closest point algorithm is regarded as one of the common methods used to register two or more point clouds raja and fernandes 2007 this method was used in open source meshlab software cignoni et al 2008 in fact with at least three non parallel points it is possible to obtain the registration parameters including three angles and three components of displacement holes that were out of were out of the kinect sight were not scanned due to the lack of uniformity and they were filled up using the fill hole option in the model since the resolution of points was high in kinect scanning the number of holes and their dimensions were small less than 1 0 cm the more accurate the scanning of the topographic surface the less points interpolation is required longoni et al 2016 finally a surface fitting was made on the point cloud of the scanned sand layer the mean surface deviation was 0 5 mm and the output faces were considered 500 for fitting the final surface after the fitted surface was obtained by subtracting pre and post erosion surfaces eroded volume of the cavity was calculated for each epoch these volumes were used to analyze the erosion process at various times 5 results 5 1 data verification the data related to six sides of the cube which were measured by the caliper were compared with the corresponding values of 3d digital model obtained from the kinect scanning table 2 fig 8 illustrates the digital model obtained from the point cloud and the recorded value of the side as given in table 2 the maximum and minimum error for the cube sides are 0 53 and 0 01 respectively on the other hand the mean square error for the size of the sides was obtained 0 155 furthermore verifications were made of curved surfaces by using shapes of conical and hemispherical voids prepared in gypsum blocks with the fitting of a surface on the scanned point cloud fig 9 the model and its 3d structure were produced the results indicated that the hemisphere volume was 11 02 cm3 using the kinect while its actual value was 11 cm3 on the other hand the calculated volume of the cone was 29 85 cm3 while its actual value was 30 cm3 5 2 evaluation of seepage erosion using kinect during the experiment on the soil block the pattern and erosion process on the middle layer of banks were obtained using a point cloud therefore the variations in the depth of the cavity were recorded at different points and times in each experiment fig 10 shows the variations in an undercutting cavity in the middle layer at different times during the test with a constant head of 24 cm the number of scanning epochs of the point cloud for undercutting cavity during the test with heads of 24 34 and 44 cm were 9 6 and 3 epochs respectively this is due to the fact that an increase in head values leads to increase in speed of erosion and decrease in erosion scanning intervals as shown in fig 10 passing the time and developing the seepage flow from the inside of the bank have increased the depth of the cavity to display the elevation counters of erosion cavity at the end of each experiment the 3d point cloud was converted into a digital elevation model this made it possible to evaluate cavity depth changes using a 2d map of the elevation counters accordingly a 5 5 mm dem network was created from the point cloud figs 11 13 and 15 illustrate the results of data analysis for three experiments with different heads of 24 34 and 44 cm and their erosion patterns respectively table 3 represents the erosion cavity volume for each epoch which was obtained in each experiment based on the results the phenomenon of riverbank failure was shown to occur when the topsoil layer becomes unstable due to an increase in the driving force associated with the effective depth i e cavity depth at failure of the created cavity the coordinates of the point with the greatest depth among the coordinates of the point cloud is not necessarily the effective depth of the erosion cavity because the frequency of this point may be small in proportion to the other points in other words the largest depth in the point cloud coordinates may only be due to a collapse with a small cross section in the soil and is not necessarily the effective cavity depth which affects the stability of the soil block hence the effective depth along with the corresponding frequency was computed in each experiment by classifying the depth parameter of the point cloud and plotting frequencygraphs figs 12 14 and 16 the criterion for selecting the effective depth was arbitrarily defined as the maximum depth with a frequency exceeding 10 for this purpose depth classes were first considered in descending rank and the first class with the frequency greater than 10 was the effective depth for example as illustrated in figs 12 14 and 16 the histograms indicated how the frequency of depth is distributed in the cavity the class interval is 20 mm therefore a histogram with a greater depth and higher frequency more than 10 is identified as the effective depth of the erosion cavity causing instability in each test for example in fig 12 the effective depth is 210 mm and the corresponding frequency is about 12 as shown in fig 11 in the first experiment which is related to the head of 24 cm the expansion of the undercutting cavity is slightly inclined in the y direction in this case the scouring of the middle layer starts and develops as a separate cavity such that the depth of the cavity extends to about 270 mm at the end of the experiment which ultimately leads to instability and a collapse in the topsoil layer based on the results of frequency analysis pertinent to the point coordinates the depth class of 200 220 mm with a frequency of about 12 had significantly affected the topsoil layer compared to the depth class of 220 240 mm with a frequency of 2 5 therefore the depth of 210 mm was determined as the effective depth in the first experiment fig 12 fig 13 which is related to the second test with a head of 34 cm also illustrates the expansion of the main undercutting cavity is uniformly formed with a maximum depth of 105 mm in the center of the layer however in the main cavity three sub cavities were observed with the depth greater than that of main cavity ultimately the maximum scouring depth at the end of the test in two of the sub cavities were more than 115 mm and in one of them reached 128 mm by performing some analyses of the coordinates of the scanned point cloud by kinect it was determined that the depth class of 120 140 which is the largest class of depth of these points has the lowest frequency less than 1 however the class 100 120 with a frequency of about 15 can be accepted as the effective depth class fig 14 fig 15 depicts the topography of the undercutting cavity in the third experiment under a water head of 44 cm the results indicated that the cavity expansion consists of two sub cavities with a maximum depth of 190 mm in this case the sub cavity which was initially formed in the center of the middle layer has a maximum depth of 210 mm and extended all around the maximum recorded depth for the undercutting sub cavity in this test was 219 mm while the results of frequency analysis indicated that the depth class 200 220 had a frequency of 5 including a small number of points however the depth class of 180 200 with a frequency of 10 increases the probability of this depth to be the greatest effective depth on the riverbank stability 6 discussion 6 1 evaluation of kinect performance monitoring of the riverbank erosion over time is an important and valuable tool for providing information and the possibility of evaluating temporal and spatial deformations new tools and techniques including short range photogrammetric techniques have significantly been studied in recent years the validation results of the kinect data for estimating the volumes and different shapes of the objects indicate a small difference between the values obtained from the 3d scan by this device and the actual values in this method the maximum error value for measuring the length was 0 5 and the error of this device in scanning of the cavity volumes were 0 18 and 0 5 for the hemisphere and the cone respectively the tool was used for 3d scanning from seepage erosion phenomenon at the riverbank in the laboratory since seepage erosion is a dynamic phenomenon it was essential that the measurement tool for riverbank variations perform in such a way that it can record model scans with high speed due to the high speed of the device for scanning it could be used to record dynamic changes on the riverbanks the resolution of the point cloud by kinect is such that it can provide the same observations as laser scanner measurements the accuracy of 3d point cloud data was appropriate to understand the erosion process another advantage of kinect is the possibility of scanning 3d data on vertical and steep slopes which reflects the flexibility of this method in performing complex morphological monitoring on the riverbank in addition cost effectiveness of kinect makes it a suitable tool with high accuracy for field studies on riverbank 6 2 variation trend of seepage erosion using a 3d scan of the studied bank in the experimental lysimeter the quantity of undercutting cavity volume was obtained in each epoch for each experiment fig 17 the process of cumulative volume changes over time was determined for each experiment by line fitting analysis it was observed that the slope values were directly proportional to the head values therefore an increase in the groundwater head in the bank increases the deepening of the undercutting cavity this means that an increase in the water head increases the driving force on the soil particles which may remove more quickly from the riverbank as the depth of the cavity increases the riverbank stability decreases over the time therefore the resulting moment can lead to the cantilever failure of the topsoil layer chu agor et al 2008b have acknowledged in their laboratory research in which an increase in the depth of the undercutting cavity reduced the riverbank stability exponentially they developed the following relation in their research 1 f s 1 03 e 0 01 d where d represents the undercutting depth in mm and f s indicates the safety factor of riverbank stability although the proposed relationship is based on soil data and laboratory conditions it was evaluated for the maximum depths in this research leading to the riverbank failure the values of the safety factors that were calculated from eq 1 were 0 12 0 34 and 0 15 for head values of 24 34 and 44 cm respectively table 4 the safety factors of less than one represent that the riverbank is unstable which is in agreement with the experimental observations of the present study fig 17 indicates that the higher groundwater head leads to the seepage erosion during a short time such that the intersection of the fitted line with the time axis is 337 648 and 708 s for testing under heads of 44 34 and 24 cm respectively karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 recognized the effect of seepage gradient on erosion termination time they defined erosion termination time as the time at which topsoil layer failure occurs based on the results a significant relationship was observed between the failure time and the seepage gradient fig 18 the results indicate that an increase in the water head lead to increasing the rate of progression of the wetting front and accelerating the riverbank collapse process karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 fitted a power function relationships to the seepage gradient and the failure times in their studies the trend of the results of the present study are in agreement with karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 fig 18 fox et al 2006 observed that at 90 cm head seepage erosion is less than that of 60 and 30 cm they explained that failure for the 90 cm head occurred prior to undercutting by seepage erosion which is in agreement with karmaker and dutta 2013 results the results of the present study indicated that the effect of soil water pressure in the topsoil layer may be negligible in the 24 cm head thus the failure mechanism is related to seepage erosion and the undercutting of topsoil layer in the test with a head of 34 cm the rate of the failure mechanism was faster than the seepage erosion based on the groundwater level consequently depth of the erosion cavity and the volume of erosion of the middle layer were lower than that of the 24 head test in fact under this circumstance the failure of the riverbank is influenced simultaneously by the pore pressure and seepage erosion and as a result the volume of the undercutting cavity was less than that of head values of 24 and 44 cm however the seepage flow was high enough at 44 cm which practically overrides the pore water pressure in the topsoil layer this may lead to expanding the erosion cavity more quickly than those of the 34 cm head value 7 conclusion in many river management issues information on the riverbank erosion rate over time or along the entire riverbank reach is essential it is important to consider long term monitoring in order to properly understand the riverbank behavior and accordingly the erosion and sediment production despite high accuracy of terrestrial scanners their higher costs and heavyweights prevent ease of movement that produces supersized point cloud which requires a special processing environment thus the need for using other methods teutsch 2007 one of the main challenges for researchers is to overcome the practical constraints while maintaining precise and high detail 3d information acquisition methods while easing and speeding in river engineering in the present study short range photogrammetric techniques were used to collect information in order to determine the amount of erosion caused by seepage in the riverbank monitoring the process of seepage erosion and examining the amount of the undercutting volume caused by this process were performed in the laboratory for this purpose the variations of undercutting by seepage in the middle layer of the test block were recorded for three different heads of groundwater photogrammetry by kinect was identified as an effective method in this study since it can expand the precision and resolution of point cloud in order to identify the recession and previous surface of the riverbank without contacting with the object the results of the temporal and spatial patterns of seepage erosion were determined in high spatial precision and temporal resolution the results on kinect accuracy based on analyzing 3d cavity scans indicated that the device has a high accuracy maximum error of 0 5 the results showed that an increase in the groundwater head increased the rate of seepage erosion and the riverbank failure occurred in short time the failure time for the 44 cm hydraulic gradient was slightly over 10 min while the required time for riverbank instability and the failure of the topsoil layer was 2 5 and 6 times higher respectively on a 34 and 24 cm gradient the obtained results indicate that an increase in the depth of the non cohesive layer by 11 21 cm leads to a failure in the topsoil layer therefore seepage erosion is an important and basic mechanism for riverbank failure and morphological changes that should not be neglected further the results indicate that the kinect technology as a new and cost effectiveness tool can accurately monitor the processes of the displacement of the vertical riverbank it is suggested that kinect application can be investigated for the quantification of riverbank erosion in field studies for future studies acknowledgment the first author would like to thank mr mahmood davoodianidaliki for his helpful and constructive

7460,temporal and spatial monitoring play a significant role in evaluating and examining the riverbank morphology and its spatiotemporal changes unlike the terrestrial laser scanners other previously used methods such as satellite images total station surveying and erosion pins have limited application to quantify the small scale bank variations due to the lack of rapid survey and resolution in data acquisition high cost lack of availability specialized equipment and hard movement of laser scanners make it necessary to develop new accurate economical and easily available methods the present study aims to test the kinect photogrametric technology for measuring and assessing riverbank variations in laboratory environment for this purpose three models of layered soil blocks for three different levels of groundwater i e 24 34 and 44 cm were designed to investigate the seepage erosion behavior experimentally the results indicate the high accuracy of kinect in measuring the bank erosion cavity dimensions i e 0 5 error with high spatial resolution data i e 300 000 points per frame the high speed of kinect in riverbank scanning enables the analysis of time variations of mechanisms such as seepage erosion which occurs rather rapidly the results confirmed that there is a power relationship between the seepage gradient and the time of the bank failure with a determination coefficient of 0 97 moreover an increase in the level of groundwater on the riverbank increases the rate of undercutting retreat that caused more rapid failure of the riverbank keywords short range photogrammetry kinect seepage riverbank erosion monitoring groundwater 1 introduction riverbank erosion as one of the most dynamic processes in riverbank morphology is one of the essential problems in river management darby et al 2000 xia et al 2014 the estimation of river erosion is of great importance due to negative effects on the river such as the loss of fertile agricultural soil amiri tokaldany et al 2003 haddadchi et al 2014 surface water contamination by sediment transport hassan et al 2013 midgley et al 2012 an increase in the suspended sediment load evans et al 2006 simon and rinaldi 2006 morphological deformation of the river which can affect submerged structures dotterweich 2008 millar 2000 rinaldi and darby 2007 and a reduction of the volume of reservoirs amitrano et al 2013 de araújo et al 2006 riverbank erosion processes are categorized into two groups based on the factors affecting the stability 1 the fluvial erosion due to excess shear stresses imposed on the riverbank and 2 the mass wasting due to the role of the geotechnical instability factors such as seepage flow and subaerial process crosta and prisco 1999 lawler et al 1997 rinaldi and darby 2007 the lateral subsurface flow is known as one of the significant factors in destruction of riverbanks and production of sediment loads in many geographical regions of the world fox and wilson 2010 fox et al 2005 masoodi et al 2017 wilson et al 2007 the subsurface flow leads to erosion of non consolidated materials along the riverbank by applying the shear stress on the cavities through the water flow or by utilizing drag force to the particles and entraining them by seepage flow dunne 1990 fox et al 2006 jones 1997 the occurrence of subsurface erosion requires establishment of certain conditions such as excess flow and the exit point of water from the soil in this regard the excess flow is defined as the difference between seepage flow and the flow at which sediment is on the threshold of motion hagerty 1991a hagerty 1991b wilson et al 2007 wilson et al 2007 suggested that the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductive in the riverbanks such as a conductive layer bounded by two less conductive layers at the top and bottom causes concentration of subsurface flow resulting in seepage from the conductive layer high stage conditions can also increase the water level in riverbanks which impacts riverbank stability as the water level in the river decreases the lateral subsurface water stored in the bank flows from the riverbank back into the river results in seepage erosion cavities fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the seepage erosion is the particle entrainment by the seepage flow from the riverbank which causes undercutting and mass failure of the topsoil layer hagerty 1991a to investigate and recognize this failure mechanism of the riverbank it is necessary to measure the volume of undercutting due to the seepage flow chu agor et al 2008a most of the applied techniques in river morphology studies are related to large scale morphological changes such as coastline displacement river bed widening and river pathway changes over time which are unable to monitor small scale changes of the riverbank nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 in this regard most studies on erosion and sediment have suffered from a lack of continuous measurements as well as many constraints in spatial and temporal changes based on morphological and sediment transport approaches ferguson 1993 one of the factors causing the complexity of seepage erosion analysis is related to its three dimensional nature chu agor et al 2009 crosta and prisco 1999 although the non uniform distribution of seepage erosion on the riverbank is evident in field they are generally distinct by preferred flow pathways the undercutting dimensions are substantial in terms of estimation of the eroded sediment and bank instability cancienne 2008 chu agor et al 2008b karmaker and dutta 2013 lawler et al 1997 reviewed and categorized the various methods used to monitoring riverbank erosion and its changes e g erosion pins terrain photogrammetry and peep 1 photo electronic erosion pin 1 erosion mechanisms identification and their roles are required to estimate sedimentation rate pizzuto et al 2010 argued that the study of temporal and spatial variations of riverbank erosion is important based on two perspectives 1 improved recognition of the riverbank erosion process can help to develop the conceptual models of the river response and 2 spatial and temporal variations of riverbank erosion can be useful in estimating sediment load and riverbank retreat which is required for river management programs with the advancement of technology in hardware and software surveying and data acquisition can be performed with higher accuracy and speed both in field and laboratory recently various approaches have been used to study the morphology of the riverbank for example fuller et al 2003 measured the sediment transport values for the fluvial equilibrium after the chute cutoff using surveying with total station camera and producing a digital elevation model dem although total station technique is highly accurate it includes a low spatial resolution and is associated with a considerable error in the steep or vertical slopes nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 with the development of the photogrammetric techniques brasington et al 2000 studied the three dimensional morphodynamics of braided rivers using a high precision real time global positioning system gps the gps technique has a limited utilization on steep and vertical slopes and it is less accurate than the total station recently wells et al 2016 presented a method for monitoring rill and ephemeral gully erosion spatiotemporally based on close range digital photogrammetric techniques aerial laser scanning als method is regarded as another application of remote sensing techniques in rivers which is based on the limitation and identification of light longoni et al 2016 this technique could measure the retreat of the riverbank surficially from the plan however it may not distinguish the erosion on the riverbank accurate enough because the banks have often steep slopes and the viewing angle in these techniques is oblique therefore it is preferable to record the erosion variations from above and to understand morphological changes of the banks the changes may appear as undermining and small scale frequent failures of the banks which are not generally recorded and could only be recordable when the failure affects the upper surface of the bank hicks et al 2007 mitasova et al 2002 thoma et al 2005 despite the high precision and high spatial resolution this method may be suffering from high uncertainties for example it may be confronted with time resolution limit to interpret at large levels heritage and hetherington 2007 milan et al 2007 terrestrial laser scanning tls is another technique used in recent years in geomorphic studies and large scale riverbank erosion measurements due to its high accuracy bitelli et al 2004 milan et al 2007 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 rosser et al 2005 recorded changes in the dimensions of a coastal cliff using tls techniques which can measure the failure variations on vertical or relatively vertical slopes with high speed and accuracy in addition the time series of terrestrial scanning was used to measure volumetric variations of stratigraphic layers at the riverbank lyons et al 2015 starek et al 2013 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 conducted their studies on riverbank erosion and how it was relocated using tls techniques milan et al 2007 used this technique to evaluate the displacement and riverbank deformation for this purpose they monitored a small reach of the river in two flood periods by tls by creating dtms and their comparison they analyzed how the erosion and sedimentation processes affect the riverbank to understand more about the relationship between the extent of riverbank erosion as well as weather conditions and river flow rates longoni et al 2016 applied tls techniques to monitor the riverbank over a period of time and found that the method is an efficient and effective way for achieving the purpose chu agor et al 2009 also studied geometry and dimensions of undercutting using 3d high accuracy medium range laser scanner to monitor for different periods a single layer simulated riverbank of sand material by 50 20 25 cm dimensions was utilized in this regard although laser scanners have high accuracy their heavy weight causes problems for their movement on the other hand it is expensive and costly in comparison to other procedures according to the mentioned methods it is not possible to introduce an optimal method for all applications practically as each includes a different ability fitting to the intended application to select the type of measurement method some factors such as accuracy cost number of measurement points and their disparity deformation rate environmental conditions adequate time for measurement access to the target body the material of the target body texture status and the color of the body surface should be taken into consideration salvi et al 1998 wells et al 2016 most of the previous studies are based on long periods of time such as satellite images sediment traps and als despite all the techniques previously introduced there are problems to obtain high resolution morphological data this is due to the fact that the adequacy of the data plays an influential role in examining the changes on short temporal and medium spatial scales based on the economic conditions to scan morphological changes resulting from seepage erosion it is necessary to have a measuring device with high spatial and temporal accuracy due to the rapid temporal variations and the probability of occurrence in small spatial reaches as the seepage erosion process often lasts less than a few hours it is necessary to make surveys more rapidly and frequently measurement methods which have been used in the riverbank erosion often provide a set of data which are spatially or temporally dispersed and have high uncertainty or sometimes limited to a short reach of the river which is not generalizable for the whole location estimating the exact volume of the undercutting at each stage of the erosion process is necessary for modeling the development of undercutting and recognizing the seepage erosion mechanism the frequent use of terrestrial laser scanners in the field is not economical due to its high cost and being research oriented until now there is not any study that has demonstrated an appropriate and cost effective method to measure seepage erosion and its effect on the riverbank retreat this study proposes an innovative approach to monitor seepage erosion using kinect which is commonly used for human body tracing and indoor mapping chang et al 2011 khoshelham and elberink 2012 oikonomidis et al 2011 this study focused on scrutinizing the features and capabilities of this technique for scanning undercutting cavity in laboratory studies to achieve this goal the rate of erosion and temporal variations of the cavity is estimated and monitored from the beginning to the end of the experiments high resolution data were collected by kinect from the erosion cavity volume in short time intervals on the stratified bank to quantify its temporal and spatial changes 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study site was a stream in atrak river watershed bazkhaneh in the north khorasan province in north eastern iran with semi arid environment the atrak river flows from the hezar masjed mountain range from east to west and ends in the caspian sea bank erosion plays a key role in the morphology of atrak river masoodi et al 2017 the geographical location of the soil sampling site was 37 27 25 2 n and 57 21 17 1 e which the seepage erosion problem is frequently observed three field surveys were made in three different times for site selection soil sampling and transporting materials to the laboratory stratification of the riverbank is composed of 2 4 m of cohesive clay loam underlaid by sandy soil with 10 cm thickness as a conductive layer this overlays consolidated clay loam layer with 1 m thickness fig 2 soil and geotechnical parameters for the layers were measured in laboratory including cohesion friction angle bulk density particle size distribution and hydraulic conductivity about 1000 kg of upper layer was collected and transferred to laboratory for physical modeling of the riverbank erosion 2 2 laboratory model to simulate seepage erosion in the laboratory a 3d block of soil was tested within a plexiglas lysimeter with dimensions of 100 cm height 50 cm width and 100 cm length which was kept by a metal framework fig 3 the lysymeter consists of the water reservoir for setting the water head and the soil reservoir as shown in fig 3 the direction of the seepage is in the z axis perpendicular to the bank face while y is along the bank face and x is normal to z y plane the two reservoirs are separated by a perforated sheet made of plexiglas with holes of 3 mm in diameter and a center to center distance of 1 cm a geotextile sheet was used between the perforated sheet and the soil to prevent soil movement into the water reservoir the front face of the lysimeter was closed with a metal plate to compacted soil to simulate a riverbank on the left wall of the lysimeter and at a height of 7 cm from the bed 5 holes with 3 mm diameter were embedded by pipe piezometers for measuring the water head in the non cohesive layer physical and geotechnical properties of soil samples were measured in the laboratory and presented in table 1 the simulated soil block in the experiments includes three layers of soil the lysimeter was packed to a height of 3 cm of clay with a dry bulk density of 1 7 gr cm3 to simulate a cohesive consolidated layer then the sieved sand with an average particles diameter of 0 09 mm which is equal to average diameters of particles in the non cohesive layer of the atrak riverbanks was compacted into the flume with a bulk density of 1 5 gr cm3 with a thickness of 10 cm the soil of in situ riverbank was used as the topsoil layer and was compacted in the lysimeter to 60 cm height and with a density of 1 56 g cm 1 the stratification was based on field observations table 1 it is worth noting that the percent soil water by weight of the topsoil layer was considered 10 on the basis of field data after compacting the soil block the water level reservoir was first raised to the intended head for the groundwater level allowing the soil block to be saturated and then it was left to drain for 24 h to make it a uniform field capacity condition prior to causing seepage by a establishing a pressure head to start the test the head was kept constant in a water reservoir by a valve which is controlled by the overflow at three heights of 24 34 and 44 cm 2 3 duration of experiments during erosion of the middle layer the undercut was scanned at different times using kinect placed on the front face of the lysimeter the beginning of the experiment was defined as observation of seepage outflow from the bank face while the end was determined by failure of the topsoil layer the test ends when the depth of the undercutting increased to an extent that instability resulted in bank failure based on the previous studies e g jaspers focks 2006 micheli and kirchner 2002 samadi et al 2013 thorne and tovey 1981 there are three main types of cantilever failure mechanisms in the topsoil layer on composite riverbanks including shear radial or tensile failures fig 4 in the critical state of bank stability the resistant and driving forces in the horizontal and vertical directions as well as the moments are in equilibrium as the balance of forces is disturbed by increasing driving forces the bank becomes unstable and failure occurs in this case the mass of the topsoil layer separates from the soil block and collapses as illustrated in fig 5 by a cantilever failure in the laboratory 2 4 kinect with the development of technology various sensors are provided for 3d scanning of the objects in addition to the advanced features of the various tools their cost effectiveness is very important for practical uses low cost sensors are more attractive especially in field survey compared to expensive sensors such as laser scanners kinect is a consumer grade device designed by microsoft for pc games microsoft 2016 due to above limitations in previous methods kinect was selected to be selected as a proposed tool for river surveying in this research for example the disadvantages of sensors based on marker based system technology are high cost unportability and time consuming markers installation bonnechere et al 2012 leardini et al 2005 with the advent of kinect this technique was significantly utilized by researchers for 3d scanning and mapping chang et al 2011 henry et al 2014 zollhöfer et al 2011 the device equipped with an infrared camera an rgb camera and the infrared projector that can record the 3d motion of the body and recognize faces by creating a light speckle structure freedman et al 2008 the kginect sensor can simultaneously capture color and depth images in a frame at speeds of more than 30 fps the total depth and color data create a color point cloud of around 300 000 points per frame it is possible to increase the density of the points or to create a point cloud as real time by recording successive depth images khoshelham and elberink 2012 the minimum and maximum distances for the kinect were about 0 6 m and 4 m respectively the advantages of kinect are easy application mark less motion capture mmc cost effective and its portability based on the studies conducted on indoor mapping khoshelham and elberink 2012 investigated the systematic and random errors of kinect data and calibrated the geometric quality of the depth captured further they used a theoretical error model and compared the data from the kinect as well as the point cloud obtained from the calibrated laser scanner kinect allows for measuring the object dimensions with high accuracy in millimeters when collecting data continuously and quickly attempts are made to find the relationship among these data with the riverbank response by collecting high resolution data on soil erosion and displacement the frequent scanning of scouring cavity surface in short time intervals help to investigate the effect of frequent depth capturing on the measured volume of erosion and bank displacements this demonstrates the role of the data scanning tool and a new approach to improve riverbank erosion studies by focusing on changes in scour volume due to seepage erosion occurring in short time intervals the method requires limited ground control points which facilitates and accelerates the process of data scanning until now no research to the best of our knowledge has been undertaken on the kinect application in small scale morphological studies in riverbanks 3 surveying technique short range photogrammetric techniques such as mmc can be used to survey irregular objects e g riverbank whose shape is not already defined surveying physical models in the laboratory was performed using the proposed technique by kinect device fig 3 initially the point cloud was scanned by the kinect which lasted approximately one minute when the soil block was ready for the experiment after draining the bank face was scanned to obtain a pre erosion point cloud also the scanning process was conducted after each collapsing of the non cohesive layer of soil as post erosion the number of the captured points in the riverbank scans averaged 110 523 the collected data in each epoch requires a common reference system to perform a comparison across different recording times at least three fixed points such as lysimetric corners were used as reference points for the bank these points were selected as the coordinates of scans the use of a series of points in the body or around the target object is regarded as one of the common methods for determining the accuracy of measurements in photogrammetry the coordinates of these points are usually measured by another method with precisely defined accuracy and compared with the measured results of these points by photogrammetry these points should be distributed approximately uniformly in the image and object space points should not strictly be located on a plan surface and have to be selected such that the best marking could be made to determine the kinect error rate in the scans performed on the walls and to verify its values two different operations were performed 1 measuring sides of a cubic block by a caliper with a precision of 0 2 μm to validate the accuracy of kinect in measuring distances and depths fig 6 2 making two gypsum blocks with two cavities and specific hemisphere and cone volumes inside fig 7 volumes of the objects were measured by archimedes law i e actual volume and kinect 4 data processing initially the removal of the extra point cloud mesh generation of points and smoothing on the mesh were performed since each set of the scanned points is defined by a coordinates system the point clouds in each epoch have to be defined in a unit coordinates system in the data registration raja and fernandes 2007 the registration process for two point clouds is determined by the geometric transformation of one point cloud with another point cloud in an absolute coordinate system xie et al 2010 there are various algorithms for the registration process the iterative closest point algorithm is regarded as one of the common methods used to register two or more point clouds raja and fernandes 2007 this method was used in open source meshlab software cignoni et al 2008 in fact with at least three non parallel points it is possible to obtain the registration parameters including three angles and three components of displacement holes that were out of were out of the kinect sight were not scanned due to the lack of uniformity and they were filled up using the fill hole option in the model since the resolution of points was high in kinect scanning the number of holes and their dimensions were small less than 1 0 cm the more accurate the scanning of the topographic surface the less points interpolation is required longoni et al 2016 finally a surface fitting was made on the point cloud of the scanned sand layer the mean surface deviation was 0 5 mm and the output faces were considered 500 for fitting the final surface after the fitted surface was obtained by subtracting pre and post erosion surfaces eroded volume of the cavity was calculated for each epoch these volumes were used to analyze the erosion process at various times 5 results 5 1 data verification the data related to six sides of the cube which were measured by the caliper were compared with the corresponding values of 3d digital model obtained from the kinect scanning table 2 fig 8 illustrates the digital model obtained from the point cloud and the recorded value of the side as given in table 2 the maximum and minimum error for the cube sides are 0 53 and 0 01 respectively on the other hand the mean square error for the size of the sides was obtained 0 155 furthermore verifications were made of curved surfaces by using shapes of conical and hemispherical voids prepared in gypsum blocks with the fitting of a surface on the scanned point cloud fig 9 the model and its 3d structure were produced the results indicated that the hemisphere volume was 11 02 cm3 using the kinect while its actual value was 11 cm3 on the other hand the calculated volume of the cone was 29 85 cm3 while its actual value was 30 cm3 5 2 evaluation of seepage erosion using kinect during the experiment on the soil block the pattern and erosion process on the middle layer of banks were obtained using a point cloud therefore the variations in the depth of the cavity were recorded at different points and times in each experiment fig 10 shows the variations in an undercutting cavity in the middle layer at different times during the test with a constant head of 24 cm the number of scanning epochs of the point cloud for undercutting cavity during the test with heads of 24 34 and 44 cm were 9 6 and 3 epochs respectively this is due to the fact that an increase in head values leads to increase in speed of erosion and decrease in erosion scanning intervals as shown in fig 10 passing the time and developing the seepage flow from the inside of the bank have increased the depth of the cavity to display the elevation counters of erosion cavity at the end of each experiment the 3d point cloud was converted into a digital elevation model this made it possible to evaluate cavity depth changes using a 2d map of the elevation counters accordingly a 5 5 mm dem network was created from the point cloud figs 11 13 and 15 illustrate the results of data analysis for three experiments with different heads of 24 34 and 44 cm and their erosion patterns respectively table 3 represents the erosion cavity volume for each epoch which was obtained in each experiment based on the results the phenomenon of riverbank failure was shown to occur when the topsoil layer becomes unstable due to an increase in the driving force associated with the effective depth i e cavity depth at failure of the created cavity the coordinates of the point with the greatest depth among the coordinates of the point cloud is not necessarily the effective depth of the erosion cavity because the frequency of this point may be small in proportion to the other points in other words the largest depth in the point cloud coordinates may only be due to a collapse with a small cross section in the soil and is not necessarily the effective cavity depth which affects the stability of the soil block hence the effective depth along with the corresponding frequency was computed in each experiment by classifying the depth parameter of the point cloud and plotting frequencygraphs figs 12 14 and 16 the criterion for selecting the effective depth was arbitrarily defined as the maximum depth with a frequency exceeding 10 for this purpose depth classes were first considered in descending rank and the first class with the frequency greater than 10 was the effective depth for example as illustrated in figs 12 14 and 16 the histograms indicated how the frequency of depth is distributed in the cavity the class interval is 20 mm therefore a histogram with a greater depth and higher frequency more than 10 is identified as the effective depth of the erosion cavity causing instability in each test for example in fig 12 the effective depth is 210 mm and the corresponding frequency is about 12 as shown in fig 11 in the first experiment which is related to the head of 24 cm the expansion of the undercutting cavity is slightly inclined in the y direction in this case the scouring of the middle layer starts and develops as a separate cavity such that the depth of the cavity extends to about 270 mm at the end of the experiment which ultimately leads to instability and a collapse in the topsoil layer based on the results of frequency analysis pertinent to the point coordinates the depth class of 200 220 mm with a frequency of about 12 had significantly affected the topsoil layer compared to the depth class of 220 240 mm with a frequency of 2 5 therefore the depth of 210 mm was determined as the effective depth in the first experiment fig 12 fig 13 which is related to the second test with a head of 34 cm also illustrates the expansion of the main undercutting cavity is uniformly formed with a maximum depth of 105 mm in the center of the layer however in the main cavity three sub cavities were observed with the depth greater than that of main cavity ultimately the maximum scouring depth at the end of the test in two of the sub cavities were more than 115 mm and in one of them reached 128 mm by performing some analyses of the coordinates of the scanned point cloud by kinect it was determined that the depth class of 120 140 which is the largest class of depth of these points has the lowest frequency less than 1 however the class 100 120 with a frequency of about 15 can be accepted as the effective depth class fig 14 fig 15 depicts the topography of the undercutting cavity in the third experiment under a water head of 44 cm the results indicated that the cavity expansion consists of two sub cavities with a maximum depth of 190 mm in this case the sub cavity which was initially formed in the center of the middle layer has a maximum depth of 210 mm and extended all around the maximum recorded depth for the undercutting sub cavity in this test was 219 mm while the results of frequency analysis indicated that the depth class 200 220 had a frequency of 5 including a small number of points however the depth class of 180 200 with a frequency of 10 increases the probability of this depth to be the greatest effective depth on the riverbank stability 6 discussion 6 1 evaluation of kinect performance monitoring of the riverbank erosion over time is an important and valuable tool for providing information and the possibility of evaluating temporal and spatial deformations new tools and techniques including short range photogrammetric techniques have significantly been studied in recent years the validation results of the kinect data for estimating the volumes and different shapes of the objects indicate a small difference between the values obtained from the 3d scan by this device and the actual values in this method the maximum error value for measuring the length was 0 5 and the error of this device in scanning of the cavity volumes were 0 18 and 0 5 for the hemisphere and the cone respectively the tool was used for 3d scanning from seepage erosion phenomenon at the riverbank in the laboratory since seepage erosion is a dynamic phenomenon it was essential that the measurement tool for riverbank variations perform in such a way that it can record model scans with high speed due to the high speed of the device for scanning it could be used to record dynamic changes on the riverbanks the resolution of the point cloud by kinect is such that it can provide the same observations as laser scanner measurements the accuracy of 3d point cloud data was appropriate to understand the erosion process another advantage of kinect is the possibility of scanning 3d data on vertical and steep slopes which reflects the flexibility of this method in performing complex morphological monitoring on the riverbank in addition cost effectiveness of kinect makes it a suitable tool with high accuracy for field studies on riverbank 6 2 variation trend of seepage erosion using a 3d scan of the studied bank in the experimental lysimeter the quantity of undercutting cavity volume was obtained in each epoch for each experiment fig 17 the process of cumulative volume changes over time was determined for each experiment by line fitting analysis it was observed that the slope values were directly proportional to the head values therefore an increase in the groundwater head in the bank increases the deepening of the undercutting cavity this means that an increase in the water head increases the driving force on the soil particles which may remove more quickly from the riverbank as the depth of the cavity increases the riverbank stability decreases over the time therefore the resulting moment can lead to the cantilever failure of the topsoil layer chu agor et al 2008b have acknowledged in their laboratory research in which an increase in the depth of the undercutting cavity reduced the riverbank stability exponentially they developed the following relation in their research 1 f s 1 03 e 0 01 d where d represents the undercutting depth in mm and f s indicates the safety factor of riverbank stability although the proposed relationship is based on soil data and laboratory conditions it was evaluated for the maximum depths in this research leading to the riverbank failure the values of the safety factors that were calculated from eq 1 were 0 12 0 34 and 0 15 for head values of 24 34 and 44 cm respectively table 4 the safety factors of less than one represent that the riverbank is unstable which is in agreement with the experimental observations of the present study fig 17 indicates that the higher groundwater head leads to the seepage erosion during a short time such that the intersection of the fitted line with the time axis is 337 648 and 708 s for testing under heads of 44 34 and 24 cm respectively karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 recognized the effect of seepage gradient on erosion termination time they defined erosion termination time as the time at which topsoil layer failure occurs based on the results a significant relationship was observed between the failure time and the seepage gradient fig 18 the results indicate that an increase in the water head lead to increasing the rate of progression of the wetting front and accelerating the riverbank collapse process karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 fitted a power function relationships to the seepage gradient and the failure times in their studies the trend of the results of the present study are in agreement with karmaker and dutta 2013 and fox et al 2006 fig 18 fox et al 2006 observed that at 90 cm head seepage erosion is less than that of 60 and 30 cm they explained that failure for the 90 cm head occurred prior to undercutting by seepage erosion which is in agreement with karmaker and dutta 2013 results the results of the present study indicated that the effect of soil water pressure in the topsoil layer may be negligible in the 24 cm head thus the failure mechanism is related to seepage erosion and the undercutting of topsoil layer in the test with a head of 34 cm the rate of the failure mechanism was faster than the seepage erosion based on the groundwater level consequently depth of the erosion cavity and the volume of erosion of the middle layer were lower than that of the 24 head test in fact under this circumstance the failure of the riverbank is influenced simultaneously by the pore pressure and seepage erosion and as a result the volume of the undercutting cavity was less than that of head values of 24 and 44 cm however the seepage flow was high enough at 44 cm which practically overrides the pore water pressure in the topsoil layer this may lead to expanding the erosion cavity more quickly than those of the 34 cm head value 7 conclusion in many river management issues information on the riverbank erosion rate over time or along the entire riverbank reach is essential it is important to consider long term monitoring in order to properly understand the riverbank behavior and accordingly the erosion and sediment production despite high accuracy of terrestrial scanners their higher costs and heavyweights prevent ease of movement that produces supersized point cloud which requires a special processing environment thus the need for using other methods teutsch 2007 one of the main challenges for researchers is to overcome the practical constraints while maintaining precise and high detail 3d information acquisition methods while easing and speeding in river engineering in the present study short range photogrammetric techniques were used to collect information in order to determine the amount of erosion caused by seepage in the riverbank monitoring the process of seepage erosion and examining the amount of the undercutting volume caused by this process were performed in the laboratory for this purpose the variations of undercutting by seepage in the middle layer of the test block were recorded for three different heads of groundwater photogrammetry by kinect was identified as an effective method in this study since it can expand the precision and resolution of point cloud in order to identify the recession and previous surface of the riverbank without contacting with the object the results of the temporal and spatial patterns of seepage erosion were determined in high spatial precision and temporal resolution the results on kinect accuracy based on analyzing 3d cavity scans indicated that the device has a high accuracy maximum error of 0 5 the results showed that an increase in the groundwater head increased the rate of seepage erosion and the riverbank failure occurred in short time the failure time for the 44 cm hydraulic gradient was slightly over 10 min while the required time for riverbank instability and the failure of the topsoil layer was 2 5 and 6 times higher respectively on a 34 and 24 cm gradient the obtained results indicate that an increase in the depth of the non cohesive layer by 11 21 cm leads to a failure in the topsoil layer therefore seepage erosion is an important and basic mechanism for riverbank failure and morphological changes that should not be neglected further the results indicate that the kinect technology as a new and cost effectiveness tool can accurately monitor the processes of the displacement of the vertical riverbank it is suggested that kinect application can be investigated for the quantification of riverbank erosion in field studies for future studies acknowledgment the first author would like to thank mr mahmood davoodianidaliki for his helpful and constructive

7461,although process based distributed hydrological models pdhms are evolving rapidly over the last few decades their extensive applications are still challenged by the computational expenses this study attempted for the first time to apply the numerically efficient maccormack algorithm to overland flow routing in a representative high spatial resolution pdhm i e the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm in order to improve its computational efficiency the analytical verification indicates that both the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes exhibit robust numerical stability and are more computationally efficient than the conventional explicit linear scheme the full version outperforms the semi version in terms of simulation accuracy when a same time step is adopted the semi maccormack scheme was implemented into dhsvm version 3 1 2 to solve the kinematic wave equations for overland flow routing the performance and practicality of the enhanced dhsvm maccormack model was assessed by performing two groups of modeling experiments in the mercer creek watershed a small urban catchment near bellevue washington the experiments show that dhsvm maccormack can considerably improve the computational efficiency without compromising the simulation accuracy of the original dhsvm model more specifically with the same computational environment and model settings the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack can be reduced to several dozen minutes for a simulation period of three months in contrast with one day and a half by the original dhsvm model without noticeable sacrifice of the accuracy the maccormack scheme proves to be applicable to overland flow routing in dhsvm which implies that it can be coupled into other phdms for watershed routing to either significantly improve their computational efficiency or to make the kinematic wave routing for high resolution modeling computational feasible keywords maccormack scheme overland flow routing dhsvm kinematic wave computational efficiency 1 introduction overland flow is one of the major components of the hydrological cycle and has the most intimate interactions with human beings because of their coexistence in space and time wong 2011 it is normally unsteady and non uniform and therefore can be described by the st venant equations owing to the highly nonlinear nature of these equations which involve a high degree of complexity in their computation various approximations of the st venant equations have been proposed for solving overland flow problems the kinematic wave kw model which was first developed by lighthill and whitham 1955 is one of such approximations and proves to be adequate for most practical overland flow situations akan and houghtalen 2003 the major assumption of the kw model is that the acceleration and pressure terms in the momentum equation are insignificant and consequently the friction slope is equal to the terrain slope miller 1984 the kw model is essentially a set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations for which analytical solutions cannot be obtained except for a few idealized conditions the finite difference fd numerical methods which are generally classified into explicit and implicit schemes are therefore frequently used to solve the kw equations both the explicit and implicit fd methods have comparative strengths and weaknesses the explicit fd schemes are easy to formulate and program but are subjected to a necessary and insufficient condition for stability known as the courant friedrichs lewy stability cfl condition chow et al 1988 the cfl condition imposes a restriction on the workable time steps which limits the computational efficiency and the practical applications of the explicit fd method the implicit fd schemes on the other hand are unconditionally stable but suffer from i high computational complexity due to the matrix operations ii large memory demand and iii deficiency in their applications to nonlinear problems kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2005 huang and lee 2013 process based distributed hydrological models pdhms are evolving rapidly over the last few decades paniconi and putti 2015 this is partly spurred by the tremendous advances in computing power programming techniques and data availability and partly by the increasing demands for spatially distributed hydrological simulations impact assessments and interdisciplinary studies beven 2011 fenicia et al 2016 nevertheless the extensive applications of pdhms are still challenged by their computational burden since pdhms are mostly associated with solving nonlinear partial differential equations over large domains at fine spatiotemporal resolutions fatichi et al 2016 in pdhms such as the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang 1998 and the water flow and balance simulation model wasim schulla and jasper 2007 the routing of overland flow is usually described by the kw equations owing to its simplicity and satisfactory accuracy compared to the st venant equations jain and singh 2005 tsai and yang 2005 yu and duan 2014 however the computational efficiency of these models would be strictly constrained in case of using the conventional explicit fd schemes to solve the kw equations because it usually requires very small time increments to comply with the cfl condition for example dhsvm routes the kw overland flow with the explicit linear scheme we have tested it using the model s test site data which corresponds to a small urban watershed 31 km2 at a spatial resolution of 30 m and found that it needs almost 186 h to complete a 2 25 years simulation the test was carried out on a lenovo notebook pc with an intel core i7 2620 m cpu and 8 gb of ram considering the complexity of the real world and the strong spatial heterogeneity of land surface characteristics more attention is increasingly paid to high spatial resolution pdhms for a refined representation of hydrological processes ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the computational efficiency of pdhms is even worse when they are applied to a large study domain with a high spatial resolution since smaller spatial steps require much smaller time steps to achieve a stable solution to the kw equations with an explicit fd scheme thus it is of great significance and practical importance to propose more efficient numerical methods to solve the kw equations for overland flow routing to reduce the computational cost the maccormack fd method which was initially proposed to solve the time dependent compressive navier stokes equations is a popular and widely used numerical algorithm in computational hydraulics maccormack 2003 tseng 2010 recently some researchers have successfully applied the maccormack algorithm to kw overland flow problems kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2005 investigated the reliability of the explicit maccormack scheme and compared it to the available analytical solutions and to a 4 point implicit fd method they concluded that the maccormack algorithm is computationally more efficient than the 4 point implicit method although they are comparable in accuracy tseng 2010 applied the unconditionally stable implicit maccormack scheme to solve the kw problem and demonstrated that it is a simple accurate highly stable and efficient solver huang and lee 2013 reformulated the implicit maccormack scheme and then applied it to two mountainous watersheds for 2 dimensional 2d runoff simulations they reported that the proposed method was significantly superior to the conventional algorithm in terms of computational efficiency these previous studies consistently revealed the clear advantage of the maccormack scheme over the other conventional numerical methods for solving the kw equations none of them however have tested the applicability and advantage of the maccormack scheme with a pdhm this study therefore applied the maccormack scheme to the kw overland flow routing in a representative high spatial resolution pdhm i e the dhsvm model more specifically the behaviors of the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes were evaluated against analytical solutions for two synthetic overland flow cases with uniform rainfalls then the semi maccormack algorithm was implemented into dhsvm to improve the efficiency of routing its overland flow the performance and practicability of the enhanced dhsvm model dhsvm maccormack were examined by carrying out two groups of modeling experiments in a small urban watershed in washington 2 methods the method section is organized as follows sections 2 1 and 2 2 briefly introduce the kw model and the maccormack numerical scheme respectively section 2 3 describes the approach of implementing the maccormack scheme into dhsvm finally in section 2 4 the methods of evaluating the performances of the maccormack schemes are presented 2 1 kinematic wave the 1 dimensional 1d kw model for overland flow routing is defined by the following continuity and momentum equations continuity equation 1 q x a t q e where q is the discharge a is the cross sectional area of flow x is the downslope distance t is the time and qe is the rainfall excess rate per unit flow length momentum equation 2 s 0 s f in which so is the bed slope and sf is the friction slope the momentum equation can be expressed equivalently to the following relationship between q and a 3 a α q β by combining eq 2 with the manning s equation eq 3 can be derived as follows 4 a np 2 3 c n s f q 3 5 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient p is the wetted perimeter which can be considered equal to flow width for shallow water flow and cn equals to 1 for metric units and 1 49 for english units thus α np 2 3 c n s o 3 5 and β 3 5 differentiation of eq 3 with respect to t and substitution of this into eq 1 gives 5 q x α β q β 1 q t q e combining eq 5 with dq q x dx q t dt it can be easily obtained that 6 c k dq da dx dt 1 α β q β 1 where ck is the kw celerity 2 2 maccormack numerical scheme the maccormack scheme is a variation of the two step lax wendroff technique and belongs to the family of splitting methods it has a second order accuracy in time and space the maccormack scheme consists of two steps a predictor step followed by a corrector step maccormack 1982 maccormack 2003 the spatial derivatives are approximated by forward differences in the predictor step whereas they are approximated by backward differences in the corrector step the implicit maccormack scheme in delta form for approximating the kw equations is presented in eqs 7 and 8 7 preditor step δ a i n δ t δ x q i 1 n q i n q e δ t 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i n 1 2 δ a i n λ δ t δ x a i n 1 2

and n are the spatial and temporal indices respectively δt and δx are temporal and spatial steps respectively δa is the change in the cross sectional area of flow δa is the iteration variable and qe is the rainfall excess rate per unit flow length note that the predictor step is first evaluated based on a backward sweep from the lower boundary i e the greatest space index to the upper boundary i e the lowest space index and the corrector step is then implemented through a sweep in a forward direction furst and furmanek 2011 the method is unconditionally stable provided that the parameter λ is chosen so that 9 λ max c k δ x δ t 0 α mac α mac 0 5 in which αmac is a coefficient which mainly depends on the wave celerity and watershed characteristics huang and lee 2013 if δt already satisfies the stability condition of the explicit fd method i e c k δ x δ t the right hand side of the above inequality vanishes and λ can thus be chosen to be zero the implicit maccormack scheme reduces to the explicit one in this case 2 3 dhsvm maccormack dhsvm is a fully distributed physically based time continuous model predominantly designed for mountainous regions with complex terrain it can provide an integrated and dynamic representation of the spatial patterns of snow cover soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff at a spatial resolution represented by the digital elevation model dem wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm version 3 1 2 was selected as a representative pdhm in this study mainly because of the free availability of the source code as well as the test site data dhsvm divides a watershed into computational grid cells centered on dem nodes each of which is assigned with appropriate vegetation characteristic and soil properties using the grid cell as a basic unit dhsvm i estimates evapotranspiration using a two layer canopy model ii simulates snow accumulation and melt using a mass and energy balance model iii describes unsaturated moisture movement through multiple rooting zone soil layers using darcy s law iv routes lateral saturated subsurface flow through a cell by cell approach using either the kinematic or diffusion approximation v routes overland flow using either a cell by cell approach or the kw approach and vi simulates channel flow using a robust linear storage routing algorithm more details about the model are available in wigmosta et al 1994 storck et al 1998 and wigmosta and perkins 2001 dhsvm has been widely utilized in various research fields such as hydrological process simulation du et al 2007 cuo et al 2008 hydrological impact assessment thanapakpawin et al 2007 cuo et al 2009 dickerson lange and mitchell 2014 alvarenga et al 2016 and sediment erosion and transport modeling doten et al 2006 lanini et al 2009 in dhsvm overland flow is primarily generated through a saturation excess mechanism despite that a relatively crude infiltration excess parameterization has been included cuo et al 2008 the directions of overland flow are determined based on the dem using the four direction d4 algorithm which assigns flow from each grid cell to its four adjacent neighbors for example as illustrated in fig 1 the outflow from pixel 5 is subdivided into the downslope neighboring pixels in the eastern and southern directions i e cell 6 q51 and cell 8 q52 the proportion of outflow in each direction is assumed to be equal to the ratio of flow width in that direction to the total flow width essentially this is consistent with the digital elevation model networks demon model which describes two dimensional and aspect driven flow movements costa cabral and burges 1994 the d4 approach allows the inflows to a certain cell originated from multiple up gradient adjacent cells for instance the inflows to cell 5 include the outflows from upstream cells 2 q22 and 4 q41 the maccormack scheme uses forward finite differences for the spatial derivatives in the predictor step eq 7 when applying this scheme to the dem based overland flow routing system in dhsvm it means that the variable a i n 1 2 at the current grid i needs to be estimated using the iteration variables q i 1 n δ a i 1 n 1 2 at the downslope grid i 1 however the current grid may have multiple outflows to the downslope adjacent grid cells fig 1 and meanwhile the downslope grids may have multiple inflows coming from other upslope grid cells in this case the outflows at the downslope cells should be decomposed in order to predict the outflow of the current cell the decomposition however is a tough challenge in theory and practice this makes it difficult to couple the full implicit maccormack scheme into dhsvm for the overland flow routing nevertheless huang and lee 2013 modified the full implicit maccormack scheme to make it usable in the dem based overland flow routing system in which the flow directions are determined using the d8 algorithm the modified maccormack scheme in delta form for approximating the kw equations is as follows 10 δ a i n 1 δ t δ x q i n q i 1 n q e δ t 11 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i n 1 δ a i n 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i 1 n 1 12 a i n 1 a i n δ a i n 1 the predictor step presented in the full maccormack scheme eqs 7 and 8 has been removed in the modified maccormack scheme hence we name the modified version of the maccormack scheme as the semi maccormack the semi maccormack algorithm can be converted to the following recursive formulas in order to implement it into dhsvm 13 δ a i t δ t δ t δ x q i t q i 1 t q e δ t 14 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i t δ t δ a i t δ t λ δ t δ x a i 1 t δ t a i 1 t 15 a i t δ t a i t δ a i t δ t in which q i 1 t and a i 1 t are respectively the total inflow from the up gradient adjacent grids and the corresponding cross sectional area at current time t q i t and a i t are respectively the outflow and its cross sectional area at current grid cell i and time t δt and δx are the time step and the grid size respectively and δa is the change in cross sectional area of flow the boundary values for the grid cells on the upstream end are assigned as zero wang and hjelmfelt 1998 jain and singh 2005 i e q u t 0 and a u t 0 where q u t and a u t are the outflow and its cross sectional area respectively at the boundary grid cells indicated by subscript u fig 2 presents the flow chart for routing the overland flow using the semi maccormack scheme in dhsvm specifically the procedure consists of five main steps i read initial conditions at start time ii enter into the external time loop iii enter into the internal spatial loop iv solve the kw equations using the semi maccormack algorithm v advance to the next time step and repeat the steps outlined above until reaching the end time the enhanced dhsvm model is referred to as dhsvm maccormack 2 4 numerical experiments for the maccormack schemes 2 4 1 experiment setup for analytical evaluation of the maccormack schemes an important advantage of the kw approach over the dynamic and diffusion wave approaches is that analytical solutions are possible for simple geometries david and michael 1986 eagleson 1970 provided the analytical solution for the kw overland flow with uniform rainfall as shown in table 1 two impermeable rectangular parking lots with different geometries are assumed to be subject to uniform rainfall with different durations and intensities the hydrographs of flow depth at the end of the parking lots were calculated using the analytical approach the explicit linear scheme and the semi and full maccormack schemes respectively the explicit linear scheme adopted in dhsvm is a commonly used fd method for solving the kw equations details about the kw computations with the explicit linear scheme have been documented by chow et al 1988 capabilities of the numerical methods i e the semi and full maccormack algorithms and the explicit linear scheme were quantitatively assessed by using the performance indicators of the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae moreover the cpu time requirements of different numerical methods were compared with each other all of the computations were run with a lenovo notebook pc with an intel core i7 2620m cpu and 8 gb of ram in the first synthetic overland flow case the time increment δt varied from 4 to 39 s for the explicit linear scheme to satisfy the cfl stability condition and it was purposely set to 50 100 and 150 s for the maccormack schemes with which the stability condition is violated the spatial step δx was set to 1 m for all of the runs the coefficient αmac in eq 9 was calibrated to be 0 5 and 0 6 in the full and semi maccormack schemes respectively to obtain the best fit results comparing to the analytical solution in the second synthetic case the time step δt varied from 0 5 to 6 s for the explicit linear scheme to satisfy the cfl stability condition but it was increased to 10 20 and 50 s for the maccormack schemes for the cases against the stability condition likewise the spatial step δx was set to 1 m for all numerical methods as in case 1 the coefficient αmac in eq 9 was best fitted to be 0 6 and 0 8 in the full and semi maccormack schemes respectively 2 4 2 test sites and experiment setups for numerical evaluation of dhsvm maccormack the test data for dhsvm 3 1 2 which is freely available at the model s official website http dhsvm pnnl gov was used to test the performance of the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack the test site mercer creek watershed is a small urban watershed near bellevue washington fig 3 the mercer creek flows through mercer slough and finally ends in lake washington sun et al 2015 the watershed has a drainage area of approximately 31 km2 and is characterized by rugged topography with elevations ranging from 16 to 326 m above sea level the primary land use types in the watershed are urban land and conifer forest and the predominant soil type is sandy loam soil the 3 hourly meteorological forcing data including air temperature wind speed relatively humidity precipitation and incoming shortwave and longwave radiations at two pseudo stations are available for the test watershed they were obtained from a hydrologically consistent dataset of land surface fluxes and states for the conterminous united states that was developed by livneh et al 2013 based on the observations from noaa cooperative observer coop stations the streamflow from the mercer creek has been monitored by us geological survey station no 12120000 47 36 11 n 122 10 47 w the streamflow records at a 15 min interval for the period from 01 01 2012 00 to 03 31 2012 21 were used for model performance assessment as presented in table 2 two groups of modeling experiments were designed and carried out to assess the performance and efficiency of dhsvm maccormack the modeling in the first experiment group exp i was performed using the original dhsvm model version 3 1 2 in which the kw equations are solved with the explicit linear scheme for overland flow routing the routing time increments δt are variable and updated at the beginning of each model time step to ensure they comply with the cfl stability condition at each computational grid chow et al 1988 in exp i we set the routing option to kinematic and the grid size to 30 m and assigned start and end times as 01 01 2012 00 and 03 31 2012 21 respectively the other parameters and options were kept with the default values the simulated streamflow was quantitatively evaluated against the measurements using the i nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and ii rmse the second experiment group exp ii was undertaken with dhsvm maccormack in which the kw equations are solved with the semi maccormack scheme the routing time step was set to 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 and 600 s for the purpose of testing the performance of the maccormack algorithm thus dhsvm maccormack was run 11 times in exp ii with the same model parameters and configurations as in exp i in addition to nse and rmse the relative nse and relative rmse as defined in eqs 16 and 17 were used to evaluate the simulations of exp ii against those of exp i moreover the relative cpu time as in eq 18 was defined to evaluate the computational efficiency of dhsvm maccormack in comparison to the original dhsvm model 16 relative nse 1 i 1 n q i dhsvm 3 1 2 q i dhsvm maccormack 2 i 1 n q i dhsvm3 1

the simulation period qi is the simulated streamflow at the time step i and qm is the mean value of the simulated streamflow the test site mercer creek mc watershed is relatively small to assess impacts of watershed sizes on the computational time with the maccormack scheme dhsvm maccormack is also applied to a large watershed this larger watershed is the upper heihe river basin uhrb with a drainage area of about 100 09 km2 as shown in table 3 in northwest china more details about this watershed are available in zhang et al 2016 the grid size routing time step and simulation length were consistently set as 150 m 600 s and 3 months respectively for both the small and large watersheds the computational environment and model settings were kept the same for the different cases as listed in table 3 moreover impacts of different modeling grid sizes e g 30 45 60 90 and 150 m on the computational time with the original and enhanced dhsvm i e dhsvm maccormack models were investigated using the mercer creek watershed 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical verification fig 4 presents the numerical results and analytical solution for the first synthetic overland flow case table 1 the flow depth time series produced by the maccormack and explicit linear schemes match the analytical solution very well although there are some small differences at the crest this indicates that both the full maccormack and semi maccormack algorithms can work very well and are comparable to the explicit linear scheme in terms of simulation accuracy even when the time step does not satisfy the stability condition thus the maccormack approaches can relax the restriction on temporal and spatial intervals imposed by the cfl stability condition when the time step is 150 s the computational time of the full and semi maccormack schemes was 0 006 and 0 003 s respectively which is about 7 15 times faster than that of the explicit linear scheme 0 046 s therefore the maccormack schemes can save the computational time considerably compared to the explicit linear method the rmses and maes are very small for all of the numerical methods as indicated and summarized in table 4 which confirms their reliability for solving the kw equations the accuracy tends to decrease with increasing time steps for both the full and semi maccormack schemes moreover with the same time step the full maccormack scheme performs slightly better than the semi maccormack scheme particularly for the recession limb of the hydrograph this is reasonable since the predictor step of the full maccormack scheme has been removed in the semi maccormack scheme fig 5 shows the results of case 2 the full maccormack scheme induces some small oscillations before reaching the equilibrium while the semi maccormack scheme is lagged to reach the maximum flow depth despite of these discrepancies the time series obtained by both maccormack schemes are very close to the analytical solution as well as to that simulated by the explicit linear scheme as shown in table 4 all of the numerical approaches can produce good overland flow simulations for case 2 with very small rmses and maes similar to case 1 the full maccormack scheme slightly outperforms the semi maccormack method when the same time step is employed although it requires slightly more computational time results in fig 5 clearly demonstrate that both the full and semi maccormack schemes are more computationally efficient than the explicit linear scheme while achieving a similar accuracy 3 2 evaluation of dhsvm maccormack fig 6 presents daily and sub daily 3 hourly streamflow observations and the simulations obtained from the two groups of modeling experiments i e exps i and ii at the outlet of the mercer creek watershed for the period from january 1 2012 to march 31 2012 in exp i the original dhsvm model simulates a streamflow hydrograph that exhibits a reasonably good match with the observed one the corresponding nse and rmse are 0 79 and 0 36 m3 s respectively for daily streamflow and 0 62 and 0 58 m3 s respectively for sub daily streamflow table 5 the results indicate a good applicability of the original dhsvm model to the mercer creek watershed according to the model evaluation guidelines proposed by moriasi et al 2007 however it takes quite a large cpu time of about one day and a half 35 50 h to complete exp i due to the low computational efficiency of routing the overland flow the considerable computational time requirement by the explicit linear scheme in the original dhsvm model significantly restricts the practicality of dhsvm s applications with the kw option for the overland flow routing the computational cost will become much worse when a longer term higher resolution hydrological simulation is needed for a larger watershed simulated streamflow hydrographs from exp ii with the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack produce almost exactly the same results as those from exp i i e results overlapped to each other when the routing time step δt is less than 300 s fig 6 only very small differences between exps i and ii can be discerned when δt is increased to 300 and 600 s as shown in table 5 the nses and rmses of daily streamflow vary from 0 78 to 0 79 and from 0 358 to 0 364 m3 s respectively with different routing time steps in exp ii which are comparable to those of exp i 0 79 and 0 36 m3 s using results from exp i as the baseline the relative nses and relative rmses span from 0 983 to 0 998 and from 0 04 to 0 09 respectively for daily streamflow and 0 984 0 997 and 0 04 0 10 respectively for the sub daily streamflow such high relative nses together with the low relative rmses clearly indicate the comparable performance between the explicit linear scheme with dhsvm and the semi maccormack scheme with dhsvm maccormack the narrow spans of the nses and rmses in exp ii show that the semi maccormack scheme still has space to further reduce the computation time without much compromise of the accuracy by using a larger time step specifically the required cpu time which decreases with increasing time intervals is observed to be in the range of 0 20 3 37 h in exp ii in stark contrast to 35 50 h in exp i the relative cpu time of exp ii ranges from 0 0949 to 0 0056 which is remarkably shorter than 1 0 from exp i these results again indicate that dhsvm maccormack can significantly improve the computational efficiency while obtaining almost the same simulation accuracy as that from the original dhsvm model in our experiment the computational time of the original dhsvm model is about one day and a half 35 50 h for a simulation period of three months however it can be cut down to several dozen minutes by using dhsvm maccormack instead without losing noticeable simulation accuracy from table 5 it is seen that the streamflow simulation accuracy in exp ii tends to improve slightly when the routing time steps become larger 30 300 s this seems inconsistent with the finding of the analytical verification i e the accuracy decreases as the time step increases the seeming contradiction can be well explained by the differences between the observed and simulated streamflow based on the model default parameters the streamflow was actually slightly overestimated for the baseflow thus the error introduced by the increase of computational time compensates the one caused by the model default parameters more specifically the overestimation of streamflow would be ameliorated with increasing routing time steps in the semi maccormack scheme since the overland flow tends to be underestimated gradually as revealed in the analytical verification as a result the streamflow simulation accuracy gets improved before reaching a turning point which is observed when the routing time step reaches 600 s from that point the underestimated volume of overland flow resulting from the coarsening routing time step begins to exceed the overestimated volume of streamflow impacts of watershed sizes on the computational time using the maccormack scheme are investigated by applying dhsvm maccormack to a much larger watershed the uhrb in china with the same model setup as listed in table 3 simulation results show that the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack were 0 01 h and 3 35 h respectively in modeling the mercer creek watershed and the uhrb in contrast it took the original dhsvm model 0 03 h and over two weeks respectively for these two watersheds although the required computational time for either dhsvm or dhsvm maccormack appear to be proportional to the watershed size the advantage of the maccormack scheme on the reduction of computational time is more significant with the larger watershed i e heihe watershed in particular the computation time required by the original dhsvm model increased by more than 11 200 fold when the watershed size is increased only by about 322 times but for the dhsvm maccormack model the increase in the computation time is only about 335 times such results indicate that the improvement on the computational efficiency of overland flow for the maccormack routing scheme is significantly more when the maccormack scheme is applied to a larger watershed with a constant grid size to assess impacts of different modeling grid sizes on the computation time we have carried out a series of different simulations with grid sizes being at 30 45 60 90 and 150 m respectively using both the original and enhanced dhsvm models with the mercer creek watershed in these simulations the computational environment and model settings were kept the same except for the modeling grid sizes fig 7 shows that the computational time required by the original dhsvm model decreases from 35 5 to 0 03 h when the grid size increases from 30 to 150 m whereas the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack reduces from 0 2 to 0 01 h this clearly demonstrates that the computational time with the maccormack scheme decreases when the grid size increases for a given watershed the reduction is more obvious for the original dhsvm model than for dhsvm maccormack as expected since the latter is already very effective when the modeling grid size is small for a given large watershed these results illustrate that the computational time of the maccormack scheme depend on the size of both the watershed and the modeling grid cell for applications to larger watersheds the demand for computational time can be compensated by increasing grid sizes thus selecting an appropriate grid cell size that is as large as possible while satisfying the accuracy requirement is the key to reduce computational time when applying the maccormack scheme to a large watershed from a practice point of view one can also use the maccormack scheme in conjunction with hpc or parallel and distributed computations li et al 2011 vivoni et al 2011 for conducting the routing for a very large river basin in this study only the semi maccormack scheme was implemented in dhsvm for the overland flow routing the full version of the maccormack scheme full maccormack however proved to outperform the semi maccormack in terms of simulation accuracy although the latter is slightly more computationally efficient as presented in section 3 1 thus in a follow up study we expect to apply the full maccormack scheme to overland flow routing in pdhms despite of the aforementioned theoretical and practical challenges in version of 3 1 2 flow paths are determined by the d4 algorithm which complicates the integration of the full maccormack algorithm into dhsvm because each computational grid may have multiple inflows and outflows however the coupling of the full maccormack scheme for watershed routing may become more plausible for other phdms with the d8 algorithm determining their flow directions since each computational grid has only one outflow in spite of possible multiple inflows 4 conclusions this study applied for the first time the maccormack numerical scheme to overland flow routing in dhsvm a representative high spatial resolution process based distributed hydrological model the maccormack scheme proved to be applicable and efficient when coupled with dhsvm after verifying against the analytical solutions for two synthetic overland flow cases with uniform rainfall the semi maccormack algorithm was implemented into dhsvm to solve the kinematic equations for overland flow routing the performance and practicability of the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack were assessed by performing two groups of modeling experiments i e exp i and exp ii over the mercer creek watershed the analytical verification indicated that both the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes i e semi maccormack and full maccormack exhibit robust numerical stability even with large time steps that violate the cfl stability condition they were demonstrated to be significantly more computationally efficient than the explicit linear scheme additionally despite more time consuming when the same time step is employed the full maccormack scheme slightly outperformed the semi version in terms of simulation precision especially for the falling limb of the hydrographs the two groups of the modeling experiments in the mercer creek watershed show that dhsvm maccormack can considerably improve the computational efficiency while preserving the same simulation accuracy of the original dhsvm model with the same computational environment and model settings dhsvm maccormack can reduce the cpu time from about one day and a half required by the original dhsvm model to several dozen minutes for a simulation period of three months january 1 2012 to march 31 2012 without any noticeable sacrifice of the accuracy in addition our results show that the reduction of computational time is significantly more with the larger watershed i e heihe watershed vs mercer creek watershed using dhsvm maccormack than dhsvm although the required computational time for both dhsvm and dhsvm maccormack appear to be proportional to the watershed size furthermore our results show that the computational efficiency of applying the maccormack scheme depends both on the sizes of the watershed and the grid cell thus selecting an appropriate grid cell size that is as large as possible while satisfying the accuracy requirement can be a key to have a maximum reduction of the computational time the maccormack scheme shows promise for applications to watershed routing in high spatial resolution pdhms in light of its outstanding computational efficiency future work will focus on implementing the full maccormack scheme to pdhms with the d8 algorithm determining their

7461,although process based distributed hydrological models pdhms are evolving rapidly over the last few decades their extensive applications are still challenged by the computational expenses this study attempted for the first time to apply the numerically efficient maccormack algorithm to overland flow routing in a representative high spatial resolution pdhm i e the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm in order to improve its computational efficiency the analytical verification indicates that both the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes exhibit robust numerical stability and are more computationally efficient than the conventional explicit linear scheme the full version outperforms the semi version in terms of simulation accuracy when a same time step is adopted the semi maccormack scheme was implemented into dhsvm version 3 1 2 to solve the kinematic wave equations for overland flow routing the performance and practicality of the enhanced dhsvm maccormack model was assessed by performing two groups of modeling experiments in the mercer creek watershed a small urban catchment near bellevue washington the experiments show that dhsvm maccormack can considerably improve the computational efficiency without compromising the simulation accuracy of the original dhsvm model more specifically with the same computational environment and model settings the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack can be reduced to several dozen minutes for a simulation period of three months in contrast with one day and a half by the original dhsvm model without noticeable sacrifice of the accuracy the maccormack scheme proves to be applicable to overland flow routing in dhsvm which implies that it can be coupled into other phdms for watershed routing to either significantly improve their computational efficiency or to make the kinematic wave routing for high resolution modeling computational feasible keywords maccormack scheme overland flow routing dhsvm kinematic wave computational efficiency 1 introduction overland flow is one of the major components of the hydrological cycle and has the most intimate interactions with human beings because of their coexistence in space and time wong 2011 it is normally unsteady and non uniform and therefore can be described by the st venant equations owing to the highly nonlinear nature of these equations which involve a high degree of complexity in their computation various approximations of the st venant equations have been proposed for solving overland flow problems the kinematic wave kw model which was first developed by lighthill and whitham 1955 is one of such approximations and proves to be adequate for most practical overland flow situations akan and houghtalen 2003 the major assumption of the kw model is that the acceleration and pressure terms in the momentum equation are insignificant and consequently the friction slope is equal to the terrain slope miller 1984 the kw model is essentially a set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations for which analytical solutions cannot be obtained except for a few idealized conditions the finite difference fd numerical methods which are generally classified into explicit and implicit schemes are therefore frequently used to solve the kw equations both the explicit and implicit fd methods have comparative strengths and weaknesses the explicit fd schemes are easy to formulate and program but are subjected to a necessary and insufficient condition for stability known as the courant friedrichs lewy stability cfl condition chow et al 1988 the cfl condition imposes a restriction on the workable time steps which limits the computational efficiency and the practical applications of the explicit fd method the implicit fd schemes on the other hand are unconditionally stable but suffer from i high computational complexity due to the matrix operations ii large memory demand and iii deficiency in their applications to nonlinear problems kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2005 huang and lee 2013 process based distributed hydrological models pdhms are evolving rapidly over the last few decades paniconi and putti 2015 this is partly spurred by the tremendous advances in computing power programming techniques and data availability and partly by the increasing demands for spatially distributed hydrological simulations impact assessments and interdisciplinary studies beven 2011 fenicia et al 2016 nevertheless the extensive applications of pdhms are still challenged by their computational burden since pdhms are mostly associated with solving nonlinear partial differential equations over large domains at fine spatiotemporal resolutions fatichi et al 2016 in pdhms such as the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang 1998 and the water flow and balance simulation model wasim schulla and jasper 2007 the routing of overland flow is usually described by the kw equations owing to its simplicity and satisfactory accuracy compared to the st venant equations jain and singh 2005 tsai and yang 2005 yu and duan 2014 however the computational efficiency of these models would be strictly constrained in case of using the conventional explicit fd schemes to solve the kw equations because it usually requires very small time increments to comply with the cfl condition for example dhsvm routes the kw overland flow with the explicit linear scheme we have tested it using the model s test site data which corresponds to a small urban watershed 31 km2 at a spatial resolution of 30 m and found that it needs almost 186 h to complete a 2 25 years simulation the test was carried out on a lenovo notebook pc with an intel core i7 2620 m cpu and 8 gb of ram considering the complexity of the real world and the strong spatial heterogeneity of land surface characteristics more attention is increasingly paid to high spatial resolution pdhms for a refined representation of hydrological processes ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 the computational efficiency of pdhms is even worse when they are applied to a large study domain with a high spatial resolution since smaller spatial steps require much smaller time steps to achieve a stable solution to the kw equations with an explicit fd scheme thus it is of great significance and practical importance to propose more efficient numerical methods to solve the kw equations for overland flow routing to reduce the computational cost the maccormack fd method which was initially proposed to solve the time dependent compressive navier stokes equations is a popular and widely used numerical algorithm in computational hydraulics maccormack 2003 tseng 2010 recently some researchers have successfully applied the maccormack algorithm to kw overland flow problems kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2005 investigated the reliability of the explicit maccormack scheme and compared it to the available analytical solutions and to a 4 point implicit fd method they concluded that the maccormack algorithm is computationally more efficient than the 4 point implicit method although they are comparable in accuracy tseng 2010 applied the unconditionally stable implicit maccormack scheme to solve the kw problem and demonstrated that it is a simple accurate highly stable and efficient solver huang and lee 2013 reformulated the implicit maccormack scheme and then applied it to two mountainous watersheds for 2 dimensional 2d runoff simulations they reported that the proposed method was significantly superior to the conventional algorithm in terms of computational efficiency these previous studies consistently revealed the clear advantage of the maccormack scheme over the other conventional numerical methods for solving the kw equations none of them however have tested the applicability and advantage of the maccormack scheme with a pdhm this study therefore applied the maccormack scheme to the kw overland flow routing in a representative high spatial resolution pdhm i e the dhsvm model more specifically the behaviors of the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes were evaluated against analytical solutions for two synthetic overland flow cases with uniform rainfalls then the semi maccormack algorithm was implemented into dhsvm to improve the efficiency of routing its overland flow the performance and practicability of the enhanced dhsvm model dhsvm maccormack were examined by carrying out two groups of modeling experiments in a small urban watershed in washington 2 methods the method section is organized as follows sections 2 1 and 2 2 briefly introduce the kw model and the maccormack numerical scheme respectively section 2 3 describes the approach of implementing the maccormack scheme into dhsvm finally in section 2 4 the methods of evaluating the performances of the maccormack schemes are presented 2 1 kinematic wave the 1 dimensional 1d kw model for overland flow routing is defined by the following continuity and momentum equations continuity equation 1 q x a t q e where q is the discharge a is the cross sectional area of flow x is the downslope distance t is the time and qe is the rainfall excess rate per unit flow length momentum equation 2 s 0 s f in which so is the bed slope and sf is the friction slope the momentum equation can be expressed equivalently to the following relationship between q and a 3 a α q β by combining eq 2 with the manning s equation eq 3 can be derived as follows 4 a np 2 3 c n s f q 3 5 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient p is the wetted perimeter which can be considered equal to flow width for shallow water flow and cn equals to 1 for metric units and 1 49 for english units thus α np 2 3 c n s o 3 5 and β 3 5 differentiation of eq 3 with respect to t and substitution of this into eq 1 gives 5 q x α β q β 1 q t q e combining eq 5 with dq q x dx q t dt it can be easily obtained that 6 c k dq da dx dt 1 α β q β 1 where ck is the kw celerity 2 2 maccormack numerical scheme the maccormack scheme is a variation of the two step lax wendroff technique and belongs to the family of splitting methods it has a second order accuracy in time and space the maccormack scheme consists of two steps a predictor step followed by a corrector step maccormack 1982 maccormack 2003 the spatial derivatives are approximated by forward differences in the predictor step whereas they are approximated by backward differences in the corrector step the implicit maccormack scheme in delta form for approximating the kw equations is presented in eqs 7 and 8 7 preditor step δ a i n δ t δ x q i 1 n q i n q e δ t 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i n 1 2 δ a i n λ δ t δ x a i n 1 2

and n are the spatial and temporal indices respectively δt and δx are temporal and spatial steps respectively δa is the change in the cross sectional area of flow δa is the iteration variable and qe is the rainfall excess rate per unit flow length note that the predictor step is first evaluated based on a backward sweep from the lower boundary i e the greatest space index to the upper boundary i e the lowest space index and the corrector step is then implemented through a sweep in a forward direction furst and furmanek 2011 the method is unconditionally stable provided that the parameter λ is chosen so that 9 λ max c k δ x δ t 0 α mac α mac 0 5 in which αmac is a coefficient which mainly depends on the wave celerity and watershed characteristics huang and lee 2013 if δt already satisfies the stability condition of the explicit fd method i e c k δ x δ t the right hand side of the above inequality vanishes and λ can thus be chosen to be zero the implicit maccormack scheme reduces to the explicit one in this case 2 3 dhsvm maccormack dhsvm is a fully distributed physically based time continuous model predominantly designed for mountainous regions with complex terrain it can provide an integrated and dynamic representation of the spatial patterns of snow cover soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff at a spatial resolution represented by the digital elevation model dem wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm version 3 1 2 was selected as a representative pdhm in this study mainly because of the free availability of the source code as well as the test site data dhsvm divides a watershed into computational grid cells centered on dem nodes each of which is assigned with appropriate vegetation characteristic and soil properties using the grid cell as a basic unit dhsvm i estimates evapotranspiration using a two layer canopy model ii simulates snow accumulation and melt using a mass and energy balance model iii describes unsaturated moisture movement through multiple rooting zone soil layers using darcy s law iv routes lateral saturated subsurface flow through a cell by cell approach using either the kinematic or diffusion approximation v routes overland flow using either a cell by cell approach or the kw approach and vi simulates channel flow using a robust linear storage routing algorithm more details about the model are available in wigmosta et al 1994 storck et al 1998 and wigmosta and perkins 2001 dhsvm has been widely utilized in various research fields such as hydrological process simulation du et al 2007 cuo et al 2008 hydrological impact assessment thanapakpawin et al 2007 cuo et al 2009 dickerson lange and mitchell 2014 alvarenga et al 2016 and sediment erosion and transport modeling doten et al 2006 lanini et al 2009 in dhsvm overland flow is primarily generated through a saturation excess mechanism despite that a relatively crude infiltration excess parameterization has been included cuo et al 2008 the directions of overland flow are determined based on the dem using the four direction d4 algorithm which assigns flow from each grid cell to its four adjacent neighbors for example as illustrated in fig 1 the outflow from pixel 5 is subdivided into the downslope neighboring pixels in the eastern and southern directions i e cell 6 q51 and cell 8 q52 the proportion of outflow in each direction is assumed to be equal to the ratio of flow width in that direction to the total flow width essentially this is consistent with the digital elevation model networks demon model which describes two dimensional and aspect driven flow movements costa cabral and burges 1994 the d4 approach allows the inflows to a certain cell originated from multiple up gradient adjacent cells for instance the inflows to cell 5 include the outflows from upstream cells 2 q22 and 4 q41 the maccormack scheme uses forward finite differences for the spatial derivatives in the predictor step eq 7 when applying this scheme to the dem based overland flow routing system in dhsvm it means that the variable a i n 1 2 at the current grid i needs to be estimated using the iteration variables q i 1 n δ a i 1 n 1 2 at the downslope grid i 1 however the current grid may have multiple outflows to the downslope adjacent grid cells fig 1 and meanwhile the downslope grids may have multiple inflows coming from other upslope grid cells in this case the outflows at the downslope cells should be decomposed in order to predict the outflow of the current cell the decomposition however is a tough challenge in theory and practice this makes it difficult to couple the full implicit maccormack scheme into dhsvm for the overland flow routing nevertheless huang and lee 2013 modified the full implicit maccormack scheme to make it usable in the dem based overland flow routing system in which the flow directions are determined using the d8 algorithm the modified maccormack scheme in delta form for approximating the kw equations is as follows 10 δ a i n 1 δ t δ x q i n q i 1 n q e δ t 11 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i n 1 δ a i n 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i 1 n 1 12 a i n 1 a i n δ a i n 1 the predictor step presented in the full maccormack scheme eqs 7 and 8 has been removed in the modified maccormack scheme hence we name the modified version of the maccormack scheme as the semi maccormack the semi maccormack algorithm can be converted to the following recursive formulas in order to implement it into dhsvm 13 δ a i t δ t δ t δ x q i t q i 1 t q e δ t 14 1 λ δ t δ x δ a i t δ t δ a i t δ t λ δ t δ x a i 1 t δ t a i 1 t 15 a i t δ t a i t δ a i t δ t in which q i 1 t and a i 1 t are respectively the total inflow from the up gradient adjacent grids and the corresponding cross sectional area at current time t q i t and a i t are respectively the outflow and its cross sectional area at current grid cell i and time t δt and δx are the time step and the grid size respectively and δa is the change in cross sectional area of flow the boundary values for the grid cells on the upstream end are assigned as zero wang and hjelmfelt 1998 jain and singh 2005 i e q u t 0 and a u t 0 where q u t and a u t are the outflow and its cross sectional area respectively at the boundary grid cells indicated by subscript u fig 2 presents the flow chart for routing the overland flow using the semi maccormack scheme in dhsvm specifically the procedure consists of five main steps i read initial conditions at start time ii enter into the external time loop iii enter into the internal spatial loop iv solve the kw equations using the semi maccormack algorithm v advance to the next time step and repeat the steps outlined above until reaching the end time the enhanced dhsvm model is referred to as dhsvm maccormack 2 4 numerical experiments for the maccormack schemes 2 4 1 experiment setup for analytical evaluation of the maccormack schemes an important advantage of the kw approach over the dynamic and diffusion wave approaches is that analytical solutions are possible for simple geometries david and michael 1986 eagleson 1970 provided the analytical solution for the kw overland flow with uniform rainfall as shown in table 1 two impermeable rectangular parking lots with different geometries are assumed to be subject to uniform rainfall with different durations and intensities the hydrographs of flow depth at the end of the parking lots were calculated using the analytical approach the explicit linear scheme and the semi and full maccormack schemes respectively the explicit linear scheme adopted in dhsvm is a commonly used fd method for solving the kw equations details about the kw computations with the explicit linear scheme have been documented by chow et al 1988 capabilities of the numerical methods i e the semi and full maccormack algorithms and the explicit linear scheme were quantitatively assessed by using the performance indicators of the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae moreover the cpu time requirements of different numerical methods were compared with each other all of the computations were run with a lenovo notebook pc with an intel core i7 2620m cpu and 8 gb of ram in the first synthetic overland flow case the time increment δt varied from 4 to 39 s for the explicit linear scheme to satisfy the cfl stability condition and it was purposely set to 50 100 and 150 s for the maccormack schemes with which the stability condition is violated the spatial step δx was set to 1 m for all of the runs the coefficient αmac in eq 9 was calibrated to be 0 5 and 0 6 in the full and semi maccormack schemes respectively to obtain the best fit results comparing to the analytical solution in the second synthetic case the time step δt varied from 0 5 to 6 s for the explicit linear scheme to satisfy the cfl stability condition but it was increased to 10 20 and 50 s for the maccormack schemes for the cases against the stability condition likewise the spatial step δx was set to 1 m for all numerical methods as in case 1 the coefficient αmac in eq 9 was best fitted to be 0 6 and 0 8 in the full and semi maccormack schemes respectively 2 4 2 test sites and experiment setups for numerical evaluation of dhsvm maccormack the test data for dhsvm 3 1 2 which is freely available at the model s official website http dhsvm pnnl gov was used to test the performance of the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack the test site mercer creek watershed is a small urban watershed near bellevue washington fig 3 the mercer creek flows through mercer slough and finally ends in lake washington sun et al 2015 the watershed has a drainage area of approximately 31 km2 and is characterized by rugged topography with elevations ranging from 16 to 326 m above sea level the primary land use types in the watershed are urban land and conifer forest and the predominant soil type is sandy loam soil the 3 hourly meteorological forcing data including air temperature wind speed relatively humidity precipitation and incoming shortwave and longwave radiations at two pseudo stations are available for the test watershed they were obtained from a hydrologically consistent dataset of land surface fluxes and states for the conterminous united states that was developed by livneh et al 2013 based on the observations from noaa cooperative observer coop stations the streamflow from the mercer creek has been monitored by us geological survey station no 12120000 47 36 11 n 122 10 47 w the streamflow records at a 15 min interval for the period from 01 01 2012 00 to 03 31 2012 21 were used for model performance assessment as presented in table 2 two groups of modeling experiments were designed and carried out to assess the performance and efficiency of dhsvm maccormack the modeling in the first experiment group exp i was performed using the original dhsvm model version 3 1 2 in which the kw equations are solved with the explicit linear scheme for overland flow routing the routing time increments δt are variable and updated at the beginning of each model time step to ensure they comply with the cfl stability condition at each computational grid chow et al 1988 in exp i we set the routing option to kinematic and the grid size to 30 m and assigned start and end times as 01 01 2012 00 and 03 31 2012 21 respectively the other parameters and options were kept with the default values the simulated streamflow was quantitatively evaluated against the measurements using the i nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and ii rmse the second experiment group exp ii was undertaken with dhsvm maccormack in which the kw equations are solved with the semi maccormack scheme the routing time step was set to 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 and 600 s for the purpose of testing the performance of the maccormack algorithm thus dhsvm maccormack was run 11 times in exp ii with the same model parameters and configurations as in exp i in addition to nse and rmse the relative nse and relative rmse as defined in eqs 16 and 17 were used to evaluate the simulations of exp ii against those of exp i moreover the relative cpu time as in eq 18 was defined to evaluate the computational efficiency of dhsvm maccormack in comparison to the original dhsvm model 16 relative nse 1 i 1 n q i dhsvm 3 1 2 q i dhsvm maccormack 2 i 1 n q i dhsvm3 1

the simulation period qi is the simulated streamflow at the time step i and qm is the mean value of the simulated streamflow the test site mercer creek mc watershed is relatively small to assess impacts of watershed sizes on the computational time with the maccormack scheme dhsvm maccormack is also applied to a large watershed this larger watershed is the upper heihe river basin uhrb with a drainage area of about 100 09 km2 as shown in table 3 in northwest china more details about this watershed are available in zhang et al 2016 the grid size routing time step and simulation length were consistently set as 150 m 600 s and 3 months respectively for both the small and large watersheds the computational environment and model settings were kept the same for the different cases as listed in table 3 moreover impacts of different modeling grid sizes e g 30 45 60 90 and 150 m on the computational time with the original and enhanced dhsvm i e dhsvm maccormack models were investigated using the mercer creek watershed 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical verification fig 4 presents the numerical results and analytical solution for the first synthetic overland flow case table 1 the flow depth time series produced by the maccormack and explicit linear schemes match the analytical solution very well although there are some small differences at the crest this indicates that both the full maccormack and semi maccormack algorithms can work very well and are comparable to the explicit linear scheme in terms of simulation accuracy even when the time step does not satisfy the stability condition thus the maccormack approaches can relax the restriction on temporal and spatial intervals imposed by the cfl stability condition when the time step is 150 s the computational time of the full and semi maccormack schemes was 0 006 and 0 003 s respectively which is about 7 15 times faster than that of the explicit linear scheme 0 046 s therefore the maccormack schemes can save the computational time considerably compared to the explicit linear method the rmses and maes are very small for all of the numerical methods as indicated and summarized in table 4 which confirms their reliability for solving the kw equations the accuracy tends to decrease with increasing time steps for both the full and semi maccormack schemes moreover with the same time step the full maccormack scheme performs slightly better than the semi maccormack scheme particularly for the recession limb of the hydrograph this is reasonable since the predictor step of the full maccormack scheme has been removed in the semi maccormack scheme fig 5 shows the results of case 2 the full maccormack scheme induces some small oscillations before reaching the equilibrium while the semi maccormack scheme is lagged to reach the maximum flow depth despite of these discrepancies the time series obtained by both maccormack schemes are very close to the analytical solution as well as to that simulated by the explicit linear scheme as shown in table 4 all of the numerical approaches can produce good overland flow simulations for case 2 with very small rmses and maes similar to case 1 the full maccormack scheme slightly outperforms the semi maccormack method when the same time step is employed although it requires slightly more computational time results in fig 5 clearly demonstrate that both the full and semi maccormack schemes are more computationally efficient than the explicit linear scheme while achieving a similar accuracy 3 2 evaluation of dhsvm maccormack fig 6 presents daily and sub daily 3 hourly streamflow observations and the simulations obtained from the two groups of modeling experiments i e exps i and ii at the outlet of the mercer creek watershed for the period from january 1 2012 to march 31 2012 in exp i the original dhsvm model simulates a streamflow hydrograph that exhibits a reasonably good match with the observed one the corresponding nse and rmse are 0 79 and 0 36 m3 s respectively for daily streamflow and 0 62 and 0 58 m3 s respectively for sub daily streamflow table 5 the results indicate a good applicability of the original dhsvm model to the mercer creek watershed according to the model evaluation guidelines proposed by moriasi et al 2007 however it takes quite a large cpu time of about one day and a half 35 50 h to complete exp i due to the low computational efficiency of routing the overland flow the considerable computational time requirement by the explicit linear scheme in the original dhsvm model significantly restricts the practicality of dhsvm s applications with the kw option for the overland flow routing the computational cost will become much worse when a longer term higher resolution hydrological simulation is needed for a larger watershed simulated streamflow hydrographs from exp ii with the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack produce almost exactly the same results as those from exp i i e results overlapped to each other when the routing time step δt is less than 300 s fig 6 only very small differences between exps i and ii can be discerned when δt is increased to 300 and 600 s as shown in table 5 the nses and rmses of daily streamflow vary from 0 78 to 0 79 and from 0 358 to 0 364 m3 s respectively with different routing time steps in exp ii which are comparable to those of exp i 0 79 and 0 36 m3 s using results from exp i as the baseline the relative nses and relative rmses span from 0 983 to 0 998 and from 0 04 to 0 09 respectively for daily streamflow and 0 984 0 997 and 0 04 0 10 respectively for the sub daily streamflow such high relative nses together with the low relative rmses clearly indicate the comparable performance between the explicit linear scheme with dhsvm and the semi maccormack scheme with dhsvm maccormack the narrow spans of the nses and rmses in exp ii show that the semi maccormack scheme still has space to further reduce the computation time without much compromise of the accuracy by using a larger time step specifically the required cpu time which decreases with increasing time intervals is observed to be in the range of 0 20 3 37 h in exp ii in stark contrast to 35 50 h in exp i the relative cpu time of exp ii ranges from 0 0949 to 0 0056 which is remarkably shorter than 1 0 from exp i these results again indicate that dhsvm maccormack can significantly improve the computational efficiency while obtaining almost the same simulation accuracy as that from the original dhsvm model in our experiment the computational time of the original dhsvm model is about one day and a half 35 50 h for a simulation period of three months however it can be cut down to several dozen minutes by using dhsvm maccormack instead without losing noticeable simulation accuracy from table 5 it is seen that the streamflow simulation accuracy in exp ii tends to improve slightly when the routing time steps become larger 30 300 s this seems inconsistent with the finding of the analytical verification i e the accuracy decreases as the time step increases the seeming contradiction can be well explained by the differences between the observed and simulated streamflow based on the model default parameters the streamflow was actually slightly overestimated for the baseflow thus the error introduced by the increase of computational time compensates the one caused by the model default parameters more specifically the overestimation of streamflow would be ameliorated with increasing routing time steps in the semi maccormack scheme since the overland flow tends to be underestimated gradually as revealed in the analytical verification as a result the streamflow simulation accuracy gets improved before reaching a turning point which is observed when the routing time step reaches 600 s from that point the underestimated volume of overland flow resulting from the coarsening routing time step begins to exceed the overestimated volume of streamflow impacts of watershed sizes on the computational time using the maccormack scheme are investigated by applying dhsvm maccormack to a much larger watershed the uhrb in china with the same model setup as listed in table 3 simulation results show that the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack were 0 01 h and 3 35 h respectively in modeling the mercer creek watershed and the uhrb in contrast it took the original dhsvm model 0 03 h and over two weeks respectively for these two watersheds although the required computational time for either dhsvm or dhsvm maccormack appear to be proportional to the watershed size the advantage of the maccormack scheme on the reduction of computational time is more significant with the larger watershed i e heihe watershed in particular the computation time required by the original dhsvm model increased by more than 11 200 fold when the watershed size is increased only by about 322 times but for the dhsvm maccormack model the increase in the computation time is only about 335 times such results indicate that the improvement on the computational efficiency of overland flow for the maccormack routing scheme is significantly more when the maccormack scheme is applied to a larger watershed with a constant grid size to assess impacts of different modeling grid sizes on the computation time we have carried out a series of different simulations with grid sizes being at 30 45 60 90 and 150 m respectively using both the original and enhanced dhsvm models with the mercer creek watershed in these simulations the computational environment and model settings were kept the same except for the modeling grid sizes fig 7 shows that the computational time required by the original dhsvm model decreases from 35 5 to 0 03 h when the grid size increases from 30 to 150 m whereas the computational time required by dhsvm maccormack reduces from 0 2 to 0 01 h this clearly demonstrates that the computational time with the maccormack scheme decreases when the grid size increases for a given watershed the reduction is more obvious for the original dhsvm model than for dhsvm maccormack as expected since the latter is already very effective when the modeling grid size is small for a given large watershed these results illustrate that the computational time of the maccormack scheme depend on the size of both the watershed and the modeling grid cell for applications to larger watersheds the demand for computational time can be compensated by increasing grid sizes thus selecting an appropriate grid cell size that is as large as possible while satisfying the accuracy requirement is the key to reduce computational time when applying the maccormack scheme to a large watershed from a practice point of view one can also use the maccormack scheme in conjunction with hpc or parallel and distributed computations li et al 2011 vivoni et al 2011 for conducting the routing for a very large river basin in this study only the semi maccormack scheme was implemented in dhsvm for the overland flow routing the full version of the maccormack scheme full maccormack however proved to outperform the semi maccormack in terms of simulation accuracy although the latter is slightly more computationally efficient as presented in section 3 1 thus in a follow up study we expect to apply the full maccormack scheme to overland flow routing in pdhms despite of the aforementioned theoretical and practical challenges in version of 3 1 2 flow paths are determined by the d4 algorithm which complicates the integration of the full maccormack algorithm into dhsvm because each computational grid may have multiple inflows and outflows however the coupling of the full maccormack scheme for watershed routing may become more plausible for other phdms with the d8 algorithm determining their flow directions since each computational grid has only one outflow in spite of possible multiple inflows 4 conclusions this study applied for the first time the maccormack numerical scheme to overland flow routing in dhsvm a representative high spatial resolution process based distributed hydrological model the maccormack scheme proved to be applicable and efficient when coupled with dhsvm after verifying against the analytical solutions for two synthetic overland flow cases with uniform rainfall the semi maccormack algorithm was implemented into dhsvm to solve the kinematic equations for overland flow routing the performance and practicability of the enhanced dhsvm model i e dhsvm maccormack were assessed by performing two groups of modeling experiments i e exp i and exp ii over the mercer creek watershed the analytical verification indicated that both the semi and full versions of the maccormack schemes i e semi maccormack and full maccormack exhibit robust numerical stability even with large time steps that violate the cfl stability condition they were demonstrated to be significantly more computationally efficient than the explicit linear scheme additionally despite more time consuming when the same time step is employed the full maccormack scheme slightly outperformed the semi version in terms of simulation precision especially for the falling limb of the hydrographs the two groups of the modeling experiments in the mercer creek watershed show that dhsvm maccormack can considerably improve the computational efficiency while preserving the same simulation accuracy of the original dhsvm model with the same computational environment and model settings dhsvm maccormack can reduce the cpu time from about one day and a half required by the original dhsvm model to several dozen minutes for a simulation period of three months january 1 2012 to march 31 2012 without any noticeable sacrifice of the accuracy in addition our results show that the reduction of computational time is significantly more with the larger watershed i e heihe watershed vs mercer creek watershed using dhsvm maccormack than dhsvm although the required computational time for both dhsvm and dhsvm maccormack appear to be proportional to the watershed size furthermore our results show that the computational efficiency of applying the maccormack scheme depends both on the sizes of the watershed and the grid cell thus selecting an appropriate grid cell size that is as large as possible while satisfying the accuracy requirement can be a key to have a maximum reduction of the computational time the maccormack scheme shows promise for applications to watershed routing in high spatial resolution pdhms in light of its outstanding computational efficiency future work will focus on implementing the full maccormack scheme to pdhms with the d8 algorithm determining their

7462,soil water and its efficient use are critical to sustainable productivity of rainfed orchards under the context of climate change in water limited areas here we combined micro catchments for collecting hillslope runoff named fish scale pits with mulches to examine water infiltration and water consumption of fruit trees using in situ soil moisture monitoring the micro lysimeter and sap flow methods via a two year experiment in a rainfed jujube orchard on china s loess plateau this experiment included four treatments fish scale pit with branch mulching fb fish scale pit with straw mulching fs fish scale pit without mulching f and bare land treatment ck the results showed that only about 50 of the rainfall infiltrated the soil for ck during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the fish scale pit without mulching experienced significantly increased rainfall infiltration by 41 38 and 27 30 respectively but also increased evaporation by 42 28 and 65 59 respectively compared to ck during the two growing seasons the jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45 64 53 10 over ck and the evaporation decreased by 42 47 53 50 when fish scale pits were mulched with branches or straw taken together the results show that the fish scale pits and mulching combinations efficiently increased rainfall infiltration and jujube evapotranspiration in the experimental jujube orchard

1 introduction soil water is an important factor for crop production in arid and semiarid regions gao et al 2016 water shortage especially during reproductive stage can significantly reduce the yield and quality of fruit trees oren and pataki 2001 li et al 2016 multiple climate models predict that climate change would amplify the intensity and frequency of droughts and thus decrease water availability particularly in semiarid regions guo et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 huang et al 2017 in the context of climate change increasing infiltration from precipitation and decreasing soil evaporation is therefore of great importance to the sustainability of rainfed orchards in water limited regions land engineering and mulching measures are effective ways of preventing drought in arid and semiarid regions by reducing runoff and decreasing soil evaporation stavi and argaman 2016 wei et al 2016 huo et al 2017 water harvesting techniques by land reprofiling represent an attractive solution for mitigating water shortages in various parts of the world stavi and argaman 2016 these land engineering measures including terracing strehmel et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2018 ridge tillage mloza banda et al 2016 and fish scale micro catchment fu et al 2010 among others are developed to increase the amount of rainfall infiltration by changing the gradient slope length and roughness of slopes for examples zhang et al 2017 showed that terracing had positive influences on soil water content among layers and mean soil water content of the terrace site was 25 4 and13 7 higher than that in the slope site fu et al 2010 found that fish scale pit a semicircular micro catchment could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment transport during heavy rainstorms and thus increase soil water infiltration however li et al 2011 showed that the average soil water content inside fish scale pits was less than that of an external slope during july and august due to the enlarged partial soil water and contact area between soil and air alternatively mulching is an effective way of reducing soil evaporation in arid and semiarid agroecosystems wang et al 2016a huo et al 2017 covering the surface with the materials in terms of straw film or branches can reduce radiation and wind speed at the surface and hence reduce evaporation balwinder singh et al 2011 wang et al 2015a reported that straw mulched significantly increased the soil water content by 19 5 compared with the clean tillage water management method during the final stage of rapid fruit growth on the rainfed semiarid loess plateau of china furthermore mahdavi et al 2017 showed that the straw mulching practice significantly reduced total cumulative evaporation up to 40 as compared to the bare soil plot in a field experimental plot in japan however mulching is usually used on leveled lands since it is susceptible to being taken away by runoff and gravity on hillslopes if land engineering measure with mulching is combined on hillslope it has the potential to increase soil water infiltration and reduce soil evaporation concurrently which is however rarely tested in rainfed orchards in semiarid areas wang et al 2015b the hilly region of the loess plateau of china is a typical semiarid region with an annual precipitation of around 400 600 mm zhang et al 2014 gao et al 2017a b generally the rain comes seasonally from july to september every year and is mostly heavy or torrential gao et al 2016 song et al 2017 in addition many orchards there are located in hillslopes and a considerable volume of the rain is lost as runoff during rainstorms leading to greater water shortages chen et al 2016 wang et al 2016a furthermore because of the high cost of irrigation in this hilly region most orchards are cultivated under rainfed conditions gao et al 2017a b li et al 2017 jujube ziziphus jujuba mill orchards are expanded during the last two decades due to its great benefit in both soil and water conservation and increasing farmer s income chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016b however the production of jujube trees is greatly regulated by soil water availability since ground water 50 m is far beyond the maximum rooting depth in this area gao et al 2016 therefore this study here aimed to examine the effects of water collection by fish scale pits and mulching combinations on soil water infiltration and water consumption by using in situ soil moisture observations micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements in a rainfed jujube orchard during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 these measurement approaches have been demonstrated suitable in understanding temporal patterns of water use of tree species in hillslopes boast and robertson 1982 sun et al 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the jujube cv lizao on ziziphus rootstock orchard under investigation 37 15 n 110 21 e is located in the north central part of the loess plateau at an elevation of 961 976 m in the northern shaanxi province of china this area has a semiarid continental climate with mean annual precipitation of 497 mm based on data for 1986 2015 79 9 396 88 mm of which falls during the growing season fig 1 a mean annual temperature of 8 6 c with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 6 5 c in january to 22 8 c in july 157 frost free days and 2720 h of sunshine on average each year weather bureau of qingjian county shaanxi province the soil is typical silt loam loess soils inceptisols usda which is primarily composed of loess with a texture of fine silt and silt loam the amounts of organic carbon organic matter total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium were 2 34 g kg 1 2 60 g kg 1 35 48 mg kg 1 5 54 mg kg 1 and 109 21 mg kg 1 respectively a summary of soil properties in the 0 100 cm layer is shown in table 1 the jujube orchard was established by manually planting 10 year old bare root seedlings on an approximately 20 slope and cultivating under rainfed conditions with spatial intervals of 3 m by 2 m respectively every year 300 kg n ha 1 70 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 of fertilizer were applied to the cultivated jujube trees pest and weed control measures were also taken every year the trees were pruned every year to maintain their height at about 2 m and a uniform canopy in the shape of a spherosome according to the sprouting and defoliation times of jujube the growth season of the jujube in 2014 and 2015 lasted for 161 and 157 days from 25 april to 3 october in 2014 and from 1 may to 5 october in 2015 2 2 treatments the fish scale pits were established on a cultivated slope in october 2013 semicircular holes were dug into the slope and the excavated earth used to form a wall around the semicircles the pits were built on slopes in an alternating pattern similar to the arrangement of the scales of a fish thus preventing water from running off trees were planted in the fish scale pits fig 2 four different treatments were used in this study a fish scale pit with branch mulching fb a fish scale pit with maize straw mulching fs a fish scale pit without mulching f and bare land treatment ck for each treatment four plots having an area of 24 m2 4 m 6 m each were established as four replicates with a spacing interval of 5 m between neighboring plots fig 2 therefore a total of 16 plots were established on hillslopes with similar slope gradients 16 25 and slope aspects 0 20 based on the jujube plant spacing and the volume of runoff the fish scale pit built in 2013 had a volume of 100 cm length 80 cm width 30 cm depth pruned jujube branches and maize straw were used for the mulch with lengths of 20 cm and a mulching thickness of 15 cm the trimmed jujube branches volume can maintain around the thickness of 15 cm to maintain the thickness of mulching material was added in november every year 2 3 soil moisture and meteorological data an ech2o ec 5 sensor decagon devices inc usa was used to measure soil water content an rr 1008 datalogger rainroot scientific limited beijing china automatically recorded the sensor output measured by the ec 5 sensors a trench with a width of 150 cm and a depth of 300 cm was vertically dug on top of the jujube tree trunk dune to expose the soil profile sensors were vertically inserted into the soil profile at depths of 5 10 20 40 60 100 160 220 and 280 cm and they were kept 20 cm from the tree trunk at the horizontal direction the system sampled data every 2 min and logged them every 10 min also a 1 m deep profile was excavated on the same slope to collect undisturbed soil cores in order to obtain measurements of the dry soil bulk density and gravimetrical soil water content θ g g g 1 an ec 5 sensor was deployed at corresponding depths to the main trench the values of θ g were then transformed to volumetric moisture contents θ v cm3 cm 3 and a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the measured moisture values θ e cm3 cm 3 by the ec 5 sensor against the volumetric moisture contents measured using the oven drying method θ v solar radiation relative humidity air temperature precipitation and wind speed were measured every 10 min using an automated weather station rainroot scientific limited beijing china close to the experimental field vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity 2 4 estimation of soil water infiltration and water consumption to calculate the soil water storage the hypothesis in this work is that 1 the soil water content in the 0 5 cm layer is equal to the calibrated value of the sensor at a depth of 5 cm and 2 the soil water content between the adjoining sensors changes linearly below 5 cm the soil water storage sws of the 0 280 cm profile was calculated using the following equation 1 sws 5 θ 5 5 θ 5 θ 10 2 h 2 h 1 θ h 1 θ h 2 2 60 θ 220 θ 280 2 where sws is the soil water storage of 0 280 cm profile cm θ h is the calibrated volumetric water content at the depth of h in cm3 m 3 and h1 and h2 are the depths of adjacent sensors in cm because the ground water depth is far beyond the maximum rooting depth in our site changes in soil water content are assumed to be driven only by precipitation and root water uptake the increment δ sws of the soil water storage every 10 min was determined using the following equation 2 δ sws sws t 10 sws t where δ sws is the increment of the soil water storage every 10 min cm sws t is the value of sws at t cm and sws t 10 is the value at t 10 min cm the δsws is primarily influenced by rainfall events and evapotranspiration in this study region where have no irrigation and negligible deep percolation zhang et al 2007 rainfall is the only source of replenishing soil water storage therefore as δsws 0 it means soil water storage is replenished by precipitation and the sum of δsws is assumed to equal to infiltration from precipitation fig 3 during rainfall events soil evaporation and canopy transpiration are usually ignored because of low air temperature high relatively humidity and thus low vapor pressure deficit vpd cai et al 2007 on the other hand as δsws 0 it means soil water loss happens which is primarily from soil evaporation in surface layer and from root water uptake in root zone layer and the sum of absolute δsws is assumed to equal to water consumption fig 3 2 5 evaporation measurement measurements of evaporation from soil were made at 8 00 every day using small lysimeters containing undisturbed samples of soil daamen et al 1993 marin et al 2010 lysimeters were composed of inner and outer pvc pipes the inner one had a diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 20 cm the outer one had a depth as long as the inner one and a slightly bigger diameter than the inner one so that the inner one would fit into the outer one tightly first the inner pipe was filled with undisturbed soil and then it was packed with gauze at the bottom then it was put into the outer pipe and weighed in addition for mulched plots the top of the lysimeter was mulched with branch or straw finally lysimeters were put into the pit from where undisturbed soil had been removed the lysimeters were installed in each plot they were re weighed after 24 h to determine the water lost by evaporation and renewed with undisturbed soil every week or after rain events the determination was continuously carried out during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 2 6 sap flow measurements the daily transpiration rate of the jujube orchard was monitored over the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons using the thermal dissipation method granier 1985 sap flux was monitored in 12 jujube trees the characteristics of the jujube trees are summarized in table 2 as the jujube trees needed to be preserved for future studies only single thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes length 30 mm diameter 2 mm were installed on the trunks of the selected plants to minimize tree damage o brien et al 2004 the upper probe was heated continually while the lower probe was kept unheated tdp probe placement can result in considerable variations in sap flux to minimize sap flux variation the probes were uniformly and horizontally inserted at 0 30 mm depth in the sapwood and installed on the north side of the trunks at about 20 cm above the ground prior to the installation of the probes two layers of the tree trunk bark were peeled off to limit external interference the probes were carefully packaged in silver membranes wilson et al 2001 wullschleger et al 2001 the cr1000 data logger campbell co usa was used to record sap flow every 10 min during the jujube growth seasons in 2014 and 2015 standard non calibrated sap flux density was calculated using the equation developed by granier 1987 and proved by clearwater et al 1999 3 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δt is the temperature difference between the heated and unheated probe and δtm is the temperature difference with no sap flow assuming that js is constant across the sapwood profile then sap flow can be calculated as santiago et al 2000 oren and pataki 2001 4 sf k j s a s where sf is sap flow kg d 1 k is unit conversion coefficient equal to 0 00864 and as is sapwood area cm2 as was estimated from the relationship between sapwood area and tree diameter determined by randomly cutting down 17 jujube trees at 20 cm above the ground fig 4 a significantly linear correlation was observed with the sapwood area increasing as the trunk diameter increased 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using microsoft excel 2010 microsoft redmond usa and spss16 0 spss chicago usa software differences between the treatments were examined using anova followed when appropriate by multiple comparisons based on the least significant difference lsd and results were considered significant when p value is less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 changes of meteorological condition as shown in fig 5 for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the average values of the diurnal temperature wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit were 19 38 c 1 08 m s 1 197 44 w m 2 and 1 19 kpa respectively the rainfall in the growth stages during 2014 was 367 02 mm which is 7 52 lower than the long term average 396 88 mm during the growing season of 2014 the rainfall was concentrated in july and the monthly rainfall was also almost equal to the long term average except that august 2014 was relatively dry with rainfall amounts 45 10 less than the long term average 106 73 mm during the growing season of 2015 the rainfall was 251 84 mm only 63 45 of the long term average 396 88 mm july was particularly dry with the rainfall only 9 12 10 40 mm of the long term average 114 00 mm 3 2 soil water infiltration the fitting equation by linear regression between volumetric moisture content by gravimetric value and dry soil bulk density and the measured volumetric values using soil moisture sensors were given in eq 5 as follows 5 θ v 0 834 θ e 7 963 where θ v is the volumetric moisture content by gravimetric value and dry soil bulk density cm3 cm 3 θ e is the measured volumetric values using soil moisture sensors cm3 cm 3 the coefficient of determination reached 0 804 and the root mean square error rmse of the ec 5 values was 0 0396 cm3 cm 3 overall the ec 5 sensors produce reliable soil moisture values in our site as shown in fig 6 the month mean rainfall infiltration under the fish scale pit treatments fb fs and f increased by 65 62 on average compared to ck during the rainstorm periods july to september 2014 august to september 2015 but showed no significant different among these fish scale pit treatments for the whole growing season in 2014 the rainfall infiltration content of fb fs and f increased by 53 24 290 93 mm 51 73 288 05 mm 41 39 268 43 mm respectively compared to ck 189 85 mm for the 2015 growing season the increments were 51 60 175 14 mm 57 73 182 21 mm 37 30 158 61 mm respectively compared to ck 115 52 mm 3 3 soil water consumption in this section soil water consumption was estimated using two different methods i e 1 the decrease of soil moisture observations and 2 soil evaporation and sap flow measurements this study showed that there is considerable soil evaporation especially during the rainy season from f and ck in the experimental orchard fig 7 no significant differences in evaporation each month was observed for fb and fs during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons during the rainy season july at 2014 and from august to september at 2015 the evaporation from f was significantly higher than the other three treatments on a monthly basis in the 2014 growing season the evaporation from fish scales pits without mulching increased by 42 28 on average compared to ck when the fish scale pits were mulched with branches and straw the evaporation decreased by 44 53 and 42 47 relative to ck respectively the values in 2015 were 65 59 53 36 and 53 50 respectively fig 8 shows the diurnal canopy transpiration mm d 1 calculated from daily whole tree cumulative sap flow and projected crown area during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively the transpiration gradually increased from the end of april 2014 up to the highest value in mid july jujube transpiration remained at a high level and then rapidly reduced to zero in the end of september on account of the low rainfall from april to july in 2015 the jujube transpiration was lower than 2014 with the advent of rain in august jujube transpiration increased rapidly through the whole growing seasons compared to ck jujube transpiration for fb fs and f increased by 49 83 216 03 mm 53 10 220 76 mm 21 22 174 79 mm at 2014 and 45 64 180 46 mm 47 91 183 28 mm 12 91 139 91 mm at 2015 respectively the soil water consumption estimated based on soil moisture observations was shown in fig 9 the water consumption of fb fs and f increased by 28 61 274 85 mm 30 17 278 17 mm 27 30 272 03 mm respectively compared to ck 213 70 mm through the 2014 growing season and the values of 2015 were 24 51 207 04 mm 28 53 213 73 mm 19 45 198 63 mm respectively overall water consumption based on soil moisture observations was underestimated compared to the estimations based on evapotranspiration measurements especially at july of 2014 and august and september of 2015 4 discussion 4 1 water infiltration and consumption fish scale pits could effectively increase rainfall utilization efficiency during the rainy seasons fig 6 as reviewed by fu et al 2010 the relative reductions in runoff from the fish scale plot for 20 year 160 mm 10 year 120 mm and 2 year 54 mm return period daily rainfall were 18 28 and 39 respectively previati et al 2010 reported that the water content values measured inside the fish scale pits are generally higher than those monitored outside the micro basins but in spite of this general tendency some noticeable effects due to soil type time of the year farm management and soil depth are observed the fish scale pits can effectively increase the rainfall infiltration by intercepting runoff at the wet seasons but the soil water content will not necessarily increase because the fish scale pits without mulching significantly increase the evaporation compared with control fig 7 probably due to the increase in soil water content and enlarged contact area between soil and air furthermore the rainfall interception of mulching material such as straw and jujube branches can result in the decrease of infiltration alliaume et al 2017 our results demonstrate that monthly infiltration between three treatments in fish scale pits fb fs f generally showed no significant difference during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 in this experiment fig 6 which indicated that combining fish scale pits with mulching had little influence on soil water infiltration the mulching decreases soil water content loss by evaporation and the variation in soil temperature by insulating the surface davarzani et al 2014 jimenez et al 2017 furthermore mulching can effectively reduce the formation of a physical soil crust by filtering soil particles during rainstorms increasing water stable soil aggregates and increasing soil water holding capacity lin and chen 2015 our results indicated that combining fish scale pits with mulching increased soil water infiltration and canopy transpiration as well this means that mulching increases soil water availability and carbon assimilation via photosynthesis and thus productivity of jujube trees hydraulic architecture has a large impact on the amount of water uptake in the root zone under sufficient water supply but root water uptake was greatly restrained soil water availability under water stress lobet et al 2014 our study region located in the semiarid region of the loess plateau where soils are exposed to water stress for the majority of growing seasons thus the water uptake of jujube is mainly influenced by soil water content in our study site lobet et al 2014 the mulching treatments increased root zone soil water content which is expected to lead to higher root water uptake 4 2 the methods of estimating soil water consumption in this study we tried to calculate the water consumption using two different methods based on soil moisture observations and evapotranspiration respectively at the rainy month the soil moisture observations method generally underestimated the evapotranspiration fig 9 the cause of the discrepancy was that the shallowest measuring point for an ec 5 sensor was only 5 cm below the soil surface in the calculation of rainfall infiltration and consumption soil water content in the 0 5 cm layer was replaced with the value measured at 5 cm eq 1 if the rainfall is small water evaporates rapidly before reaching 5 cm depth so this computing method clearly underestimates the evaporation especially over the wet season simultaneous monitoring of the surface soil water can eliminate this error furthermore the hypothesis of linear variation of the soil water between two sensors and deep percolation may introduce other sources of uncertainty there are also possible systematic errors in estimating transpiration using granier method for examples the difference of the trunk s natural temperature gradient and the heated probes temperature the distribution of sapwood area and the installation position of probes sun et al 2012 ren et al 2017 in addition some researchers found that soil moisture content had large variation in space at orchard scale and thus the selection of in situ monitoring location can impact the accuracy of soil moisture estimation by sensors villagra et al 1995 therefore future studies should evaluate the uncertainty caused by single monitoring location by using statistical approaches such as time stability analysis hu et al 2010 gao et al 2015 4 3 implications by now land engineering measures were alone used to establish on slope in arid and semiarid regions which will increase evaporation from our findings combination of mulching and land engineering measures on hillslopes increased rainfall infiltration and decreased soil evaporation as well in addition the economics of using mulch material needs to be considered trimmed jujube branches and maize straw were selected as mulching material in this experiment the rainfall interception process of these two materials was not clear enough to allow it to be ignored for two reasons first the surface of these two materials was smooth thus it was not very hygroscopic second the rainfall could easily reach the soil surface through microvoids formed by these two materials when choosing mulching materials one should consider not only the effect on soil water conservation improvement of physical soil properties and the effect of regional local climate but also economic applicability for instance of the two materials used in this study jujube branches are easier to obtain than maize straw following the reduction in cultivated land area the jujube branches were mainly from the annually trimmed branches in addition the presence of straw increases the damage caused by pests and diseases the use of trimmed branches as mulching materials reduced the cost of the processing and transportation of material using trimmed branches also helped with the two objectives of rainfall interception and storage and soil water preservation providing both an economic and ecological benefit to rainfed orchards in semiarid hillslopes 5 conclusion in this study we tried to calculate water consumption using automatic water monitoring devices and combined sap flow and micro lysimeter methods in a semiarid rainfed orchard the results obtained from the two methods were similar over monthly during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons only about 50 rainfall infiltrated the soil the fish scale pit treatments without mulching significantly increased the rainfall infiltration by 41 38 and 27 30 respectively and also increased evaporation by 42 28 and 65 59 respectively compared to ck during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 the jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45 64 53 10 and the evaporation decreased by 42 47 53 50 when fish scale pits were mulched using branches or straw hence farmers should be encouraged to apply the comprehensive agricultural measures to sustain agroecosystems on sloping field management of semiarid rainfed orchards

flow methods via a two year experiment in a rainfed jujube orchard on china s loess plateau this experiment included four treatments fish scale pit with branch mulching fb fish scale pit with straw mulching fs fish scale pit without mulching f and bare land treatment ck the results showed that only about 50 of the rainfall infiltrated the soil for ck during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the fish scale pit without mulching experienced significantly increased rainfall infiltration by 41 38 and 27 30 respectively but also increased evaporation by 42 28 and 65 59 respectively compared to ck during the two growing seasons the jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45 64 53 10 over ck and the evaporation decreased by 42 47 53 50 when fish scale pits were mulched with branches or straw taken together the results show that the fish scale pits and mulching combinations efficiently increased rainfall infiltration and jujube evapotranspiration in the experimental jujube orchard the findings here provide an insight into the field water management for hillslope orchards in water limited regions keywords soil moisture evapotranspiration land engineering measure mulching jujube 1 introduction soil water is an important factor for crop production in arid and semiarid regions gao et al 2016 water shortage especially during reproductive stage can significantly reduce the yield and quality of fruit trees oren and pataki 2001 li et al 2016 multiple climate models predict that climate change would amplify the intensity and frequency of droughts and thus decrease water availability particularly in semiarid regions guo et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 huang et al 2017 in the context of climate change increasing infiltration from precipitation and decreasing soil evaporation is therefore of great importance to the sustainability of rainfed orchards in water limited regions land engineering and mulching measures are effective ways of preventing drought in arid and semiarid regions by reducing runoff and decreasing soil evaporation stavi and argaman 2016 wei et al 2016 huo et al 2017 water harvesting techniques by land reprofiling represent an attractive solution for mitigating water shortages in various parts of the world stavi and argaman 2016 these land engineering measures including terracing strehmel et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 gao et al 2018 ridge tillage mloza banda et al 2016 and fish scale micro catchment fu et al 2010 among others are developed to increase the amount of rainfall infiltration by changing the gradient slope length and roughness of slopes for examples zhang et al 2017 showed that terracing had positive influences on soil water content among layers and mean soil water content of the terrace site was 25 4 and13 7 higher than that in the slope site fu et al 2010 found that fish scale pit a semicircular micro catchment could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment transport during heavy rainstorms and thus increase soil water infiltration however li et al 2011 showed that the average soil water content inside fish scale pits was less than that of an external slope during july and august due to the enlarged partial soil water and contact area between soil and air alternatively mulching is an effective way of reducing soil evaporation in arid and semiarid agroecosystems wang et al 2016a huo et al 2017 covering the surface with the materials in terms of straw film or branches can reduce radiation and wind speed at the surface and hence reduce evaporation balwinder singh et al 2011 wang et al 2015a reported that straw mulched significantly increased the soil water content by 19 5 compared with the clean tillage water management method during the final stage of rapid fruit growth on the rainfed semiarid loess plateau of china furthermore mahdavi et al 2017 showed that the straw mulching practice significantly reduced total cumulative evaporation up to 40 as compared to the bare soil plot in a field experimental plot in japan however mulching is usually used on leveled lands since it is susceptible to being taken away by runoff and gravity on hillslopes if land engineering measure with mulching is combined on hillslope it has the potential to increase soil water infiltration and reduce soil evaporation concurrently which is however rarely tested in rainfed orchards in semiarid areas wang et al 2015b the hilly region of the loess plateau of china is a typical semiarid region with an annual precipitation of around 400 600 mm zhang et al 2014 gao et al 2017a b generally the rain comes seasonally from july to september every year and is mostly heavy or torrential gao et al 2016 song et al 2017 in addition many orchards there are located in hillslopes and a considerable volume of the rain is lost as runoff during rainstorms leading to greater water shortages chen et al 2016 wang et al 2016a furthermore because of the high cost of irrigation in this hilly region most orchards are cultivated under rainfed conditions gao et al 2017a b li et al 2017 jujube ziziphus jujuba mill orchards are expanded during the last two decades due to its great benefit in both soil and water conservation and increasing farmer s income chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016b however the production of jujube trees is greatly regulated by soil water availability since ground water 50 m is far beyond the maximum rooting depth in this area gao et al 2016 therefore this study here aimed to examine the effects of water collection by fish scale pits and mulching combinations on soil water infiltration and water consumption by using in situ soil moisture observations micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements in a rainfed jujube orchard during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 these measurement approaches have been demonstrated suitable in understanding temporal patterns of water use of tree species in hillslopes boast and robertson 1982 sun et al 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the jujube cv lizao on ziziphus rootstock orchard under investigation 37 15 n 110 21 e is located in the north central part of the loess plateau at an elevation of 961 976 m in the northern shaanxi province of china this area has a semiarid continental climate with mean annual precipitation of 497 mm based on data for 1986 2015 79 9 396 88 mm of which falls during the growing season fig 1 a mean annual temperature of 8 6 c with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 6 5 c in january to 22 8 c in july 157 frost free days and 2720 h of sunshine on average each year weather bureau of qingjian county shaanxi province the soil is typical silt loam loess soils inceptisols usda which is primarily composed of loess with a texture of fine silt and silt loam the amounts of organic carbon organic matter total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium were 2 34 g kg 1 2 60 g kg 1 35 48 mg kg 1 5 54 mg kg 1 and 109 21 mg kg 1 respectively a summary of soil properties in the 0 100 cm layer is shown in table 1 the jujube orchard was established by manually planting 10 year old bare root seedlings on an approximately 20 slope and cultivating under rainfed conditions with spatial intervals of 3 m by 2 m respectively every year 300 kg n ha 1 70 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 of fertilizer were applied to the cultivated jujube trees pest and weed control measures were also taken every year the trees were pruned every year to maintain their height at about 2 m and a uniform canopy in the shape of a spherosome according to the sprouting and defoliation times of jujube the growth season of the jujube in 2014 and 2015 lasted for 161 and 157 days from 25 april to 3 october in 2014 and from 1 may to 5 october in 2015 2 2 treatments the fish scale pits were established on a cultivated slope in october 2013 semicircular holes were dug into the slope and the excavated earth used to form a wall around the semicircles the pits were built on slopes in an alternating pattern similar to the arrangement of the scales of a fish thus preventing water from running off trees were planted in the fish scale pits fig 2 four different treatments were used in this study a fish scale pit with branch mulching fb a fish scale pit with maize straw mulching fs a fish scale pit without mulching f and bare land treatment ck for each treatment four plots having an area of 24 m2 4 m 6 m each were established as four replicates with a spacing interval of 5 m between neighboring plots fig 2 therefore a total of 16 plots were established on hillslopes with similar slope gradients 16 25 and slope aspects 0 20 based on the jujube plant spacing and the volume of runoff the fish scale pit built in 2013 had a volume of 100 cm length 80 cm width 30 cm depth pruned jujube branches and maize straw were used for the mulch with lengths of 20 cm and a mulching thickness of 15 cm the trimmed jujube branches volume can maintain around the thickness of 15 cm to maintain the thickness of mulching material was added in november every year 2 3 soil moisture and meteorological data an ech2o ec 5 sensor decagon devices inc usa was used to measure soil water content an rr 1008 datalogger rainroot scientific limited beijing china automatically recorded the sensor output measured by the ec 5 sensors a trench with a width of 150 cm and a depth of 300 cm was vertically dug on top of the jujube tree trunk dune to expose the soil profile sensors were vertically inserted into the soil profile at depths of 5 10 20 40 60 100 160 220 and 280 cm and they were kept 20 cm from the tree trunk at the horizontal direction the system sampled data every 2 min and logged them every 10 min also a 1 m deep profile was excavated on the same slope to collect undisturbed soil cores in order to obtain measurements of the dry soil bulk density and gravimetrical soil water content θ g g g 1 an ec 5 sensor was deployed at corresponding depths to the main trench the values of θ g were then transformed to volumetric moisture contents θ v cm3 cm 3 and a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the measured moisture values θ e cm3 cm 3 by the ec 5 sensor against the volumetric moisture contents measured using the oven drying method θ v solar radiation relative humidity air temperature precipitation and wind speed were measured every 10 min using an automated weather station rainroot scientific limited beijing china close to the experimental field vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity 2 4 estimation of soil water infiltration and water consumption to calculate the soil water storage the hypothesis in this work is that 1 the soil water content in the 0 5 cm layer is equal to the calibrated value of the sensor at a depth of 5 cm and 2 the soil water content between the adjoining sensors changes linearly below 5 cm the soil water storage sws of the 0 280 cm profile was calculated using the following equation 1 sws 5 θ 5 5 θ 5 θ 10 2 h 2 h 1 θ h 1 θ h 2 2 60 θ 220 θ 280 2 where sws is the soil water storage of 0 280 cm profile cm θ h is the calibrated volumetric water content at the depth of h in cm3 m 3 and h1 and h2 are the depths of adjacent sensors in cm because the ground water depth is far beyond the maximum rooting depth in our site changes in soil water content are assumed to be driven only by precipitation and root water uptake the increment δ sws of the soil water storage every 10 min was determined using the following equation 2 δ sws sws t 10 sws t where δ sws is the increment of the soil water storage every 10 min cm sws t is the value of sws at t cm and sws t 10 is the value at t 10 min cm the δsws is primarily influenced by rainfall events and evapotranspiration in this study region where have no irrigation and negligible deep percolation zhang et al 2007 rainfall is the only source of replenishing soil water storage therefore as δsws 0 it means soil water storage is replenished by precipitation and the sum of δsws is assumed to equal to infiltration from precipitation fig 3 during rainfall events soil evaporation and canopy transpiration are usually ignored because of low air temperature high relatively humidity and thus low vapor pressure deficit vpd cai et al 2007 on the other hand as δsws 0 it means soil water loss happens which is primarily from soil evaporation in surface layer and from root water uptake in root zone layer and the sum of absolute δsws is assumed to equal to water consumption fig 3 2 5 evaporation measurement measurements of evaporation from soil were made at 8 00 every day using small lysimeters containing undisturbed samples of soil daamen et al 1993 marin et al 2010 lysimeters were composed of inner and outer pvc pipes the inner one had a diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 20 cm the outer one had a depth as long as the inner one and a slightly bigger diameter than the inner one so that the inner one would fit into the outer one tightly first the inner pipe was filled with undisturbed soil and then it was packed with gauze at the bottom then it was put into the outer pipe and weighed in addition for mulched plots the top of the lysimeter was mulched with branch or straw finally lysimeters were put into the pit from where undisturbed soil had been removed the lysimeters were installed in each plot they were re weighed after 24 h to determine the water lost by evaporation and renewed with undisturbed soil every week or after rain events the determination was continuously carried out during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 2 6 sap flow measurements the daily transpiration rate of the jujube orchard was monitored over the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons using the thermal dissipation method granier 1985 sap flux was monitored in 12 jujube trees the characteristics of the jujube trees are summarized in table 2 as the jujube trees needed to be preserved for future studies only single thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax co usa with two needle probes length 30 mm diameter 2 mm were installed on the trunks of the selected plants to minimize tree damage o brien et al 2004 the upper probe was heated continually while the lower probe was kept unheated tdp probe placement can result in considerable variations in sap flux to minimize sap flux variation the probes were uniformly and horizontally inserted at 0 30 mm depth in the sapwood and installed on the north side of the trunks at about 20 cm above the ground prior to the installation of the probes two layers of the tree trunk bark were peeled off to limit external interference the probes were carefully packaged in silver membranes wilson et al 2001 wullschleger et al 2001 the cr1000 data logger campbell co usa was used to record sap flow every 10 min during the jujube growth seasons in 2014 and 2015 standard non calibrated sap flux density was calculated using the equation developed by granier 1987 and proved by clearwater et al 1999 3 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δt is the temperature difference between the heated and unheated probe and δtm is the temperature difference with no sap flow assuming that js is constant across the sapwood profile then sap flow can be calculated as santiago et al 2000 oren and pataki 2001 4 sf k j s a s where sf is sap flow kg d 1 k is unit conversion coefficient equal to 0 00864 and as is sapwood area cm2 as was estimated from the relationship between sapwood area and tree diameter determined by randomly cutting down 17 jujube trees at 20 cm above the ground fig 4 a significantly linear correlation was observed with the sapwood area increasing as the trunk diameter increased 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using microsoft excel 2010 microsoft redmond usa and spss16 0 spss chicago usa software differences between the treatments were examined using anova followed when appropriate by multiple comparisons based on the least significant difference lsd and results were considered significant when p value is less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 changes of meteorological condition as shown in fig 5 for the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the average values of the diurnal temperature wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit were 19 38 c 1 08 m s 1 197 44 w m 2 and 1 19 kpa respectively the rainfall in the growth stages during 2014 was 367 02 mm which is 7 52 lower than the long term average 396 88 mm during the growing season of 2014 the rainfall was concentrated in july and the monthly rainfall was also almost equal to the long term average except that august 2014 was relatively dry with rainfall amounts 45 10 less than the long term average 106 73 mm during the growing season of 2015 the rainfall was 251 84 mm only 63 45 of the long term average 396 88 mm july was particularly dry with the rainfall only 9 12 10 40 mm of the long term average 114 00 mm 3 2 soil water infiltration the fitting equation by linear regression between volumetric moisture content by gravimetric value and dry soil bulk density and the measured volumetric values using soil moisture sensors were given in eq 5 as follows 5 θ v 0 834 θ e 7 963 where θ v is the volumetric moisture content by gravimetric value and dry soil bulk density cm3 cm 3 θ e is the measured volumetric values using soil moisture sensors cm3 cm 3 the coefficient of determination reached 0 804 and the root mean square error rmse of the ec 5 values was 0 0396 cm3 cm 3 overall the ec 5 sensors produce reliable soil moisture values in our site as shown in fig 6 the month mean rainfall infiltration under the fish scale pit treatments fb fs and f increased by 65 62 on average compared to ck during the rainstorm periods july to september 2014 august to september 2015 but showed no significant different among these fish scale pit treatments for the whole growing season in 2014 the rainfall infiltration content of fb fs and f increased by 53 24 290 93 mm 51 73 288 05 mm 41 39 268 43 mm respectively compared to ck 189 85 mm for the 2015 growing season the increments were 51 60 175 14 mm 57 73 182 21 mm 37 30 158 61 mm respectively compared to ck 115 52 mm 3 3 soil water consumption in this section soil water consumption was estimated using two different methods i e 1 the decrease of soil moisture observations and 2 soil evaporation and sap flow measurements this study showed that there is considerable soil evaporation especially during the rainy season from f and ck in the experimental orchard fig 7 no significant differences in evaporation each month was observed for fb and fs during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons during the rainy season july at 2014 and from august to september at 2015 the evaporation from f was significantly higher than the other three treatments on a monthly basis in the 2014 growing season the evaporation from fish scales pits without mulching increased by 42 28 on average compared to ck when the fish scale pits were mulched with branches and straw the evaporation decreased by 44 53 and 42 47 relative to ck respectively the values in 2015 were 65 59 53 36 and 53 50 respectively fig 8 shows the diurnal canopy transpiration mm d 1 calculated from daily whole tree cumulative sap flow and projected crown area during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively the transpiration gradually increased from the end of april 2014 up to the highest value in mid july jujube transpiration remained at a high level and then rapidly reduced to zero in the end of september on account of the low rainfall from april to july in 2015 the jujube transpiration was lower than 2014 with the advent of rain in august jujube transpiration increased rapidly through the whole growing seasons compared to ck jujube transpiration for fb fs and f increased by 49 83 216 03 mm 53 10 220 76 mm 21 22 174 79 mm at 2014 and 45 64 180 46 mm 47 91 183 28 mm 12 91 139 91 mm at 2015 respectively the soil water consumption estimated based on soil moisture observations was shown in fig 9 the water consumption of fb fs and f increased by 28 61 274 85 mm 30 17 278 17 mm 27 30 272 03 mm respectively compared to ck 213 70 mm through the 2014 growing season and the values of 2015 were 24 51 207 04 mm 28 53 213 73 mm 19 45 198 63 mm respectively overall water consumption based on soil moisture observations was underestimated compared to the estimations based on evapotranspiration measurements especially at july of 2014 and august and september of 2015 4 discussion 4 1 water infiltration and consumption fish scale pits could effectively increase rainfall utilization efficiency during the rainy seasons fig 6 as reviewed by fu et al 2010 the relative reductions in runoff from the fish scale plot for 20 year 160 mm 10 year 120 mm and 2 year 54 mm return period daily rainfall were 18 28 and 39 respectively previati et al 2010 reported that the water content values measured inside the fish scale pits are generally higher than those monitored outside the micro basins but in spite of this general tendency some noticeable effects due to soil type time of the year farm management and soil depth are observed the fish scale pits can effectively increase the rainfall infiltration by intercepting runoff at the wet seasons but the soil water content will not necessarily increase because the fish scale pits without mulching significantly increase the evaporation compared with control fig 7 probably due to the increase in soil water content and enlarged contact area between soil and air furthermore the rainfall interception of mulching material such as straw and jujube branches can result in the decrease of infiltration alliaume et al 2017 our results demonstrate that monthly infiltration between three treatments in fish scale pits fb fs f generally showed no significant difference during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 in this experiment fig 6 which indicated that combining fish scale pits with mulching had little influence on soil water infiltration the mulching decreases soil water content loss by evaporation and the variation in soil temperature by insulating the surface davarzani et al 2014 jimenez et al 2017 furthermore mulching can effectively reduce the formation of a physical soil crust by filtering soil particles during rainstorms increasing water stable soil aggregates and increasing soil water holding capacity lin and chen 2015 our results indicated that combining fish scale pits with mulching increased soil water infiltration and canopy transpiration as well this means that mulching increases soil water availability and carbon assimilation via photosynthesis and thus productivity of jujube trees hydraulic architecture has a large impact on the amount of water uptake in the root zone under sufficient water supply but root water uptake was greatly restrained soil water availability under water stress lobet et al 2014 our study region located in the semiarid region of the loess plateau where soils are exposed to water stress for the majority of growing seasons thus the water uptake of jujube is mainly influenced by soil water content in our study site lobet et al 2014 the mulching treatments increased root zone soil water content which is expected to lead to higher root water uptake 4 2 the methods of estimating soil water consumption in this study we tried to calculate the water consumption using two different methods based on soil moisture observations and evapotranspiration respectively at the rainy month the soil moisture observations method generally underestimated the evapotranspiration fig 9 the cause of the discrepancy was that the shallowest measuring point for an ec 5 sensor was only 5 cm below the soil surface in the calculation of rainfall infiltration and consumption soil water content in the 0 5 cm layer was replaced with the value measured at 5 cm eq 1 if the rainfall is small water evaporates rapidly before reaching 5 cm depth so this computing method clearly underestimates the evaporation especially over the wet season simultaneous monitoring of the surface soil water can eliminate this error furthermore the hypothesis of linear variation of the soil water between two sensors and deep percolation may introduce other sources of uncertainty there are also possible systematic errors in estimating transpiration using granier method for examples the difference of the trunk s natural temperature gradient and the heated probes temperature the distribution of sapwood area and the installation position of probes sun et al 2012 ren et al 2017 in addition some researchers found that soil moisture content had large variation in space at orchard scale and thus the selection of in situ monitoring location can impact the accuracy of soil moisture estimation by sensors villagra et al 1995 therefore future studies should evaluate the uncertainty caused by single monitoring location by using statistical approaches such as time stability analysis hu et al 2010 gao et al 2015 4 3 implications by now land engineering measures were alone used to establish on slope in arid and semiarid regions which will increase evaporation from our findings combination of mulching and land engineering measures on hillslopes increased rainfall infiltration and decreased soil evaporation as well in addition the economics of using mulch material needs to be considered trimmed jujube branches and maize straw were selected as mulching material in this experiment the rainfall interception process of these two materials was not clear enough to allow it to be ignored for two reasons first the surface of these two materials was smooth thus it was not very hygroscopic second the rainfall could easily reach the soil surface through microvoids formed by these two materials when choosing mulching materials one should consider not only the effect on soil water conservation improvement of physical soil properties and the effect of regional local climate but also economic applicability for instance of the two materials used in this study jujube branches are easier to obtain than maize straw following the reduction in cultivated land area the jujube branches were mainly from the annually trimmed branches in addition the presence of straw increases the damage caused by pests and diseases the use of trimmed branches as mulching materials reduced the cost of the processing and transportation of material using trimmed branches also helped with the two objectives of rainfall interception and storage and soil water preservation providing both an economic and ecological benefit to rainfed orchards in semiarid hillslopes 5 conclusion in this study we tried to calculate water consumption using automatic water monitoring devices and combined sap flow and micro lysimeter methods in a semiarid rainfed orchard the results obtained from the two methods were similar over monthly during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons only about 50 rainfall infiltrated the soil the fish scale pit treatments without mulching significantly increased the rainfall infiltration by 41 38 and 27 30 respectively and also increased evaporation by 42 28 and 65 59 respectively compared to ck during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 the jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45 64 53 10 and the evaporation decreased by 42 47 53 50 when fish scale pits were mulched using branches or straw hence farmers should be encouraged to apply the comprehensive agricultural measures to sustain agroecosystems on sloping field management of semiarid rainfed orchards

like carp fish in tidal regime has dependence on tidal cycle spawning of those species depends on high tide low discharge and moonlight conditions tsai et al 1981 the water temperature and salinity modify their migration pattern and they often prefer to a less tidal brackish regime in late spring for spawning lucas et al 2001 such ecological conditions can be prioritized in habitat simulation model globally among 207 methodologies of instream flow assessment in 44 countries habitat simulation method is the second most frequently ef assessment method tharme 2003 this is the widespread adopted method applied frequently either in a knowledge based or a data driven approach with quantitative results of combined suitability index c i and introduced with application software like physical habitat simulation system phabsim jung and choi 2015 aguilar and polo 2016 fornaroli et al 2016 yi et al 2014 woo 2010 phabsim is capable to correlate hydraulic model with biological model that identifies suitable habitat criteria based on the relationship of discharge and weighted usable area wua i e surface area based on composite probability of c i to indicate relative habitat suitability ayllón et al 2012 alternatively 2d hydraulic and habitat model like river 2d has been suggested in channel bottom friction dominated scenario during low tide or low flow as an improvement of ef prediction qin et al 2016 rivaes et al 2015 steffler and ali 2012 lee et al 2010 thus considering sensitivity to microhabitat variables 2d models can perform better for spatial distribution phenomena for wua and c i determination this study of ef assessment was primarily focused on its key component minimum flow requirement of semi diurnal karnafuli river based on its ecological habitat for carp fish moreover optimum meteorological factors along with the hydraulic conditions and water quality parameters play crucial role in ef maintenance riverine ecology commonly impaired by hydrologic alterations but for tidal river the ef assessment and flow standards need further intensive studies this research aimed to develop a flexible modeling framework to establish environmental flow threshold in ungauged semi diurnal tidal regime through flow characterization i e high low flow of tidal regime from the representative flow duration and thus finally obtain the optimum hydraulic conditions for suitable ef therefore a comprehensive modeling framework was required to establish following the fundamental ef assessment concepts of eloha so initially a hydrologic model i e swmm combined with hydrodynamic model hec ras to overcome several difficulties of existing ef assessment in ungauged streams i e scarcity of long term flow characteristics land cover land use changes effect on streamflow seepage loss of channel friction dominated tidal decay then to define hydraulic habitat feature a statistical analysis on derived flow data was performed focusing key ecological habitat carp fish furthermore to characterize the ecological habitat behavior under several flow conditions using habitat simulation model phabsim and river2d on wua basis those ecologically relevant flow was examined and suitable hydraulic conditions were proposed finally based on combined habitat suitability index flow alteration and ecologic response relationship was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karnafuli river exists in the south eastern part of bangladesh is the largest and most important river in chittagong region originating from the lushai hills in mizoram india the karnafuli flows 270 km southwest through the chittagong hill tracts and chittagong and finally disposes to the bay of bengal as per bangladesh meteorological department bmd the annual rainfall amount is 3000 mm of which 80 experienced during monsoon period june september according to the chittagong port authority cpa on an average the width of the river is about 667 m typical tidal range in a semi diurnal period 12 hr 28 min at the river estuary was observed with tide level of 1 5 m during low tide that reaches 5 5 m during high tide the water level gradually passes through non tidal regime at kaptai located a distance of 62 km from the river mouth and show daily variation of 1 2 m 1 8 m fig 1 based on semi diurnal tidal nature the hydrodynamic study considered lower 41 km of karnafuli river and 12 km of lower parts of halda river this covers a catchment area of about 310 km2 the hydrologic alteration of this area was tested on the restoration site selected at 32 km downstream of the kaptai dam up to karnafuli halda confluence based on the ecological indictors i e major indian carps fig 1 so the outlet discharge of kaptai dam has an influence on the aquatic community of this regime and thus there is an influence on the lower part of the halda river this area usually treated as nursery ground of major carps during spawning season april june as those fishes migrates from upper reach to this zone tsai et al 1981 akter and ali 2012 this is the only pure indian carp breeding field in bangladesh and possibly in south asia however due to habitat alteration the major carp production declined from 2470 kg in 1945 to 20 kg in the year 2004 and then slightly increased to 47 kg in 2015 moef 2015 this declination is possibly due to excess exploitation for supplying water to adjacent chittagong city rainfall pattern change suitable climatic conditions for spawning increasing salinity amount changed geomorphology by sand extraction and others 2 2 data preparation to avail the historical flow time series for the spawning ground fig 1 a combination of rainfall runoff and hydraulic model was adopted during the study period 2010 15 hydrological and meteorological parameters were derived to set up swmm model tables 1 and 2 the rainfall runoff model swmm was engaged to acquire tributaries runoff contribution and then applied as upstream boundary condition in hec ras finally tidal simulation in hec ras was performed with downstream boundary conditions of stage hydrograph 2 2 1 hydrological parameters hydrologic parameters were derived to incorporate in usepa s swmm an extension of geographic information system gis called hec geohms executed to delineate watershed boundary and stream network through terrain preprocessing using aster gdem as origin of topography stream network was obtained through this process table 1 the area threshold method was used to delineate watershed and stream network as the input dem in a gridded nature the steps followed in hec geohms terrain preprocessing was as a dem reconditioning using karnafuli river streamline b sink filling c flow accumulation grid generation based on computed flow direction d development of stream link grid based on flow direction and stream grid and e obtaining catchment grid along with associated stream link to obtain watershed boundaries then the model parameters i e slope s and imperviousness i were derived from spatial data table 1 as well as from the available literatures table 2 the width parameter refers to the width of overland flow path for sheet flow runoff and thus the overland flow width fw m was determined as ahiablame and shakya 2016 1 fw a l where a m2 is the catchment area and l m is the length of the overland flow path calculated from obtained hec geohms watershed analysis in this study land use and land cover lulc map fig 2 a and b were prepared considering four land use criteria viz vegetation barren land including cultivated lands without crops water body and built up area through the supervised classification by erdas imagine software in supervised classification spectral signatures were collected from specified locations training sites in the image by digitizing various polygons overlaying different land use types spectral signatures were classified following the knowledge based expert classification systems depending on the reference google earth maps to improve the accuracy of the classification process for a large study area this approach provides a reasonable accuracy two satellite images table 2 were used to determine built up area i e the imperviousness percentage and curve number eq 2 kappa coefficient is an accuracy assessment measure of predicted landuse pixel thus the consistency between the classified lulc map and reference maps google earth images field data represented by kappa coefficient that was determined by classification error and found within the range between 1 and 1 foody 2010 lulc in 2010 and 2015 were assessed by available high resolution google earth images on may 5 2010 and april 4 2015 respectively here 30 random points for each type of layer were sampled and compared with the available lulc thus the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient was respectively 81 and 0 79 for the lulc map 2010 applying similar approach for the lulc map 2015 overall accuracy and kappa coefficient was obtained 83 67 and 0 82 respectively however a variation of barren land pixel was observed between two lulc maps due to time period of image acquisition from the field survey it was reported that the crop period of irrigation field responsible for these variation in vegetation and barren field pixel the mean slope of each watershed has determined using zonal analysis mean in arc gis spatial analysis the soil conservation service scs method was selected for analysis as i this is the commonly used method in watershed to quantify landuse effect on runoff and provides reasonable results ii its calculation is made easier by the fact that only a few variables need to be estimated hydrologic soil group land use and slope and iii despite its simplicity it yields reasonable results compare to the complex models lastra et al 2008 modified scs equations eq 2 to suit indian subcontinents conditions were used in this study as suriya and mudgal

as well as the effective rainfall 2 2 2 hydraulic properties channel topography of stream network was exchanged from dem to prepare hydraulic input using hec georas preprocessing for hydrodynamic modeling using hec ras total 32 cross sections based on continuous field survey by cpa were engaged table 1 due to the low resolution i e 30 m of dem all cross sections were reconstructed based on surveyed cross sections by the bwdb and cpa cross sections were assumed representative as uniform within 1000 m in tributaries in pre processing the acquired dem was used as grid layer and processed to create channel geometry as this was required in swmm cross sections were digitized perpendicular to the path of flow in the channels the bank lines were manually checked with google earth as base map and they are manually relocated for channel seepage loss causes significant amount reduction of discharge aquifer to channel flux was ignored as the groundwater table was assumed below the river bed moreover the karnafuli river is a perennial stream and so groundwater flux in streamflow can be ignored seepage loss rate in each river cross section was computed using eq 4 and then further converted to seepage loss rate as per eq 5 garg 2007 4 δ q b d 2 3 200 where δq channel losses m3 s per km length of channel b bed width of the channel m d depth of water in the channel m 5 q δ q 3600 1000 p l q is the seepage loss rate mm h p is wetted perimeter of the channel m l is the conduit length m as the tide pattern of the karnafuli river is semi diurnal 6 h interval water level time series were used as downstream boundary condition in the hec ras during 2010 2015 table 1 to account the river flow from upstream areas of watershed boundary at node cs 1 fig 4 a 6 h discharge time series were collected table 1 3 model set up for the selected study area swmm model was preferred to derive rainfall hydrograph and to conduct hydrological routing for tributaries as tidal effect is not significant hydrological routing model is advantageous where morphology varies at small scale and can also be used at larger scale with limited topography information fekete et al 2001 thus to observe the ecological responses with hydrologic alteration a hydrologic model swmm was used to derive upstream contribution over river flow for the karnafuli river 1d hydrodynamic model hec ras was used due to significant tidal effect fig 4 again in this condition a detailed study on a hydrological model would provide misleading information as these models assume uniform velocity or a constant velocity throughout the large conduit ignoring topographic variation saleh et al 2013 the dynamic mechanism of unsteady flow is also ease in simulation in a hydrodynamic model hec ras unsteady flow simulation was carried to avail the sensitive flow components then the bidirectional hydrodynamic process of tidal river was analyzed separately as unidirectional river while habitat simulation method was also engaged i e phabsim and river 2d overall model set up process was shown in fig 3 and the measured data was detailed in table 1 3 1 hydrologic model most of the parts of karnafuli river are ungauged and the available gauge data already involved in the hydrologic model so it is advantageous to integrate a rainfall runoff model with a hydrodynamic model the preliminary purpose of this integration is to define the upstream boundary condition of hydrodynamic model hec ras usepa swmm is a link node model used to route in the tributaries and thus it can drive inflow hydrograph at desired gauge location of river tsihrintzis et al 2007 application of swmm found in real time optimal behavior as well as flood hazard risk mapping ilker et al 2008 mohammad et al 2016 the model has a wide variety of application including hydrologic and hydraulic capabilities i e flow routing through closed and open conduit networks of unlimited size backwater effect simulation surface ponding flood modeling and flood reduction with low impact development lid kelly and james 2009 rossman 2010 kenneth et al 2008 described an automatic calibration method of swmm model for large watershed incorporating gis with swmm this optimization method was applied to determine the hydrologic parameters and described in section 2 2 1 the topography of the study area was created by combining stream lines defined by hec geohms the watershed boundary was created using hec geohms and river center lines cross section cut lines bank lines those were predefined by hec geo ras fig 4 the inputs to the model are a the geometry with the numbering nodes and links as hec georas b for each conduit lengths maximum depths invert elevation c manning s roughness coefficient nc for each conduit and d the bathymetric information acquired from field survey e the inflow hydrograph at node cs 1 fig 4 to specify control fig 3 of relative runoff contribution of from upstream areas to river flow as karnafuli has its origin outside watershed boundary hydrological parameters imperviousness depression storage width and manning s co efficient for overland flow slope were incorporated in the model interface dynamic wave routing method with a time steps of 30 s was used to simulate the model for 6 year daily rainfall time series i e 2010 2015 3 2 hydrodynamic model a tidal river flow can rarely appear in steady condition thus hec ras unsteady flow analysis was carried out for tide simulation of karnafuli river an inaccurate choice of time steps and cross section spacing is the possible reason for model instability baldassarre et al 2009 samuels 1989 suggested a guideline for optimal cross sections i e 6 δ x kb where b is bankfull surface width of the main channel m and k is a constant ranges from 10 to 20 to obtain optimal number of cross sections for unsteady flow simulation based on an estimation of backwater flow samuels 1989 as 7 δ x 0 2 1 f 2 s d 0 2 d s when f 2 0 a uniform cross section spacing of an interval 1000 m satisfies eq 7 for hec ras river geometry brunner 2006 described a method to select time steps δ t for medium to large rivers as 8 δ t t r 20 where tr is the time of rise of the flood wave h several time steps in incremental order 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 h were tested model stability was obtained at a time step of 0 5 h and chosen as model time steps as earlier node link set to compute the hydrograph as previous steps for the intended modeling only karnafuli river was considered in hec ras platform the hydraulic modeling in hec ras needs upstream hydrograph as boundary condition and swmm was coupled with the model for producing runoff hydrograph fig 5 to the connected tributaries to ensure homogenous hydraulic routing and channel geometry in both models i e swmm and hec ras environments the cross section spacing was tested at similar regular intervals 1000 m for both tributaries and main stream contraction and expansion coefficients were considered as 0 1 and 0 3 respectively following brunner 2006 the simulation of hydrodynamic consists of 2 parts a firstly the hec ras model run using steady state analysis to prepare initial boundary condition of hec ras unsteady flow and b then the hec ras model run for unsteady stage the upstream boundary condition was defined by flow hydrograph at cross section cs 1 and lateral inflow hydrographs fig 5 at the tributaries those are connected to main stream fig 4 the downstream boundary condition was defined as stage hydrograph at outfall fig 4 to simulate tidal flow during 2010 2015 3 3 habitat simulation model a number of factors i e water temperatures water depth substrate size flow velocity suspended sediment concentration need to be considered as ecological habitat factor one dimensional phabsim and two dimensional river 2d http www river2d ualberta ca were selected for habitat simulation both models are based on a hydraulic model that uses preference curves considering eco factors such as water depth water temperature flow velocity and substrate size river 2d model comprise of continuity equation and two components of the momentum vector eqs 9 11 steffler and blackburn 2002 9 h

collected from 4 survey points table 1 to set up river 2d model the restoration reaches were divided into 568 elements and 370 nodes to form a triangular irregular network tin such finite element based model predicts the location of water edges from interpolation of three points of adjacent tin elements a new node of interpolated bathymetry inserted in the areas of significant topographic variations viz steep banks pools etc this approach can orient smallest elements on narrow necked down cross sections and the largest tin elements on the large pool following holmquist and waddle 2013 a number of discharges obtained from the flow duration curve fdc were defined at inflow sections and depth discharge relationship was derived in outflow locations fig 8 such approach reduces the varying discharge effect on the outflow section during modeling contribution of groundwater and tributaries losses were ignored as those were already accounted in the hydrologic modeling i e swmm similar cross section orientation was adopted both in hec ras and phabsim considering streams as rectangular cells with the constant depth and flow velocity according to wu and wang 2006 this assumption maintains parallel streamlines and neglect transverse eddy as flow characteristics i e flow depth flow velocity and stage discharge relationship were obtained from hec ras these can be used for hydraulic modeling in phabsim mean column velocity method was used to simulate cell velocity of the selected reach advantage of using this model is the incremental analysis that can predict and quantify the impact of hydrologic alterations on targeted species nikghalb et al 2016 had developed an approach for hec ras 1d channel average velocity to distribute for each cell in the phabsim the cell velocity vi mod obtained from the average velocity eq 12 the associated parameters are the manning s roughness coefficient n hydraulic radius of each cell hd or r and weighted discharge q of each

catla catla catla mrigala cirrhinus mrigala and rohi labeo rohita spawn in this region and reported as key ecological indicator thus environmental flow of the selected regime was investigated based on the habitat suitability of those species fish and other aquatic organisms usually susceptible to a certain ranges of stream velocity water depth and bed substrate eco hydraulic model i e phabsim have a key assumption that consider habitat suitability of a regime based on the velocity depth and substrate size and the representative index are known as habitat suitability index hsi tsai et al 1981 investigated hydrological conditions and water quality conditions during spawning of major carps at lower parts of the halda river and from this study the habitat suitability curve hsc for the targeted species was developed fig 6 hsi were obtained from the hsc curve fig 6 for the targeted species on a scale of 0 1 im and kang 2011 hsi for the three carp species was assumed similar from previous study recommendation akter and ali 2012 lucas et al 2001 the substrate size was determined from field survey and these can be engaged in channel index determination field survey was conducted during spawning season at low tide period on a sunny day to assign the channel index the substrate size was visually determined at spatial scale varying 10 30 m those nodes locations were identified from common points of bathymetry 3 3 2 estimation of ecological flow rate minimum environmental flow was obtained from the phabsim using hscs that relate habitat indicators i e the wua with the hydraulic variables water depth and stream velocity then the optimum ecological flow rate was estimated through flow wua relationship following aguilar and polo 2016 the wua can be obtained by multiplying the area of each cell by its suitability index value as 15 wua i 1 n a i c i where a i is an area of cell i and c i is the combined hsi of cell i the combined hsi c i is a suitability criterion with a combination of hsi of depth velocity and substrate size i e 16 c i γ v i γ d i γ c i where γ v i γ d i and γ c i are hsi function of cell i regarding velocity depth of flow and substrate size respectively 3 4 statistical analysis of the model outcome swmm generated hydrograph at tributary cst 1 was validated using available dataset from bwdb stream gauge station fig 5 observed water level from the 2 tidal gauge stations were collected and compared to evaluate model performance those stations were khal no 18 cs 32 and khal no 10 cs 27 and they located respectively 5 km and 11 km from the mouth of estuary fig 4 model performance was evaluated using a matrix of error statistics the criteria to evaluate the hydrologic and hydraulic model performances were percent bias pbais root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as 17 pbais 100 i 1 n x o x m i i 1 n x o i 18 rsr i 1 n x o x m 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 19 rmse 1 n x i m x i o 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n x i o x i m 2 i 1 n x i o x o 2 here mean observed value x o 1 n i 1 n x i o n is the total data points of field observations x i m is the modeled value and x i o is the observed value the negative mean error indicates the model under predicted the water level this statistical analysis is used to characterize the quality and evaluation of model performance nse value ranges from to 1 and a perfect match between observed and simulated value is 1 hence the model predicted flow show reasonable agreement as all stations show nse above 0 9 for validation nse value of two tide gauges stations i e cs 32 and cs 27 shows a decrement from 0 99 to 0 93 indicates that water level prediction towards inland show slight deviation pbais values show the average tendency of the simulated value and found within 10 table 4 at flow gauge cst 1 positive value represents bias towards overestimation and negative value at cs 17 indicates underestimation this can be concluded that the swmm prediction has slightly overestimation on flow and hec ras underestimated discharge at selected gauge within allowable limit sediment transport change cross sectional value by erosion or deposition showed influence on the simulated water levels or low flows prediction following saleh et al 2013 this can be concluded that the topography obtained from the field survey should improve at regular time interval considering geomorphological change thus the model could predict water level and discharge reasonably 4 results 4 1 estimation of flow duration curve fdc and selected discharge as hydraulic habitat feature karnafuli river has prominent semi diurnal tide effect and from hec ras simulation it was observed that discharge reduce rapidly towards inland for instance during simulation period maximum flow was found 4000 m3 s at outfall and it was reduced to 250 m3 s at cs 10 located 27 km away from mouth fig 4 due to semi diurnal fluctuations during flood tide saline water flow from sea to the inland thus flow in this direction was assumed as positive and opposite appeared as negative flow fig 7c establishing a stage discharge relationship in a tidal river is difficult as it usually took form of looped curve and for fewer water level fluctuation and unidirectional analysis it can be adopted for a flood or ebb tide the spawning ground was located at a distance of 27 km from the sea mouth stage discharge relationship can be established as water level ranges from 2 5 to 4 m flood tide was considered due to a unidirectional flow is a prerequisite condition for phabsim hydraulic modeling flow duration curve fdc during flood tide was obtained from a period of simulated flow positive discharge against a cumulative percentage of flows in an ungauged tidal river observed time series are less available and flow variability is high thus simulated flow time series are desirable to derive a fdc to cover entire range of flow of a representative regime fdc can provide a holistic concept from a long term flow variability as well as unknown flow occurrence probability however hec data storage system hec dssv2 model was used to perform statistical analysis from a flow time series obtained from hec ras during flood tide period using the math function of dss tool the discharges during 2010 2015 for the corresponding regime ranked according to the percent flow exceeds or equaled and finally fdc curve were derived fig 8 from fdc curve during high tide the flow ranges were determined and a series of flow alternates were produced for determination of suitable ef several discharges were selected and relative information about their velocity and depth obtained from stage discharge and velocity discharge relationship establishing reasonable correlation co efficient obtained from flood tide table 5 4 2 estimation of ecological flow rate the obtained flow range was simulated in phabsim and river 2d to determine suitable ef against the optimal wua suitable discharge was obtained from phabsim that can be determined for spawning season of major carps was 30 1 m3 s figs 9 and 10c on the other hand river 2d predicts the optimum ef as 25 m3 s with the increase of discharge several parts of reach attain high velocity and water depth and the spawning ground gradually lost the appropriate situation of spawning except near bank as there are less water depth and velocity fig 10d extreme flow event like flooding discharge interrupt spawning suitability of major indian carps initially the wua increases with discharge and while the maximum discharge of 25 m3 s obtained this implies the suitable instream flow to maintain healthy ecology fig 9 from the selected discharge table 5 wua found decreases except two flow case i e 75 m3 s and 200 m3 s the ci at different discharge reveals the formation of different sizes riffle make this spawning ground more suitable during low discharge fig 10 a c it has been already detected the flow components like magnitude duration frequency timing of low flows are closely related with different aquatic process of eco hydrology for stream flow alterations hydrologic model swmm was applied considering anthropogenic changes like land use that are frequently ignored in conventional hydrologic modeling there is some discrepancy while low flow simulation as model overestimates low flow stage this is due to most of the hydraulic model is based on flood wave routing thus low flow event simulation performances are not completely reliable multi objective calibration approach of hydrologic model can be applied for stream flow generations to capture entire flow regime characteristics although all cross sections were acquired from bwdb and cpa surveyed dataset stage and discharge prediction from hec ras was affected at different stations possibly due to sediment deposition of those cross sections as a result cross sections got shortened and predicted discharges were less than actual discharge one of the aims of the study was to define long term flow time series and flow ranges of ungauged tidal karnafuli river where flow monitoring was not available to determine the flow ranges this model can also be applied for unidirectional river after calibration the flow ranges of flood tide 15 1 m3 s 245 m3 s were obtained more than the ebb tide period 23 1 m3 s 187 5 m3 s due to inability to simulate bidirectional flow in phabsim ef analyzed considering flow ranges of flood tide as unidirectional river wua decreased sharply after the discharge 30 1 m3 s and with the increase of discharge corresponding velocity and depth increases which made ci less this resulted unsuitable flow for the major carps spawning less turbulent place might be preferable to the major carps and areas of deep pool during spawning season which located within 1000 m from upstream fig 10a water depth velocity and substrate size were considered as dominant eco factor for determining suitable ecological flow rate other eco factors i e water temperatures suspended sediment concentration etc was not considered in model development variations in habitat predictions between phabsim and river2d habitat simulation model may be occurred due to longitudinal variation of depth velocity or velocity distribution while model simulation again inadequate substrate mapping may influence the obtained results from river 2d preference curve method of habitat simulation using phabsim and river 2d was preferred in this study this needs further development while engaging in ef assessment although this method sensitive to preference curve and usually showed high hsi but variation in same trend relatively other method such as generalized additive model data driven fuzzy logic model yi et al 2016 thus prediction of ef thresholds might not be affected by this method previous studies reveal that the human activity with different hydraulic structures like dam sluice gate bridges etc influences the ecosystem yao et al 2015 sun et al 2015 boavida et al 2015 thus the recommended ef 25 30 1 m3 s at depth of 3 5 4 2 m from long term stage discharge relationship has to maintain without any human interruption moreover the optimal meteorological hydrodynamic and several water quality parameters were suggested to maintain ef table 6 4 3 kaptai dam operational influence on habitat conditions kaptai dam is an earth fill dam covering a reservoir area of 777 sq km and control annual inflow runoff of approximately 15 646 million cubic meters with its 16 gated spillways noman 1997 from estimated fdc curve two high flows 200 and 225 m3 s was tested to represent peak released discharge impact on habitat condition fig 10g and h wua was quantified within 48 000 61 000 m2 for high upstream flow i e 200 m3 s after then a sharp decrease of wua was observed against further increment of discharge fig 10 the dam released discharge distributed partially through ichamoti river a tributary of karnafuli river and several stakeholders i e water treatment plants karnafuli irrigation projects and numerous industries it was difficult to determine the direct impact of dam released discharge on restoration site as the study area was 32 km downstream of kaptai dam unknown amount of water withdrawal of those stakeholders from released discharge and inadequate data moreover due to absence of semi diurnal effect and dominant non tidal regime this portion of karnafuli river was beyond the scope of this study although indirect dam impact was considered to achieve flow hydrograph at cs 1 fig 4 table 1 as upstream discharge contribution existing reservoir operation rule are divided into two parts first part august october utilizes the reservoir for the storage period to refill the reservoir at potential level 33 4 m above mean sea level for power generation and the rest for the drawdown period november through july fig 11 during the spawning period of carp fish april june peak released discharge was found 400 450 m3 s and it can disperse the restoration site providing fish access to floodplain present dam operation mode was set with an objective to generate hydroelectric power and protect the downstream from riverine flooding hence the integration of operation rule curve needs improvement to resemble suitable ecological habitat condition hydrologic alteration induced by dam can be indicated by low flow or high flow varied from their occurrence frequency duration and pulse richter and thomas 2007 rapid fluctuations of water level have negative consequences on the brood egg washing away from spawning ground furthermore such high discharge can be recommended after prolonged dry weather to assist this restoration site reducing salinity amount and other water quality parameter at suitable level dam released discharge should control during high tide to avoid the high flow in restoration site if the hydropower dam can be operated in daily basis at the same rate of kaptai reservoir inflow the ef could be unchanged due to sudden high released discharge 5 conclusions this ef assessment was carried with a modeling framework comprised of hydrological hydraulic and habitat models those are commonly used for water management the model framework can be applied in both unidirectional and tidal river after calibration and validation moreover habitat simulation methods required considering more abiotic factors i e water quality and meteorological conditions to predict ef ranges to achieve ef optimum habitat conditions were suggested combining present study and expert recommendations table 6 fundamental concepts of eloha framework were followed but conceptualized following hydrologic process of an ungauged semi diurnal tidal regime model performance was reasonable below 10 error and discrepancies probably arose from proper tidal simulation despite these achievements few attempts were suggested for future ef assessment as for sparsely gauged regions establishment of eloha framework is a concerning issue due to prediction accuracy thus regionalization of stream flow characteristics was done on physical characteristics of watershed additionally prediction uncertainties can be reduced by multi objective optimization for hydrologic process zhang et al 2008 as flow characteristics in semi diurnal regime usually dominated by tidal characteristics a hydrodynamic model needs to integrate while simulating overall processes in this study the flow regime characteristics of tidal karnafuli river were derived with a modeling framework principally dominated by tidal nature the method described in this study will facilitate a model based study to obtain historical flow that can be employed as an assessment tool of ungauged river basin management in fact the flow regime of tidal river can be characterized by a spring tide and a neap tide occurred twice in a lunar month and considering tidal variation in a year may be sufficient for simulation period uncertainties should consider from extreme events i e storm surge and sea level rise as the tide range has prominent influence over those source as some parts of the watershed were already urbanized the swmm model was employed to simulate the relative contribution of upstream runoff for low flow simulation the modeling framework also consider the seepage loss from channel land use change and bottom friction domination in tidal decay applying a hydrologic model showed reasonable representation in hydrologic alteration in this study the statistical analysis on flow components was carried out to define the range of flow regime finally phabsim and river 2d were used to determine ef based on the preference curve method the minimum instream flow requirements for major carps spawning was found 25 30 1 m3 s at depth of 3 5 4 2 m the simulated ef during the flood tide is 25 30 1 m3 s i e around 10 12 of mean annual runoff viz 245 m3 s this outcome reasonably match with the minimum flow requirement as 10 flow of the mean annual runoff defined by acreman et al 2000 for the managed flood and river flow from water quality perspective the fish spawning of carp fish found sensitive to salinity concentration during dry weather the salinity intrusion may be reduced from the released discharge of dam but should not exceed flow 100 m3 s for habitat simulation river2d considers spatial flow variability and prediction of habitat availability performed better compare to the phabsim the prediction accuracy of habitat simulation requires improvement using frequent fish sampling and survey on predicted hotspot these areas of improvement can briefly synthesized by two categories i e tidal hydrodynamic and required dataset includes bathymetry streamflow and carp fish habitat related ecological information water managers and scientific community can work together to overcome those limitations acknowledgements the research was supported by funds provided by center for river harbor and landslide research crhlsr chittagong university of engineering and technology

7463,due to shortage of flow monitoring data in ungauged semidiurnal river environmental flow ef determination based on its key component minimum low flow is always difficult for ef assessment this study selected a reach immediately after the halda karnafuli confluence a unique breeding ground for indian carp fishes of bangladesh as part of an ungauged tidal river ef threshold establishment faces challenges in changing ecological paradigms with periodic change of tides and hydrologic alterations this study describes a novel approach through modeling framework comprising hydrological hydrodynamic and habitat simulation model the ef establishment was conceptualized according to the hydrologic process of an ungauged semi diurnal tidal regime in four steps initially a hydrologic model coupled with a hydrodynamic model to simulate flow considering land use changes effect on streamflow seepage loss of channel friction dominated tidal decay as well as lack of long term flow characteristics secondly to define hydraulic habitat feature a statistical analysis on derived flow data was performed to identify habitat suitability thirdly to observe the ecological habitat behavior based on the identified hydrologic alteration hydraulic habitat features were investigated finally based on the combined habitat suitability index flow alteration and ecological response relationship was established then the obtained ef provides a set of low flow indices of desired regime and thus the obtained discharge against maximum weighted usable area wua was defined as ef threshold for the selected reach a suitable ef regime condition was obtained within flow range 25 30 1 m3 s i e around 10 12 of the mean annual runoff of 245 m3 s and these findings are within researchers recommendation of minimum flow requirement additionally it was observed that tidal characteristics are dominant process in semi diurnal regime however during the study period 2010 2015 the validated model with those reported observations can provide guidance for the decision support system dss to maintain ef range in an ungauged tidal river keywords tidal process flow components habitat simulation ungauged rivers 1 introduction low flow is a seasonal phenomenon during prolonged dry weather and could be resulted from the human regulation on natural stream the low flow of a stream could result adverse effect on the entire ecosystem and environmental flow ef can be an approach to mitigate this issue efs are defined as quantity quality and timing of water flow to sustain estuarine and freshwater ecosystem and maintain stakeholders livelihood brisbane declaration 2007 in two decades ef management becomes a vital issue for the river management as flow restoration serves biotic function to drive every step in the life cycle of the ecological habitat arthington et al 2006 fanaian et al 2015 waddle 2012 poff and zimmerman 2010 to sustain freshwater ecosystem at regional scale ecological limits of hydrologic alterations eloha an ecologically coherent framework was developed for the effective ef management poff et al 2010 richter 2010 richter et al 2012 eloha comprises of two processes i e scientific and social to reinforce hydrologic alteration with ecosystem management and confirmed social participation for ef implementation this flexible eloha framework can fit with a regional scale application following four steps i e a basin wide hydrologic and ecologic database development b identification of distinctive flow regime with hydrologic indices having ecological significance c hydrologic alteration determination comparing current and idealized habitat conditions d link up ecological response with obtained hydrologic alteration overall the eloha framework has dependence on extensive hydrologic and ecologic database although those may often unavailable for ungauged stream regional regression analysis can be applied for the ungauged stream while reference flow gauges are available with continuous historical records zhang et al 2016 however applying this method is rather difficult task in a trans boundary tidal river basin with limited reference flow gauge information this hindrance might be overcome using a hydrologic model to investigate long term flow characteristics with identification of ecologically relevant hydrologic indices richter et al 2012 ef assessment particularly in an ungauged tidal regime faces a number of difficulties for instance topographical datasets play a significant role in hydrodynamic results as well as prediction accuracy of river discharge saksena and merwade 2015 on the other hand hydrodynamic process of tidal river is a complex phenomenon relies upon the upstream freshwater inflow and downstream tide the estuary ecology flood routing and the relevant parameters were governed by the periodic changes of water level or tide pattern viz semidiurnal diurnal or mixed of both sun et al 2015 to conduct ef assessment hydrologic model should consider land use change and hydrodynamic model should pose responsive behavior in groundwater interaction with surface water and therefore should consider seepage loss generally ef assessments in a river carried out using four methods i e representing in hydrological methodologies habitat simulation method hydraulic rating and holistic methodologies all of these methods are dependent on long term flow monitoring whereas in a tidal river basin ecological processes are regulated by five basic components i e magnitude frequency duration timing and changing rate of hydrologic conditions during both high and low tides poff et al 1997 aguilar and polo 2016 numerical models can be applied for a particular regime to avail those historical databases and hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras is one of the frequently used models in this regard recently hickey et al 2015 introduced ecosystem functions model hec efm to translate flow statistical results of hec ras in an ecology function relationship to assess aquatic habitat suitability of river on the other hand mouton et al 2007 presented an integrated modeling approach combining a 1d hydraulic model based on the hec ras software and the fish habitat module of casimir a fuzzy logic based eco hydraulic modeling system to simulate and assess ecological effects of physical habitat changes in rivers due to capability of backwater simulation tsihrintzis et al 2007 has adopted storm water management model swmm model for management decisions on coastal lagoon through evaluating alternative scenarios to increase tidal flushing and water residence time to evaluate spawning suitability of chinese sturgeon in yangtze river basin in china a generalized additive method with a 2d hydrodynamic model showed well response yi et al 2016 recently based on the fish preference curves a combination of hydrodynamic and heat transfer model was coupled to obtain habitat suitability yao et al 2015 an artificial neural network was also applied to forecast the habitat suitability and ef assessment in coastal harbor and river environment watts et al 2011 olden et al 2004 unfortunately those data driven methods involved with flow regime characteristics are often fail to apply on ungauged streams with limited historical dataset ef estimation is also possible from synthetic streamflow time series in deterministic simulation approach in this approach rainfall runoff models are usually involved to convert catchment rainfall to a continuous streamflow smakhtin 2001 to develop ef standards of an ungauged stream a hydrologic model is an ultimate requirement for providing reasonable estimation of flow to serve as a source of required long term database establishing hydrologic alteration linkage with ecological response can be done following the biodiversity behavior and ef sensitivity the behavior of ecological habitat like carp fish in tidal regime has dependence on tidal cycle spawning of those species depends on high tide low discharge and moonlight conditions tsai et al 1981 the water temperature and salinity modify their migration pattern and they often prefer to a less tidal brackish regime in late spring for spawning lucas et al 2001 such ecological conditions can be prioritized in habitat simulation model globally among 207 methodologies of instream flow assessment in 44 countries habitat simulation method is the second most frequently ef assessment method tharme 2003 this is the widespread adopted method applied frequently either in a knowledge based or a data driven approach with quantitative results of combined suitability index c i and introduced with application software like physical habitat simulation system phabsim jung and choi 2015 aguilar and polo 2016 fornaroli et al 2016 yi et al 2014 woo 2010 phabsim is capable to correlate hydraulic model with biological model that identifies suitable habitat criteria based on the relationship of discharge and weighted usable area wua i e surface area based on composite probability of c i to indicate relative habitat suitability ayllón et al 2012 alternatively 2d hydraulic and habitat model like river 2d has been suggested in channel bottom friction dominated scenario during low tide or low flow as an improvement of ef prediction qin et al 2016 rivaes et al 2015 steffler and ali 2012 lee et al 2010 thus considering sensitivity to microhabitat variables 2d models can perform better for spatial distribution phenomena for wua and c i determination this study of ef assessment was primarily focused on its key component minimum flow requirement of semi diurnal karnafuli river based on its ecological habitat for carp fish moreover optimum meteorological factors along with the hydraulic conditions and water quality parameters play crucial role in ef maintenance riverine ecology commonly impaired by hydrologic alterations but for tidal river the ef assessment and flow standards need further intensive studies this research aimed to develop a flexible modeling framework to establish environmental flow threshold in ungauged semi diurnal tidal regime through flow characterization i e high low flow of tidal regime from the representative flow duration and thus finally obtain the optimum hydraulic conditions for suitable ef therefore a comprehensive modeling framework was required to establish following the fundamental ef assessment concepts of eloha so initially a hydrologic model i e swmm combined with hydrodynamic model hec ras to overcome several difficulties of existing ef assessment in ungauged streams i e scarcity of long term flow characteristics land cover land use changes effect on streamflow seepage loss of channel friction dominated tidal decay then to define hydraulic habitat feature a statistical analysis on derived flow data was performed focusing key ecological habitat carp fish furthermore to characterize the ecological habitat behavior under several flow conditions using habitat simulation model phabsim and river2d on wua basis those ecologically relevant flow was examined and suitable hydraulic conditions were proposed finally based on combined habitat suitability index flow alteration and ecologic response relationship was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karnafuli river exists in the south eastern part of bangladesh is the largest and most important river in chittagong region originating from the lushai hills in mizoram india the karnafuli flows 270 km southwest through the chittagong hill tracts and chittagong and finally disposes to the bay of bengal as per bangladesh meteorological department bmd the annual rainfall amount is 3000 mm of which 80 experienced during monsoon period june september according to the chittagong port authority cpa on an average the width of the river is about 667 m typical tidal range in a semi diurnal period 12 hr 28 min at the river estuary was observed with tide level of 1 5 m during low tide that reaches 5 5 m during high tide the water level gradually passes through non tidal regime at kaptai located a distance of 62 km from the river mouth and show daily variation of 1 2 m 1 8 m fig 1 based on semi diurnal tidal nature the hydrodynamic study considered lower 41 km of karnafuli river and 12 km of lower parts of halda river this covers a catchment area of about 310 km2 the hydrologic alteration of this area was tested on the restoration site selected at 32 km downstream of the kaptai dam up to karnafuli halda confluence based on the ecological indictors i e major indian carps fig 1 so the outlet discharge of kaptai dam has an influence on the aquatic community of this regime and thus there is an influence on the lower part of the halda river this area usually treated as nursery ground of major carps during spawning season april june as those fishes migrates from upper reach to this zone tsai et al 1981 akter and ali 2012 this is the only pure indian carp breeding field in bangladesh and possibly in south asia however due to habitat alteration the major carp production declined from 2470 kg in 1945 to 20 kg in the year 2004 and then slightly increased to 47 kg in 2015 moef 2015 this declination is possibly due to excess exploitation for supplying water to adjacent chittagong city rainfall pattern change suitable climatic conditions for spawning increasing salinity amount changed geomorphology by sand extraction and others 2 2 data preparation to avail the historical flow time series for the spawning ground fig 1 a combination of rainfall runoff and hydraulic model was adopted during the study period 2010 15 hydrological and meteorological parameters were derived to set up swmm model tables 1 and 2 the rainfall runoff model swmm was engaged to acquire tributaries runoff contribution and then applied as upstream boundary condition in hec ras finally tidal simulation in hec ras was performed with downstream boundary conditions of stage hydrograph 2 2 1 hydrological parameters hydrologic parameters were derived to incorporate in usepa s swmm an extension of geographic information system gis called hec geohms executed to delineate watershed boundary and stream network through terrain preprocessing using aster gdem as origin of topography stream network was obtained through this process table 1 the area threshold method was used to delineate watershed and stream network as the input dem in a gridded nature the steps followed in hec geohms terrain preprocessing was as a dem reconditioning using karnafuli river streamline b sink filling c flow accumulation grid generation based on computed flow direction d development of stream link grid based on flow direction and stream grid and e obtaining catchment grid along with associated stream link to obtain watershed boundaries then the model parameters i e slope s and imperviousness i were derived from spatial data table 1 as well as from the available literatures table 2 the width parameter refers to the width of overland flow path for sheet flow runoff and thus the overland flow width fw m was determined as ahiablame and shakya 2016 1 fw a l where a m2 is the catchment area and l m is the length of the overland flow path calculated from obtained hec geohms watershed analysis in this study land use and land cover lulc map fig 2 a and b were prepared considering four land use criteria viz vegetation barren land including cultivated lands without crops water body and built up area through the supervised classification by erdas imagine software in supervised classification spectral signatures were collected from specified locations training sites in the image by digitizing various polygons overlaying different land use types spectral signatures were classified following the knowledge based expert classification systems depending on the reference google earth maps to improve the accuracy of the classification process for a large study area this approach provides a reasonable accuracy two satellite images table 2 were used to determine built up area i e the imperviousness percentage and curve number eq 2 kappa coefficient is an accuracy assessment measure of predicted landuse pixel thus the consistency between the classified lulc map and reference maps google earth images field data represented by kappa coefficient that was determined by classification error and found within the range between 1 and 1 foody 2010 lulc in 2010 and 2015 were assessed by available high resolution google earth images on may 5 2010 and april 4 2015 respectively here 30 random points for each type of layer were sampled and compared with the available lulc thus the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient was respectively 81 and 0 79 for the lulc map 2010 applying similar approach for the lulc map 2015 overall accuracy and kappa coefficient was obtained 83 67 and 0 82 respectively however a variation of barren land pixel was observed between two lulc maps due to time period of image acquisition from the field survey it was reported that the crop period of irrigation field responsible for these variation in vegetation and barren field pixel the mean slope of each watershed has determined using zonal analysis mean in arc gis spatial analysis the soil conservation service scs method was selected for analysis as i this is the commonly used method in watershed to quantify landuse effect on runoff and provides reasonable results ii its calculation is made easier by the fact that only a few variables need to be estimated hydrologic soil group land use and slope and iii despite its simplicity it yields reasonable results compare to the complex models lastra et al 2008 modified scs equations eq 2 to suit indian subcontinents conditions were used in this study as suriya and mudgal

as well as the effective rainfall 2 2 2 hydraulic properties channel topography of stream network was exchanged from dem to prepare hydraulic input using hec georas preprocessing for hydrodynamic modeling using hec ras total 32 cross sections based on continuous field survey by cpa were engaged table 1 due to the low resolution i e 30 m of dem all cross sections were reconstructed based on surveyed cross sections by the bwdb and cpa cross sections were assumed representative as uniform within 1000 m in tributaries in pre processing the acquired dem was used as grid layer and processed to create channel geometry as this was required in swmm cross sections were digitized perpendicular to the path of flow in the channels the bank lines were manually checked with google earth as base map and they are manually relocated for channel seepage loss causes significant amount reduction of discharge aquifer to channel flux was ignored as the groundwater table was assumed below the river bed moreover the karnafuli river is a perennial stream and so groundwater flux in streamflow can be ignored seepage loss rate in each river cross section was computed using eq 4 and then further converted to seepage loss rate as per eq 5 garg 2007 4 δ q b d 2 3 200 where δq channel losses m3 s per km length of channel b bed width of the channel m d depth of water in the channel m 5 q δ q 3600 1000 p l q is the seepage loss rate mm h p is wetted perimeter of the channel m l is the conduit length m as the tide pattern of the karnafuli river is semi diurnal 6 h interval water level time series were used as downstream boundary condition in the hec ras during 2010 2015 table 1 to account the river flow from upstream areas of watershed boundary at node cs 1 fig 4 a 6 h discharge time series were collected table 1 3 model set up for the selected study area swmm model was preferred to derive rainfall hydrograph and to conduct hydrological routing for tributaries as tidal effect is not significant hydrological routing model is advantageous where morphology varies at small scale and can also be used at larger scale with limited topography information fekete et al 2001 thus to observe the ecological responses with hydrologic alteration a hydrologic model swmm was used to derive upstream contribution over river flow for the karnafuli river 1d hydrodynamic model hec ras was used due to significant tidal effect fig 4 again in this condition a detailed study on a hydrological model would provide misleading information as these models assume uniform velocity or a constant velocity throughout the large conduit ignoring topographic variation saleh et al 2013 the dynamic mechanism of unsteady flow is also ease in simulation in a hydrodynamic model hec ras unsteady flow simulation was carried to avail the sensitive flow components then the bidirectional hydrodynamic process of tidal river was analyzed separately as unidirectional river while habitat simulation method was also engaged i e phabsim and river 2d overall model set up process was shown in fig 3 and the measured data was detailed in table 1 3 1 hydrologic model most of the parts of karnafuli river are ungauged and the available gauge data already involved in the hydrologic model so it is advantageous to integrate a rainfall runoff model with a hydrodynamic model the preliminary purpose of this integration is to define the upstream boundary condition of hydrodynamic model hec ras usepa swmm is a link node model used to route in the tributaries and thus it can drive inflow hydrograph at desired gauge location of river tsihrintzis et al 2007 application of swmm found in real time optimal behavior as well as flood hazard risk mapping ilker et al 2008 mohammad et al 2016 the model has a wide variety of application including hydrologic and hydraulic capabilities i e flow routing through closed and open conduit networks of unlimited size backwater effect simulation surface ponding flood modeling and flood reduction with low impact development lid kelly and james 2009 rossman 2010 kenneth et al 2008 described an automatic calibration method of swmm model for large watershed incorporating gis with swmm this optimization method was applied to determine the hydrologic parameters and described in section 2 2 1 the topography of the study area was created by combining stream lines defined by hec geohms the watershed boundary was created using hec geohms and river center lines cross section cut lines bank lines those were predefined by hec geo ras fig 4 the inputs to the model are a the geometry with the numbering nodes and links as hec georas b for each conduit lengths maximum depths invert elevation c manning s roughness coefficient nc for each conduit and d the bathymetric information acquired from field survey e the inflow hydrograph at node cs 1 fig 4 to specify control fig 3 of relative runoff contribution of from upstream areas to river flow as karnafuli has its origin outside watershed boundary hydrological parameters imperviousness depression storage width and manning s co efficient for overland flow slope were incorporated in the model interface dynamic wave routing method with a time steps of 30 s was used to simulate the model for 6 year daily rainfall time series i e 2010 2015 3 2 hydrodynamic model a tidal river flow can rarely appear in steady condition thus hec ras unsteady flow analysis was carried out for tide simulation of karnafuli river an inaccurate choice of time steps and cross section spacing is the possible reason for model instability baldassarre et al 2009 samuels 1989 suggested a guideline for optimal cross sections i e 6 δ x kb where b is bankfull surface width of the main channel m and k is a constant ranges from 10 to 20 to obtain optimal number of cross sections for unsteady flow simulation based on an estimation of backwater flow samuels 1989 as 7 δ x 0 2 1 f 2 s d 0 2 d s when f 2 0 a uniform cross section spacing of an interval 1000 m satisfies eq 7 for hec ras river geometry brunner 2006 described a method to select time steps δ t for medium to large rivers as 8 δ t t r 20 where tr is the time of rise of the flood wave h several time steps in incremental order 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 4 h were tested model stability was obtained at a time step of 0 5 h and chosen as model time steps as earlier node link set to compute the hydrograph as previous steps for the intended modeling only karnafuli river was considered in hec ras platform the hydraulic modeling in hec ras needs upstream hydrograph as boundary condition and swmm was coupled with the model for producing runoff hydrograph fig 5 to the connected tributaries to ensure homogenous hydraulic routing and channel geometry in both models i e swmm and hec ras environments the cross section spacing was tested at similar regular intervals 1000 m for both tributaries and main stream contraction and expansion coefficients were considered as 0 1 and 0 3 respectively following brunner 2006 the simulation of hydrodynamic consists of 2 parts a firstly the hec ras model run using steady state analysis to prepare initial boundary condition of hec ras unsteady flow and b then the hec ras model run for unsteady stage the upstream boundary condition was defined by flow hydrograph at cross section cs 1 and lateral inflow hydrographs fig 5 at the tributaries those are connected to main stream fig 4 the downstream boundary condition was defined as stage hydrograph at outfall fig 4 to simulate tidal flow during 2010 2015 3 3 habitat simulation model a number of factors i e water temperatures water depth substrate size flow velocity suspended sediment concentration need to be considered as ecological habitat factor one dimensional phabsim and two dimensional river 2d http www river2d ualberta ca were selected for habitat simulation both models are based on a hydraulic model that uses preference curves considering eco factors such as water depth water temperature flow velocity and substrate size river 2d model comprise of continuity equation and two components of the momentum vector eqs 9 11 steffler and blackburn 2002 9 h

collected from 4 survey points table 1 to set up river 2d model the restoration reaches were divided into 568 elements and 370 nodes to form a triangular irregular network tin such finite element based model predicts the location of water edges from interpolation of three points of adjacent tin elements a new node of interpolated bathymetry inserted in the areas of significant topographic variations viz steep banks pools etc this approach can orient smallest elements on narrow necked down cross sections and the largest tin elements on the large pool following holmquist and waddle 2013 a number of discharges obtained from the flow duration curve fdc were defined at inflow sections and depth discharge relationship was derived in outflow locations fig 8 such approach reduces the varying discharge effect on the outflow section during modeling contribution of groundwater and tributaries losses were ignored as those were already accounted in the hydrologic modeling i e swmm similar cross section orientation was adopted both in hec ras and phabsim considering streams as rectangular cells with the constant depth and flow velocity according to wu and wang 2006 this assumption maintains parallel streamlines and neglect transverse eddy as flow characteristics i e flow depth flow velocity and stage discharge relationship were obtained from hec ras these can be used for hydraulic modeling in phabsim mean column velocity method was used to simulate cell velocity of the selected reach advantage of using this model is the incremental analysis that can predict and quantify the impact of hydrologic alterations on targeted species nikghalb et al 2016 had developed an approach for hec ras 1d channel average velocity to distribute for each cell in the phabsim the

catla catla catla mrigala cirrhinus mrigala and rohi labeo rohita spawn in this region and reported as key ecological indicator thus environmental flow of the selected regime was investigated based on the habitat suitability of those species fish and other aquatic organisms usually susceptible to a certain ranges of stream velocity water depth and bed substrate eco hydraulic model i e phabsim have a key assumption that consider habitat suitability of a regime based on the velocity depth and substrate size and the representative index are known as habitat suitability index hsi tsai et al 1981 investigated hydrological conditions and water quality conditions during spawning of major carps at lower parts of the halda river and from this study the habitat suitability curve hsc for the targeted species was developed fig 6 hsi were obtained from the hsc curve fig 6 for the targeted species on a scale of 0 1 im and kang 2011 hsi for the three carp species was assumed similar from previous study recommendation akter and ali 2012 lucas et al 2001 the substrate size was determined from field survey and these can be engaged in channel index determination field survey was conducted during spawning season at low tide period on a sunny day to assign the channel index the substrate size was visually determined at spatial scale varying 10 30 m those nodes locations were identified from common points of bathymetry 3 3 2 estimation of ecological flow rate minimum environmental flow was obtained from the phabsim using hscs that relate habitat indicators i e the wua with the hydraulic variables water depth and stream velocity then the optimum ecological flow rate was estimated through flow wua relationship following aguilar and polo 2016 the wua can be obtained by multiplying the area of each cell by its suitability index value as 15 wua i 1 n a i c i where a i is an area of cell i and c i is the combined hsi of cell i the combined hsi c i is a suitability criterion with a combination of hsi of depth velocity and substrate size i e 16 c i γ v i γ d i γ c i where γ v i γ d i and γ c i are hsi function of cell i regarding velocity depth of flow and substrate size respectively 3 4 statistical analysis of the model outcome swmm generated hydrograph at tributary cst 1 was validated using available dataset from bwdb stream gauge station fig 5 observed water level from the 2 tidal gauge stations were collected and compared to evaluate model performance those stations were khal no 18 cs 32 and khal no 10 cs 27 and they located respectively 5 km and 11 km from the mouth of estuary fig 4 model performance was evaluated using a matrix of error statistics the criteria to evaluate the hydrologic and hydraulic model performances were percent bias pbais root mean square error rmse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as 17 pbais 100 i 1 n x o x m i i 1 n x o i 18 rsr i 1 n x o x m 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 19 rmse 1 n x i m x i o 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n x i o x i m 2 i 1 n x i o x o 2 here mean observed value x o 1 n i 1 n x i o n is the total data points of field observations x i m is the modeled value and x i o is the observed value the negative mean error indicates the model under predicted the water level this statistical analysis is used to characterize the quality and evaluation of model performance nse value ranges from to 1 and a perfect match between observed and simulated value is 1 hence the model predicted flow show reasonable agreement as all stations show nse above 0 9 for validation nse value of two tide gauges stations i e cs 32 and cs 27 shows a decrement from 0 99 to 0 93 indicates that water level prediction towards inland show slight deviation pbais values show the average tendency of the simulated value and found within 10 table 4 at flow gauge cst 1 positive value represents bias towards overestimation and negative value at cs 17 indicates underestimation this can be concluded that the swmm prediction has slightly overestimation on flow and hec ras underestimated discharge at selected gauge within allowable limit sediment transport change cross sectional value by erosion or deposition showed influence on the simulated water levels or low flows prediction following saleh et al 2013 this can be concluded that the topography obtained from the field survey should improve at regular time interval considering geomorphological change thus the model could predict water level and discharge reasonably 4 results 4 1 estimation of flow duration curve fdc and selected discharge as hydraulic habitat feature karnafuli river has prominent semi diurnal tide effect and from hec ras simulation it was observed that discharge reduce rapidly towards inland for instance during simulation period maximum flow was found 4000 m3 s at outfall and it was reduced to 250 m3 s at cs 10 located 27 km away from mouth fig 4 due to semi diurnal fluctuations during flood tide saline water flow from sea to the inland thus flow in this direction was assumed as positive and opposite appeared as negative flow fig 7c establishing a stage discharge relationship in a tidal river is difficult as it usually took form of looped curve and for fewer water level fluctuation and unidirectional analysis it can be adopted for a flood or ebb tide the spawning ground was located at a distance of 27 km from the sea mouth stage discharge relationship can be established as water level ranges from 2 5 to 4 m flood tide was considered due to a unidirectional flow is a prerequisite condition for phabsim hydraulic modeling flow duration curve fdc during flood tide was obtained from a period of simulated flow positive discharge against a cumulative percentage of flows in an ungauged tidal river observed time series are less available and flow variability is high thus simulated flow time series are desirable to derive a fdc to cover entire range of flow of a representative regime fdc can provide a holistic concept from a long term flow variability as well as unknown flow occurrence probability however hec data storage system hec dssv2 model was used to perform statistical analysis from a flow time series obtained from hec ras during flood tide period using the math function of dss tool the discharges during 2010 2015 for the corresponding regime ranked according to the percent flow exceeds or equaled and finally fdc curve were derived fig 8 from fdc curve during high tide the flow ranges were determined and a series of flow alternates were produced for determination of suitable ef several discharges were selected and relative information about their velocity and depth obtained from stage discharge and velocity discharge relationship establishing reasonable correlation co efficient obtained from flood tide table 5 4 2 estimation of ecological flow rate the obtained flow range was simulated in phabsim and river 2d to determine suitable ef against the optimal wua suitable discharge was obtained from phabsim that can be determined for spawning season of major carps was 30 1 m3 s figs 9 and 10c on the other hand river 2d predicts the optimum ef as 25 m3 s with the increase of discharge several parts of reach attain high velocity and water depth and the spawning ground gradually lost the appropriate situation of spawning except near bank as there are less water depth and velocity fig 10d extreme flow event like flooding discharge interrupt spawning suitability of major indian carps initially the wua increases with discharge and while the maximum discharge of 25 m3 s obtained this implies the suitable instream flow to maintain healthy ecology fig 9 from the selected discharge table 5 wua found decreases except two flow case i e 75 m3 s and 200 m3 s the ci at different discharge reveals the formation of different sizes riffle make this spawning ground more suitable during low discharge fig 10 a c it has been already detected the flow components like magnitude duration frequency timing of low flows are closely related with different aquatic process of eco hydrology for stream flow alterations hydrologic model swmm was applied considering anthropogenic changes like land use that are frequently ignored in conventional hydrologic modeling there is some discrepancy while low flow simulation as model overestimates low flow stage this is due to most of the hydraulic model is based on flood wave routing thus low flow event simulation performances are not completely reliable multi objective calibration approach of hydrologic model can be applied for stream flow generations to capture entire flow regime characteristics although all cross sections were acquired from bwdb and cpa surveyed dataset stage and discharge prediction from hec ras was affected at different stations possibly due to sediment deposition of those cross sections as a result cross sections got shortened and predicted discharges were less than actual discharge one of the aims of the study was to define long term flow time series and flow ranges of ungauged tidal karnafuli river where flow monitoring was not available to determine the flow ranges this model can also be applied for unidirectional river after calibration the flow ranges of flood tide 15 1 m3 s 245 m3 s were obtained more than the ebb tide period 23 1 m3 s 187 5 m3 s due to inability to simulate bidirectional flow in phabsim ef analyzed considering flow ranges of flood tide as unidirectional river wua decreased sharply after the discharge 30 1 m3 s and with the increase of discharge corresponding velocity and depth increases which made ci less this resulted unsuitable flow for the major carps spawning less turbulent place might be preferable to the major carps and areas of deep pool during spawning season which located within 1000 m from upstream fig 10a water depth velocity and substrate size were considered as dominant eco factor for determining suitable ecological flow rate other eco factors i e water temperatures suspended sediment concentration etc was not considered in model development variations in habitat predictions between phabsim and river2d habitat simulation model may be occurred due to longitudinal variation of depth velocity or velocity distribution while model simulation again inadequate substrate mapping may influence the obtained results from river 2d preference curve method of habitat simulation using phabsim and river 2d was preferred in this study this needs further development while engaging in ef assessment although this method sensitive to preference curve and usually showed high hsi but variation in same trend relatively other method such as generalized additive model data driven fuzzy logic model yi et al 2016 thus prediction of ef thresholds might not be affected by this method previous studies reveal that the human activity with different hydraulic structures like dam sluice gate bridges etc influences the ecosystem yao et al 2015 sun et al 2015 boavida et al 2015 thus the recommended ef 25 30 1 m3 s at depth of 3 5 4 2 m from long term stage discharge relationship has to maintain without any human interruption moreover the optimal meteorological hydrodynamic and several water quality parameters were suggested to maintain ef table 6 4 3 kaptai dam operational influence on habitat conditions kaptai dam is an earth fill dam covering a reservoir area of 777 sq km and control annual inflow runoff of approximately 15 646 million cubic meters with its 16 gated spillways noman 1997 from estimated fdc curve two high flows 200 and 225 m3 s was tested to represent peak released discharge impact on habitat condition fig 10g and h wua was quantified within 48 000 61 000 m2 for high upstream flow i e 200 m3 s after then a sharp decrease of wua was observed against further increment of discharge fig 10 the dam released discharge distributed partially through ichamoti river a tributary of karnafuli river and several stakeholders i e water treatment plants karnafuli irrigation projects and numerous industries it was difficult to determine the direct impact of dam released discharge on restoration site as the study area was 32 km downstream of kaptai dam unknown amount of water withdrawal of those stakeholders from released discharge and inadequate data moreover due to absence of semi diurnal effect and dominant non tidal regime this portion of karnafuli river was beyond the scope of this study although indirect dam impact was considered to achieve flow hydrograph at cs 1 fig 4 table 1 as upstream discharge contribution existing reservoir operation rule are divided into two parts first part august october utilizes the reservoir for the storage period to refill the reservoir at potential level 33 4 m above mean sea level for power generation and the rest for the drawdown period november through july fig 11 during the spawning period of carp fish april june peak released discharge was found 400 450 m3 s and it can disperse the restoration site providing fish access to floodplain present dam operation mode was set with an objective to generate hydroelectric power and protect the downstream from riverine flooding hence the integration of operation rule curve needs improvement to resemble suitable ecological habitat condition hydrologic alteration induced by dam can be indicated by low flow or high flow varied from their occurrence frequency duration and pulse richter and thomas 2007 rapid fluctuations of water level have negative consequences on the brood egg washing away from spawning ground furthermore such high discharge can be recommended after prolonged dry weather to assist this restoration site reducing salinity amount and other water quality parameter at suitable level dam released discharge should control during high tide to avoid the high flow in restoration site if the hydropower dam can be operated in daily basis at the same rate of kaptai reservoir inflow the ef could be unchanged due to sudden high released discharge 5 conclusions this ef assessment was carried with a modeling framework comprised of hydrological hydraulic and habitat models those are commonly used for water management the model framework can be applied in both unidirectional and tidal river after calibration and validation moreover habitat simulation methods required considering more abiotic factors i e water quality and meteorological conditions to predict ef ranges to achieve ef optimum habitat conditions were suggested combining present study and expert recommendations table 6 fundamental concepts of eloha framework were followed but conceptualized following hydrologic process of an ungauged semi diurnal tidal regime model performance was reasonable below 10 error and discrepancies probably arose from proper tidal simulation despite these achievements few attempts were suggested for future ef assessment as for sparsely gauged regions establishment of eloha framework is a concerning issue due to prediction accuracy thus regionalization of stream flow characteristics was done on physical characteristics of watershed additionally prediction uncertainties can be reduced by multi objective optimization for hydrologic process zhang et al 2008 as flow characteristics in semi diurnal regime usually dominated by tidal characteristics a hydrodynamic model needs to integrate while simulating overall processes in this study the flow regime characteristics of tidal karnafuli river were derived with a modeling framework principally dominated by tidal nature the method described in this study will facilitate a model based study to obtain historical flow that can be employed as an assessment tool of ungauged river basin management in fact the flow regime of tidal river can be characterized by a spring tide and a neap tide occurred twice in a lunar month and considering tidal variation in a year may be sufficient for simulation period uncertainties should consider from extreme events i e storm surge and sea level rise as the tide range has prominent influence over those source as some parts of the watershed were already urbanized the swmm model was employed to simulate the relative contribution of upstream runoff for low flow simulation the modeling framework also consider the seepage loss from channel land use change and bottom friction domination in tidal decay applying a hydrologic model showed reasonable representation in hydrologic alteration in this study the statistical analysis on flow components was carried out to define the range of flow regime finally phabsim and river 2d were used to determine ef based on the preference curve method the minimum instream flow requirements for major carps spawning was found 25 30 1 m3 s at depth of 3 5 4 2 m the simulated ef during the flood tide is 25 30 1 m3 s i e around 10 12 of mean annual runoff viz 245 m3 s this outcome reasonably match with the minimum flow requirement as 10 flow of the mean annual runoff defined by acreman et al 2000 for the managed flood and river flow from water quality perspective the fish spawning of carp fish found sensitive to salinity concentration during dry weather the salinity intrusion may be reduced from the released discharge of dam but should not exceed flow 100 m3 s for habitat simulation river2d considers spatial flow variability and prediction of habitat availability performed better compare to the phabsim the prediction accuracy of habitat simulation requires improvement using frequent fish sampling and survey on predicted hotspot these areas of improvement can briefly synthesized by two categories i e tidal hydrodynamic and required dataset includes bathymetry streamflow and carp fish habitat related ecological information water managers and scientific community can work together to overcome those limitations acknowledgements the research was supported by funds provided by center for river harbor and landslide research crhlsr chittagong university of engineering and technology

7464,rivers are an important source of co2 to the atmosphere however mountainous rivers and streams with high emission rates are not well studied particularly in china we report the first detailed investigation on monsoonal mountainous rivers in the three gorges reservoir tgr region with a focus on the riverine co2 partial pressure pco2 co2 degassing and their potential controls the pco2 levels ranged from 50 to 6019 µatm with averages of 1573 sd 1060 in dry autumn and 1276 sd 1166 µatm in wet summer seasons 94 of samples were supersaturated with co2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 µatm monsoonal precipitation controlled pco2 seasonality with both the maximal and minimal levels occurring in the wet season and showing the overall effects of dilution riverine pco2 could be predicted better in the dry season using ph do and dtp whereas ph and doc were better predictors in the wet season we conclude that in situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon rather than photosynthesis resulted in negative relationships between pco2 and do and ph and thus co2 supersaturation photosynthetic primary production was effectively limited by rapid flow velocity and short residence time the estimated water to air co2 emission rate in the tgr rivers was 350 319 in the autumn and lower yet more variable at 326 439 mmol m2 d in summer our calculated co2 areal fluxes were in the upper level magnitude of published data demonstrating the importance of mountainous rivers and streams as a global greenhouse gas source and urgency for more detailed studies on co2 degassing to address a global data gap for these environments keywords riverine carbon flux co2 degassing partial pressure of co2 dissolved inorganic carbon mountainous streams and rivers three gorges reservoir catchment 1 introduction in the context of global climate change quantification of greenhouse gases ghgs emissions from continents to the atmosphere is recognized as a priority tranvik et al 2009 liu et al 2010 barros et al 2011 regnier et al 2013 rivers appear to be heterotrophic systems resulting in more organic matter being respired within the river than being fixed through photosynthesis by phytoplankton cole and caraco 2001 li et al 2012 rivers have been widely reported to be supersaturated in carbon dioxide co2 with respect to the atmosphere and are a net source of atmospheric co2 butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 the global budgets for co2 emissions from rivers and streams have been updated to 1 8 pg c y raymond et al 2013 and therefore exceeding the transport of carbon 0 9 pg c y by the rivers to the ocean regnier et al 2013 li and bush 2015 other recent work provides even lower estimates 0 65 pg c co2 y from global rivers and streams via water air interface nevertheless the global emission is particularly constrained by data from asia lauerwald et al 2015 even with large uncertainty of emissions rivers and streams play an important role as conduits of carbon c from terrestrial reservoirs to the downstream or oceans and the atmosphere for the purpose of understanding the global c budget there is an urgent need to re evaluate the modern overestimation of the land carbon sink by bring into full consideration of c fluxes from rivers and streams bastviken et al 2011 there are a number of important studies on fluvial co2 estimation via air water interface from the large rivers i e amazon richey et al 2002 mississippi and yukon lauerwald et al 2015 hudson cole and caraco 2001 american river networks butman and raymond 2011 and mekong li et al 2013a demonstrating significant emissions of co2 from these continental rivers china s major rivers are also supersaturated in co2 with respect to the atmosphere and are a source of carbon degassing such as the yangtze wang et al 2007 li et al 2012 the yellow ran et al 2015a ran et al 2015b and the pearl river yao et al 2007 limited data in other regions suggested extremely dynamic aqueous pco2 and at times much higher co2 areal flux in small river and streams teodoru et al 2009 beyond these specific studies the characterization of co2 partial pressure pco2 and exchanges of co2 between the water and atmosphere have not been well explored in freshwater systems and particularly not for in the asian monsoonal climate driven river networks raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 as a consequence current data in these river systems particularly in mountainous rivers and streams are constraining the estimation of the role of monsoonal asian rivers on global co2 fluxes it is anticipated that china s subtropical rivers and streams including mountainous rivers in the three gorges reservoir tgr region are supersaturated in co2 li et al 2012 wang et al 2017 they should be similar to rivers in other regions such as tropical richey et al 2002 sarma et al 2011 temperate butman and raymond 2011 and boreal areas teodoru et al 2009 prior studies on aquatic co2 emissions in the tgr region focused on backwater area of the pengxi zhao et al 2013 li et al 2014b huang et al 2017 xiangxi zhao et al 2011 huang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and meixi rivers li et al 2014a fu et al 2016 li et al 2017 as well as the mainstream of the tgr xiao et al 2013 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and demonstrated their significant carbon sources moreover these findings also suggested that the estimates from the region suffer from large uncertainties because of great variability see data in table 1 and lack of systematic data collection the region is highly under sampled with references to time and space i e only seven rivers have been reported to our best of our knowledge and the overall magnitude and importance of aquatic emissions therefore remains to be quantified for river networks in the region with a monsoonal climate here we firstly present a complete investigation on pco2 dynamics of the tgr region with mountainous terrain and our objectives are to 1 explore the magnitude and variability in riverine pco2 and 2 unravel their links to physicochemical attributes of the river networks we test the hypothesis of profound heterogeneity in fluvial pco2 as a consequence of divergent biophysical characteristics and human activities across the large catchment as well as high co2 degassing flux in the mountainous rivers and streams this hypothesis stems from the observation that rivers can serve as both a conduit for terrestrial co2 efflux and as reactors for mineralization of exotic organic carbon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study sites are located in the mountainous tgr catchment 28 44 31 40 n 106 10 111 10 e of china fig 1 this region has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and annual mean temperature ranges between15 and 19 c average annual precipitation is approximately 1250 mm with large intra and inter annual variability about 75 of the annual total rainfall is concentrated in april september and the year round average relative humidity is 77 peng 2005 huang et al 2017 mao et al 2017 our river subcatchments include 36 first order tributaries and 27 second order tributaries which make up the majority of the tributaries of the yangtze in the tgr region water samples were collated in autumn 20 oct 5 nov 2015 dry season and summer 21 jun 3 jul 2016 wet season the rivers in this study have drainage areas of 113 4394 km2 with annual discharges of 1 8 112 m3 s table s1 the location of sampling sites is depicted in fig 1 and detailed information on sampling sites that include primary data are listed in the supplement materials appendix table a1 2 2 water sampling and analyses discrete samples were collected from 66 locations 39 sampling sites are from the first order tributaries and 27 from the second order tributaries from the main tributaries in the tgr region of the yangtze river fig 1 our sampling locations are situated on the rivers where the waters are not affected by reservoir operation thus mainstream of the tgr and backwater area of the tgr tributaries are outside of our scope running water samples were collected using pre acid washed 5 l high polyethylene hdpe plastic containers at a water depth of approximately 10 cm below surface the samples were filtered through pre baked whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters on the sampling day the first portion of the filtration was discarded to clean the membrane and the following portion was stored in acid washed hdpe bottles the bottles were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analysed concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved total nitrogen dtn and dissolved total phosphorus dtp were measured within one week of water collection water temperature tw do saturation do ph and electrical conductivity ec

using a fixed endpoint titration method with 0 0200 mol l hydrochloric acid hcl on the sampling day ph is a key parameter for pco2 calculation and was measured to a precision of 0 002 wind speed at 1

and dtn and dtp concentrations were determined using a continuous flow autoanalyzer aa3 seal analytical germany following peroxodisulfate oxidation 2 3 pco2 calculations co2sys software with input data on measured ph water temperature and alkalinity was used to calculate riverine pco2 lewis et al 1998 this program is commonly used for its simplicity and reliability butman and raymond 2011 hunt et al 2011 sarma et al 2011 li et al 2013a dissolved inorganic carbon dic species including hco3 and co3 2 are also calculated using co2sys 2 4 water air co2 flux calculations the flux of co2 f unit in mmol m2 d across the water air interface was estimated using the thin boundary layer tbl model as follows 1 f k k h p co 2 water p co 2 air 2 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k is the gas transfer velocity of co2 also referred to as piston velocity unit in m d pco2 water unit in in µatm is the partial pressure of co2 in the surface water and pco2 air unit in µatm is the co2 concentration in equilibrium with atmosphere pco2 air 410 29 µatm n 58 kh mmol m3 µatm is the solubility of co2 corrected using temperature t in c this model has been widely used i e wang et al 2007 yao et al 2007 teodoru et al 2009 li et al 2012 li et al 2013a alin et al 2015 ran et al 2015b piston velocity k is governed by basin physical factors but mostly by water turbulence and wind speed borges et al 2004 raymond et al 2012 alin et al 2015 there have been extensive efforts to improve the reliability of k for the tbl model e g k values from a suit of empirical models of wind speed and flow velocity raymond et al 2012 alin et al 2015 the estimated k values range from 1 cm h to 100 cm h with greater variation in smaller streams and rivers raymond et al 2012 however 8 15 cm h for k values has been widely adopted for riverine co2 outgassing for instance k values 8 15 cm h in the river rhone and saone aucour et al 1999 and in some asian rivers such as xijiang river yao et al 2007 and maotiao river wang et al 2011 nevertheless k600 measured in the lower mekong river one of the largest river in asia was 23 3 17 3 cm h and greatly exceeding other asian monsoonal climate rivers of similar hydrographical characteristics ca 10 cm h we also calculated k600 from the model obtained in the lower mekong river alin et al 2015 and suggested 31 5 12 1 cm h 95 confidence interval for mean 28 3 34 7 for the dry season and 40 6 18 4 cm h 95 confidence interval for mean 35 4 45 8 for wet season fig s1 thus our calculated k value was 30 8 11 8 cm h in the dry season when average temperature was 19 1 c the k value was 45 6 20 7 cm h in the wet season when average temperature was 24 8 c the following formula was used to calculate the k values at different temperatures based on the known k600 3 k 600 k t 600 s ct 0 5 4 s ct 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 04132 t 3 where kt is the measured values in situ temperature t sct is the scumidt number of temperature t here t 20 c sct 600 and k600 31 5 12 1 cm h in the dry season and 40 6 18 4 cm h cm h in the wet season see mentioned above the results were comparable to k levels in the yellow river 23 61 cm h ran et al 2015b taking into consideration this range for k values in asian rivers we designated a k of 10 cm h as the lower limit for our rivers and for case of comparison with other rivers in the yangtze basin and world rivers yao et al 2007 wang et al 2011 2 5 data quality for riverine pco2 calculations quality control procedures for the critical variables of ph and alkalinity were as follows 1 the ph probes were carefully calibrated 2 in situ ph values were recorded when the ph stabilized within 0 01 units for 2 min and 3 duplicates for individual samples were determined for alkalinity alkalinity is generally titrated using hcl with various concentrations ranging between 0 01 m and 0 1 m hunt et al 2011 alkalinity here was determined by titration using a 0 0200 m hcl to an end point of ph 3 1 4 4 identified by a color indicator tropeolin d two replicates for individual sample indicated the uncertainty of 0 8 previous studies have reported an overestimation of aqueous pco2 due to the presence of significant non carbonate alkalinity nc alk typically contributed by nitrogen phosphorus silicate and organic species in particular hunt et al 2011 li et al 2013a for this study dtn and dtp averaged 273 2 range 52 0 752 5 μm and 2 7 range 0 4 9 6 μm representing a very small proportion of nc alk li et al 2012 doc ranged from 361 7 to 3462 5 μm with an average of 1018 2 μm the contribution of organic acid anions to measured alkalinity has been previously constrained to less than 10 of doc in rivers lozovik 2005 if the maximum contribution of organic acids to alkalinity of 10 is adopted 10 of the equivalent doc 101 8 μm was only a small proportion 3 6 of the alkalinity measurements total average 2847 6 831 1 μeq l thus the contribution of organic acids to the alkalinity was minor although the potential effects are interesting 2 6 statistical analyses normality of the data distribution was tested using the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test variables without a normal distribution were transformed by natural logarithm for statistical analyses the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to compare the seasonal differences multivariate statistics such as correlation and regression analyses and analysis of variance anova were undertaken correlation analyses were made using spearman coefficient for relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters and basin characteristics stepwise multiple regression was used to identify possible predictors for net co2 outgassing while anova was performed for seasonal differences of the dic system and key water quality parameters with significance at p 0 05 the statistical processes were conducted using spss 16 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics summer air temperature averaged 31 4 4 2 c with a range of 22 3 41 1 c and wind velocity ranged between 0 and 5 m s with an average of 0 8 0 9 m s table s1 both discharge and flow velocity showed significant differences between seasons p 0 05 by mann whitney u test with 1 7 fold higher flow velocity and 3 8 fold higher water discharge in the summer season table s1 the distinct seasonality is aligned with monsoonal climate in the tgr region spatial variations in water discharge and flow velocity were also high based on the high ratio of standard deviation to mean values this is understandable given the rivers occur in highly variable landscapes across a vast area of 60 000 km2 3 2 dic species seasonal patterns of water temperature ph alkalinity and dic speciation are deciphered in fig 2 supporting statistics are also supplied in table s2 t ranged from 15 1 to 26 5 c with an average of 19 1 2 3 c in autumn as expected water temperature in autumn was much lower than in the summer 24 8 4 8 c both ph and alkalinity also showed significant differences between seasons with higher alkalinity 3122 1 809 4 µeq l in autumn yet higher average ph 8 22 0 32 in summer alkalinity averaged 2847 6 831 1 μeq l median 2800 μeq l in the tgr rivers this is lower than many major china rivers such as yellow 3361 μeq l and yangtze s main tributaries of jinshajiang 3858 μeq l and lancanjiang 3466 μeq l but is comparable to minjiang 2901 μeq l and wujiang 2780 μeq l these two rivers are close to the tgr and slightly higher than the yangtze 2311 μeq l hanjiang 2464 μeq l and daduhe 2198 μeq l when compared to other major asian rivers alkalinity was slightly lower than salween 3475 μeq l while much higher 1 3 3 fold than other rivers including indus 2130 μeq l ganges 1951 μeq l mekong 1524 μeq l honghe 1328 μeq l brahmaputra 951 μeq l and the global median 1256 μeq l for major rivers data were compiled by previous studies li et al 2009b li et al 2013a hco3 was the dominant component of dic for all river water samples across the seasons accounting for 97 3 0 8 autumn and 97 3 1 4 summer of dic on average the next major component was dissolved co2 accounting for 2 0 1 0 in autumn and 1 7 1 4 in summer with co3 2 a minor contributor to dic 0 7 0 7 vs 1 0 1 1 in autumn and summer hco3 also accounted for almost all of the alkalinity mean 98 6 1 3 in autumn and 97 9 2 1 as a consequence dic hco3 and alkalinity showed very strong relationships r2 0 99 p 0 001 fig 2 table s2 there were strong spatial variations of pco2 levels in both autumn and summer fig 2 table s2 as reflected by the ratio of max pco2 min pco2 33 in autumn and 120 in summer both the maximal and minimal pco2 concentrations were observed during the wet season summer the maximum can be attributed to soil co2 input via runoff while the minimal concentration reflects the overriding effects of dilution by precipitation pco2 median values varied significantly between seasons p 0 001 by mann whitney test with 1 6 fold higher concentration in the autumn 1303 5 vs 832 8 µatm pco2 averages had similar seasonal trends with the pco2 median values nevertheless pco2 averages exhibited insignificant seasonal difference p 0 13 by anova 3 3 surface water to atmosphere co2 flux average emission rate of co2 showed profound variations depending on the k level used and time of sampling as reflected by significant seasonal differences and large s d fig 3 table s3 dry season values ranged from 71 7 to 1562 8 mmol m2 d autumn while the wet season values ranged between 135 5 and 2111 8 mmol m2 d summer fig 3 the averaged co2 areal fluxes were similar irrespective of dry 349 9 318 8 mmol m2 d and wet 326 1 439 0 mmol m2 d seasons while the median areal fluxes were significantly higher in the dry season 268 8 vs 159 2 mmol m2 d fig 3 when using k 10 the averaged co2 areal fluxes were estimated at 113 6 103 5 ranging from 23 3 to 507 4 mmol m2 d in the dry season and 71 5 96 3 ranging from 29 7 to 463 1 mmol m2 d in the wet season the mean far exceeds the corresponding median values we also found median co2 areal flux was much higher in the dry season 87 3 vs 34 9 mmol m2 d fig 3 table s3 our results indicate that rivers in the tgr region emitted 2 33 2 25 2 42 tg co2 y with the lower limits of 0 64 0 49 0 78 tg co2 y considering a total water area of approx 430 km2 for all tributaries water area is from

significant seasonal differences and were notably higher in autumn dry season do saturation do was similar across seasons though large variation in max do min do occurred in autumn the doc mean and

median dtn concentrations were similar in autumn 3 49 vs 3 33 mg l for mean and median they were also comparable to the median dtn in the summer 3 62 mg l fig 4 table s4 however mean dtn varied significantly in season with 1 2 fold higher concentration in the summer 3 49 0 97 vs 4 17 2 29 mg l table s4 we also found that spatially the dtn concentrations in summer were more highly variable as reflected by the larger ratio of max dtn min dtn table s4 dtp exhibited significant seasonal differences p 0 001 fig 4 the mean for dtp was 1 2 1 3 fold higher than its median concentrations and dtp average was 1 3 fold higher in summer when compared to autumn 99 88 57 43 vs 67 76 59 77 mg l fig 4 table s4 correlations between pco2 and measured water variables were examined fig 5 table s5 pco2 was significantly related to do doc and dtn in the autumn p 0 05 while in the summer significant relationship was only observed between pco2 and doc r 0 5 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 controls on seasonal variability of pco2 aqueous pco2 is mainly controlled by within river mineralization of doc that has an allochthonous origin input of soil co2 that is generated by soil respiration via runoff and photosynthesis cole and caraco 2001 cole et al 2007 li et al 2013a wallin et al 2013 free flowing mountainous natural rivers are of a net heterotrophic nature and therefore are supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium the rivers in this study had very low chl a concentrations i e 0 5 µg l peng 2005 0 4 µg l from our data and thus limited primary production probably because of high flow velocities and short residence time of carbon li et al 2017 as a consequence in situ respiration of organic carbon within rivers and the effects of external biogeochemical process in upstream terrestrial ecosystem are likely to be more relevant to riverine pco2 in the tgr region this is generally supported by the distinct seasonality and spatial variations of pco2 oversaturation fig 2 further significant relationships between pco2 and doc could reflect within river respiration of organic matter to some extent fig 5 cole and caraco 2001 and much higher contents of nutrients in the rivers implied terrestrial inputs and simultaneously soil respiration influences to riverine co2 fig 4 li et al 2009a wallin et al 2013 previous studies in the yangtze river and other international rivers have reported the combined impacts of anthropogenic activities precipitation and hydrological flow path on riverine pco2 li et al 2012 li et al 2013a li and zhang 2014 we highlight that both the crest and trough of pco2 were observed in the summer wet season fig 2 which is mainly due to variable monsoonal precipitation for instance initial precipitation and mild temperature enhances soil microbial respiration and thus enhanced soil co2 content and export of soil co2 to rivers via runoff whereas the commutative effect of rainfall on increasing saturated soils as the monsoonal season extends leads to surface runoff and subsequent dilution of riverine pco2 this became evident in our data as the field work conducted over 2 weeks during the monsoonal season captured variability in rainfall and soil saturation from a large catchment area of 60 000 km2 i e some area with initial rain event while others with persistent rainfall etc the net effect of monsoonal rainfall eventually caused an overall dilution of riverine pco2 which was essentially responsible for the significantly lower wet season summer pco2 by comparison to the dry season autumn fig 2 substantial heterogeneity in basin physical characteristics and human land use activities i e there are developed districts of fuling and wangzhou and rural districts of fengdu and wuxi also contribute to the large spatial dynamics that were observed for pco2 fig 4 diverse human activities in the region are supported by highly variable seasonality of tdn and tdp concentrations as well as highly variable composition in the wet season fig 4 for example similar to other rivers i e han river in the yangtze river basin there were enhanced nutrient concentrations in the wet season because of diffusive pollutants li et al 2009a and overall diluted doc by rainfall lu et al 2012 4 2 relationships between pco2 and environmental variables water chemical variables and within river biogeochemical process also exerted an effect on pco2 beyond the over arching influence of hydrological processes there are a number of important water quality variables that showed a relationship with pco2 in the dry season but were absent during the wet season fig 5 table s5 there are two possible reasons for these differences firstly the effects of high flow conditions simply mask the other relationships alternatively there are some different processes simultaneously occurring that connect nutrient cycles and pco2 under conditions of low flow and higher temperature in the dry season prior studies reported a variable influence of nutrients on pco2 i e enhanced nutrients could favor aquatic photosynthesis that consumed dissolved co2 and produced dissolved o2 cole and caraco 2001 wang et al 2007 while others observed weak correlations between pco2 and nutrients li et al 2012 li et al 2013a low primary production as reflected by very low chla in these rivers could further mask the couplings between pco2 and nutrient elements however the tgr rivers are generally p limited as indicated by very high ratio of n to p fig 4 p increases therefore nourish microorganism and could potentially boost bacterial respiration of organic carbon resulting in the observed significant association between pco2 and dtp in the dry season fig 4 also both the dominant process of respiration and limited photosynthesis in these mountainous rivers could plausibly increase pco2 lowering do and ph resulting in the negative correlations between pco2 and do and ph as well as positive correlations between pco2 and doc table s5 there were strong relations between the thermodynamic variable ph and pco2 this was anticipated as the calculated pco2 from co2sys is highly dependent on the ph pco2 could be predicted using exponential models as follows autumn pco2 4e 11e 2 395ph r2 0 82 p 0 001 summer pco2 6e 10e 2 186ph r2 0 80 p 0 001 similar to other studies finlay et al 2009 li et al 2012 there is a good capacity for predicting pco2 using key parameters we found a stronger regression with an r2 0 9 when using multiple regression models with data on ph do and organic matter autumn pco2 23885 19 2520 24 1825 88 604 59 lndo 1754 27 404 78 ph 5 62 dtp r2 0 91 p 0 001 summer pco2 14316 34 2279 73 1673 42 272 41 ph 39 67 7 32 doc r2 0 91 p 0 001 4 3 co2 outgassing to the atmosphere the measured riverine pco2 of this study were much lower than reported for most rivers listed in table s6 and or other world rivers cole and caraco 2001 yet comparable to that of the yangtze 1297 µatm and the mississippi 1335 µatm and exceeding the lower mekong 1090 µatm and st lawrence 576 µatm table s6 the estimated emission rates were within the previously published range but towards the upper end of published rates while the co2 area flux depended largely on gas transfer velocity for instance k values of 8 55 were adopted for co2 flux calculations from china s monsoonal rivers if we apply a k 10 that is widely used in china to the data from this study the estimated emission rates are within the intermediate published range table s6 amazon and boreal streams such as krycklan rivers showed peak emission rates our calculated co2 areal fluxes were however much higher than global riverine averages and were comparable to global average if k 10 was applied table s6 our estimates of co2 outgassing rates from free running waters in tgr tributaries were much higher as compared to the estimation from backwater area and main stream of the tgr table 1 however our estimates were comparable to the limited data from running waters of pengxi huang et al 2017 and backwater area of longxi li et al 2013 as well as degassing rates from other mountains rivers in the upper yangtze river such as maotiao wang et al 2011 and longchuan li et al 2012 the collated data in this region demonstrated that low flow velocity and increased water residence time increased phytoplankton production and thus enhanced photosynthesis which could reduce pco2 this was corroborated by the observations in the pengxi river i e co2 emission rate dramatically decreased from upper stream to downstream huang et al 2017 nevertheless backwater area was overall carbon source even in the severe algae blooming spring though the backwaters serve as co2 sink in short periods i e several days guo et al 2011 fu et al 2016 table 1 the results indicate that co2 emissions from tgr tributaries were previously underestimated i e 0 37 0 44 tg co2 y li et al 2017 and 0 03 tg co2 y yang et al 2013 the under estimation of this key process can be attributed to limited spatial and seasonal sampling for example prior upscaling estimates were based on one or two rivers such as the meixi li et al 2017 daning and pengxi rivers yang et al 2013 if the emissions of co2 0 77 1 3 tg co2 y from tgr surface water are included yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 total emissions from waters in the tgr region would amount to 3 02 3 72 tg co2 per year the emissions from our more detailed study of 2 33 tg co2 y lower limit of 0 64 tg co2 y based on this very first detailed investigation on tgr tributaries provide a more precise carbon budget for the regional rivers it also provides urgently needed primary data on mountainous rivers for inclusion in the riverine carbon assessment to inform global carbon models similar to other highly impacted publications ran et al 2015b k average was used for co2 areal flux calculations which potentially resulted in large uncertainty we therefore compared co2 emission rates using k values from separated streams and k mean level fig s2 and found that there was not a statistically significant difference by the two methods by mann whitney u test the difference of co2 mean areal flux for all rivers from separated k and k mean was within 10 in the same season thus our co2 emissions were reliable using the simple k average 5 conclusions the key results demonstrate that mountainous rivers and streams where data are scarce had higher than expected co2 emission rates which should be urgently included for global carbon budget from rivers we concluded that the negative correlation between co2 emission and do that was a striking feature in the data may indicate in situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon rather than photosynthesis as a dominant contribution of the co2 supersaturation under conditions typical of mountain rivers where flow is rapid and organic carbon residence time is short overall the riverine water was oversaturated in pco2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 µatm averaging about 1425 µatm 1573 1060 vs 1276 1166 µatm in dry and wet season this resulted in a water air interface co2 emission rate of 338 0 ranging between 135 5 and 2111 8 mmol m2 d in the tributaries of the reservoir the aqueous pco2 levels exhibited considerable spatial and seasonal variations with both the highest and lowest concentrations in the wet summer season the maximal pco2 was contributable to influx of soil co2 to streams via runoff and the minimum was due to the dilution effect by persistent and concentrated rainfall however the monsoonal precipitation ultimately limited pco2 via dilution acknowledgements this study was funded by the hundred talent program of the chinese academy of sciences

7464,rivers are an important source of co2 to the atmosphere however mountainous rivers and streams with high emission rates are not well studied particularly in china we report the first detailed investigation on monsoonal mountainous rivers in the three gorges reservoir tgr region with a focus on the riverine co2 partial pressure pco2 co2 degassing and their potential controls the pco2 levels ranged from 50 to 6019 µatm with averages of 1573 sd 1060 in dry autumn and 1276 sd 1166 µatm in wet summer seasons 94 of samples were supersaturated with co2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 µatm monsoonal precipitation controlled pco2 seasonality with both the maximal and minimal levels occurring in the wet season and showing the overall effects of dilution riverine pco2 could be predicted better in the dry season using ph do and dtp whereas ph and doc were better predictors in the wet season we conclude that in situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon rather than photosynthesis resulted in negative relationships between pco2 and do and ph and thus co2 supersaturation photosynthetic primary production was effectively limited by rapid flow velocity and short residence time the estimated water to air co2 emission rate in the tgr rivers was 350 319 in the autumn and lower yet more variable at 326 439 mmol m2 d in summer our calculated co2 areal fluxes were in the upper level magnitude of published data demonstrating the importance of mountainous rivers and streams as a global greenhouse gas source and urgency for more detailed studies on co2 degassing to address a global data gap for these environments keywords riverine carbon flux co2 degassing partial pressure of co2 dissolved inorganic carbon mountainous streams and rivers three gorges reservoir catchment 1 introduction in the context of global climate change quantification of greenhouse gases ghgs emissions from continents to the atmosphere is recognized as a priority tranvik et al 2009 liu et al 2010 barros et al 2011 regnier et al 2013 rivers appear to be heterotrophic systems resulting in more organic matter being respired within the river than being fixed through photosynthesis by phytoplankton cole and caraco 2001 li et al 2012 rivers have been widely reported to be supersaturated in carbon dioxide co2 with respect to the atmosphere and are a net source of atmospheric co2 butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 the global budgets for co2 emissions from rivers and streams have been updated to 1 8 pg c y raymond et al 2013 and therefore exceeding the transport of carbon 0 9 pg c y by the rivers to the ocean regnier et al 2013 li and bush 2015 other recent work provides even lower estimates 0 65 pg c co2 y from global rivers and streams via water air interface nevertheless the global emission is particularly constrained by data from asia lauerwald et al 2015 even with large uncertainty of emissions rivers and streams play an important role as conduits of carbon c from terrestrial reservoirs to the downstream or oceans and the atmosphere for the purpose of understanding the global c budget there is an urgent need to re evaluate the modern overestimation of the land carbon sink by bring into full consideration of c fluxes from rivers and streams bastviken et al 2011 there are a number of important studies on fluvial co2 estimation via

li et al 2013a demonstrating significant emissions of co2 from these continental rivers china s major rivers are also supersaturated in co2 with respect to the atmosphere and are a source of carbon degassing such as the yangtze wang et al 2007 li et al 2012 the yellow ran et al 2015a ran et al 2015b and the pearl river yao et al 2007 limited data in other regions suggested extremely dynamic aqueous pco2 and at times much higher co2 areal flux in small river and streams teodoru et al 2009 beyond these specific studies the characterization of co2 partial pressure pco2 and exchanges of co2 between the water and atmosphere have not been well explored in freshwater systems and particularly not for in the asian monsoonal climate driven river networks raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 as a consequence current data in these river systems particularly in mountainous rivers and streams are constraining the estimation of the role of monsoonal asian rivers on global co2 fluxes it is anticipated that china s subtropical rivers and streams including mountainous rivers in the three gorges reservoir tgr region are supersaturated in co2 li et al 2012 wang et al 2017 they should be similar to rivers in other regions such as tropical richey et al 2002 sarma et al 2011 temperate butman and raymond 2011 and boreal areas teodoru et al 2009 prior studies on aquatic co2 emissions in the tgr region focused on backwater area of the pengxi zhao et al 2013 li et al 2014b huang et al 2017 xiangxi zhao et al 2011 huang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and meixi rivers li et al 2014a fu et al 2016 li et al 2017 as well as the mainstream of the tgr xiao et al 2013 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 and demonstrated their significant carbon sources moreover these findings also suggested that the estimates from the region suffer from large uncertainties because of great variability see data in table 1 and lack of systematic data collection the region is highly under sampled with references to time and space i e only seven rivers have been reported to our best of our knowledge and the overall magnitude and importance of aquatic emissions therefore remains to be quantified for river networks in the region with a monsoonal climate here we firstly present a complete investigation on pco2 dynamics of the tgr region with mountainous terrain and our objectives are to 1 explore the magnitude and variability in riverine pco2 and 2 unravel their links to physicochemical attributes of the river networks we test the hypothesis of profound heterogeneity in fluvial pco2 as a consequence of divergent biophysical characteristics and human activities across the large catchment as well as high co2 degassing flux in the mountainous rivers and streams this hypothesis stems from the observation that rivers can serve as both a conduit for terrestrial co2 efflux and as reactors for mineralization of exotic organic carbon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study sites are located in the mountainous tgr catchment 28 44 31 40 n 106 10 111 10 e of china fig 1 this region has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and annual mean temperature ranges between15 and 19 c average annual precipitation is approximately 1250 mm with large intra and inter annual variability about 75 of the annual total rainfall is concentrated in april september and the year round average relative humidity is 77 peng 2005 huang et al 2017 mao et al 2017 our river subcatchments include 36 first order tributaries and 27 second order tributaries which make up the majority of the tributaries of the yangtze in the tgr region water samples were collated in autumn 20 oct 5 nov 2015 dry season and summer 21 jun 3 jul 2016 wet season the rivers in this study have drainage areas of 113 4394 km2 with annual discharges of 1 8 112 m3 s table s1 the location of sampling sites is depicted in fig 1 and detailed information on sampling sites that include primary data are listed in the supplement materials appendix table a1 2 2 water sampling and analyses discrete samples were collected from 66 locations 39 sampling sites are from the first order tributaries and 27 from the second order tributaries from the main tributaries in the tgr region of the yangtze river fig 1 our sampling locations are situated on the rivers where the waters are not affected by reservoir operation thus mainstream of the tgr and backwater area of the tgr tributaries are outside of our scope running water samples were collected using pre acid washed 5 l high polyethylene hdpe plastic containers at a water depth of approximately 10 cm below surface the samples were filtered through pre baked whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters on the sampling day the first portion of the filtration was discarded to clean the membrane and the following portion was stored in acid washed hdpe bottles the bottles were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analysed concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved total nitrogen dtn and dissolved total phosphorus dtp were measured within one week of water collection water temperature tw do saturation do ph and electrical conductivity ec

using a fixed endpoint titration method with 0 0200 mol l hydrochloric acid hcl on the sampling day ph is a key parameter for pco2 calculation and was measured to a precision of 0 002 wind speed at 1

and dtn and dtp concentrations were determined using a continuous flow autoanalyzer aa3 seal analytical germany following peroxodisulfate oxidation 2 3 pco2 calculations co2sys software with input data on measured ph water temperature and alkalinity was used to calculate riverine pco2 lewis et al 1998 this program is commonly used for its simplicity and reliability butman and raymond 2011 hunt et al 2011 sarma et al 2011 li et al 2013a dissolved inorganic carbon dic species including hco3 and co3 2 are also calculated using co2sys 2 4 water air co2 flux calculations the flux of co2 f unit in mmol m2 d across the water air interface was estimated using the thin boundary layer tbl model as follows 1 f k k h p co 2 water p co 2 air 2 k h 10 1 11 0 016 t 0 00007 t 2 where k is the gas transfer velocity of co2 also referred to as piston velocity unit in m d pco2 water unit in in µatm is the partial pressure of co2 in the surface water and pco2 air unit in µatm is the co2 concentration in equilibrium with atmosphere pco2 air 410 29 µatm n 58 kh mmol m3 µatm is the solubility of co2 corrected using temperature t in c this model has been widely used i e wang et al 2007 yao et al 2007 teodoru et al 2009 li et al 2012 li et al 2013a alin et al 2015 ran et al 2015b piston velocity k is governed by basin physical factors but mostly by water turbulence and wind speed borges et al 2004 raymond et al 2012 alin et al 2015 there have been extensive efforts to improve the reliability of k for the tbl model e g k values from a suit of empirical models of wind speed and flow velocity raymond et al 2012 alin et al 2015 the estimated k values range from 1 cm h to 100 cm h with greater variation in smaller streams and rivers raymond et al 2012 however 8 15 cm h for k values has been widely adopted for riverine co2 outgassing for instance k values 8 15 cm h in the river rhone and saone aucour et al 1999 and in some asian rivers such as xijiang river yao et al 2007 and maotiao river wang et al 2011 nevertheless k600 measured in the lower mekong river one of the largest river in asia was 23 3 17 3 cm h and greatly exceeding other asian monsoonal climate rivers of similar hydrographical characteristics ca 10 cm h we also calculated k600 from the model obtained in the lower mekong river alin et al 2015 and suggested 31 5 12 1 cm h 95 confidence interval for mean 28 3 34 7 for the dry season and 40 6 18 4 cm h 95 confidence interval for mean 35 4 45 8 for wet season fig s1 thus our calculated k value was 30 8 11 8 cm h in the dry season when average temperature was 19 1 c the k value was 45 6 20 7 cm h in the wet season when average temperature was 24 8 c the following formula was used to calculate the k values at different temperatures based on the known k600 3 k 600 k t 600 s ct 0 5 4 s ct 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 04132 t 3 where kt is the measured values in situ temperature t sct is the scumidt number of temperature t here t 20 c sct 600 and k600 31 5 12 1 cm h in the dry season and 40 6 18 4 cm h cm h in the wet season see mentioned above the results were comparable to k levels in the yellow river 23 61 cm h ran et al 2015b taking into consideration this range for k values in asian rivers we designated a k of 10 cm h as the lower limit for our rivers and for case of comparison with other rivers in the yangtze basin and world rivers yao et al 2007 wang et al 2011 2 5 data quality for riverine pco2 calculations quality control procedures for the critical variables of ph and alkalinity were as follows 1 the ph probes were carefully calibrated 2 in situ ph values were recorded when the ph stabilized within 0 01 units for 2 min and 3 duplicates for individual samples were determined for alkalinity alkalinity is generally titrated using hcl with various concentrations ranging between 0 01 m and 0 1 m hunt et al 2011 alkalinity here was determined by titration using a 0 0200 m hcl to an end point of ph 3 1 4 4 identified by a color indicator tropeolin d two replicates for individual sample indicated the uncertainty of 0 8 previous studies have reported an overestimation of aqueous pco2 due to the presence of significant non carbonate alkalinity nc alk typically contributed by nitrogen phosphorus silicate and organic species in particular hunt et al 2011 li et al 2013a for this study dtn and dtp averaged 273 2 range 52 0 752 5 μm and 2 7 range 0 4 9 6 μm representing a very small proportion of nc alk li et al 2012 doc ranged from 361 7 to 3462 5 μm with an average of 1018 2 μm the contribution of organic acid anions to measured alkalinity has been previously constrained to less than 10 of doc in rivers lozovik 2005 if the maximum contribution of organic acids to alkalinity of 10 is adopted 10 of the equivalent doc 101 8 μm was only a small proportion 3 6 of the alkalinity measurements total average 2847 6 831 1 μeq l thus the contribution of organic acids to the alkalinity was minor although the potential effects are interesting 2 6 statistical analyses normality of the data distribution was tested using the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test variables without a normal distribution were transformed by natural logarithm for statistical analyses the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to compare the seasonal differences multivariate statistics such as correlation and regression analyses and analysis of variance anova were undertaken correlation analyses were made using spearman coefficient for relationships between pco2 and environmental parameters and basin characteristics stepwise multiple regression was used to identify possible predictors for net co2 outgassing while anova was performed for seasonal differences of the dic system and key water quality parameters with significance at p 0 05 the statistical processes were conducted using spss 16 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics summer air temperature averaged 31 4 4 2 c with a range of 22 3 41 1 c and wind velocity ranged between 0 and 5 m s with an average of 0 8 0 9 m s table s1 both discharge and flow velocity showed significant differences between seasons p 0 05 by mann whitney u test with 1 7 fold higher flow velocity and 3 8 fold higher water discharge in the summer season table s1 the distinct seasonality is aligned with monsoonal climate in the tgr region spatial variations in water discharge and flow velocity were also high based on the high ratio of standard deviation to mean values this is understandable given the rivers occur in highly variable landscapes across a vast area of 60 000 km2 3 2 dic species seasonal patterns of water temperature ph alkalinity and dic speciation are deciphered in fig 2 supporting statistics are also supplied in table s2 t ranged from 15 1 to 26 5 c with an average of 19 1 2 3 c in autumn as expected water temperature in autumn was much lower than in the summer 24 8 4 8 c both ph and alkalinity also showed significant differences between seasons with higher alkalinity 3122 1 809 4 µeq l in autumn yet higher average ph 8 22 0 32 in summer alkalinity averaged 2847 6 831 1 μeq l median 2800 μeq l in the tgr rivers this is lower than many major china rivers such as yellow 3361 μeq l and yangtze s main tributaries of jinshajiang 3858 μeq l and lancanjiang 3466 μeq l but is comparable to minjiang 2901 μeq l and wujiang 2780 μeq l these two rivers are close to the tgr and slightly higher than the yangtze 2311 μeq l hanjiang 2464 μeq l and daduhe 2198 μeq l when compared to other major asian rivers alkalinity was slightly lower than salween 3475 μeq l while much higher 1 3 3 fold than other rivers including indus 2130 μeq l ganges 1951 μeq l mekong 1524 μeq l honghe 1328 μeq l brahmaputra 951 μeq l and the global median 1256 μeq l for major rivers data were compiled by previous studies li et al 2009b li et al 2013a hco3 was the dominant component of dic for all river water samples across the seasons accounting for 97 3 0 8 autumn and 97 3 1 4 summer of dic on average the next major component was dissolved co2 accounting for 2 0 1 0 in autumn and 1 7 1 4 in summer with co3 2 a minor contributor to dic 0 7 0 7 vs 1 0 1 1 in autumn and summer hco3 also accounted for almost all of the alkalinity mean 98 6 1 3 in autumn and 97 9 2 1 as a consequence dic hco3 and alkalinity showed very strong relationships r2 0 99 p 0 001 fig 2 table s2 there were strong spatial variations of pco2 levels in both autumn and summer fig 2 table s2 as reflected by the ratio of max pco2 min pco2 33 in autumn and 120 in summer both the maximal and minimal pco2 concentrations were observed during the wet season summer the maximum can be attributed to soil co2 input via runoff while the minimal concentration reflects the overriding effects of dilution by precipitation pco2 median values varied significantly between seasons p 0 001 by mann whitney test with 1 6 fold higher concentration in the autumn 1303 5 vs 832 8 µatm pco2 averages had similar seasonal trends with the pco2 median values nevertheless pco2 averages exhibited insignificant seasonal difference p 0 13 by anova 3 3 surface water to atmosphere co2 flux average emission rate of co2 showed profound variations depending on the k level used and time of sampling as reflected by significant seasonal differences and large s d fig 3 table s3 dry season values ranged from 71 7 to 1562 8 mmol m2 d autumn while the wet season values ranged between 135 5 and 2111 8 mmol m2 d summer fig 3 the averaged co2 areal fluxes were similar irrespective of dry 349 9 318 8 mmol m2 d and wet 326 1 439 0 mmol m2 d seasons while the median areal fluxes were significantly higher in the dry season 268 8 vs 159 2 mmol m2 d fig 3 when using k 10 the averaged co2 areal fluxes were estimated at 113 6 103 5 ranging from 23 3 to 507 4 mmol m2 d in the dry season and 71 5 96 3 ranging from 29 7 to 463 1 mmol m2 d in the wet season the mean far exceeds the corresponding median values we also found median co2 areal flux was much higher in the dry season 87 3 vs 34 9 mmol m2 d fig 3 table s3 our results indicate that rivers in the tgr region emitted 2 33 2 25 2 42 tg co2 y with the lower limits of 0 64 0 49 0 78 tg co2 y considering a total water area of approx 430 km2 for all tributaries water area is from

significant seasonal differences and were notably higher in autumn dry season do saturation do was similar across seasons though large variation in max do min do occurred in autumn the doc mean and

median dtn concentrations were similar in autumn 3 49 vs 3 33 mg l for mean and median they were also comparable to the median dtn in the summer 3 62 mg l fig 4 table s4 however mean dtn varied significantly in season with 1 2 fold higher concentration in the summer 3 49 0 97 vs 4 17 2 29 mg l table s4 we also found that spatially the dtn concentrations in summer were more highly variable as reflected by the larger ratio of max dtn min dtn table s4 dtp exhibited significant seasonal differences p 0 001 fig 4 the mean for dtp was 1 2 1 3 fold higher than its median concentrations and dtp average was 1 3 fold higher in summer when compared to autumn 99 88 57 43 vs 67 76 59 77 mg l fig 4 table s4 correlations between pco2 and measured water variables were examined fig 5 table s5 pco2 was significantly related to do doc and dtn in the autumn p 0 05 while in the summer significant relationship was only observed between pco2 and doc r 0 5 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 controls on seasonal variability of pco2 aqueous pco2 is mainly controlled by within river mineralization of doc that has an allochthonous origin input of soil co2 that is generated by soil respiration via runoff and photosynthesis cole and caraco 2001 cole et al 2007 li et al 2013a wallin et al 2013 free flowing mountainous natural rivers are of a net heterotrophic nature and therefore are supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium the rivers in this study had very low chl a concentrations i e 0 5 µg l peng 2005 0 4 µg l from our data and thus limited primary production probably because of high flow velocities and short residence time of carbon li et al 2017 as a consequence in situ respiration of organic carbon within rivers and the effects of external biogeochemical process in upstream terrestrial ecosystem are likely to be more relevant to riverine pco2 in the tgr region this is generally supported by the distinct seasonality and spatial variations of pco2 oversaturation fig 2 further significant relationships between pco2 and doc could reflect within river respiration of organic matter to some extent fig 5 cole and caraco 2001 and much higher contents of nutrients in the rivers implied terrestrial inputs and simultaneously soil respiration influences to riverine co2 fig 4 li et al 2009a wallin et al 2013 previous studies in the yangtze river and other international rivers have reported the combined impacts of anthropogenic activities precipitation and hydrological flow path on riverine pco2 li et al 2012 li et al 2013a li and zhang 2014 we highlight that both the crest and trough of pco2 were observed in the summer wet season fig 2 which is mainly due to variable monsoonal precipitation for instance initial precipitation and mild temperature enhances soil microbial respiration and thus enhanced soil co2 content and export of soil co2 to rivers via runoff whereas the commutative effect of rainfall on increasing saturated soils as the monsoonal season extends leads to surface runoff and subsequent dilution of riverine pco2 this became evident in our data as the field work conducted over 2 weeks during the monsoonal season captured variability in rainfall and soil saturation from a large catchment area of 60 000 km2 i e some area with initial rain event while others with persistent rainfall etc the net effect of monsoonal rainfall eventually caused an overall dilution of riverine pco2 which was essentially responsible for the significantly lower wet season summer pco2 by comparison to the dry season autumn fig 2 substantial heterogeneity in basin physical characteristics and human land use activities i e there are developed districts of fuling and wangzhou and rural districts of fengdu and wuxi also contribute to the large spatial dynamics that were observed for pco2 fig 4 diverse human activities in the region are supported by highly variable seasonality of tdn and tdp concentrations as well as highly variable composition in the wet season fig 4 for example similar to other rivers i e han river in the yangtze river basin there were enhanced nutrient concentrations in the wet season because of diffusive pollutants li et al 2009a and overall diluted doc by rainfall lu et al 2012 4 2 relationships between pco2 and environmental variables water chemical variables and within river biogeochemical process also exerted an effect on pco2 beyond the over arching influence of hydrological processes there are a number of important water quality variables that showed a relationship with pco2 in the dry season but were absent during the wet season fig 5 table s5 there are two possible reasons for these differences firstly the effects of high flow conditions simply mask the other relationships alternatively there are some different processes simultaneously occurring that connect nutrient cycles and pco2 under conditions of low flow and higher temperature in the dry season prior studies reported a variable influence of nutrients on pco2 i e enhanced nutrients could favor aquatic photosynthesis that consumed dissolved co2 and produced dissolved o2 cole and caraco 2001 wang et al 2007 while others observed weak correlations between pco2 and nutrients li et al 2012 li et al 2013a low primary production as reflected by very low chla in these rivers could further mask the couplings between pco2 and nutrient elements however the tgr rivers are generally p limited as indicated by very high ratio of n to p fig 4 p increases therefore nourish microorganism and could potentially boost bacterial respiration of organic carbon resulting in the observed significant association between pco2 and dtp in the dry season fig 4 also both the dominant process of respiration and limited photosynthesis in these mountainous rivers could plausibly increase pco2 lowering do and ph resulting in the negative correlations between pco2 and do and ph as well as positive correlations between pco2 and doc table s5 there were strong relations between the thermodynamic variable ph and pco2 this was anticipated as the calculated pco2 from co2sys is highly dependent on the ph pco2 could be predicted using exponential models as follows autumn pco2 4e 11e 2 395ph r2 0 82 p 0 001 summer pco2 6e 10e 2 186ph r2 0 80 p 0 001 similar to other studies finlay et al 2009 li et al 2012 there is a good capacity for predicting pco2 using key parameters we found a stronger regression with an r2 0 9 when using multiple regression models with data on ph do and organic matter autumn

the measured riverine pco2 of this study were much lower than reported for most rivers listed in table s6 and or other world rivers cole and caraco 2001 yet comparable to that of the yangtze 1297 µatm and the mississippi 1335 µatm and exceeding the lower mekong 1090 µatm and st lawrence 576 µatm table s6 the estimated emission rates were within the previously published range but towards the upper end of published rates while the co2 area flux depended largely on gas transfer velocity for instance k values of 8 55 were adopted for co2 flux calculations from china s monsoonal rivers if we apply a k 10 that is widely used in china to the data from this study the estimated emission rates are within the intermediate published range table s6 amazon and boreal streams such as krycklan rivers showed peak emission rates our calculated co2 areal fluxes were however much higher than global riverine averages and were comparable to global average if k 10 was applied table s6 our estimates of co2 outgassing rates from free running waters in tgr tributaries were much higher as compared to the estimation from backwater area and main stream of the tgr table 1 however our estimates were comparable to the limited data from running waters of pengxi huang et al 2017 and backwater area of longxi li et al 2013 as well as degassing rates from other mountains rivers in the upper yangtze river such as maotiao wang et al 2011 and longchuan li et al 2012 the collated data in this region demonstrated that low flow velocity and increased water residence time increased phytoplankton production and thus enhanced photosynthesis which could reduce pco2 this was corroborated by the observations in the pengxi river i e co2 emission rate dramatically decreased from upper stream to downstream huang et al 2017 nevertheless backwater area was overall carbon source even in the severe algae blooming spring though the backwaters serve as co2 sink in short periods i e several days guo et al 2011 fu et al 2016 table 1 the results indicate that co2 emissions from tgr tributaries were previously underestimated i e 0 37 0 44 tg co2 y li et al 2017 and 0 03 tg co2 y yang et al 2013 the under estimation of this key process can be attributed to limited spatial and seasonal sampling for example prior upscaling estimates were based on one or two rivers such as the meixi li et al 2017 daning and pengxi rivers yang et al 2013 if the emissions of co2 0 77 1 3 tg co2 y from tgr surface water are included yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 total emissions from waters in the tgr region would amount to 3 02 3 72 tg co2 per year the emissions from our more detailed study of 2 33 tg co2 y lower limit of 0 64 tg co2 y based on this very first detailed investigation on tgr tributaries provide a more precise carbon budget for the regional rivers it also provides urgently needed primary data on mountainous rivers for inclusion in the riverine carbon assessment to inform global carbon models similar to other highly impacted publications ran et al 2015b k average was used for co2 areal flux calculations which potentially resulted in large uncertainty we therefore compared co2 emission rates using k values from separated streams and k mean level fig s2 and found that there was not a statistically significant difference by the two methods by mann whitney u test the difference of co2 mean areal flux for all rivers from separated k and k mean was within 10 in the same season thus our co2 emissions were reliable using the simple k average 5 conclusions the key results demonstrate that mountainous rivers and streams where data are scarce had higher than expected co2 emission rates which should be urgently included for global carbon budget from rivers we concluded that the negative correlation between co2 emission and do that was a striking feature in the data may indicate in situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon rather than photosynthesis as a dominant contribution of the co2 supersaturation under conditions typical of mountain rivers where flow is rapid and organic carbon residence time is short overall the riverine water was oversaturated in pco2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 µatm averaging about 1425 µatm 1573 1060 vs 1276 1166 µatm in dry and wet season this resulted in a water air interface co2 emission rate of 338 0 ranging between 135 5 and 2111 8 mmol m2 d in the tributaries of the reservoir the aqueous pco2 levels exhibited considerable spatial and seasonal variations with both the highest and lowest concentrations in the wet summer season the maximal pco2 was contributable to influx of soil co2 to streams via runoff and the minimum was due to the dilution effect by persistent and concentrated rainfall however the monsoonal precipitation ultimately limited pco2 via dilution acknowledgements this study was funded by the hundred talent program of the chinese academy of sciences
