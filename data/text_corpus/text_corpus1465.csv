7325,groundwater recharge gr controls vegetation geomorphology groundwater wetlands and surface flow and ultimately the ecology and economics of semi arid regions therefore it is critical to assess hydroclimate model scenarios and the uncertainty in future gr to force regional groundwater models we use basic statistics of downscaled global circulation model gcm projected cumulative potential gr grp for selecting representative projections cumulative grp is the net recharge difference between precipitation p and evapotranspiration et rates over the projection period the approach is illustrated with an example in the nebraska sand hills nsh the largest dune region in the western hemisphere where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow changes in decadal average grp at 1 8 12 km scale were estimated from spatially downscaled bias corrected temperature and p output from 16 commonly used gcms for years 2010 to 2099 these changes accounted for three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and projections were subsequently used as input to the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface hydrology model for each of the 48gcm vic hydroclimate projections cumulative grp was calculated and averaged over the study area three projections those with cumulative average grp nearest the median and 1 standard deviation were selected as representing median wet and dry conditions these projections allow for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models using readily available downscaled gcm projected climate changes thereby optimizing modeling efforts future grp was calculated for the nsh using the selected gr projections by adjusting the 2000 2009 baseline grp estimates at 1 km scale the latter was inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model with et based on remote sensing modis temperature data and matching regional baseflows in the nsh by 2099 the median projection indicates an increase in grp of 3mm yr 5 relative to the 2000 2009 baseline of 52 6mm yr the wet projection has an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection shows an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline effects of projection period duration and time step averaging on selection of gr projections with this approach are discussed the new detailed grp projections clarify varying trends of past large scale analyses of the northern high plains region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the nsh hydrologic system this approach can be extended to other arid to humid regions with available gcm hydroclimate projections keywords groundwater recharge gr cumulative potential recharge global circulation models gcm climate change groundwater modeling nebraska sand hills nsh 1 introduction groundwater modeling of land use and climate change impacts on groundwater recharge gr discharge and aquifer levels has become an increasingly urgent topic in groundwater science candela et al 2009 doble and crosbie 2017 goderniaux et al 2011 green et al 2011 hanson et al 2014 maxwell and kollet 2008 meixner et al 2016 rosenberg et al 1999 scibek and allen 2006 taylor et al 2013 wanders and van lanen 2015 woldeamlak et al 2007 york et al 2002 these changes commonly pose major threats to surface water features such as groundwater fed lakes and wetlands as groundwater systems respond to changing gr green et al 2011 sometimes with disastrous ecological and economic consequences e g tao et al 2015 this issue is especially important in arid and semi arid environments where groundwater discharge often dominates the water balance of streams and lakes and supports their existence changing groundwater levels and coverage of lakes and wetlands can affect groundwater dependent ecosystems klove et al 2014 and agriculture where plants are sub irrigated by groundwater such as in the nebraska sand hills nsh harvey et al 2007 an important gr area of the high plains aquifer scanlon et al 2012 drying lakebeds in these systems act as preferential dust source areas contributing disproportionately to global dust emissions tegen et al 2002 ginoux et al 2012 these issues are at the center of an area of intensive research integrating groundwater modeling remote sensing and field observations for modeling purposes research institutions and management agencies rely on already available studies of gr derived from of global circulation model gcm projections in such cases development of gr projections is just a stage of a larger project that must consider other drivers of change such as land use and resource demands snover et al 2013 vano et al 2015 thus sets of various projections are constrained by the capacity to assess and incorporate available climate change scenarios into the planning or modeling process for example meixner et al 2016 generalized implications of projected climate change for gr in the western united states and found that modeling studies of projected climate change effects had been carried out for about half of the reviewed aquifers in contrast to that studies with emphasis on gr commonly strive to incorporate all possible gcm projections table 1 presents a few representative examples for illustration purposes studies of rosenberg et al 1999 scibek and allen 2006 toews and allen 2009 allen et al 2010 provide examples of groundwater models of different scales with different number of gr projections used from a small number of gcms selection of gcms and projections used ad hoc considerations as also was shown by meixner et al 2016 in contrast to that studies by crosbie et al 2010 2011 2013 and tillman et al 2017 were dedicated entirely to gr mapping following numerous studies based on the world climate research programme wcrp coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 projections in analyses crosbie et al 2013 used 49 projections and tillman et al 2016 explored 97 projections in both cases increasing the projections subsets and inference of statistical properties was recommended for future gr studies processing of the ever growing number of gcms and ghg scenarios may produce additional information and characteristics of the entire set of projections however use of each projection as an input for groundwater modeling and analysis of the resulting output dataset may not be an optimal strategy rather selected representative projections should be used for groundwater modeling with moderate size datasets of gr projections then the characterization of the sensitivity of the regional groundwater systems to gr changes and analyses of the modeling uncertainty becomes more efficient despite this need to rationalize the number of climate scenarios in impact modeling assessments there is a limited focus toward methods of effectively using gcm derived information e g vano et al 2015 starting from pioneering work by rosenberg et al 1999 groundwater recharge and groundwater modeling studies vary by the numbers of gcm projections used table 1 in this aspect the study of allen et al 2010 exemplifies the inherent problem of a growing number of both gcm models and greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios conducting regional studies required modeling the gr and groundwater flow and they considered only four gcms and two ghg scenarios i e eight climate change projections for an aquifer on the border of canada and the us area of 161km2 alternatively tillman et al 2016 studied gr for the upper colorado river basin 293 721km2 using 97 gcm projections but without groundwater modeling these approaches to gr estimation differ greatly in detail based on the amount of available modern climate data used and gcm projections therefore it is desirable to have a simple method for summarizing the wealth of possible gr projections and their uncertainty before undertaking more in depth studies such as forcing diagnostic regional groundwater flow models we use a simple approach to the task of identifying and selecting three representative gr scenarios for groundwater modeling while capturing the variability inherent in the set of individual projections based on gcms and ghg scenarios unlike ng et al 2010 or crosbie et al 2013 this approach is based on analyses of gridded cumulative potential gr and consists of the following steps 1 selection of the duration of the projection period 2 identification of gcms ghg emissions scenarios and land surface hydrology models 3 assessment of future changes in the net potential groundwater recharge grp as the difference between gcm projected mean precipitation p and coupled land surface hydrology model simulated actual evapotranspiration et 4 compilation of grp datasets and calculation of statistics of cumulative over the projection period spatially averaged grp for all gcms and ghg emissions scenarios and 5 identification of representative median wet and dry gr projections these steps result in the necessary gr inputs for regional groundwater modeling we will illustrate the idea with a focus on the nebraska sand hills nsh a 40 000 km2 portion of the northern high plains aquifer region with total area of 450 000km2 rosenberg et al 1999 table iii estimated reductions of gr for the entire missouri river basin of about the same total area as the high plains aquifer reductions of gr in the northern high plains aquifer region were predicted to range between 10 and 17 based on one of three selected gcms and three ghg emissions scenarios crosbie et al 2013 presented gr study for entire high plains aquifer region using 16 gcms and three ghg scenarios and found a substantial qualitative difference in gr dynamics between the northern and southern high plains aquifer regions in 2050 the most southern parts may experience a future decrease in gr while the northern parts may even exhibit a modest increase meixner et al 2016 found similar latitudinal trends in analyses of future gr in the western united states we will address variance in predicted trends using only limited number of projections the primary objective of our study is to demonstrate an approach to the assessment of the gcm projected net grp changes in the nsh region including the range and most likely possible projections for the 21st century furthermore this approach specifically evaluates temporal variability of future gr projections and how this gcm selection approach is influenced by choice of projection period duration this approach can be used for diagnostic analyses of climate and land use related changes for regional groundwater modeling in many areas of the world 2 study area in the semi arid dune environment of the nebraska sand hills nsh the largest continuous dune region in the western hemisphere ahlbrandt and fryberger 1980 many streams and several thousand natural groundwater fed lakes and wetlands exist in hydraulic connection with the northern high plains aquifer fig 1 they are supported by the highest gr rates of the entire high plains aquifer region crosbie et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 averaging more than 70mm yr and exceeding 270mm yr in some areas szilagyi et al 2011 the absence of overland flow due to the high infiltration capacity of the sands bleed and flowerday 1998 suggests that groundwater derived from local precipitation is the primary source of water to lakes and streams bleed and flowerday 1998 current water resources are plentiful in the region providing relatively steady water inputs to the downstream platte river basin and drinking water for cities with total population of about one million irrigation in the nsh study area fig 1 is limited due to the sandy soils and variable topography and land use change is expected to be negligible so these effects are unlikely to obscure the effects of future climate change however little is known about hydrological vulnerability of the nsh due to 21st century climate change bathke et al 2014 what is known from tree rings archeological remains lake sediment and geomorphic data is that alternating humid and dry periods have been common over the holocene miao et al 2007 with numerous documented occasions of extensive and extended drought over the last 10 000years in the great plains woodhouse and overpeck 1998 moreover droughts of greater duration and severity than observed during the instrumental record have occurred as recently as 700years ago and were accompanied by dune migration loope et al 1995 miao et al 2007 3 methods 3 1 selecting set of future climate models for groundwater recharge estimation the steps taken in the process of generating gr data for regional groundwater modeling at a 1 km resolution in the sand hills of nebraska are outlined in fig 2 in eight steps diagram blocks the set of gcms and scenarios contains uncertainties of two kinds 1 differences in the simulated processes and parameterization of gcms and 2 global and regional climate dynamics driven by differences in future ghg emissions here we made use of cmip3 model results meehl et al 2007 rather than cmip5 to enable comparisons to previous work and because cmip5 climate projections change little from cmip3 projections over the central great plains brekke et al 2013 an ensemble of bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd climate and hydrology projections downscaled from 16 gcms and 3 ghg emissions scenarios was obtained from the downscaled cmip3 and cmip5 climate and hydrology projections archive http gdo dcp ucllnl org downscaled cmip projections the gcm model projections used in this study were forced by three ghg emissions scenarios a2 a1b and b1 after ipcc sres nakicenovic et al 2000 covering a wide range of demographic economic and technological driving forces leading to differences in ghg emissions and global surface temperatures these downscaled projections were then utilized to determine future gr projections for the 21st century monthly gridded values of p and et for the entire 21st century spanning the missouri river basin with a spatial resolution of 1 8 12 km were downloaded from the archive using a single run of each 16 gcm and each 3 ghg emissions scenario a total of 48 combinations fig 2 block 1 usbr 2011 the downloaded hydrology variable et was produced using the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale land surface hydrology model applying the penman monteith equation and allowing for deep drainage liang et al 1994 niraula et al 2017 the archive of cmip3 hydroclimate model projections provided the necessary p and et data to generate future grp changes from 2010 through the end of the 21st century as follows for each of the 48 combinations of gcms and ghg emissions scenarios grp was calculated using a water balance approach as the mean decadal difference between p and et considering that overland flow is minimal due to high infiltration rates in the nsh bleed and flowerday 1998 averages of grp at the downscaled gcm grid scale 12 km over each 21st century decade 2000 2009 2010 2019 and 2090 2099 were calculated and clipped using arcgis to cover only the study area fig 2 block 2 the same p et water balance approach relying on remote sensing measurements has been implemented successfully in the nsh region szilagyi et al 2011 and the entire state of nebraska at 1 km resolution szilagyi and jozsa 2013 and elsewhere e g brunner et al 2007 crosbie et al 2014 to estimate spatially distributed gr rates and for inputs to groundwater flow models the grp from different gcms may vary during the projection period complicating the comparison of various gr projections for example a wet projection may become dry for a certain period or vice versa for instance the a1b scenario projects the largest increase in global temperatures between about 2000 2060 while a2 exceeds a1b in surface warming after 2060 up to 3 6 c in 2100 relative to 2000 meanwhile the b1 scenario shows the smallest increase in surface temperature similarly changes in p in the future are projected by the gcms but in the central u s and in nebraska itself there is little agreement of the overall direction of changes in the long term average christensen et al 2007 ipcc 2014 causing the relatively high uncertainty in projections of future gr in this region however in the last thirty years of the 21st century 2071 2099 increases in p of 0 20 are expected over winter and spring months with decreases of 0 20 over summer months and insignificant trends in the fall months karl et al 2009 walsh et al 2014 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios followed by differences among gcms are the dominant sources of uncertainty in future gr estimation crosbie et al 2011 2013 and the ensemble of 48 climate projections used in this study represent a wide range of these main sources of uncertainty other lesser sources of uncertainty such as from the choice of downscaling method or land surface hydrological model selected and its parameterization vic model used here were not considered in this study niraula et al 2017 provide a comparison of three different land surface hydrology models applied across the western u s concluding that vic and noah are the best suited tools for potential recharge estimation from a water management perspective or for protection of aquatic habitat it is likely best to have a possible range of outcomes and plan accordingly rather than plan for the average likelihood alone allen et al 2010 to represent the range of possibilities there is a need to select at least one dry and one wet projection here we choose three projections of the 48 analyzed by way of analysis of cumulative potential gr the following section describes the basis on which the gcm projections were selected 3 2 evaluating gcm projections by cumulative potential groundwater recharge grp diffuse groundwater recharge is the major driver and often largest water budget component of many groundwater systems to compare all available gr projections we calculated cumulative grp from each gcm projection averaged over the study area from the beginning to the end of the projection period fig 2 block 3 resulting in the curves shown in fig 3 the descriptive statistics of the 48 cumulative spatially averaged grp were then used to select three gr projections those closest to the median cumulative grp and 1 standard deviation sd from the median represent median wet and dry conditions fig 2 block 4 this process removes 405 raster files of decadal grp over a 90 year projection period resulting in 27 gr projections 12 12 km raster files remaining for use to force the groundwater model fig 2 block 5 as mentioned above the duration of the projection period may play a significant role in selection of gr projections to illustrate the role of the projection period duration we compare 40 year and 90 year projections and show differences that could arise in the final selection of representative median wet and dry gcm projections of gr changes 3 3 calculation of future potential groundwater recharge rates our approach to calculation of future grp rates is to superimpose decadal changes from the three selected gcms vic 12 12 km hydroclimate projections onto the modern conditions of 2000 2009 baseline accounting for variations of projected grp fig 2 block 6 while of secondary concern with respect to the objectives of this article this step was carried out to provide 1 km resolution future gr estimates for direct application to a transient groundwater model and to discuss changes relative to an arguably more accurate baseline than could be provided by the bias corrected spatial disaggregation gcm vic hydroclimate projections it is important to note that all gcm estimates of grp for 2000 2009 at 12 12 km scale have some bias with respect to the baseline estimate therefore for transient groundwater modeling this bias is corrected by adjusting baseline estimates 1 1 km by the decadal changes obtained from gcms fig 2 block 7 baseline grp 2000 2009 estimates were derived from modis land surface temperature satellite measurements and other ancillary climate data szilagyi and jozsa 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 and were slightly adjusted during calibration of a previously developed steady state modflow based groundwater model with 1 km horizontal grid cell resolution rossman 2015 rossman et al in press after calibration of the groundwater model to water levels and regional baseflow to streams the spatially averaged baseline grp from 2000 to 2009 equaled 52 6mm yr 15 greater than the modis derived original grp estimate 46mm yr of szilagyi and jozsa 2013 over the same time period and study area in addition to having fine spatial resolution 1 km baseline grp has complete coverage of the study area and both positive and negative net gr rates regarded as requirements for regional groundwater flow modeling in shallow groundwater systems szilagyi and jozsa 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 median wet and dry projections averaged over the study area net cumulative 2010 2099 potential groundwater recharge grp for the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections had a median of 4 970m 55 2mm yr a mean of 5 080m 56 4mm yr a standard deviation sd of 1 548m 17 2mm yr and a range of 6 884m 76 5mm yr minimum cumulative 2010 2099 grp equaled 2 468m 27 4mm yr and the maximum equaled 9 351m 103 9mm yr curves shown on fig 3 fig 4 depicts maps of the cumulative grp from 2010 2099 for the three selected gr projections the spatial variability is due to the gradients in climate topography land cover use and to a lesser degree soils the magnitude of the spatial variability quantified by sd for each decade remains roughly the same throughout the 21st century with no apparent trend projected by the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections assessed fig 5 the sd of the decadal grp rates varies in time between 19 2mm yr and 27 0mm yr 36 6 and 51 4 of the baseline grp rate respectively following the selection criteria described herein by the end of the century 2090s the selected median gcm vic projection yields a spatially averaged increase in grp of 3mm yr 5 relative to the 2000 2009 baseline estimate of 52 6mm yr the wet projection yields an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection yields an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline these projected changes in grp are consistent with other large scale analyses in the region e g meixner et al 2016 and nearby in colorado tillman et al 2016 and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the groundwater system and its connected surface water features with the tendency of the median projection towards a slight increase in gr for the nsh such quantification has substantially higher resolution than previous studies cf crosbie et al 2013 meixner et al 2016 with direct implications for applications in transient regional groundwater flow modeling the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate model projections each have considerable variability from decade to decade fig 5 the coefficient of variation cv sd divided by the mean of decadal average grp from 2010 to 2099 varies from 0 43 to 0 66 and averages 0 55 for comparison the average cv of the three selected gr projections selected are 0 55 median 0 49 wet 0 43 dry thereby the selected gr projections capture most but not all of the full range of potential future gr variability displayed by all 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections assessed interestingly the dry projection indicates generally wetter conditions over 2010 2030 and gr for the median projection can exceed or almost equal the wet projection gr e g 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 4 2 temporal and spatial trends the temporal changes in the three grp projections fig 5 have similar magnitudes and range of uncertainty as those published for the northern high plains aquifer region by crosbie et al 2013 and the upper colorado basin by tillman et al 2017 gr is projected to decrease in lower recharge areas in the southern and central high plains aquifer regions while slightly increasing in the northern high plains aquifer region results have a similar spatial trend as those that can be inferred from rosenberg et al 1999 who found smaller decreases of recharge in the entire missouri river basin compared to the arkansas river basin however rosenberg et al 1999 did not single out the nsh region specifically and lumped watershed areas of possible increase in nebraska with areas of gr reduction in kansas thereby projecting slight overall decreases in general future gr reductions decrease northward ultimately becoming an increase in nebraska these results are consistent with cook et al 2015 indicating moderate to severe decreases in gr rates and increases in drought indices based on analysis of the palmer drought index and soil moisture metrics interestingly tillman et al 2017 found a similar trend of gr increase by 2099 at the same latitude in the upper colorado basin decadal averages yielded increases by approximately 5 to 10 based on 97 climate change projections meixner et al 2016 drew similar conclusions for the northern high plains aquifer region changes in future gr rates may be positive or negative depending on changes in the intensity of rainfall allen et al 2010 toews and allen 2009 and on the fraction of precipitation falling as either rain or snow jyrkama and sykes 2007 a possible additional factor for the increases in future gr rates in the nsh region is that the soils are substantially more permeable than in surrounding regions the finding here that a slight increase in gr is the most likely for the nsh indicates that the gcms the statistical downscaling method used usbr 2011 and the land surface hydrology model vic are capable of accurately simulating the processes that determine p and et however there is potential for vic to systematically underestimate current et rates as the version implemented does not explicitly account for the many small lakes in the nsh usbr 2011 and because it does not account for lateral groundwater flow at basin scales thus affecting land surface moisture states taylor et al 2013 4 3 effects of projection period duration the approach used here to find representative median wet and dry gr projections involves elements of subjectivity especially for wet and dry projections even when ranges for the nsh and upper colorado tillman et al 2016 are encouragingly similar in magnitude datasets of cumulative grp whether 48 or 97 gcm scenarios may not have a normal distribution for example crosbie et al 2010 proposed using pearson type iii distribution fitted to a set of grp at the final date of the projection period more importantly it is apparent that the duration of projection period affects cumulative grp statistics and selection of median wet and dry projections to illustrate this point we applied our approach for comparing such grp projections in the study area between period 2010 2049 and period 2010 2099 using histograms of cumulative grp at final years fig 6 see also table s1 of the supplementary material comparison of these histograms shows that sd spread in selection of representative projections is higher for longer forecast periods visual inspection also indicates that the use of lognormal or pearson type iii distributions becomes more plausible clearly representative median wet and dry projections are different for each projection period table 2 and table s1 of the supplementary material there are other ways of summarizing statistics of projections including quartiles and box plot diagrams however the reliance on sd in defining uncertainty bounds for representative projections is simple provides plausible projections and is a visual approach to preparing input data for groundwater models 4 4 time step in projections the ultimate goal of this study is to apply representative projections in transient groundwater flow models here time steps are defined by accuracy requirements of numerical method and data in regional groundwater models smaller time steps daily to monthly are rarely required or applied rossman and zlotnik 2013 as time steps or stress periods are typically on the time scale of years and longer however there is also a hydrological constraint time steps must be at least as long as it takes for infiltrating water from precipitation to traverse the vadose zone potential groundwater recharge grp will become actual groundwater recharge gra after a certain vadose zone lag time the time required for moisture changes to traverse the vadose zone before reaching the water table fig 2 block 7 cf rossman et al 2014 although this constraint does not exist for models where vadose zone soil moisture flow is calculated using physically based numerical modeling codes for example those solving richards equation in three dimensions e g parflow hydrogeosphere see maxwell and kollet 2008 in more traditional groundwater modeling applications e g modflow the vadose zone lag time between grp and gra must be introduced rossman et al 2014 show that in 90 of the nsh this lag time is less than 10years under the baseline 2000 2009 climate with an analytical solution requiring only vadose zone thickness and long term average grp in modeling of the nsh and other cases of thick vadose zones this constraint affected the selection of the decadal grp temporal averaging that was used with such a time step gra effectively equals grp in the nsh fig 2 block 8 in general large vadose zone thickness and low permeability soils rocks in the vadose zone may require assessment of lag time as it may be longer than 10years in other basins or under different climatic conditions e g cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 this would be true of large portions of the central and southern high plains aquifer and other areas generally in semi arid or arid climates 4 5 applying other projection measures more complex time dependent measures of projections such as the aridity index or palmer drought severity index could be used for comparison of various projections dai and zhao 2016 however evaluation of cumulative grp is especially attractive for groundwater modeling since it can be directly applied as input to transient models and the variable is considered in conceptual assessments of regional water budgets of groundwater systems furthermore in areas with lower infiltration capacity and higher overland flows the approach used here is still useful only the land surface hydrology model output of deep drainage should be used in the groundwater model instead of p et in regions where this is the case the vadose zone thickness ought to be considered as well as the time shift between potential gr grp and actual gr gra at the water table e g cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 5 summary and conclusions regional groundwater modeling is a standard tool for estimating the effects of future land use and climate changes on groundwater recharge gr and numerous global circulation model gcm and greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios are currently used for obtaining input data studies of future climate change impacts to gr rarely explore assessment and selection approaches e g vano et al 2015 and typically do not even rationalize the choice of gcms selected with proliferation of models and climate change scenarios inferences of the new gr projections forces multiple and frequent recalculation of these effects with groundwater models to constrain the latter step in future developments we identify only a limited number of projections while capturing most of the variability inherent among the ensemble of projections towards this goal we use statistics of the cumulative potential groundwater recharge grp which is defined as the difference between long term precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration et estimates for a future projection period duration of interest e g 40 or 90years this approach starts with developing a set of projections of gr finding cumulative grp for each gcm ghg scenario that can be coupled with a land surface hydrology model over the projection period and calculating statistics of the spatial average grp dataset in the area of interest these statistics permit a large reduction in the projections needed by selecting a small subset of representative gr projections that still represent well the range of projected grp changes groundwater recharge projections were developed based on gcm projected changes in the decadal averages of the difference between p and et from publically available downscaled gcm and land surface hydrology model variable infiltration capacity vic outputs under intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sres scenarios of global ghg emissions this approach is illustrated by the case of the nebraska sand hills nsh where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow changes in decadal averages of grp at 1 8 12 km scale were estimated from 16 commonly used spatially downscaled bias corrected gcm under three ghg emissions scenarios of the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate model projections the grp changes were estimated and applied as adjustments to the baseline 2000 2009 grp at 1 km scale the latter were inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model with et derived from remote sensing modis temperature data of 2000 2009 and calibrated gr allowing a match with regional baseflow to streams after obtaining cumulative over a period of 40 and 90years spatially averaged grp from 48 projections three gr projections median wet and dry were selected for the nebraska sand hills nsh in the nsh the 90 year median projection indicates a spatially averaged grp increase of 3mm yr 5 by the end of the century relative to the 2000 2009 baseline of 52 6mm yr the wet projection indicates an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection yields an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline the projected grp estimates are consistent with other large scale analyses of the region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the nsh hydrologic system our estimate resolves variance in interpretations of gr trends between rosenberg et al 1999 and crosbie et al 2013 high infiltration rates of the sandy soils reduce overland flow in the nsh and groundwater lag time between precipitation events and actual recharge at the water table which is within 3 7years on average in the nsh even with future potential climate changes shorter than the decadal time step utilized in the current study this is an important consideration in groundwater modeling defined by the hydraulic properties and thickness of the vadose zone cf cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 use of gr projections to understand impacts on groundwater systems elsewhere need to consider the issue of groundwater system response time green et al 2011 for example response times are becoming considerably shorter during wet conditions with higher gr rates another factor affecting the response time is distance between drainages gr changes may take considerable time centuries to affect the entire groundwater system uncertainty in gr rates is generally considered to be caused by both gcms and ghg emissions scenarios crosbie et al 2011 however analyses of dynamic feedbacks between changing wetland coverage streamflows climate variables and groundwater flow simulations will certainly be required in future modeling studies the decision to exclude these processes was based on adequate local information on the geology climate and vadose zone flows which may not be appropriate in other study areas this methodology allows for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models to gcm projected climate changes and assessing the absolute changes in future grp and changes relative to a baseline from the recent historical period future investigations may require assessment of gr projection temporal variability resulting from individual gcms at smaller time steps this is not a problem as available hydroclimate data are typically resolved at the daily to monthly scale finally it is important to note that wet projections may include decades of drought while still having the largest total gr over the entire projection period therefore use of commonly accepted climate change scenarios requires a clearly defined assessment of the projection period duration wet projections may not be the wettest and dry projections may not be the driest consistently over such projection period acknowledgements this research was supported by grants from the national science foundation igert program dge 0903469

hydroclimate model scenarios and the uncertainty in future gr to force regional groundwater models we use basic statistics of downscaled global circulation model gcm projected cumulative potential gr grp for selecting representative projections cumulative grp is the net recharge difference between precipitation p and evapotranspiration et rates over the projection period the approach is illustrated with an example in the nebraska sand hills nsh the largest dune region in the western hemisphere where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow changes in decadal average grp at 1 8 12 km scale were estimated from spatially downscaled bias corrected temperature and p output from 16 commonly used gcms for years 2010 to 2099 these changes accounted for three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and projections were subsequently used as input to the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface hydrology model for each of the 48gcm vic hydroclimate projections cumulative grp was calculated and averaged over the study area three projections those with cumulative average grp nearest the median and 1 standard deviation were selected as representing median wet and dry conditions these projections allow for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models using readily available downscaled gcm projected climate changes thereby optimizing modeling efforts future grp was calculated for the nsh using the selected gr projections by adjusting the 2000 2009 baseline grp estimates at 1 km scale the latter was inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model with et based on remote sensing modis temperature data and matching regional baseflows in the nsh by 2099 the median projection indicates an increase in grp of 3mm yr 5 relative to the 2000 2009 baseline of 52 6mm yr the wet projection has an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection shows an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline effects of projection period duration and time step averaging on selection of gr projections with this approach are discussed the new detailed grp projections clarify varying trends of past large scale analyses of the northern high plains region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the nsh hydrologic system this approach can be extended to other arid to humid regions with available gcm hydroclimate projections keywords groundwater recharge gr cumulative potential recharge global circulation models gcm climate change groundwater modeling nebraska sand hills nsh 1 introduction groundwater modeling of land use and climate change impacts on groundwater recharge gr discharge and aquifer levels has become an increasingly urgent topic in groundwater science candela et al 2009 doble and crosbie 2017 goderniaux et al 2011 green et al 2011 hanson et al 2014 maxwell and kollet 2008 meixner et al 2016 rosenberg et al 1999 scibek and allen 2006 taylor et al 2013 wanders and van lanen 2015 woldeamlak et al 2007 york et al 2002 these changes commonly pose major threats to surface water features such as groundwater fed lakes and wetlands as groundwater systems respond to changing gr green et al 2011 sometimes with disastrous ecological and economic consequences e g tao et al 2015 this issue is especially important in arid and semi arid environments where groundwater discharge often dominates the water balance of streams and lakes and supports their existence changing groundwater levels and coverage of lakes and wetlands can affect groundwater dependent ecosystems klove et al 2014 and agriculture where plants are sub irrigated by groundwater such as in the nebraska sand hills nsh harvey et al 2007 an important gr area of the high plains aquifer scanlon et al 2012 drying lakebeds in these systems act as preferential dust source areas contributing disproportionately to global dust emissions tegen et al 2002 ginoux et al 2012 these issues are at the center of an area of intensive research integrating groundwater modeling remote sensing and field observations for modeling purposes research institutions and management agencies rely on already available studies of gr derived from of global circulation model gcm projections in such cases development of gr projections is just a stage of a larger project that must consider other drivers of change such as land use and resource demands snover et al 2013 vano et al 2015 thus sets of various projections are constrained by the capacity to assess and incorporate available climate change scenarios into the planning or modeling process for example meixner et al 2016 generalized implications of projected climate change for gr in the western united states and found that modeling studies of projected climate change effects had been carried out for about half of the reviewed aquifers in contrast to that studies with emphasis on gr commonly strive to incorporate all possible gcm projections table 1 presents a few representative examples for illustration purposes studies of rosenberg et al 1999 scibek and allen 2006 toews and allen 2009 allen et al 2010 provide examples of groundwater models of different scales with different number of gr projections used from a small number of gcms selection of gcms and projections used ad hoc considerations as also was shown by meixner et al 2016 in contrast to that studies by crosbie et al 2010 2011 2013 and tillman et al 2017 were dedicated entirely to gr mapping following numerous studies based on the world climate research programme wcrp coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 projections in analyses crosbie et al 2013 used 49 projections and tillman et al 2016 explored 97 projections in both cases increasing the projections subsets and inference of statistical properties was recommended for future gr studies processing of the ever growing number of gcms and ghg scenarios may produce additional information and characteristics of the entire set of projections however use of each projection as an input for groundwater modeling and analysis of the resulting output dataset may not be an optimal strategy rather selected representative projections should be used for groundwater modeling with moderate size datasets of gr projections then the characterization of the sensitivity of the regional groundwater systems to gr changes and analyses of the modeling uncertainty becomes more efficient despite this need to rationalize the number of climate scenarios in impact modeling assessments there is a limited focus toward methods of effectively using gcm derived information e g vano et al 2015 starting from pioneering work by rosenberg et al 1999 groundwater recharge and groundwater modeling studies vary by the numbers of gcm projections used table 1 in this aspect the study of allen et al 2010 exemplifies the inherent problem of a growing number of both gcm models and greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios conducting regional studies required modeling the gr and groundwater flow and they considered only four gcms and two ghg scenarios i e eight climate change projections for an aquifer on the border of canada and the us area of 161km2 alternatively tillman et al 2016 studied gr for the upper colorado river basin 293 721km2 using 97 gcm projections but without groundwater modeling these approaches to gr estimation differ greatly in detail based on the amount of available modern climate data used and gcm projections therefore it is desirable to have a simple method for summarizing the wealth of possible gr projections and their uncertainty before undertaking more in depth studies such as forcing diagnostic regional groundwater flow models we use a simple approach to the task of identifying and selecting three representative gr scenarios for groundwater modeling while capturing the variability inherent in the set of individual projections based on gcms and ghg scenarios unlike ng et al 2010 or crosbie et al 2013 this approach is based on analyses of gridded cumulative potential gr and consists of the following steps 1 selection of the duration of the projection period 2 identification of gcms ghg emissions scenarios and land surface hydrology models 3 assessment of future changes in the net potential groundwater recharge grp as the difference between gcm projected mean precipitation p and coupled land surface hydrology model simulated actual evapotranspiration et 4 compilation of grp datasets and calculation of statistics of cumulative over the projection period spatially averaged grp for all gcms and ghg emissions scenarios and 5 identification of representative median wet and dry gr projections these steps result in the necessary gr inputs for regional groundwater modeling we will illustrate the idea with a focus on the nebraska sand hills nsh a 40 000 km2 portion of the northern high plains aquifer region with total area of 450 000km2 rosenberg et al 1999 table iii estimated reductions of gr for the entire missouri river basin of about the same total area as the high plains aquifer reductions of gr in the northern high plains aquifer region were predicted to range between 10 and 17 based on one of three selected gcms and three ghg emissions scenarios crosbie et al 2013 presented gr study for entire high plains aquifer region using 16 gcms and three ghg scenarios and found a substantial qualitative difference in gr dynamics between the northern and southern high plains aquifer regions in 2050 the most southern parts may experience a future decrease in gr while the northern parts may even exhibit a modest increase meixner et al 2016 found similar latitudinal trends in analyses of future gr in the western united states we will address variance in predicted trends using only limited number of projections the primary objective of our study is to demonstrate an approach to the assessment of the gcm projected net grp changes in the nsh region including the range and most likely possible projections for the 21st century furthermore this approach specifically evaluates temporal variability of future gr projections and how this gcm selection approach is influenced by choice of projection period duration this approach can be used for diagnostic analyses of climate and land use related changes for regional groundwater modeling in many areas of the world 2 study area in the semi arid dune environment of the nebraska sand hills nsh the largest continuous dune region in the western hemisphere ahlbrandt and fryberger 1980 many streams and several thousand natural groundwater fed lakes and wetlands exist in hydraulic connection with the northern high plains aquifer fig 1 they are supported by the highest gr rates of the entire high plains aquifer region crosbie et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 averaging more than 70mm yr and exceeding 270mm yr in some areas szilagyi et al 2011 the absence of overland flow due to the high infiltration capacity of the sands bleed and flowerday 1998 suggests that groundwater derived from local precipitation is the primary source of water to lakes and streams bleed and flowerday 1998 current water resources are plentiful in the region providing relatively steady water inputs to the downstream platte river basin and drinking water for cities with total population of about one million irrigation in the nsh study area fig 1 is limited due to the sandy soils and variable topography and land use change is expected to be negligible so these effects are unlikely to obscure the effects of future climate change however little is known about hydrological vulnerability of the nsh due to 21st century climate change bathke et al 2014 what is known from tree rings archeological remains lake sediment and geomorphic data is that alternating humid and dry periods have been common over the holocene miao et al 2007 with numerous documented occasions of extensive and extended drought over the last 10 000years in the great plains woodhouse and overpeck 1998 moreover droughts of greater duration and severity than observed during the instrumental record have occurred as recently as 700years ago and were accompanied by dune migration loope et al 1995 miao et al 2007 3 methods 3 1 selecting set of future climate models for groundwater recharge estimation the steps taken in the process of generating gr data for regional groundwater modeling at a 1 km resolution in the sand hills of nebraska are outlined in fig 2 in eight steps diagram blocks the set of gcms and scenarios contains uncertainties of two kinds 1 differences in the simulated processes and parameterization of gcms and 2 global and regional climate dynamics driven by differences in future ghg emissions here we made use of cmip3 model results meehl et al 2007 rather than cmip5 to enable comparisons to previous work and because cmip5 climate projections change little from cmip3 projections over the central great plains brekke et al 2013 an ensemble of bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd climate and hydrology projections downscaled from 16 gcms and 3 ghg emissions scenarios was obtained from the downscaled cmip3 and cmip5 climate and hydrology projections archive http gdo dcp ucllnl org downscaled cmip projections the gcm model projections used in this study were forced by three ghg emissions scenarios a2 a1b and b1 after ipcc sres nakicenovic et al 2000 covering a wide range of demographic economic and technological driving forces leading to differences in ghg emissions and global surface temperatures these downscaled projections were then utilized to determine future gr projections for the 21st century monthly gridded values of p and et for the entire 21st century spanning the missouri river basin with a spatial resolution of 1 8 12 km were downloaded from the archive using a single run of each 16 gcm and each 3 ghg emissions scenario a total of 48 combinations fig 2 block 1 usbr 2011 the downloaded hydrology variable et was produced using the variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale land surface hydrology model applying the penman monteith equation and allowing for deep drainage liang et al 1994 niraula et al 2017 the archive of cmip3 hydroclimate model projections provided the necessary p and et data to generate future grp changes from 2010 through the end of the 21st century as follows for each of the 48 combinations of gcms and ghg emissions scenarios grp was calculated using a water balance approach as the mean decadal difference between p and et considering that overland flow is minimal due to high infiltration rates in the nsh bleed and flowerday 1998 averages of grp at the downscaled gcm grid scale 12 km over each 21st century decade 2000 2009 2010 2019 and 2090 2099 were calculated and clipped using arcgis to cover only the study area fig 2 block 2 the same p et water balance approach relying on remote sensing measurements has been implemented successfully in the nsh region szilagyi et al 2011 and the entire state of nebraska at 1 km resolution szilagyi and jozsa 2013 and elsewhere e g brunner et al 2007 crosbie et al 2014 to estimate spatially distributed gr rates and for inputs to groundwater flow models the grp from different gcms may vary during the projection period complicating the comparison of various gr projections for example a wet projection may become dry for a certain period or vice versa for instance the a1b scenario projects the largest increase in global temperatures between about 2000 2060 while a2 exceeds a1b in surface warming after 2060 up to 3 6 c in 2100 relative to 2000 meanwhile the b1 scenario shows the smallest increase in surface temperature similarly changes in p in the future are projected by the gcms but in the central u s and in nebraska itself there is little agreement of the overall direction of changes in the long term average christensen et al 2007 ipcc 2014 causing the relatively high uncertainty in projections of future gr in this region however in the last thirty years of the 21st century 2071 2099 increases in p of 0 20 are expected over winter and spring months with decreases of 0 20 over summer months and insignificant trends in the fall months karl et al 2009 walsh et al 2014 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios followed by differences among gcms are the dominant sources of uncertainty in future gr estimation crosbie et al 2011 2013 and the ensemble of 48 climate projections used in this study represent a wide range of these main sources of uncertainty other lesser sources of uncertainty such as from the choice of downscaling method or land surface hydrological model selected and its parameterization vic model used here were not considered in this study niraula et al 2017 provide a comparison of three different land surface hydrology models applied across the western u s concluding that vic and noah are the best suited tools for potential recharge estimation from a water management perspective or for protection of aquatic habitat it is likely best to have a possible range of outcomes and plan accordingly rather than plan for the average likelihood alone allen et al 2010 to represent the range of possibilities there is a need to select at least one dry and one wet projection here we choose three projections of the 48 analyzed by way of analysis of cumulative potential gr the following section describes the basis on which the gcm projections were selected 3 2 evaluating gcm projections by cumulative potential groundwater recharge grp diffuse groundwater recharge is the major driver and often largest water budget component of many groundwater systems to compare all available gr projections we calculated cumulative grp from each gcm projection averaged over the study area from the beginning to the end of the projection period fig 2 block 3 resulting in the curves shown in fig 3 the descriptive statistics of the 48 cumulative spatially averaged grp were then used to select three gr projections those closest to the median cumulative grp and 1 standard deviation sd from the median represent median wet and dry conditions fig 2 block 4 this process removes 405 raster files of decadal grp over a 90 year projection period resulting in 27 gr projections 12 12 km raster files remaining for use to force the groundwater model fig 2 block 5 as mentioned above the duration of the projection period may play a significant role in selection of gr projections to illustrate the role of the projection period duration we compare 40 year and 90 year projections and show differences that could arise in the final selection of representative median wet and dry gcm projections of gr changes 3 3 calculation of future potential groundwater recharge rates our approach to calculation of future grp rates is to superimpose decadal changes from the three selected gcms vic 12 12 km hydroclimate projections onto the modern conditions of 2000 2009 baseline accounting for variations of projected grp fig 2 block 6 while of secondary concern with respect to the objectives of this article this step was carried out to provide 1 km resolution future gr estimates for direct application to a transient groundwater model and to discuss changes relative to an arguably more accurate baseline than could be provided by the bias corrected spatial disaggregation gcm vic hydroclimate projections it is important to note that all gcm estimates of grp for 2000 2009 at 12 12 km scale have some bias with respect to the baseline estimate therefore for transient groundwater modeling this bias is corrected by adjusting baseline estimates 1 1 km by the decadal changes obtained from gcms fig 2 block 7 baseline grp 2000 2009 estimates were derived from modis land surface temperature satellite measurements and other ancillary climate data szilagyi and jozsa 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 and were slightly adjusted during calibration of a previously developed steady state modflow based groundwater model with 1 km horizontal grid cell resolution rossman 2015 rossman et al in press after calibration of the groundwater model to water levels and regional baseflow to streams the spatially averaged baseline grp from 2000 to 2009 equaled 52 6mm yr 15 greater than the modis derived original grp estimate 46mm yr of szilagyi and jozsa 2013 over the same time period and study area in addition to having fine spatial resolution 1 km baseline grp has complete coverage of the study area and both positive and negative net gr rates regarded as requirements for regional groundwater flow modeling in shallow groundwater systems szilagyi and jozsa 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 median wet and dry projections averaged over the study area net cumulative 2010 2099 potential groundwater recharge grp for the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections had a median of 4 970m 55 2mm yr a mean of 5 080m 56 4mm yr a standard deviation sd of 1 548m 17 2mm yr and a range of 6 884m 76 5mm yr minimum cumulative 2010 2099 grp equaled 2 468m 27 4mm yr and the maximum equaled 9 351m 103 9mm yr curves shown on fig 3 fig 4 depicts maps of the cumulative grp from 2010 2099 for the three selected gr projections the spatial variability is due to the gradients in climate topography land cover use and to a lesser degree soils the magnitude of the spatial variability quantified by sd for each decade remains roughly the same throughout the 21st century with no apparent trend projected by the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections assessed fig 5 the sd of the decadal grp rates varies in time between 19 2mm yr and 27 0mm yr 36 6 and 51 4 of the baseline grp rate respectively following the selection criteria described herein by the end of the century 2090s the selected median gcm vic projection yields a spatially averaged increase in grp of 3mm yr 5 relative to the 2000 2009 baseline estimate of 52 6mm yr the wet projection yields an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection yields an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline these projected changes in grp are consistent with other large scale analyses in the region e g meixner et al 2016 and nearby in colorado tillman et al 2016 and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the groundwater system and its connected surface water features with the tendency of the median projection towards a slight increase in gr for the nsh such quantification has substantially higher resolution than previous studies cf crosbie et al 2013 meixner et al 2016 with direct implications for applications in transient regional groundwater flow modeling the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate model projections each have considerable variability from decade to decade fig 5 the coefficient of variation cv sd divided by the mean of decadal average grp from 2010 to 2099 varies from 0 43 to 0 66 and averages 0 55 for comparison the average cv of the three selected gr projections selected are 0 55 median 0 49 wet 0 43 dry thereby the selected gr projections capture most but not all of the full range of potential future gr variability displayed by all 48 gcm vic hydroclimate projections assessed interestingly the dry projection indicates generally wetter conditions over 2010 2030 and gr for the median projection can exceed or almost equal the wet projection gr e g 2050 2060 and 2080 2090 4 2 temporal and spatial trends the temporal changes in the three grp projections fig 5 have similar magnitudes and range of uncertainty as those published for the northern high plains aquifer region by crosbie et al 2013 and the upper colorado basin by tillman et al 2017 gr is projected to decrease in lower recharge areas in the southern and central high plains aquifer regions while slightly increasing in the northern high plains aquifer region results have a similar spatial trend as those that can be inferred from rosenberg et al 1999 who found smaller decreases of recharge in the entire missouri river basin compared to the arkansas river basin however rosenberg et al 1999 did not single out the nsh region specifically and lumped watershed areas of possible increase in nebraska with areas of gr reduction in kansas thereby projecting slight overall decreases in general future gr reductions decrease northward ultimately becoming an increase in nebraska these results are consistent with cook et al 2015 indicating moderate to severe decreases in gr rates and increases in drought indices based on analysis of the palmer drought index and soil moisture metrics interestingly tillman et al 2017 found a similar trend of gr increase by 2099 at the same latitude in the upper colorado basin decadal averages yielded increases by approximately 5 to 10 based on 97 climate change projections meixner et al 2016 drew similar conclusions for the northern high plains aquifer region changes in future gr rates may be positive or negative depending on changes in the intensity of rainfall allen et al 2010 toews and allen 2009 and on the fraction of precipitation falling as either rain or snow jyrkama and sykes 2007 a possible additional factor for the increases in future gr rates in the nsh region is that the soils are substantially more permeable than in surrounding regions the finding here that a slight increase in gr is the most likely for the nsh indicates that the gcms the statistical downscaling method used usbr 2011 and the land surface hydrology model vic are capable of accurately simulating the processes that determine p and et however there is potential for vic to systematically underestimate current et rates as the version implemented does not explicitly account for the many small lakes in the nsh usbr 2011 and because it does not account for lateral groundwater flow at basin scales thus affecting land surface moisture states taylor et al 2013 4 3 effects of projection period duration the approach used here to find representative median wet and dry gr projections involves elements of subjectivity especially for wet and dry projections even when ranges for the nsh and upper colorado tillman et al 2016 are encouragingly similar in magnitude datasets of cumulative grp whether 48 or 97 gcm scenarios may not have a normal distribution for example crosbie et al 2010 proposed using pearson type iii distribution fitted to a set of grp at the final date of the projection period more importantly it is apparent that the duration of projection period affects cumulative grp statistics and selection of median wet and dry projections to illustrate this point we applied our approach for comparing such grp projections in the study area between period 2010 2049 and period 2010 2099 using histograms of cumulative grp at final years fig 6 see also table s1 of the supplementary material comparison of these histograms shows that sd spread in selection of representative projections is higher for longer forecast periods visual inspection also indicates that the use of lognormal or pearson type iii distributions becomes more plausible clearly representative median wet and dry projections are different for each projection period table 2 and table s1 of the supplementary material there are other ways of summarizing statistics of projections including quartiles and box plot diagrams however the reliance on sd in defining uncertainty bounds for representative projections is simple provides plausible projections and is a visual approach to preparing input data for groundwater models 4 4 time step in projections the ultimate goal of this study is to apply representative projections in transient groundwater flow models here time steps are defined by accuracy requirements of numerical method and data in regional groundwater models smaller time steps daily to monthly are rarely required or applied rossman and zlotnik 2013 as time steps or stress periods are typically on the time scale of years and longer however there is also a hydrological constraint time steps must be at least as long as it takes for infiltrating water from precipitation to traverse the vadose zone potential groundwater recharge grp will become actual groundwater recharge gra after a certain vadose zone lag time the time required for moisture changes to traverse the vadose zone before reaching the water table fig 2 block 7 cf rossman et al 2014 although this constraint does not exist for models where vadose zone soil moisture flow is calculated using physically based numerical modeling codes for example those solving richards equation in three dimensions e g parflow hydrogeosphere see maxwell and kollet 2008 in more traditional groundwater modeling applications e g modflow the vadose zone lag time between grp and gra must be introduced rossman et al 2014 show that in 90 of the nsh this lag time is less than 10years under the baseline 2000 2009 climate with an analytical solution requiring only vadose zone thickness and long term average grp in modeling of the nsh and other cases of thick vadose zones this constraint affected the selection of the decadal grp temporal averaging that was used with such a time step gra effectively equals grp in the nsh fig 2 block 8 in general large vadose zone thickness and low permeability soils rocks in the vadose zone may require assessment of lag time as it may be longer than 10years in other basins or under different climatic conditions e g cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 this would be true of large portions of the central and southern high plains aquifer and other areas generally in semi arid or arid climates 4 5 applying other projection measures more complex time dependent measures of projections such as the aridity index or palmer drought severity index could be used for comparison of various projections dai and zhao 2016 however evaluation of cumulative grp is especially attractive for groundwater modeling since it can be directly applied as input to transient models and the variable is considered in conceptual assessments of regional water budgets of groundwater systems furthermore in areas with lower infiltration capacity and higher overland flows the approach used here is still useful only the land surface hydrology model output of deep drainage should be used in the groundwater model instead of p et in regions where this is the case the vadose zone thickness ought to be considered as well as the time shift between potential gr grp and actual gr gra at the water table e g cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 5 summary and conclusions regional groundwater modeling is a standard tool for estimating the effects of future land use and climate changes on groundwater recharge gr and numerous global circulation model gcm and greenhouse gas ghg emissions scenarios are currently used for obtaining input data studies of future climate change impacts to gr rarely explore assessment and selection approaches e g vano et al 2015 and typically do not even rationalize the choice of gcms selected with proliferation of models and climate change scenarios inferences of the new gr projections forces multiple and frequent recalculation of these effects with groundwater models to constrain the latter step in future developments we identify only a limited number of projections while capturing most of the variability inherent among the ensemble of projections towards this goal we use statistics of the cumulative potential groundwater recharge grp which is defined as the difference between long term precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration et estimates for a future projection period duration of interest e g 40 or 90years this approach starts with developing a set of projections of gr finding cumulative grp for each gcm ghg scenario that can be coupled with a land surface hydrology model over the projection period and calculating statistics of the spatial average grp dataset in the area of interest these statistics permit a large reduction in the projections needed by selecting a small subset of representative gr projections that still represent well the range of projected grp changes groundwater recharge projections were developed based on gcm projected changes in the decadal averages of the difference between p and et from publically available downscaled gcm and land surface hydrology model variable infiltration capacity vic outputs under intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sres scenarios of global ghg emissions this approach is illustrated by the case of the nebraska sand hills nsh where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow changes in decadal averages of grp at 1 8 12 km scale were estimated from 16 commonly used spatially downscaled bias corrected gcm under three ghg emissions scenarios of the 48 gcm vic hydroclimate model projections the grp changes were estimated and applied as adjustments to the baseline 2000 2009 grp at 1 km scale the latter were inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model with et derived from remote sensing modis temperature data of 2000 2009 and calibrated gr allowing a match with regional baseflow to streams after obtaining cumulative over a period of 40 and 90years spatially averaged grp from 48 projections three gr projections median wet and dry were selected for the nebraska sand hills nsh in the nsh the 90 year median projection indicates a spatially averaged grp increase of 3mm yr 5 by the end of the century relative to the 2000 2009 baseline of 52 6mm yr the wet projection indicates an average increase of 22mm yr 42 and the dry projection yields an average decrease of 15mm yr 29 relative to the baseline the projected grp estimates are consistent with other large scale analyses of the region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the nsh hydrologic system our estimate resolves variance in interpretations of gr trends between rosenberg et al 1999 and crosbie et al 2013 high infiltration rates of the sandy soils reduce overland flow in the nsh and groundwater lag time between precipitation events and actual recharge at the water table which is within 3 7years on average in the nsh even with future potential climate changes shorter than the decadal time step utilized in the current study this is an important consideration in groundwater modeling defined by the hydraulic properties and thickness of the vadose zone cf cook et al 2003 rossman et al 2014 use of gr projections to understand impacts on groundwater systems elsewhere need to consider the issue of groundwater system response time green et al 2011 for example response times are becoming considerably shorter during wet conditions with higher gr rates another factor affecting the response time is distance between drainages gr changes may take considerable time centuries to affect the entire groundwater system uncertainty in gr rates is generally considered to be caused by both gcms and ghg emissions scenarios crosbie et al 2011 however analyses of dynamic feedbacks between changing wetland coverage streamflows climate variables and groundwater flow simulations will certainly be required in future modeling studies the decision to exclude these processes was based on adequate local information on the geology climate and vadose zone flows which may not be appropriate in other study areas this methodology allows for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models to gcm projected climate changes and assessing the absolute changes in future grp and changes relative to a baseline from the recent historical period future investigations may require assessment of gr projection temporal variability resulting from individual gcms at smaller time steps this is not a problem as available hydroclimate data are typically resolved at the daily to monthly scale finally it is important to note that wet projections may include decades of drought while still having the largest total gr over the entire projection period therefore use of commonly accepted climate change scenarios requires a clearly defined assessment of the projection period duration wet projections may not be the wettest and dry projections may not be the driest consistently over such projection period acknowledgements this research was supported by grants from the national science foundation igert program dge 0903469

7326,accurately delineating the effects of hydrological and water quality habitat factors on the aquatic biota will significantly assist the management of water resources and restoration of river ecosystems however current models fail to comprehensively consider the effects of multiple habitat factors on the development of fish species in this study a dynamic framework for river ecosystems was set up to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors in terms of hydrology and water quality on the fish community in rivers to achieve this the biomechanical forms of the relationships between hydrology water quality and aquatic organisms were determined the developing processes of the food web without external disturbance were simulated by 208 models constructed using ecopath with ecosim ewe these models were then used to analyze changes in biomass δb of two representative fish species opsariichthys bidens and carassius auratus which are widely distributed in asia and thus have

some habitat restoration programs have taken fish as representative of an ecosystem s health to evaluate the potential of river ecosystem restoration bellmore et al 2012 whitley and bollens 2014 as such there is an urgent need to synthetically consider the effects of multiple factors on aquatic life taking fish as representatives and to construct a new dynamic model of river ecosystems based on

external forces based on the super dimensional data sets composed of hydrological and water quality factors which are the principal driving factors for river fish a principal component analysis pca

city of jinan 36 0 37 5 n 116 2 117 7 e is located in eastern china bordered by mount tai to the south and traversed by the yellow river and has a steeper topography in the south than in the north fig 1 hilly areas piedmont clinoplain and alluvial plains span the city from south to north the altitude within the area ranges from 66 to 957 m above sea level with highly contrasting relief the semi humid continental monsoon climate in the city area is characterized by cold dry winters and hot wet summers the average annual precipitation is 636 mm 75 of which falling during the high flow periods the average annual temperature is 14 3 c the average monthly temperature is highest in july ranging from 26 8 to 27 4 c and is lowest in january ranging from 3 2 to 1 4 c cui et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2015b the city represents a typical developing city in china with an area of 8227 km2 and a population of 5 69 million people zhang et al 2007 with rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in jinan are severely polluted and reduced in quantity as a result drinking water human health and well being are being increasingly threatened as well as the fish community hong et al 2010 zhao et al 2015b policymakers and stakeholders are aware of the need to rehabilitate the river ecosystems in the city and routine monitoring stations distributed evenly on typical rivers were established fig 1 at these monitoring stations parameters relative to biota water quality and hydrological factors were measured concurrently 3 materials and methods 3 1 data we collected samples from 57 water ecological monitoring sites in jinan sampling was performed eight times between may 2014 and july 2016 biological data algae zooplankton zoobenthos fish and habitat hydrological and water quality data were concurrently collected 3 1 1 biological data over the eight sampling events 58 taxa of fish samples were collected belonging to one phylum one class seven orders 19 families and 50 genera fish were collected over 30 min in three habitat types i e pools riffles and runs within a 500 m reach along the river at each sampling site individuals caught from the three habitats were combined to represent a site in addition electrofishing was conducted to ensure that a good representation of fish species was collected at each site all individuals collected were identified to species where possible in situ as described by chen et al 1997 and then counted weighed and recorded in field data sheets all identified fish were then released a few specimens that could not be identified in the field were preserved in 10 formalin solution and stored in labeled jars for subsequent identification zhao et al 2015a among all fish in the eight samplings opsariichthys bidens and carassius auratus are widely distributed in east asia with high economic value and high tolerance to hypoxia o bidens is often used as an experimental target for cytogenetic and artificial propagation fu et al 2012 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in addition c auratus has strong adaptability and plays an important role in freshwater aquaculture and genetics experiments in china dasgupta et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 topal et al 2017 therefore the two fish species have attracted wide attention from scholars and stakeholders these two fish species were present in food webs in all the eight field sampling events while other fish species were absent in one or more of the sampling events resulting in incomplete data series hence we took o bidens and c auratus as examples to set up models of ecosystem dynamics and to explore human influences on them at each sampling site other organisms including algae zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected and appropriately preserved all aquatic organisms were sorted weighed and classified in the laboratory details on the collection methods for each group of organisms are provided in zhao et al 2012 2013 2015a b for the algae 175 taxa were collected belonging to eight phyla ten classes 18 orders 28 families and 30 genera for the zooplankton 90 taxa were collected belonging to three phyla four classes 11 orders 16 families and 38 genera and for the zoobenthos 73 taxa were collected belonging to three phyla six classes 12 orders 26 families and 50 genera 3 1 2 hydrological and water quality data and principal factors driving the fish community hydrological and water quality physical and chemical factors are directly related to the survival of the fish community barbour et al 1999 palmer and febria 2012 table 1 shows the hydrological and water quality factors measured water samples for chemical analyses were collected at the monitoring sites and tested in the laboratory within 24 h a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to test for copper zinc cadmium and lead and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was employed to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations additional details of the analytical methods can be found in zhao et al 2015a we analyzed the influencing effects of hydrological and water quality attributes on fish communities using canonical correspondence analysis cca in another of our papers zhao et al 2018 along with driving factors on zoobenthos communities it was shown that 1 the hydrological factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan were velocity water depth and flow similarly duan et al 2008 showed that velocity water depth and streamflow played important roles in breeding and survival of fish carnivorous fish usually gather in areas with fast velocity marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 2 the water quality physical factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan city were conductivity turbidity water temperature and ph these findings are similar to those reported by yang et al 2007 and liu et al 2016 conductivity had the most effect on fish distribution similarly qian et al 2016 showed that conductivity significantly influenced aquatic biota additionally the distribution of fish communities was affected by turbidity and water temperature whereby turbidity constrained the predators and thus affected the migration of fish pekcanhekim et al 2010 moreover high water temperature had a negative impact on some fish species coulter et al 2014 3 the water quality chemical factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan city were permanganate index chemical oxygen demand calcium sulfate and total hardness chemical oxygen demand was able to characterize the status of the water environment well marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 and there was a significant relationship between c auratus and chemical oxygen demand this species is often found in waters with high chemical oxygen demand values the above studies indicate that the driving factors for fish communities in our study area have been sufficiently demonstrated based on these studies water depth and velocity conductivity turbidity calcium sulfate total hardness chemical oxygen demand and permanganate were selected as the principal driving factors for fish in this study table 2 to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors on fish in rivers among the selected principal driving factors fig 2 velocity had a larger range than water depth fig 2a while the five chemical factors had different concentrations calcium and sulfate showed greater average concentrations than that of total hardness chemical oxygen demand and permanganate the maximum velocity was 0 95 m s and the minimum was 0 09 m s the average water depth was 0 15 m while the average velocity was 0 44 m s the range of conductivity was the largest 386 765 ms m with an average of 548 38 ms m the maximum turbidity was 3 59 and minimum is 1 2 with the average being 2 73 3 2 method in this study food web models corresponding to the eight sampling events at all sites totaling 208 models were constructed and calibrated using the software ecopath with ecosim ewe 1 http ecopath org 1 whereby to simulate the development processes of fish without disturbance these models along with actual sampling results were then used to calculate the difference in biomass δb of fish species between the results of the simulation and the actual sampling the difference shows the change in the ecosystem under disturbance scenarios based on the selected principal factors influencing fish species in the study area the relationship between changes in the biomass of key species and changes in the principal factors δfi was estimated by principal component regression to clarify the quantitative response relationship between key species and principal driving factors the development of the river ecosystem food web without the influence of human activities was initially simulated with ecosim as the principal habitat factors affecting river species the hydrological and water quality status was always affected by external disturbance in reality in order to quantify the impact of external disturbance food web models corresponding to the eight samplings at all sites totaling up to 456 models were constructed and calibrated in ewe software in these models aquatic sampling data from 2014 to 2016 were used ecosim was used to study the development of ecosystems without external disturbance with which the actual sampling results were compared to calculate the influence of external disturbances on biological development fig 3 ecosim is a module of the ewe software which can simulate the dynamic development process at the ecosystem level it is commonly used by the international community to evaluate the impact of fisheries on ecosystems and to explore the consequences of policy options ecosim is considered a new core tool for use in water ecosystems research by many ecologists essington 2007 colvin et al 2015 du et al 2015 the basic mathematical equation is as follows 1 db i dt g i q ji mo i b i f i b i e i b i j 1 n q ji i i where dbi dt represents the growth rate during the time interval dt of group i in terms of its biomass bi gi is the net growth efficiency production consumption ratio m0i the non predation other natural mortality rate fi is fishing mortality rate ei is emigration rate ii is immigration rate and ei bi ii is the net migration rate the two summations estimate consumption rates the first expressing the total consumption by group i and the second is predation by all predators on the same group i the consumption rates qji are calculated based on the foraging arena concept where bi is divided into vulnerable and non vulnerable components and the transfer rate between these two components thus determines whether control is top down bottom up or of an intermediate type eight food web models at each site corresponding to the eight sampling events 05 2014 08 2014 11 2014 05 2015 09 2015 10 2015 05 2016 07 2016 were initially set up afterwards every one of the eight food webs was driven by ecosim to produce a new food web without external disturbance for the rest of the samplings from its setup date to 07 2016 fig 3 the modeled key fish biomass in each new food web was then compared with the measured biomass in the corresponding field samplings whereby to calculate the biomass changes caused by external disturbance for example the food web model of 05 2014 was driven by ecosim to predict the state of the food web on every sampling date from august 2014 to july 2016 with time steps set at 1 month comparing the measured values 08 2014 11 2014 05 2015 09 2015 10 2015 05 2016 07 2016 with the simulated values the differences between the measured and the simulated biomass for those months were obtained we used the following model to determine the disturbance to fish caused by external factors 2 δ b b measured b simulated where b measured stands for the measured biomass b simulated refers to the simulated biomass in this study both units are t km2 after the disturbance to fish caused by external factors was calculated the highly correlated hydrological and water quality factors were integrated and transformed by using pca in general complex correlations exist among the principal habitat factors driving the development of fish communities if the principal factors are used to fit relationships between the fish species and principal driving factors multi collinearity of independent variables may affect the reliability of the regression equation which leads to the coefficient of the principal factors being unable to accurately reflect the actual contribution to biological changes in this study pca was used to reduce the principal factors since the principal components obtained after dimension reduction are independent multi collinearity of variables can be avoided qureshi et al 2015 a set of related variables were subjected to orthogonal transformation to generate a set of linearly independent variables the least information loss is the premise of pca in which the original variables are transformed into fewer principal components and the principal components are not related to each other the use of principal components for data modeling can effectively solve the variable information overlap multi collinearity and other problems associated with the analysis felipe sotelo et al 2008 saba and su 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of river ecosystem food web development without external disturbances from human activities the eight simulations with ecosim are shown in fig 4 in general the ecosystem was relatively stable under natural conditions the fluctuation range was less than 4 within the simulation time of the eight sampling scenarios the biggest fluctuation took place in the 10 2015 scenario fig 4f where the amplitude of change and the simulation time were in the form of a power function conversely the smallest fluctuation was in the 11 2014 scenario fig 4c with fluctuations of only 0 02 generally most simulation scenes were relatively stable without significant changes during the first simulation year there was no obvious synergism between the developmental trends in each plot and the biomass discretization of the functional groups gradually increased throughout development 4 2 integrity and transformation of highly correlated hydrological and water quality factors using the data obtained above the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic response of the principal factors were explored mathematically and the dynamic interactions between fish species and principal driving factors of river ecosystems were determined taking o bidens and c auratus as a case we set up an ecosystem dynamics model for them comparing ecosim simulation results with the measured data the changes in biomass of the two species in table 4 showed that the total measured biomass values of o bidens in october 2014 may 2015 and september 2015 were less than that of the simulated biomass negative values in the table and the measured data in the remaining months were greater than the simulated biomass positive values in the table the actual biomass of c auratus was greater than that of the simulated biomass indicating that the biomass of the c auratus community increased with human activities table 3 fig 5 shows that the difference in biomass δ b of o bidens in the may 2014 scenario was mostly negative that is the measured biomass was relatively low compared to the simulated biomass and the simulated biomass of c auratus was less than the measured biomass in the may 2014 scenario o bidens is a ferocious carnivore and is at the top of the trophic level c auratus is an omnivore which mainly feeds on water plants and algae and is located in the lower trophic level than o bidens the actual biomass of o bidens was less than the simulated biomass however the biomass c auratus was opposite to that of o bidens which reflects the fact that to some extent human activities decreased nutrient levels simplified the structure and reduced the stability and resilience of ecosystems deng et al 2015 the total variance explained by the initial solution table 4 revealed that the cumulative variance of the first two principal components was 87 which is sufficient to describe the dependent variable and the third component eigenvalue was less than 1 in addition the slope of principal components 1 and 2 was greatest as shown in fig 6 therefore this study nominated components 1 and 2 as the principal components the component matrix of the two principal components is shown in table 5 the eigenvalue of component 1 was 5 793 and the eigenvalue of component 2 was 2 047 the coefficient of each principal factor is shown in table 6 since the coefficient represents the contribution of factors to the principal component this shows that conductivity and total hardness are major contributors to the principal component f1 the velocity permanganate index and chemical oxygen demand have major roles in the principal component f2 based on the coefficient of principal components shown in the table 5 two principal components can be formulated as follows 3 f 1 0 35 zx 1 0 06 zx 2 0 41 zx 3 0 38 zx 4 0 38 zx 5 0 39 zx 6 0 4 zx 7 0 26 zx 8 0 21 zx 9 4 f 2 0 21 zx 1 0 63 zx 2 0 05 zx 3 0 11 zx 4 0 18 zx 5 0 19 zx 6 0 04 zx 7 0 43 zx 8 0 54 zx 9 here the nine principal driving factors of fish communities were transformed into two independent principal components by pca with most of information retained 87 12 while the co linearity problem of the driving factors during the construction of the model was eliminated and the accuracy of the model was improved 4 3 establishment and validation of our model as the two principal components f1 and f2 can replace the original nine variables the relationship between δb and the two principle components was formulated to clarify the mechanisms driving water ecosystem development and to speculate the biological status by hydrology and water quality factors as such a unified formula of biomass variation and principal components f1 and f2 of o bidens and c auratus was developed i e the relationship between the change in biomass and the change in principal factors can be expressed in a unified form 5 δ b p 1 p 2 f 1 2 p 3 e f 2 where δ b is the change in fish biomass f 1 f 2 refer to the two principal components p 1 p 2 p 3 are coefficients the calibrated coefficients and statistical parameters for the two fish species are shown in table 6 the root mean squared error rmse of the regression curve was 0 17 for o bidens and 0 14 for c auratus the sum of squared errors sse was 0 86 and 0 59 for the two species respectively while r square was 0 56 and 0 57 respectively the rmse of the c auratus simulation was slightly smaller than that of o bidens which means the biomass simulation for the former species is more accurate than for the latter species comparison of the field measured δb and simulated δb using eq 5 revealed close values fig 7 the trend line for the results predicted for c auratus according to our model x axis and the observed δb y axis was y 0 92 x 1 47 with a r2 of 0 87 and a rmse of 0 11 fig 7a levene s test for equality of variances revealed that simulated δb has the same distribution as that of the observed δb f 0 05 f2 54 3 17 p 0 05 and the two data sets are considered to have homogeneity of variance results of the paired samples t test revealed that the means of the two data sets were equal at significance level of 5 t 0 37 t0 05 2 27 2 05 p 0 05 the trend line of the results predicted for o bidens according to our model x axis and for observed δb y axis was y 1 08 x 0 06 with a r2 of 0 79 and a rmse of 3 14 fig 7b levene s test for equality of variances revealed that the simulated δb has the same distribution as the observed δb f 0 09 f2 54 3 17 p 0 05 which implies that the two data sets have homogeneity of variance results of the paired samples t test revealed that the means of the two data sets were equal at significance level of 5 t 0 52 t0 05 2 27 2 05 p 0 05 the fitted results matched the measured δb well which suggests that eq 5 can be used to accurately calculate δb of fish species with the principal components f1 and f2 many scholars contributed significantly to aquatic biogeochemical modeling yet improvements are still needed chen et al 2002 developed a coupled physical and biological model for lake michigan with good performance yet the model is not easy to be put into practice due to difficulties in data acquisition arhonditsis and brett 2004 arhonditsis et al 2006 evaluated the development of mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling and believed the mechanistic model still needs to be insightful explored vera mendoza and salas de león 2014 middelburg and levin 2009 and sell 2004 also made significant contributions to biochemical and physical mechanism models yet there is still much work to be done to accurately model the complex mechanisms in river ecosystems for the purpose of practical use based on theories that are easy to understand instead of complex mechanism theories our methodology has modest requirements for assembling information and scientific expertise which makes it easy to be put into practice it is expected to be applied to help determine the effect of hydrological and water quality change on river ecosystems and therefore to provide a scientific basis for decision making by river administrators and stakeholders 5 conclusion in this study ecosim was used to simulate the development of ecosystems without hydrological and water quality habitat disturbances from human activities with results of which we explored the effects of habitat hydrological water quality physical and chemical factors on fish using pca and other statistical methods results show that the relationship between the change in biomass δb and the principal components f1 and f2 composed by the change in key habitat factors can be formulated as δ b p 1 p 2 f 1 2 p 3 e f 2 where the coefficients p1 p2 p3 vary with fish species the simulated δb matched the observed δb well for both species o bidens and c auratus levene s test for equality of variances revealed that the simulated δb had the same distribution as that of the observed δb further t test revealed that there were no statistical significant differences between the simulated and observed δb it is possible to employ this model to accurately calculate the biomass change of fish species using the key habitat factors derived principal components in this paper only the representative fish species o bidens and c auratus were studied based on the data of which the model between biomass and habitat changes was developed and it performed satisfactorily however the study on only two fish species inevitably brings about some uncertainties in the results therefore long term monitoring for fish and habitat factors to provide sufficiently long data series is necessary in the future research in addition to biomass others variables indicating the status of the fish community e g biodiversity integrated biological index and density also require in depth research these should enhance the extent of application of our model in future acknowledgments we acknowledge the reviewers

set up to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors in terms of hydrology and water quality on the fish community in rivers to achieve this the biomechanical forms of the relationships between hydrology water quality and aquatic organisms were determined the developing processes of the food web without external disturbance were simulated by 208 models constructed using ecopath with ecosim

the eight samplings opsariichthys bidens and carassius auratus are widely distributed in east asia with high economic value and high tolerance to hypoxia o bidens is often used as an experimental target for cytogenetic and artificial propagation fu et al 2012 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in addition c auratus has strong adaptability and plays an important role in freshwater aquaculture and genetics experiments in china dasgupta et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 topal et al 2017 therefore the two fish species have attracted wide attention from scholars and stakeholders these two fish species were present in food webs in all the eight field sampling events while other fish species were absent in one or more of the sampling events resulting in incomplete data series hence we took o bidens and c auratus as examples to set up models of ecosystem dynamics and to explore human influences on them at each sampling site other organisms including algae zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected and appropriately preserved all aquatic organisms were sorted weighed and classified in the laboratory details on the collection methods for each group of organisms are provided in zhao et al 2012 2013 2015a b for the algae 175 taxa were collected belonging to eight phyla ten classes 18 orders 28 families and 30 genera for the zooplankton 90 taxa were collected belonging to three phyla four classes 11 orders 16 families and 38 genera and for the zoobenthos 73 taxa were collected belonging to three phyla six classes 12 orders 26 families and 50 genera 3 1 2 hydrological and water quality data and principal factors driving the fish community hydrological and water quality physical and chemical factors are directly related to the survival of the fish community barbour et al 1999 palmer and febria 2012 table 1 shows the hydrological and water quality factors measured water samples for chemical analyses were collected at the monitoring sites and tested in the laboratory within 24 h a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to test for copper zinc cadmium and lead and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was employed to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations additional details of the analytical methods can be found in zhao et al 2015a we analyzed the influencing effects of hydrological and water quality attributes on fish communities using canonical correspondence analysis cca in another of our papers zhao et al 2018 along with driving factors on zoobenthos communities it was shown that 1 the hydrological factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan were velocity water depth and flow similarly duan et al 2008 showed that velocity water depth and streamflow played important roles in breeding and survival of fish carnivorous fish usually gather in areas with fast velocity marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 2 the water quality physical factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan city were conductivity turbidity water temperature and ph these findings are similar to those reported by yang et al 2007 and liu et al 2016 conductivity had the most effect on fish distribution similarly qian et al 2016 showed that conductivity significantly influenced aquatic biota additionally the distribution of fish communities was affected by turbidity and water temperature whereby turbidity constrained the predators and thus affected the migration of fish pekcanhekim et al 2010 moreover high water temperature had a negative impact on some fish species coulter et al 2014 3 the water quality chemical factors contributing to significant differences in fish distribution in jinan city were permanganate index chemical oxygen demand calcium sulfate and total hardness chemical oxygen demand was able to characterize the status of the water environment well marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 and there was a significant relationship between c auratus and chemical oxygen demand this species is often found in waters with high chemical oxygen demand values the above studies indicate that the driving factors for fish communities in our study area have been sufficiently demonstrated based on these studies water depth and velocity conductivity turbidity calcium sulfate total hardness chemical oxygen demand and permanganate were selected as the principal driving factors for fish in this study table 2 to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors on fish in rivers among the selected principal driving factors fig 2 velocity had a larger range than water depth fig 2a while the five chemical factors had different concentrations calcium and sulfate showed greater average concentrations than that of total hardness chemical oxygen demand and permanganate the maximum velocity was 0 95 m s and the minimum was 0 09 m s the average water depth was 0 15 m while the average velocity was 0 44 m s the range of conductivity was the largest 386 765 ms m with an average of 548 38 ms m the maximum turbidity was 3 59 and minimum is 1 2 with the average being 2 73 3 2 method in this study food web models corresponding to the eight sampling events at all sites totaling 208 models were constructed and calibrated using the software ecopath with ecosim ewe 1 http ecopath org 1 whereby to simulate the development processes of fish without disturbance these models along with actual sampling results were then used to calculate the difference in biomass δb of fish species between the results of the simulation and the actual sampling the difference shows the change in the ecosystem under disturbance scenarios based on the selected principal factors influencing fish species in the study area the relationship between changes in the biomass of key species and changes in the principal factors δfi was estimated by principal component regression to clarify the quantitative response relationship between key species and principal driving factors the development of the river ecosystem food web without the influence of human activities was initially simulated with ecosim as the principal habitat factors affecting river species the hydrological and water quality status was always affected by external disturbance in reality in order to quantify the impact of external disturbance food web models corresponding to the eight samplings at all sites totaling up to 456 models were constructed and calibrated in ewe software in these models aquatic sampling data from 2014 to 2016 were used ecosim was used to study the development of ecosystems without external disturbance with which the actual sampling results were compared to calculate the influence of external disturbances on biological development fig 3 ecosim is a module of the ewe software which can simulate the dynamic development process at the ecosystem level it is commonly used by the international community to evaluate the impact of fisheries on ecosystems and to explore the consequences of policy options ecosim is considered a new core tool for use in water ecosystems research by many ecologists essington 2007 colvin et al 2015 du et al 2015 the basic mathematical equation is as follows 1 db i dt g i q ji mo i b i f i b i e i b i j 1 n q ji i i where dbi dt represents the growth rate during the time interval dt of group i in terms of its biomass bi gi is the net growth efficiency production consumption ratio m0i the non predation other natural mortality rate fi is fishing mortality rate ei is emigration rate ii is immigration rate and ei bi ii is the net migration rate the two summations estimate consumption rates the first expressing the total consumption by group i and the second is predation by all predators on the same group i the consumption rates qji are calculated based on the foraging arena concept where bi is divided into vulnerable and non vulnerable components and the transfer rate between these two components thus determines whether control is top down bottom up or of an intermediate type eight food web models at each site corresponding to the eight sampling events 05 2014 08 2014 11 2014 05 2015 09 2015 10 2015 05 2016 07 2016 were initially set up afterwards every one of the eight food webs was driven by ecosim to produce a new food web without external disturbance for the rest of the samplings from its setup date to 07 2016 fig 3 the modeled key fish biomass in each new food web was then compared with the measured biomass in the corresponding field samplings whereby to calculate the biomass changes caused by external disturbance for example the food web model of 05 2014 was driven by ecosim to predict the state of the food web on every sampling date from august 2014 to july 2016 with time steps set at 1 month comparing the measured values 08 2014 11 2014 05 2015 09 2015 10 2015 05 2016 07 2016 with the simulated values the differences between the measured and the simulated biomass for those months were obtained we used the following model to determine the disturbance to fish caused by external factors 2 δ b b measured b simulated where b measured stands for the measured biomass b simulated refers to the simulated biomass in this study both units are t km2 after the disturbance to fish caused by external factors was calculated the highly correlated hydrological and water quality factors were integrated and transformed by using pca in general complex correlations exist among the principal habitat factors driving the development of fish communities if the principal factors are used to fit relationships between the fish species and principal driving factors multi collinearity of independent variables may affect the reliability of the regression equation which leads to the coefficient of the principal factors being unable to accurately reflect the actual contribution to biological changes in this study pca was used to reduce the principal factors since the principal components obtained after dimension reduction are independent multi collinearity of variables can be avoided qureshi et al 2015 a set of related variables were subjected to orthogonal transformation to generate a set of linearly independent variables the least information loss is the premise of pca in which the original variables are transformed into fewer principal components and the principal components are not related to each other the use of principal components for data modeling can effectively solve the variable information overlap multi collinearity and other problems associated with the analysis felipe sotelo et al 2008 saba and su 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of river ecosystem food web development without external disturbances from human activities the eight simulations with ecosim are shown in fig 4 in general the ecosystem was relatively stable under natural conditions the fluctuation range was less than 4 within the simulation time of the eight sampling scenarios the biggest fluctuation took place in the 10 2015 scenario fig 4f where the amplitude of change and the simulation time were in the form of a power function conversely the smallest fluctuation was in the 11 2014 scenario fig 4c with fluctuations of only 0 02 generally most simulation scenes were relatively stable without significant changes during the first simulation year there was no obvious synergism between the developmental trends in each plot and the biomass discretization of the functional groups gradually increased throughout development 4 2 integrity and transformation of highly correlated hydrological and water quality factors using the data obtained above the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic response of the principal factors were explored mathematically and the dynamic interactions between fish species and principal driving factors of river ecosystems were determined taking o bidens and c auratus as a case we set up an ecosystem dynamics model for them comparing ecosim simulation results with the measured data the changes in biomass of the two species in table 4 showed that the total measured biomass values of o bidens in october 2014 may 2015 and september 2015 were less than that of the simulated biomass negative values in the table and the measured data in the remaining months were greater than the simulated biomass positive values in the table the actual biomass of c auratus was greater than that of the simulated biomass indicating that the biomass of the c auratus community increased with human activities table 3 fig 5 shows that the difference in biomass δ b of o bidens in the may 2014 scenario was mostly negative that is the measured biomass was relatively low compared to the simulated biomass and the simulated biomass of c auratus was less than the measured biomass in the may 2014 scenario o bidens is a ferocious carnivore and is at the top of the trophic level c auratus is an omnivore which mainly feeds on water plants and algae and is located in the lower trophic level than o bidens the actual biomass of o bidens was less than the simulated biomass however the biomass c auratus was opposite to that of o bidens which reflects the fact that to some extent human activities decreased nutrient levels simplified the structure and reduced the stability and resilience of ecosystems deng et al 2015 the total variance explained by the initial solution table 4 revealed that the cumulative variance of the first two principal components was 87 which is sufficient to describe the dependent variable and the third component eigenvalue was less than 1 in addition the slope of principal components 1 and 2 was greatest as shown in fig 6 therefore this study nominated components 1 and 2 as the principal components the component matrix of the two principal components is shown in table 5 the eigenvalue of component 1 was 5 793 and the eigenvalue of component 2 was 2 047 the coefficient of each principal factor is shown in table 6 since the coefficient represents the contribution of factors to the principal component this shows that conductivity and total hardness are major contributors to the principal component f1 the velocity permanganate index and chemical oxygen demand have major roles in the principal component f2 based on the coefficient of principal components shown in the table 5 two principal components can be formulated as follows 3 f 1 0 35 zx 1 0 06 zx 2 0 41 zx 3 0 38 zx 4 0 38 zx 5 0 39 zx 6 0 4 zx 7 0 26 zx 8 0 21 zx 9 4 f 2 0 21 zx 1 0 63 zx 2 0 05 zx 3 0 11 zx 4 0 18 zx 5 0 19 zx 6 0 04 zx 7 0 43 zx 8 0 54 zx 9 here the nine principal driving factors of fish communities were transformed into two independent principal components by pca with most of information retained 87 12 while the co linearity problem of the driving factors during the construction of the model was eliminated and the accuracy of the model was improved 4 3 establishment and validation of our model as the two principal components f1 and f2 can replace the original nine variables the relationship between δb and the two principle components was formulated to clarify the mechanisms driving water ecosystem development and to speculate the biological status by hydrology and water quality factors as such a unified formula of biomass variation and principal components f1 and f2 of o bidens and c auratus was developed i e the relationship between the change in biomass and the change in principal factors can be expressed in a unified form 5 δ b p 1 p 2 f 1 2 p 3 e f 2 where δ b is the change in fish biomass f 1 f 2 refer to the two principal components p 1 p 2 p 3 are coefficients the calibrated coefficients and statistical parameters for the two fish species are shown in table 6 the root mean squared error rmse of the regression curve was 0 17 for o bidens and 0 14 for c auratus the sum of squared errors sse was 0 86 and 0 59 for the two species respectively while r square was 0 56 and 0 57 respectively the rmse of the c auratus simulation was slightly smaller than that of o bidens which means the biomass simulation for the former species is more accurate than for the latter species comparison of the field measured δb and simulated δb using eq 5 revealed close values fig 7 the trend line for the results predicted for c auratus according to our model x axis and the observed δb y axis was y 0 92 x 1 47 with a r2 of 0 87 and a rmse of 0 11 fig 7a levene s test for equality of variances revealed that simulated δb has the same distribution as that of the observed δb f 0 05 f2 54 3 17 p 0 05 and the two data sets are considered to have homogeneity of variance results of the paired samples t test revealed that the means of the two data sets were equal at significance level of 5 t 0 37 t0 05 2 27 2 05 p 0 05 the trend line of the results predicted for o bidens according to our model x axis and for observed δb y axis was y 1 08 x 0 06 with a r2 of 0 79 and a rmse of 3 14 fig 7b levene s test for equality of variances revealed that the simulated δb has the same distribution as the observed δb f 0 09 f2 54 3 17 p 0 05 which implies that the two data sets have homogeneity of variance results of the paired samples t test revealed that the means of the two data sets were equal at significance level of 5 t 0 52 t0 05 2 27 2 05 p 0 05 the fitted results matched the measured δb well which suggests that eq 5 can be used to accurately calculate δb of fish species with the principal components f1 and f2 many scholars contributed significantly to aquatic biogeochemical modeling yet improvements are still needed chen et al 2002 developed a coupled physical and biological model for lake michigan with good performance yet the model is not easy to be put into practice due to difficulties in data acquisition arhonditsis and brett 2004 arhonditsis et al 2006 evaluated the development of mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling and believed the mechanistic model still needs to be insightful explored vera mendoza and salas de león 2014 middelburg and levin 2009 and sell 2004 also made significant contributions to biochemical and physical mechanism models yet there is still much work to be done to accurately model the complex mechanisms in river ecosystems for the purpose of practical use based on theories that are easy to understand instead of complex mechanism theories our methodology has modest requirements for assembling information and scientific expertise which makes it easy to be put into practice it is expected to be applied to help determine the effect of hydrological and water quality change on river ecosystems and therefore to provide a scientific basis for decision making by river administrators and stakeholders 5 conclusion in this study ecosim was used to simulate the development of ecosystems without hydrological and water quality habitat disturbances from human activities with results of which we explored the effects of habitat hydrological water quality physical and chemical factors on fish using pca and other statistical methods results show that the relationship between the change in biomass δb and the principal components f1 and f2 composed by the change in key habitat factors can be formulated as δ b p 1 p 2 f 1 2 p 3 e f 2 where the coefficients p1 p2 p3 vary with fish species the simulated δb matched the observed δb well for both species o bidens and c auratus levene s test for equality of variances revealed that the simulated δb had the same distribution as that of the observed δb further t test revealed that there were no statistical significant differences between the simulated and observed δb it is possible to employ this model to accurately calculate the biomass change of fish species using the key habitat factors derived principal components in this paper only the representative fish species o bidens and c auratus were studied based on the data of which the model between biomass and habitat changes was developed and it performed satisfactorily however the study on only two fish species inevitably brings about some uncertainties in the results therefore long term monitoring for fish and habitat factors to provide sufficiently long data series is necessary in the future research in addition to biomass others variables indicating the status of the fish community e g biodiversity integrated biological index and density also require in depth research these should enhance the extent of application of our model in future acknowledgments we acknowledge the reviewers

7327,in a semi arid to arid climate context dependency on groundwater resources may lead to overexploitation and deterioration of water quality the continental intercalaire ci aquifer is one such continental scale aquifer more than a million of km2 which is mainly confined poorly recharged but intensely abstracted to date the management of this resource relies on hydrogeological modelling and key parameters such as recharge discharge rate and groundwater dynamics we use a combination of residence time indicators 14c 36cl 4he and stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o to give greater constraint on the groundwater residence time in the ci in previous studies 14c measurements and steady state modelling indicate a residence time of less than 100 ka whereas in others 36cl measurements and transient scenarios modelling suggest a longer residence time 500 ka in this study most of the 14c measurements are below the limit of detection establishing residence times greater than 40 ka and confirming the necessity of strict sampling protocols to exclude all air and ams measurements when low 14c concentrations are expected in the tunisian recharge area detectable 14c indicate sporadic recharge episodes 3 7 ka and 29 43 ka whereas 4he and 36cl concentrations in central areas suggest very old 2 ma groundwaters in these central areas chlorine concentration can reach more than 2 g l since 36cl concentrations are up to 4 time less than the initial input we are confident there is no excessive deep 36cl production we characterise five distinct flowpaths reaching the tunisian discharge area using their isotopic signatures according to our mixing model the average contribution from the main recharge area the algerian atlas mountains is around 88 this value is close to hydrogeological models conversely the contribution from the dahar mountains is lower than in the hydrogeological modelling 2 against 10 whereas the tinhert shows a greater contribution 10 against 1 increase of abstraction from the ci can potentially activate the circulation of old brackish groundwaters and dramatically decrease the water quality in the whole system keywords recharge groundwater budget radioactive isotopes stables isotopes continental scale aquifer tunisia and algeria 1 introduction as a result of a general increase in stress on the global water resources due to climate change and enhanced pressure from anthropogenic activities improving the understanding of continental scale aquifers has recently gained a renewed interest de vries and simmers 2002 wada et al 2010 2012 konikow 2011 gleeson et al 2012 hydrogeological characteristics of these huge mostly fossil water reservoirs have been well documented eress 1972 edmunds and tyler 2002 scanlon et al 2006 margat 2008 however any further assessment of their sustainability in response to future changing conditions requires significant steps forward in our ability to integrate all available information from hydrodynamics as well as physical and chemical properties so as to fully exploit these data in numerical models in response to this need we have undertaken an extensive study of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas one of the largest aquifer systems in the world this transboundary multi layered aquifer which extends over 106 km2 in algeria tunisia and libya is composed of two main water bearing units the complexe terminal ct and the continental intercalaire ci previous studies have been tackling the residence time issues related to the ci which is deeper and more extended

is produced at a predictable rate by the uranium and thorium decay however radiogenic 4he accumulation not only depends on uranium and thorium contents in the aquifer host matrix but also on advection and diffusion fluxes to and from other geological formations in other continental scale aquifers such as the great artesian basin gab and the amadeus basin in australia the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas or the paris basin in france multi isotopic tracers studies have been applied over the past 20 years lehmann et al 2003 used 81kr to calibrate 36cl parameters initial value radioactive

aquifers more recently a multi isotopic study of oman based on 14c 36cl and 4he müller et al 2016 showed the complementarity of these tracers to calculate residence time in a straightforward area also cartwright et al 2017b used 14c and 36cl cl to constrain solutes cycle in an old groundwater system murray basin australia in this paper we propose to use residence indicators 14c and 36cl and accumulations of radiogenic 4he as well as stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o to characterise a complex study site to attempt to quantify the recharge in a secondary recharge area and to determine origins and proportions of groundwaters reaching the main discharge area 2 hydrogeological context the two main aquifers of the nwsas the ct and the ci are located in cretaceous to neogene formations isolated from each other by the cenomanian aquitard an evaporitic and argillaceous layer unconfined on a large proportion of its surface the ct is imbedded in heterogeneous turonian to pliocene continental formations of sand clay and carbonates by contrast the ci aquifer on which this paper focuses is mostly confined deeper down to 2500 m beneath the chotts region in tunisia and larger 1 5 times the ct area it is composed of late jurassic to early cretaceaous detrital sediments alternating marine and continental origins from clear to clayey sand cornet 1964 busson 1967 conrad 1969 castany 1982 ouaja et al 2004 with only two main water bearing formations barremian and albian the ci have been shown to be both more homogeneous and continuous than the ct edmunds et al 2003 petersen et al 2014 the joint storage of ct and ci has been estimated around 31 000 109 m3 baba sy 2005 of which 20 000 109 m3 for the ci aquifer considering a mean thickness of 350 m 1000 m at maximum an extent of around 1 1 106 km2 and an effective porosity of 5 baba sy 2005 this rough estimation suggests it is a significant water supply for the algerian tunisian and libyan saharan oases and in the whole semi arid northern fringe of the saharan desert however since the beginning of intense abstraction for domestic and agricultural uses in the 1970 s a general decrease of the piezometric level in both ci and ct aquifers was observed while water withdrawal reached 75 m3 s in 2000 to assess the sustainability of this water resource several large scale hydrological investigations were conducted eress 1972 oss 2003 baba sy 2005 modern pre anthropic recharge rates were estimated between 29 2 and 35 5 m3 s according to hydrological models of the ci and ct eress 1972 oss 2003 baba sy 2005 recently gonçalvès et al 2013 estimated a modern recharge rate of 44 28 m3 s over the nwsas based on a regional water budget calculation from the grace record of terrestrial water storage over the time period from 2003 to 2010 therefore these results indicate consistently that the nwsas is still an active system with a small but significant present day recharge the ci has been conceptualised as three sub systems based on piezometric maps established in the 1970 s before the intensification of abstraction eress 1972 the great occidental erg the great oriental erg and the hamada al hamra see fig 1 the atlas mountains is the recharge area of the great occidental erg while the foggaras constitutes the discharge area in a nw to sw direction the nafusa mountains tinhert plateau and the hassawna mountains supply the hamada al hamra area which discharges in the gulf of syrte and imply three main flowpaths west to east south west to north east and south to north respectively in between the atlas mountains the dahar mountains and the tinhert plateau are the recharge areas of the great oriental erg where the main discharge area is the gulf of gabes a low hydraulic gradient area is located in the central south of the ci indicating almost stagnant groundwaters see fig 1 there the proportion of the contribution from the atlas and the tinhert is poorly understood depending on the recharge variability and historic climatic conditions however assuming an equivalent decrease of recharge over the entire system low hydraulic gradients and flow directions are globally maintained according to climatic simulations over 10 ka baba sy 2005 and over 775 ka petersen 2014 edmunds et al 2003 described the hydrochemistry of the flowline from the north atlas mountains fig 1 the tunisian southern part ends downstream of the main flowlines where collected waters are characterised by different recharge areas residence times and water rock interactions as described in several studies abid et al 2009 2010 2011 2012a b they highlight that the tunisian ci groundwaters are of sodium chloride to sulphate calcium type with halite dissolution and evaporation as the main source of salinity note that major ion concentrations we measured are similar to the results of previous studies and are not described further here the residence time in an aquifer can be expressed as the storage by the recharge or discharge rate in a steady state system for the ci only with a modern pre anthropogenic recharge between 5 6 and 15 2 m3 s baba sy 2005 petersen 2014 and a 20 000 109 m3 storage the residence time is between 40 ka and 115 ka however others have shown that transient model are needed to describe the ci and recharge rates varied drastically in the past edmunds et al 2004 tjallingii et al 2008 coulthard et al 2013 petersen et al 2014 so far only a few attempts have been made to date ci groundwaters directly by radiometric methods in particular guendouz and michelot 2006 reported 36cl measurements along a w e transect across algeria figs 1 and 2 the data showed that the 36cl activity and 36cl cl ratio decrease uniformly by a factor of 3 to 4 along 600 km in west to east flow direction table 1 this range is compatible with radioactive decay of 36cl on the expected time scales however the inferred water ages remained highly uncertain ranging between 400 and 1300 ka for the easternmost samples depending on the initial set of parameters used in the chronological equations as in all system the choice of a value for the initial input and the chloride dissolution contribution particularly affect age calculations while deep production is generally assumed to be known fabryka martin 1988 along with 238u series radionuclides data and activities ratio elliot et al 2014 provide some 4he concentrations occurring in the ci see fig 1 and 2 they range from 8 8 10 8 to 3 3 10 5 ccstp g table 1 based on 234u 238u activities they suggest residence time up to 600 ka as mentioned previously by contrast with those old ages several publications reported 14c activities significantly above background guendouz 1985 edmunds et al 2003 abid et al 2011 14c activities up to 60 pmc have been measured in the first 200 km from the algerian atlas mountains towards the gulf of gabes edmunds et al 2003 these concentrations have been interpreted as a contribution of holocene or late pleistocene recharge for the 400 km remaining to the discharge area of the gulf of gabes 14c activities vary from 0 to 2 pmc guendouz 1985 and abid et al 2011 report activities from 1 to more than 10 pmc with an analytical error of at least 1 pmc in distinct areas of the tunisian ci these values suggest that water recently in equilibrium with the atmosphere infiltrated the aquifer within timescales commensurate with the 14c decay period the sampling of large amount of water for the liquid scintillation spectrometry method may also have led to atmospheric contamination aggarwal et al 2014 all but one of their samples between 1 and 4 pmc occur close to the outcrop less than 200 km love et al 2000 in the gab disregard measurement below 4 pmc mahara et al 2009 presented more than sixty 14c measurements in the gab again all above 1 pmc whatever the distance to the outcrop up to 1090 km in order to address this issue to get a realistic interpretation and to understand if the system shows discordant ages we have taken a new set of small volumes 14c samples collected with techniques designed to eliminate atmospheric contamination 3 sampling and methods to characterise the dynamics of the tunisian groundwaters twenty nine boreholes were sampled in november 2010 fig 2 covering the extent of the ci in tunisia the samples are assigned in four geographical groups according to the hydrogeological units previously presented in the fig 1 the depth vary from 150 m to 2600 m with most of the screen intervals of 10 50 m up to 300 m in some case however only slightly more than half of the boreholes had precise depth information tozeur ridge group the nine samples of this group named after the main geomorphological structure of the area are regularly spaced in the tunisian part of the well documented atlas to gabes flowpath edmunds et al 2003 guendouz and michelot 2006 dahar group this group consist in five samples taken in the northern part of the ci dahar mountains outcrop or close to it south group this group includes eight samples from southernmost part of the studied area theses samples may have several origins as suggested by the piezometric map the tinhert the south western part of the atlas and or the dahar the low hydraulic gradient in this area less than 50 m in 400 km does not indicate which origin is more probable three samples close to the dahar outcroup belong to this group and not the dahar group they are located in the southern part of the dahar where an oss technical report oss 2003 suggest that a discharge may occur from the ci to the djeffara aquifer kebili gabes group the seven samples of this group named after the main localities of the area are located in the main discharge area of the ci close to the gabes gulf in this area the ci aquifer upwells along the el hamma fault and outlets into the djeffara coastal aquifer techniques samples have been taken from the wellhead or a tap directly connected few meters to the head only one 13 come from a tap connected by more than few meters of pipe because of a pump failure no samples for helium nor 14c analysis were collected on site 6 and no sample 14c analysis were collected on site 10 however in both case non hermetic tanks used for water storage were sampled for 14c to characterise exchange with the atmosphere in table 1 to measure the stable isotopes water samples were collected in brown glass bottles δ 2 h and δ 18 o were determined at the lrae laboratory sfax tunisia by laser spectrometry measurement and expressed as variations relative to the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water precision is 1 for δ 2 h and 0 1 for δ 18 o samples for carbon isotopes analysis on dic dissolved inorganic c were collected in 500 ml stainless steel bottles to avoid any atmospheric contamination the preparation prior to analysis was carried out at ides laboratory in orsay france δ 13 c was measured by irms isotopic ratio mass spectromectry precision of 0 15 the results are reported in variations from the vienna peedee belemnite standard vpdb the 14c measurements were performed on the artemis national ams facility ums lmc14 saclay france according to published procedures delqué količ et al 2013 the results expressed in percent modern carbon pmc have been corrected from the blank 0 2 to 0 4 pmc depending on the batch the 1 σ uncertainty is 1 14c contents of two tank samples 6 and 10 are well over the detection limit see table 1 whereas nearby samples collected directly from the wellheads are below or close to the detection limit this indicates rapid exchange with the co2 atmospheric pool and provides further evidence for likely rapid contamination of samples collected and pre treated in the field under the classical analytical procedure aggarwal et al 2014 immediately after collecting samples for chlorine isotopes in hdpe bottles the water was acidified with ultra pure hno3 samples were clear in color and thus unfiltered chloride concentration was measured by ion chromatography at the lrae 36cl samples were prepared at the cerege laboratory aix en provence france cl separation and purification steps followed a procedure modified from bentley et al 1986 the target weight of chloride was 2 mg according to the requirement of the ams used cl was first precipitated as agcl and the supernatant was discarded then the precipitate was dissolved in nh4oh and sulphur was removed by precipitation of baso4 in order to minimize 36s which is the most abundant 36cl isobar these two steps were repeated three times the last agcl precipitate was rinsed three times in distilled water and then dried the final stage was target preparation for the ams by compaction of the precipitate directly into the sample holder 36cl analyses were performed on the french ams national facility aster a 5 mv tandem accelerator installed at the cerege arnold et al 2010 arnold et al 2013 bouchez et al 2015 all 36cl concentrations were normalised to the knstd1600 calibration material 36cl cl of 1 6 10 12 provided by k nishiizumi for each set of 10 samples one blank sample was prepared following the procedure described above 36cl cl ratios of blanks varied between 0 1 0 04 10 15 and 0 9 0 3 10 15 and were always more than one order of magnitude lower than the smallest 36cl cl ratio measured sample 6 was chosen for its intermediate chlorine concentration to assess the overall reproducibility including both chemical separation and spectrometric measurements over the course of this study the reproducibly is assessed to be 8 2 rsd n 6 samples for he analyses were collected in copper tubes tightly closed at both ends by metal clamps for each sampling point two replicates of 10 ml of water were sampled in the laboratory dissolved helium and neon were extracted under vacuum into a glass bulb following a routine procedure jean baptiste et al 1992 jean baptiste et al 2010 jean baptiste et al 2017 the glass bulbs were then connected to the high vacuum stainless steel inlet line of a map 215 50 noble gas mass spectrometer for 3he 4he and 20ne determination the measurements were calibrated against air as a standard analytical precisions for helium and neon concentrations and for the 3he 4he ratio are given in table 2 20ne is considered of purely atmospheric origin and is used to correct 4he concentrations for the atmospheric contribution 20ne degasing may also indicate atmospheric contamination during sampling 4 results table 1 gives sample numbers group temperature δ

18 o as shown in fig 3 δ 2 h ranges from 70 to 40 and δ 18 o from 9 to 6 the samples are scattered below the local meteoric water line and even below the global meteoric water line showing very low deuterium excess they are depleted compared to the modern rainwater of sfax the reference station in the area where the mean values of δ 2 h and δ 18 o are 23 3 and 4 6 respectively maliki et al 2000 celle jeanton et al 2001 abid et al 2011 the most enriched sample δ 2h 41 close to the sfax meteoric water line smwl is the shallowest sample 1 the dahar and the tozeur ridge groups are more enriched lightest δ 18o up to 7 and 6 5 respectively and δ 2 h up to 46 and 51 respectively than the south and kebili gabes group heaviest δ 18 o up to 9 and 8 respectively and δ 2 h up to 69 and 62 respectively stable isotopes are therefore consistent in each group the kebili gabes group appears as a mixing between the tozeur ridge group and a more depleted end member like the south group the data generally does not seem to follow an evaporation line a part from the tozeur group δ 13 c and 14 c δ 13 c varies from 12 to 7 except sample 23 17 this range of 12 to 7 is typical of some dissolution of marine carbonate δ 13 c 0 in recharging meteoric water δ 13 c 22 to 27 the unusually light value may indicate interaction with old organic matter love et al 1994 jiráková et al 2009 jiráková et al 2010 out of the 27 samples collected at a wellhead five 1 3 5 and 22 have 14c activity significantly above the detection limit determined by procedural blank of the artemis ams 0 2 to 0 4 pmc the superficial sample of the dahar group 1 not surprisingly presents the highest value 42 2 0 2 pmc according to edmunds et al 2003 and guendouz 2003 activities between 20 and 60 pmc are measured close to the ci and ct outcrops and correspond to holocene recharged water using the highest possible initial activity 100 pmc without any correction the maximum age would be around 7 ka the two samples closest to the northern outcrop in dahar show low but significant 14c activities 1 0 0 1 and 1 1 0 1 pmc with the sample 1 as an initial activity we calculated age corresponding to a travel time between the non confined and the confined area using netpath plummer et al 1994 the computed ages 29 to 43 ka depend on the model and the associated parameters carbonate dissolution soil gas co2 dissolution co2 gas aqueous exchange calcite hco3 exchange gypsum dissolution or ca na cation exchange only the fontes and garnier model fontes and garnier 1979 takes into account two major process occurring in the ci gypsum dissolution and ca na cation exchange abid et al 2010 2011 the corresponding ages are 33 and 31 ka respectively obviously all these ages are apparent ages assuming a piston flow model without any mixing alternatively small supplies of more recently recharged water could also explain the low measured 14c activities of these samples 14c activity of the sample 22 reaches 1 03 0 12 located in the tozeur ridge group it is deep and confined directly on the flowpath from the atlas mountains reasons to discard this sample are discussed later based on data from the other tracers 36 cl and 36 cl cl in the sampled part of the ci aquifer chloride concentration varies from 200 to 3500 mg l and 36cl concentration from 0 44 0 05 10 8 to 7 6 0 5 10 8 at l leading to 36cl cl atomic ratio between 5 2 0 9 10 15 and 41 2 10 15 at at isotopic ratios are significantly lower than those reported in the nubian aquifer of egypt patterson et al 2005 where most of the values are above 100 10 15 at at and with a maximum at 228 10 15 at at in the nubian aquifer chloride concentrations are 20 to 50 times lower than in ci while 36cl concentrations are similar in the algerian part of the ci described by guendouz and michelot 2006 36cl concentrations vary from to 0 90 to 3 53 108 at l while 36cl cl ratios vary from to 8 to 99 10 15 at at the samples from the tozeur ridge group are on the eastern prolongation of the algerian continuous flowline coming from recharge in the atlas crossing the entire algerian desert from west to east fig 1 along with the guendouz and michelot 2006 dataset the tozeur ridge samples were used in petersen et al 2014 to characterise the recharge in the atlas mountains over the last 775 ka comparison between the tozeur ridge group and the other samples is provided by the 36cl cl against 36cl concentration plot in fig 4 this highlights three distinct clusters of data a first set of samples has relatively high 36cl cl ratios between 20 and 40 10 15 at at and relatively low 36cl less than 3 10 8 at l it includes most of the samples from the tozeur ridge group two samples from the south group the closest to the dahar mountains and the superficial sample of the dahar group a second set of samples are in the same range of 36cl cl values but have higher 36cl above 4 10 8 at l these samples are all from the dahar group and one of the south group sample 2 they are also characterised by a quite high and constant cl concentration around 1 g l finally the third set of samples has both low 36cl cl 15 10 15 at at and low 36cl 2 5 10 8 at l it includes most of the samples of the south group those from the kebili gabes group and two from tozeur ridge group only one sample from tozeur ridge group 22 displays the combination of high 36cl concentration and low 36cl cl this sample already showed an anomalously high 14c concentration helium total he concentration ne concentration and non atmospheric 4he concentrations after correction from neon concentration are presented in table 2 considering 20ne of pure atmospheric origin helium concentrations were corrected for their atmospheric component using the relation 1 4 he non atm 4 he meas 20 ne meas 20 ne sol 4 he sol where meas subscript refers to measured values and sol subscript to equilibrium solubility values at 20 c considered as the best estimate of recharge temperature edmunds et al 2004 elliot et al 2014 it also roughly compensates for obvious limited degassing samples 15 21 22 and 24 although the uncertainty implied is larger however the assumptions and uncertainties for this correction have very little effect on the data since for all but 3 samples 1 3 and 4 non atmospheric helium is more than 94 of total helium fig 5 indicates that all these groundwater samples are air saturated waters that accumulated radiogenic helium with a 3he 4he ratio 0 03 ra typical of the crustal production ballentine and burnard 2002 with no evidence of any mantel component typical value of 8 ra in the upper mantle samples display a wide range of he concentrations from 8 8 10 8 to 3 3 10 5 ccstp g the lowest values 5 10 7 ccstp g are associated with the three samples closest to the north dahar outcrop showing significant 14c activity and high 36cl cl ratios dahar group the highest helium concentrations exceed by several orders of magnitude those expected for equilibrium solubility with the atmosphere 4 5 10 8 ccstp g samples of the south group associated to a low hydraulic gradient display he concentration in the 10 5 ccstp g range the estimated order of magnitude of he production due to the radioactive decay of u and th and their α emitting daughters in the rock matrix ballentine et al 2002 is 2 10 12 ccstp g of water year considering typical values of 1 ppm of u and 3 ppm of th elliot et al 2014 and an average porosity of 20 eress 1972 guellala et al 2011 for the tozeur group samples for instance this would lead to ages around 1 ma therefore accumulation of radiogenic helium reflects therefore both the in situ production and also the vertical fluxes from underlying layers and basement this combination has been observed in similar geological environments ballentine et al 2002 torgersen and clarke 1985 castro et al 1998 marty et al 1993 2003 patterson et al 2005 kulongoski 2008 fourré et al 2011a fig 5 demonstrates two trends characterised by different isotopic signatures of the crustal end member dahar and south groups samples are mixed with a less radiogenic end member than tozeur ridge samples this probably reflects differences in the geology such as li content of the rocks along the different lines of flowpaths from the recharge areas the kebili gabes samples lie in between 5 discussion stable isotopes show a large range of variation but each group presents mostly consistent values they are used as a control for the mixing calculation in the gabes discharge area 14c and 36cl distributions in the samples close to the dahar outcrop provide recharge information while 36cl and 4he are used to infer the circulation pattern in the different areas of the study 20ne depletion suggests degassing of the sample 22 moreover detectable 14c activity and high 36cl concentration point to a cross contamination originating from mixing between different aquifers to explain such an unusual signature compared to the seven other samples of the tozeur ridge group consequently this sample is excluded from the discussion sample 2 has a composition closer to the dahar group than the south group for the stable isotope of water cl 36cl figs 3 and 4 this sample will then be considered to belong to the dahar group in the discussion before examining the system scale some considerations about the dahar mountains and the low gradient area are given quantification of the recharge over the last 40 ka in the north dahar in the dahar samples the 36cl cl ratio is much higher and the 4he content much lower than in the south samples as shown is figs 4 and 6 this sharp contrast appears despite the vicinity of dahar mountains to both groups see fig 1 the 14c content in the north dahar highlight two recharge periods younger than 50 ka younger than 7 ka and 29 to 43 ka they may correspond to humid periods described in the literature one during the holocene in the mediterranean area abrantes et al 2012 desprat et al 2013 the second recorded 30 40 ka ago in the tunisian chotts szabo et al 1995 causse et al 2003 a mean recharge rate r may be calculated as a function of a mean residence time t t represent the time elapsed between the water income at outcrop and its present day sampled location we use the apparent ages based on 14c in the unconfined part the equation is 2 r l t ω where l is the thickness m and ω the porosity in the dahar mountains the thickness of the ci is estimated about 200 m baba sy 2005 and the porosity about 19 guellala et al 2011 the 14c age of the sample 1 is lower than 7 ka then the mean recharge rate over this period of time is higher than 6 mm an considering the total area of the ci outcrops in the dahar mountains 2000 km2 according to baba sy 2005 it is higher than 0 3 m3 s in the confined part assuming a piston flow model and no mixing the recharge rate r is expressed as a linear function of time t the distance d between the sample and the outcrop the porosity ω the length l of the outcrop and the thickness l of the aquifer geyh and wirth 1980 3 r d t ω l l the closest outcrop to the sample 3 is distant of 20 km 14 km length and the 14c age between 29 and 43 ka then the mean recharge rate of the last 29 to 43 ka is 1 3 to 1 9 mm yr the samples 1 and 3 are a good example of the large variation of 36cl concentrations that can be measured within less than 50 km and less than 50 ka the respective numbers 1 53 10 8 at l and 7 31 10 8 at l indicate a specific combination of evaporation precipitation dissolution of halite and initial 36cl cl and it is difficult to isolate any of those components however some key parameters are estimated within large uncertainties the main source of the precipitation in the dahar is the atlantic or the mediterranean sea abouelmagd et al 2012 the chlorine concentration in the rainfall depending on the distance to the moisture source the initial concentrations before evaporation may range from 4 mg l as used by guendouz and michelot 2006 in the algerian part of the ci atlantic coast and 20 mg l as measured by gay 1999 in the cap bon north tunisian mediterranean coast this range as well as an increase in the cosmogenic production e g the twice higher hypothesis in plummer 1997 in nevada 40 ka ago or the contribution of halite dissolution can explain the wide range of 36cl and cl concentrations in the dahar at different period of time helium accumulation in the tunisian part of the ci close to the dahar outcrops 4he concentration in samples 1 3 7 ka 3 33 ka and 4 31 ka is higher than the atmospheric value the subsequent 4he crustal accumulations are then respectively 4 8 10 11 2 10 11 and 4 10 12 ccstp g a 4he concentrations measured in the eastward flow line tozeur ridge group range from 6 to 40 10 7 ccstp g over the distance between the tozeur ridge samples and the atlas outcrop between 470 km and 530 km the 36cl cl experience a decay by a factor 2 to 4 using a range of ages between 300 and 600 ka at a mean distance from the atlas of 500 km petersen et al 2014 the mean 4he accumulation is around 4 10 12 ccstp g a these rough calculations show a sharp contrast between the accumulation of helium in the tunisian and in the algerian part of the ci they are supported by the two distinct crustal 3he 4he end members mixing with the atmospheric end member 2 7 10 8 for the dahar and 8 10 9 for the tozeur ridge group fig 5 by contrast with the tozeur ridge group the south group is located in the low hydraulic gradient area and displays he concentrations one order of magnitude higher than those of the tozeur ridge group 8 10 6 to 3 10 5 ccstp g it reinforces the argument for long residence time and that almost stagnant groundwater has been there for some millions of years considering the 4he accumulations calculated for the tozeur ridge 4 10 12 ccstp g a and dahar 0 2 8 10 11 ccstp g a groups the range of residence times is 2 to 5 ma by comparison marty et al 2003 and fourré et al 2011b obtained values of 1 5 10 11 to 1 7 10 10 ccstp g a in aquifers of the paris basin in the gab torgersen and clarke 1985 obtained 4 6 10 12 in recent water 50 ka and 2 91 10 10 in older groundwaters the south group presents very high chlorine concentrations in excess of 2000 mg l these brackish groundwaters present a challenge to use the 36cl method the high chloride concentrations are supposed to be associated to a dramatic increase of the 36cl concentration due to deep production park et al 2002 however the 36cl concentration in the south group is not higher than the concentration in samples close to the outcrop this group presents high 4he contents and a narrow range of 36cl concentrations chlorine concentrations highlight a western water body samples 8 to 11 1 7 to 2 2 g l salty and dense and a eastern water body 5 to 7 0 5 to 0 8 g l less mineralized the recharge intensity could explain this contrast too weak to lead to a mixing between these two bodies it would however dilute the cl concentrations at the same time 4he diffuses from the west where it is more concentrated toward the outcrops an alternative interpretation is a mixing of the recharge with water from the western salty and dense water body when the hydraulic gradient is reversed and led to a discharge in this area compatible with present day model of the djeffara aquifer oss report oss 2006 overall groundwater in the south of tunisia is quasi stagnant as shown by the 36cl equilibrium and the high radiogenic 4he content they reach it presents poor quality waters cl concentration up to 2300 mg l which are neither potable nor suitable for agriculture one of the worst consequences related to the intensification of the ci exploitation would be the mobilisation of these brackish groundwaters toward the discharge areas both gabes and dahar the mixing balance described below could be changed and result in the decline of the groundwater quality in the northern part of the ci convergence of flowpaths the gabes plain through the hamma fault is the main discharge area of the ci in tunisia oss 2003 the samples from the kebili gabes group then necessarily result from a mixing between the flowlines described previously they show the lowest 36cl but not the highest 4he contents the low 36cl concentration of this group confirms the convergence of groundwater with long residence time coherent with the idea of a recharge mostly coming from the algerian atlas and a very long way along a sw ne route crossing the whole of southern tunisia fig 1 4he concentrations in the kebili gabes group include values 10 6 ccstp g to 3 10 5 ccstp g suggesting a locally variable flux only samples 14 and 29 verify the expected higher 4he content in the kebili gabes group than in the tozeur ridge group 8 10 6 ccstp g the other samples are within the same range of helium concentrations as those on the tozeur ridge however the crustal signature is still different between the tozeur ridge and the kebili gabes group fig 5 in order to estimate the origin atlas dahar or tinhert mountains of the groundwater in gabes we based a simple mixing model between the different group highlighted above cl and stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o are used as conservative tracers to roughly calculate the contribution of each group to the values characterising the kebili gabes group the three end members we described in this paper tozeur ridge dahar and south are completed by two end members from guendouz and michelot 2006 and elliot et al 2014 shown in the tables 1 and 2 these two algerian end members represent groundwaters from central atlas fig 1 and 6 and are named the central and oriental erg from north to south the table 3 indicates the composition of each end members as an example a good agreement with the three tracers is observed with the following proportions fig 7 central 40 oriental erg 35 tozeur ridge 13 south 9 and dahar 2 this scenario indicates that the atlas mountains are providing most of the groundwaters reaching the tunisian discharge area 88 while the dahar mountains are a small to insignificant contributor the tinhert contribution in the discharge flux in gabes is moderate but still existing despite the low gradient area 36cl concentration is higher and 4he concentration is lower in the calculated mixing than in the measured concentration in kebili gabes group fig 7 the radioactive decay and the accumulation of 4he are not taken into account in our simple mixing model and these processes explain these differences the calculated 36cl concentration is about twice the observed 36cl concentration roughly equivalent to 300 ka one 36cl half live the comparison between the measured mixing and the calculated mixing gives an indication of the age of the mixture and should not be considered as an absolute age as expected the calculated 4he concentration is lower than the average of 4he concentration in the kebili gabes group however the range of concentration in this group is too wide to calculate a meaningful accumulation oss 2003 baba sy 2005 and petersen 2014 provide a steady state hydrogeological model of the ci based on the 1950 reference piezometric map the calculated inputs range from 5 2 to 7 5 m3 s in the atlas of which 3 6 m3 s discharge in the foggaras southwest part of the map fig 1 from 0 15 to 0 45 m3 s in the dahar and from 0 1 to 1 m3 s in the tinhert the output in the tunisian discharge area is between 2 and 3 1 m3 s assuming that dahar groundwaters entirely discharge in the gabes area tinhert groundwaters complete the flux the proportions of groundwaters reaching gabes range from 80 to 88 for the atlas from 10 to 15 for the dahar and from 2 to 5 for tinhert the proportions we calculated using isotopes are in line with those from the hydrogeological modelling however isotopic calculations demonstrate a lower flux from dahar and a higher flux from tinhert than the hydrogeological modelling this incomplete agreement may be explained by several factors e g the poor knowledge of the boundary condition in these areas like piezometric levels the lack of complementary measurements to define the end members or temporal changes in the hydraulic gradients 6 conclusion the use of both conservative and radioactive tracers provides a comprehensive description of the tunisian part of the ci 14c is below procedural blank 0 44 pmc by contrast with previous works except in the dahar mountains which bears evidence of recently recharge water 40 ka all other areas are compatible with a very ancient recharge when long residence times are expected contamination of a few pmc with 14c brings inconsistencies in residence time interpretations and should be avoided by using methods that reliably exclude atmospheric air combined with high sensitivity ams measurements 36cl is a suitable tracer in brackish groundwaters in the ci context given that no particularly high 36cl concentrations have been measured due to deep production regional grouping appears when different isotopes are considered together while each tracer taken individually provides us with only ambiguous information residence times in the dahar mountains 3 to 43 ka and the sharp contrast with the surrounding areas show a low recharge rate and absence of significant circulation the groundwaters in the south of the ci which accumulated several millions of years ago are highly mineralized the increase in the exploitation of the ci widely over the present day recharge may lead to mining of these very old groundwaters the quality of the groundwater in the north of the ci tozeur ridge group is relatively good today but could be deteriorated in the future without a management of groundwater abstraction in this paper our use of a multi isotopes approach has improved understanding of the local recharge and circulation of groundwater in a continental scale aquifer system at this scale the 14c measurements indicate whether or not an outcrop is an active recharge area the combination of 36cl radioactive decay and 4he

7327,in a semi arid to arid climate context dependency on groundwater resources may lead to overexploitation and deterioration of water quality the continental intercalaire ci aquifer is one such continental scale aquifer more than a million of km2 which is mainly confined poorly recharged but intensely abstracted to date the management of this resource relies on hydrogeological modelling and key parameters such as recharge discharge rate and groundwater dynamics we use a combination of residence time indicators 14c 36cl 4he and stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o to give greater constraint on the groundwater residence time in the ci in previous studies 14c measurements and steady state modelling indicate a residence time of less than 100 ka whereas in others 36cl measurements and transient scenarios modelling suggest a longer residence time 500 ka in this study most of the 14c measurements are below the limit of detection establishing residence times greater than 40 ka and confirming the necessity of strict sampling protocols to exclude all air and ams measurements when low 14c concentrations are expected in the tunisian recharge area detectable 14c indicate sporadic recharge episodes 3 7 ka and 29 43 ka whereas 4he and 36cl concentrations in central areas suggest very old 2 ma groundwaters in these central areas chlorine concentration can reach more than 2 g l since 36cl concentrations are up to 4 time less than the initial input we are confident there is no excessive deep 36cl production we characterise five distinct flowpaths reaching the tunisian discharge area using their isotopic signatures according to our mixing model the average contribution from the main recharge area the algerian atlas mountains is around 88 this value is close to hydrogeological models conversely the contribution from the dahar mountains is lower than in the hydrogeological modelling 2 against 10 whereas the tinhert shows a greater contribution 10 against 1 increase of abstraction from the ci can potentially activate the circulation of old brackish groundwaters and dramatically decrease the water quality in the whole system keywords recharge groundwater

2008 however any further assessment of their sustainability in response to future changing conditions requires significant steps forward in our ability to integrate all available information from hydrodynamics as well as physical and chemical properties so as to fully exploit these data in numerical models in response to this need we have undertaken an extensive study of the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas one of the largest aquifer systems in the world this transboundary multi layered aquifer which extends over 106 km2 in algeria tunisia and libya is composed of two main water bearing units the complexe terminal ct and the continental intercalaire ci previous studies have been tackling the residence time issues related to the ci which is deeper and more extended contradictory residence times can be estimated short less than 100 ka based on 14c measurements abid et al 2010 2012a b or steady sate modelling baba sy 2005 and reference therein or long more than 1 ma associated to 36cl measurements guendouz and michelot 2006 or 238u 234u activities elliot et al 2014 and transient modelling petersen et al 2014 this multi isotope study proposes a mass balance stable isotope of water cl between five drainage areas of the ci and one of the main outlet description fig 1 and hydrological context and an original interpretation of new 36cl and 14c data clark and fritz 1997 and cartwright et al 2017a offer comprehensive reviews of the use of cosmogenic isotopes in aquifer more specific descriptions can be found in libby et al 1949 and stuiver and reimer 1993 for 14c and in lal and peters 1967 bentley et al 1986 or phillips 2000 for 36cl dating ranges of up to 40 50 ka for 14c and from 100 ka to several ma for 36cl are expected given their respective half lives 5730 a for 14c and 301 ka for 36cl 4he measurements torgersen and ivey 1985 torgersen 2010 kipfer et al 2002 have been used to establish the overlap in ages between 14c and 36cl in aquifers 4he is produced at a predictable rate by the uranium and thorium decay however radiogenic 4he accumulation not only depends on uranium and thorium contents in the aquifer host matrix but also on advection and diffusion fluxes to and from other geological formations in other continental scale aquifers such as the great artesian basin gab and the amadeus basin in australia the nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas or the paris basin in france multi isotopic tracers studies have been applied over the past 20 years lehmann et al 2003 used 81kr to calibrate 36cl parameters initial value radioactive decay subsurface production and addition of chloride and 4he dating methods in the gab 1 7 106 km2 in the gab again mahara et al 2009 tested the compatibility of the groundwater flow velocity and 4he

the paris basin 2 106 km2 four studies based on multi isotopes evaluated the confinement properties of the clay formation for an underground research laboratory url marty et al 2003 used 14c to calculate 4he accumulation rate lavastre et al 2010 used 14c 36cl and noble gases to determine recharge period fourré et al 2011b and rebeix et al 2014 used he isotopes and cl isotopes to characterise aquifers more recently a multi isotopic study of oman based on 14c 36cl and 4he müller et al 2016 showed the complementarity of these tracers to calculate residence time in a straightforward area also cartwright et al 2017b used 14c and 36cl cl to constrain solutes cycle in an old groundwater system murray basin australia in this paper we propose to use residence indicators 14c and 36cl and accumulations of radiogenic 4he as well as stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o to characterise a complex study site to attempt to quantify the recharge in a secondary recharge area and to determine origins and proportions of groundwaters reaching the main discharge area 2 hydrogeological context the two main aquifers of the nwsas the ct and the ci are located in cretaceous to neogene formations isolated from each other by the cenomanian aquitard an evaporitic and argillaceous layer unconfined on a large proportion of its surface the ct is imbedded in heterogeneous turonian to pliocene continental formations of sand clay and carbonates by contrast the ci aquifer on which this paper focuses is mostly confined deeper down to 2500 m beneath the chotts region in tunisia and larger 1 5 times the ct area it is composed of late jurassic to early cretaceaous detrital sediments alternating marine and continental origins from clear to clayey sand cornet 1964 busson 1967 conrad 1969 castany 1982 ouaja et al 2004 with only two main water bearing formations barremian and albian the ci have been shown to be both more homogeneous and continuous than the ct edmunds et al 2003 petersen et al 2014 the joint storage of ct and ci has been estimated around 31 000 109 m3 baba sy 2005 of which 20 000 109 m3 for the ci aquifer considering a mean thickness of 350 m 1000 m at maximum an extent of around 1 1 106 km2 and an effective porosity of 5 baba sy 2005 this rough estimation suggests it is a significant water supply for the algerian tunisian and libyan saharan oases and in the whole semi arid northern fringe of the saharan desert however since the beginning of intense abstraction for domestic and agricultural uses in the 1970 s a general decrease of the piezometric level in both ci and ct aquifers was observed while water withdrawal reached 75 m3 s in 2000 to assess the sustainability of this water resource several large scale hydrological investigations were conducted eress 1972 oss 2003 baba sy 2005 modern pre anthropic recharge rates were estimated between 29 2 and 35 5 m3 s according to hydrological models of the ci and ct eress 1972 oss 2003 baba sy 2005 recently gonçalvès et al 2013 estimated a modern recharge rate of 44 28 m3 s over the nwsas based on a regional water budget calculation from the grace record of terrestrial water storage over the time period from 2003 to 2010 therefore these results indicate consistently that the nwsas is still an active system with a small but significant present day recharge the ci has been conceptualised as three sub systems based on piezometric maps established in the 1970 s before the intensification of abstraction eress 1972 the great occidental erg the great oriental erg and the hamada al hamra see fig 1 the atlas mountains is the recharge area of the great occidental erg while the foggaras constitutes the discharge area in a nw to sw direction the nafusa mountains tinhert plateau and the hassawna mountains supply the hamada al hamra area which discharges in the gulf of syrte and imply three main flowpaths west to east south west to north east and south to north respectively in between the atlas mountains the dahar mountains and the tinhert plateau are the recharge areas of the great oriental erg where the main discharge area is the gulf of gabes a low hydraulic gradient area is located in the central south of the ci indicating almost stagnant groundwaters see fig 1 there the proportion of the contribution from the atlas and the tinhert is poorly understood depending on the recharge variability and historic climatic conditions however assuming an equivalent decrease of recharge over the entire system low hydraulic gradients and flow directions are globally maintained according to climatic simulations over 10 ka baba sy 2005 and over 775 ka petersen 2014 edmunds et al 2003 described the hydrochemistry of the flowline from the north atlas mountains fig 1 the tunisian southern part ends downstream of the main flowlines where collected waters are characterised by different recharge areas residence times and water rock interactions as described in several studies abid et al 2009 2010 2011 2012a b they highlight that the tunisian ci groundwaters are of sodium chloride to sulphate calcium type with halite dissolution and evaporation as the main source of salinity note that major ion concentrations we measured are similar to the results of previous studies and are not described further here the residence time in an aquifer can be expressed as the storage by the recharge or discharge rate in a steady state system for the ci only with a modern pre anthropogenic recharge between 5 6 and 15 2 m3 s baba sy 2005 petersen 2014 and a 20 000 109 m3 storage the residence time is between 40 ka and 115 ka however others have shown that transient model are needed to describe the ci and recharge rates varied drastically in the past edmunds et al 2004 tjallingii et al 2008 coulthard et al 2013 petersen et al 2014 so far only a few attempts have been made to date ci groundwaters directly by radiometric methods in particular guendouz and michelot 2006 reported 36cl measurements along a w e transect across algeria figs 1 and 2 the data showed that the 36cl activity and 36cl cl ratio decrease uniformly by a factor of 3 to 4 along 600 km in west to east flow direction table 1 this range is compatible with radioactive decay of 36cl on the expected time scales however the inferred water ages remained highly uncertain ranging between 400 and 1300 ka for the easternmost samples depending on the initial set of parameters used in the chronological equations as in all system the choice of a value for the initial input and the chloride dissolution contribution particularly affect age calculations while deep production is generally assumed to be known fabryka martin 1988 along with 238u series radionuclides data and activities ratio elliot et al 2014 provide some 4he concentrations occurring in the ci see fig 1 and 2 they range from 8 8 10 8 to 3 3 10 5 ccstp g table 1 based on 234u 238u activities they suggest residence time up to 600 ka as mentioned previously by contrast with those old ages several publications reported 14c activities significantly above background guendouz 1985 edmunds et al 2003 abid et al 2011 14c activities up to 60 pmc have been measured in the first 200 km from the algerian atlas mountains towards the gulf of gabes edmunds et al 2003 these concentrations have been interpreted as a contribution of holocene or late pleistocene recharge for the 400 km remaining to the discharge area of the gulf of gabes 14c activities vary from 0 to 2 pmc guendouz 1985 and abid et al 2011 report activities from 1 to more than 10 pmc with an analytical error of at least 1 pmc in distinct areas of the tunisian ci these values suggest that water recently in equilibrium with the atmosphere infiltrated the aquifer within timescales commensurate with the 14c decay period the sampling of large amount of water for the liquid scintillation spectrometry method may also have led to atmospheric contamination aggarwal et al 2014 all but one of their samples between 1 and 4 pmc occur close to the outcrop less than 200 km love et al 2000 in the gab disregard measurement below 4 pmc mahara et al 2009 presented more than sixty 14c measurements in the gab again all above 1 pmc whatever the distance to the outcrop up to 1090 km in order to address this issue to get a realistic interpretation and to understand if the system shows discordant ages we have taken a new set of small volumes 14c samples collected with techniques designed to eliminate atmospheric contamination 3 sampling and methods to characterise the dynamics of the tunisian groundwaters twenty nine boreholes were sampled in november 2010 fig 2 covering the extent of the ci in tunisia the samples are assigned in four geographical groups according to the hydrogeological units previously presented in the fig 1 the depth vary from 150 m to 2600 m with most of the screen intervals of 10 50 m up to 300 m in some case however only slightly more than half of the boreholes had precise depth information tozeur ridge group the nine samples of this group named after the main geomorphological structure of the area are regularly spaced in the tunisian part of the well documented atlas to gabes flowpath edmunds et al 2003 guendouz and michelot 2006 dahar group this group consist in five samples taken in the northern part of the ci dahar mountains outcrop or close to it south group this group includes eight samples from southernmost part of the studied area theses samples may have several origins as suggested by the piezometric map the tinhert the south western part of the atlas and or the dahar the low hydraulic gradient in this area less than 50 m in 400 km does not indicate which origin is more probable three samples close to the dahar outcroup belong to this group and not the dahar group they are located in the southern part of the dahar where an oss technical report oss 2003 suggest that a discharge may occur from the ci to the djeffara aquifer kebili gabes group the seven samples of this group named after the main localities of the area are located in the main discharge area of the ci close to the gabes gulf in this area the ci aquifer upwells along the el hamma fault and outlets into the djeffara coastal aquifer techniques samples have been taken from the wellhead or a tap directly connected few meters to the head only one 13 come from a tap connected by more than few meters of pipe because of a pump failure no samples for helium nor 14c analysis were collected on site 6 and no sample 14c analysis were collected on site 10 however in both case non hermetic tanks used for water storage were sampled for 14c to characterise exchange with the atmosphere in table 1 to measure the stable isotopes water samples were collected in brown glass bottles δ 2 h and δ 18 o were determined at the lrae laboratory sfax tunisia by laser spectrometry measurement and expressed as variations relative to the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water precision is 1 for δ 2 h and 0 1 for δ 18 o samples for carbon isotopes analysis on dic dissolved inorganic c were collected in 500 ml stainless steel bottles to avoid any atmospheric contamination the preparation prior to analysis was carried out at ides laboratory in orsay france δ 13 c was measured by irms isotopic ratio mass spectromectry precision of 0 15 the results are reported in variations from the vienna peedee belemnite standard vpdb the 14c measurements were performed on the artemis national ams facility ums lmc14 saclay france according to published procedures delqué količ et al 2013 the results expressed in percent modern carbon pmc have been corrected from the blank 0 2 to 0 4 pmc depending on the batch the 1 σ uncertainty is 1 14c contents of two tank samples 6 and 10 are well over the detection limit see table 1 whereas nearby samples collected directly from the wellheads are below or close to the detection limit this indicates rapid exchange with the co2 atmospheric pool and provides further evidence for likely rapid contamination of samples collected and pre treated in the field under the classical analytical procedure aggarwal et al 2014 immediately after collecting samples for chlorine isotopes in hdpe bottles the water was acidified with ultra pure hno3 samples were clear in color and thus unfiltered chloride concentration was measured by ion chromatography at the lrae 36cl samples were prepared at the cerege laboratory aix en provence france cl separation and purification steps followed a procedure modified from bentley et al 1986 the target weight of chloride was 2 mg according to the requirement of the ams used cl was first precipitated as agcl and the supernatant was discarded then the precipitate was dissolved in nh4oh and sulphur was removed by precipitation of baso4 in order to minimize 36s which is the most abundant 36cl isobar these two steps were repeated three times the last agcl precipitate was rinsed three times in distilled water and then dried the final stage was target preparation for the ams by compaction of the precipitate directly into the sample holder 36cl analyses were performed on the french ams national facility aster a 5 mv tandem accelerator installed at the cerege arnold et al 2010 arnold et al 2013 bouchez et al 2015 all 36cl concentrations were normalised to the knstd1600 calibration material 36cl cl of 1 6 10 12 provided by k nishiizumi for each set of 10 samples one blank sample was prepared following the procedure described above 36cl cl ratios of blanks varied between 0 1 0 04 10 15 and 0 9 0 3 10 15 and were always more than one order of magnitude lower than the smallest 36cl cl ratio measured sample 6 was chosen for its intermediate chlorine concentration to assess the overall reproducibility including both chemical separation and spectrometric measurements over the course of this study the reproducibly is assessed to be 8 2 rsd n 6 samples for he analyses were collected in copper tubes tightly closed at both ends by metal clamps for each sampling point two replicates of 10 ml of water were sampled in the laboratory dissolved helium and neon were extracted under vacuum into a glass bulb following a routine procedure jean baptiste et al 1992 jean baptiste et al 2010 jean baptiste et al 2017 the glass bulbs were then connected to the high vacuum stainless steel inlet line of a map 215 50 noble gas mass spectrometer for 3he 4he and 20ne determination the measurements were calibrated against air as a standard analytical precisions for helium and neon concentrations and for the 3he 4he ratio are given in table 2 20ne is considered of purely atmospheric origin and is used to correct 4he concentrations for the atmospheric contribution 20ne degasing may also indicate atmospheric contamination during sampling 4 results table 1 gives sample numbers group temperature δ 13 c and 14c while table 2 presents total he concentration ne concentration radiogenic he concentration helium isotopic ratio as well as chloride and 36cl concentration and 36cl cl ratio δ 2 h and δ 18 o as shown in fig 3 δ 2 h ranges from 70 to 40 and δ 18 o from 9 to 6 the samples are scattered below the local meteoric water line and even below the global meteoric water line showing very low deuterium excess they are depleted compared to the modern rainwater of sfax the reference station in the area where the mean values of δ 2 h and δ 18 o are 23 3 and 4 6 respectively maliki et al 2000 celle jeanton et al 2001 abid et al 2011 the most enriched sample δ 2h 41 close to the sfax meteoric water line smwl is the shallowest sample 1 the dahar and the tozeur ridge groups are more enriched lightest δ 18o up to 7 and 6 5 respectively and δ 2 h up to 46 and 51 respectively than the south and kebili gabes group heaviest δ 18 o up to 9 and 8 respectively and δ 2 h up to 69 and 62 respectively stable isotopes are therefore consistent in each group the kebili gabes group appears as a mixing between the tozeur ridge group and a more depleted end member like the south group the data generally does not seem to follow an evaporation line a part from the tozeur group δ 13 c and 14 c δ 13 c varies from 12 to 7 except sample 23 17 this range of 12 to 7 is typical of some dissolution of marine carbonate δ 13 c 0 in recharging meteoric water δ 13 c 22 to 27 the unusually light value may indicate interaction with old organic matter love et al 1994 jiráková et al 2009 jiráková et al 2010 out of the 27 samples collected at a wellhead five 1 3 5 and 22 have 14c activity significantly above the detection limit determined by procedural blank of the artemis ams 0 2 to 0 4 pmc the superficial sample of the dahar group 1 not surprisingly presents the highest value 42 2 0 2 pmc according to edmunds et al 2003 and guendouz 2003 activities between 20 and 60 pmc are measured close to the ci and ct outcrops and correspond to holocene recharged water using the highest possible initial activity 100 pmc without any correction the maximum age would be around 7 ka the two samples closest to the northern outcrop in dahar show low but significant 14c activities 1 0 0 1 and 1 1 0 1 pmc with the sample 1 as an initial activity we calculated age corresponding to a travel time between the non confined and the confined area using netpath plummer et al 1994 the computed ages 29 to 43 ka depend on the model and the associated parameters carbonate dissolution soil gas co2 dissolution co2 gas aqueous exchange calcite hco3 exchange gypsum dissolution or ca na cation exchange only the fontes and garnier model fontes and garnier 1979 takes into account two major process occurring in the ci gypsum dissolution and ca na cation exchange abid et al 2010 2011 the corresponding ages are 33 and 31 ka respectively obviously all these ages are apparent ages assuming a piston flow model without any mixing alternatively small supplies of more recently recharged water could also explain the low measured 14c activities of these samples 14c activity of the sample 22 reaches 1 03 0 12 located in the tozeur ridge group it is deep and confined directly on the flowpath from the atlas mountains reasons to discard this sample are discussed later based on data from the other tracers 36 cl and 36 cl cl in the sampled part of the ci aquifer chloride concentration varies from 200 to 3500 mg l and 36cl concentration from 0 44 0 05 10 8 to 7 6 0 5 10 8 at l leading to 36cl cl atomic ratio between 5 2 0 9 10 15 and 41 2 10 15 at at isotopic ratios are significantly lower than those reported in the nubian aquifer of egypt patterson et al 2005 where most of the values are above 100 10 15 at at and with a maximum at 228 10 15 at at in the nubian aquifer chloride concentrations are 20 to 50 times lower than in ci while 36cl concentrations are similar in the algerian part of the ci described by guendouz and michelot 2006 36cl concentrations vary from to 0 90 to 3 53 108 at l while 36cl cl ratios vary from to 8 to 99 10 15 at at the samples from the tozeur ridge group are on the eastern prolongation of the algerian continuous flowline coming from recharge in the atlas crossing the entire algerian desert from west to east fig 1 along with the guendouz and michelot 2006 dataset the tozeur ridge samples were used in petersen et al 2014 to characterise the recharge in the atlas mountains over the last 775 ka comparison between the tozeur ridge group and the other samples is provided by the 36cl cl against 36cl concentration plot in fig 4 this highlights three distinct clusters of data a first set of samples has relatively high 36cl cl ratios between 20 and 40 10 15 at at and relatively low 36cl less than 3 10 8 at l it includes most of the samples from the tozeur ridge group two samples from the south group the closest to the dahar mountains and the superficial sample of the dahar group a second set of samples are in the same range of 36cl cl values but have higher 36cl above 4 10 8 at l these samples are all from the dahar group and one of the south group sample 2 they are also characterised by a quite high and constant cl concentration around 1 g l finally the third set of samples has both low 36cl cl 15 10 15 at at and low 36cl 2 5 10 8 at l it includes most of the samples of the south group those from the kebili gabes group and two from tozeur ridge group only one sample from tozeur ridge group 22 displays the combination of high 36cl concentration and low 36cl cl this sample already showed an anomalously high 14c concentration helium total he concentration ne concentration and non atmospheric 4he concentrations after correction from neon concentration are presented in table 2 considering 20ne of pure atmospheric origin helium concentrations were corrected for their atmospheric component using the relation 1 4 he non atm 4 he meas 20 ne meas 20 ne sol 4 he sol where meas subscript refers to measured values and sol subscript to equilibrium solubility values at 20 c considered as the best estimate of recharge temperature edmunds et al 2004 elliot et al 2014 it also roughly compensates for obvious limited degassing samples 15 21 22 and 24 although the uncertainty implied is larger however the assumptions and uncertainties for this correction have very little effect on the data since for all but 3 samples 1 3 and 4 non atmospheric helium is more than 94 of total helium fig 5 indicates that all these groundwater samples are air saturated waters that accumulated radiogenic helium with a 3he 4he ratio 0 03 ra typical of the crustal production ballentine and burnard 2002 with no evidence of any mantel component typical value of 8 ra in the upper mantle samples display a wide range of he concentrations from 8 8 10 8 to 3 3 10 5 ccstp g the lowest values 5 10 7 ccstp g are associated with the three samples closest to the north dahar outcrop showing significant 14c activity and high 36cl cl ratios dahar group the highest helium concentrations exceed by several orders of magnitude those expected for equilibrium solubility with the atmosphere 4 5 10 8 ccstp g samples of the south group associated to a low hydraulic gradient display he concentration in the 10 5 ccstp g range the estimated order of magnitude of he production due to the radioactive decay of u and th and their α emitting daughters in the rock matrix ballentine et al 2002 is 2 10 12 ccstp g of water year considering typical values of 1 ppm of u and 3 ppm of th elliot et al 2014 and an average porosity of 20 eress 1972 guellala et al 2011 for the tozeur group samples for instance this would lead to ages around 1 ma therefore accumulation of radiogenic helium reflects therefore both the in situ production and also the vertical fluxes from underlying layers and basement this combination has been observed in similar geological environments ballentine et al 2002 torgersen and clarke 1985 castro et al 1998 marty et al 1993 2003 patterson et al 2005 kulongoski 2008 fourré et al 2011a fig 5 demonstrates two trends characterised by different isotopic signatures of the crustal end member dahar and south groups samples are mixed with a less radiogenic end member than tozeur ridge samples this probably reflects differences in the geology such as li content of the rocks along the different lines of flowpaths from the recharge areas the kebili gabes samples lie in between 5 discussion stable isotopes show a large range of variation but each group presents mostly consistent values they are used as a control for the mixing calculation in the gabes discharge area 14c and 36cl distributions in the samples close to the dahar outcrop provide recharge information while 36cl and 4he are used to infer the circulation pattern in the different areas of the study 20ne depletion suggests degassing of the sample 22 moreover detectable 14c activity and high 36cl concentration point to a cross contamination originating from mixing between different aquifers to explain such an unusual signature compared to the seven other samples of the tozeur ridge group consequently this sample is excluded from the discussion sample 2 has a composition closer to the dahar group than the south group for the stable isotope of water cl 36cl figs 3 and 4 this sample will then be considered to belong to the dahar group in the discussion before examining the system scale some considerations about the dahar mountains and the low gradient area are given quantification of the recharge over the last 40 ka in the north dahar in the dahar samples the 36cl cl ratio is much higher and the 4he content much lower than in the south samples as shown is figs 4 and 6 this sharp contrast appears despite the vicinity of dahar mountains to both groups see fig 1 the 14c content in the north dahar highlight two recharge periods younger than 50 ka younger than 7 ka and 29 to 43 ka they may correspond to humid periods described in the literature one during the holocene in the mediterranean area abrantes et al 2012 desprat et al 2013 the second recorded 30 40 ka ago in the tunisian chotts szabo et al 1995 causse et al 2003 a mean recharge rate r may be calculated as a function of a mean residence time t t represent the time elapsed between the water income at outcrop and its present day sampled location we use the apparent ages based on 14c in the unconfined part the equation is 2 r l t ω where l is the thickness m and ω the porosity in the dahar mountains the thickness of the ci is estimated about 200 m baba sy 2005 and the porosity about 19 guellala et al 2011 the 14c age of the sample 1 is lower than 7 ka then the mean recharge rate over this period of time is higher than 6 mm an considering the total area of the ci outcrops in the dahar mountains 2000 km2 according to baba sy 2005 it is higher than 0 3 m3 s in the confined part assuming a piston flow model and no mixing the recharge rate r is expressed as a linear function of time t the distance d between the sample and the outcrop the porosity ω the length l of the outcrop and the thickness l of the aquifer geyh and wirth 1980 3 r d t ω l l the closest outcrop to the sample 3 is distant of 20 km 14 km length and the 14c age between 29 and 43 ka then the mean recharge rate of the last 29 to 43 ka is 1 3 to 1 9 mm yr the samples 1 and 3 are a good example of the large variation of 36cl concentrations that can be measured within less than 50 km and less than 50 ka the respective numbers 1 53 10 8 at l and 7 31 10 8 at l indicate a specific combination of evaporation precipitation dissolution of halite and initial 36cl cl and it is difficult to isolate any of those components however some key parameters are estimated within large uncertainties the main source of the precipitation in the dahar is the atlantic or the mediterranean sea abouelmagd et al 2012 the chlorine concentration in the rainfall depending on the distance to the moisture source the initial concentrations before evaporation may range from 4 mg l as used by guendouz and michelot 2006 in the algerian part of the ci atlantic coast and 20 mg l as measured by gay 1999 in the cap bon north tunisian mediterranean coast this range as well as an increase in the cosmogenic production e g the twice higher hypothesis in plummer 1997 in nevada 40 ka ago or the contribution of halite dissolution can explain the wide range of 36cl and cl concentrations in the dahar at different period of time helium accumulation in the tunisian part of the ci close to the dahar outcrops 4he concentration in samples 1 3 7 ka 3 33 ka and 4 31 ka is higher than the atmospheric value the subsequent 4he crustal accumulations are then respectively 4 8 10 11 2 10 11 and 4 10 12 ccstp g a 4he concentrations measured in the eastward flow line tozeur ridge group range from 6 to 40 10 7 ccstp g over the distance between the tozeur ridge samples and the atlas outcrop between 470 km and 530 km the 36cl cl experience a decay by a factor 2 to 4 using a range of ages between 300 and 600 ka at a mean distance from the atlas of 500 km petersen et al 2014 the mean 4he accumulation is around 4 10 12 ccstp g a these rough calculations show a sharp contrast between the accumulation of helium in the tunisian and in the algerian part of the ci they are supported by the two distinct crustal 3he 4he end members mixing with the atmospheric end member 2 7 10 8 for the dahar and 8 10 9 for the tozeur ridge group fig 5 by contrast with the tozeur ridge group the south group is located in the low hydraulic gradient area and displays he concentrations one order of magnitude higher than those of the tozeur ridge group 8 10 6 to 3 10 5 ccstp g it reinforces the argument for long residence time and that almost stagnant groundwater has been there for some millions of years considering the 4he accumulations calculated for the tozeur ridge 4 10 12 ccstp g a and dahar 0 2 8 10 11 ccstp g a groups the range of residence times is 2 to 5 ma by comparison marty et al 2003 and fourré et al 2011b obtained values of 1 5 10 11 to 1 7 10 10 ccstp g a in aquifers of the paris basin in the gab torgersen and clarke 1985 obtained 4 6 10 12 in recent water 50 ka and 2 91 10 10 in older groundwaters the south group presents very high chlorine concentrations in excess of 2000 mg l these brackish groundwaters present a challenge to use the 36cl method the high chloride concentrations are supposed to be associated to a dramatic increase of the 36cl concentration due to deep production park et al 2002 however the 36cl concentration in the south group is not higher than the concentration in samples close to the outcrop this group presents high 4he contents and a narrow range of 36cl concentrations chlorine concentrations highlight a western water body samples 8 to 11 1 7 to 2 2 g l salty and dense and a eastern water body 5 to 7 0 5 to 0 8 g l less mineralized the recharge intensity could explain this contrast too weak to lead to a mixing between these two bodies it would however dilute the cl concentrations at the same time 4he diffuses from the west where it is more concentrated toward the outcrops an alternative interpretation is a mixing of the recharge with water from the western salty and dense water body when the hydraulic gradient is reversed and led to a discharge in this area compatible with present day model of the djeffara aquifer oss report oss 2006 overall groundwater in the south of tunisia is quasi stagnant as shown by the 36cl equilibrium and the high radiogenic 4he content they reach it presents poor quality waters cl concentration up to 2300 mg l which are neither potable nor suitable for agriculture one of the worst consequences related to the intensification of the ci exploitation would be the mobilisation of these brackish groundwaters toward the discharge areas both gabes and dahar the mixing balance described below could be changed and result in the decline of the groundwater quality in the northern part of the ci convergence of flowpaths the gabes plain through the hamma fault is the main discharge area of the ci in tunisia oss 2003 the samples from the kebili gabes group then necessarily result from a mixing between the flowlines described previously they show the lowest 36cl but not the highest 4he contents the low 36cl concentration of this group confirms the convergence of groundwater with long residence time coherent with the idea of a recharge mostly coming from the algerian atlas and a very long way along a sw ne route crossing the whole of southern tunisia fig 1 4he concentrations in the kebili gabes group include values 10 6 ccstp g to 3 10 5 ccstp g suggesting a locally variable flux only samples 14 and 29 verify the expected higher 4he content in the kebili gabes group than in the tozeur ridge group 8 10 6 ccstp g the other samples are within the same range of helium concentrations as those on the tozeur ridge however the crustal signature is still different between the tozeur ridge and the kebili gabes group fig 5 in order to estimate the origin atlas dahar or tinhert mountains of the groundwater in gabes we based a simple mixing model between the different group highlighted above cl and stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o are used as conservative tracers to roughly calculate the contribution of each group to the values characterising the kebili gabes group the three end members we described in this paper tozeur ridge dahar and south are completed by two end members from guendouz and michelot 2006 and elliot et al 2014 shown in the tables 1 and 2 these two algerian end members represent groundwaters from central atlas fig 1 and 6 and are named the central and oriental erg from north to south the table 3 indicates the composition of each end members as an example a good agreement with the three tracers is observed with the following proportions fig 7 central 40 oriental erg 35 tozeur ridge 13 south 9 and dahar 2 this scenario indicates that the atlas mountains are providing most of the groundwaters reaching the tunisian discharge area 88 while the dahar mountains are a small to insignificant contributor the tinhert contribution in the discharge flux in gabes is moderate but still existing despite the low gradient area 36cl concentration is higher and 4he concentration is lower in the calculated mixing than in the measured concentration in kebili gabes group fig 7 the radioactive decay and the accumulation of 4he are not taken into account in our simple mixing model and these processes explain these differences the calculated 36cl concentration is about twice the observed 36cl concentration roughly equivalent to 300 ka one 36cl half live the comparison between the measured mixing and the calculated mixing gives an indication of the age of the mixture and should not be considered as an absolute age as expected the calculated 4he concentration is lower than the average of 4he concentration in the kebili gabes group however the range of concentration in this group is too wide to calculate a meaningful accumulation oss 2003 baba sy 2005 and petersen 2014 provide a steady state hydrogeological model of the ci based on the 1950 reference piezometric map the calculated inputs range from 5 2 to 7 5 m3 s in the atlas of which 3 6 m3 s discharge in the foggaras southwest part of the map fig 1 from 0 15 to 0 45 m3 s in the dahar and from 0 1 to 1 m3 s in the tinhert the output in the tunisian discharge area is between 2 and 3 1 m3 s assuming that dahar groundwaters entirely discharge in the gabes area tinhert groundwaters complete the flux the proportions of groundwaters reaching gabes range from 80 to 88 for the atlas from 10 to 15 for the dahar and from 2 to 5 for tinhert the proportions we calculated using isotopes are in line with those from the hydrogeological modelling however isotopic calculations demonstrate a lower flux from dahar and a higher flux from tinhert than the hydrogeological modelling this incomplete agreement may be explained by several factors e g the poor knowledge of the boundary condition in these areas like piezometric levels the lack of complementary measurements to define the end members or temporal changes in the hydraulic gradients 6 conclusion the use of both conservative and radioactive tracers provides a comprehensive description of the tunisian part of the ci 14c is below procedural blank 0 44 pmc by contrast with previous works except in the dahar mountains which bears evidence of recently recharge water 40 ka all other areas are compatible with a very ancient recharge when long residence times are expected contamination of a few pmc with 14c brings inconsistencies in residence time interpretations and should be avoided by using methods that reliably exclude atmospheric air combined with high sensitivity ams measurements 36cl is a suitable tracer in brackish groundwaters in the ci context given that no particularly high 36cl concentrations have been measured due to deep production regional grouping appears when different isotopes are considered together while each tracer taken individually provides us with only ambiguous information residence times in the dahar mountains 3 to 43 ka and the sharp contrast with the surrounding areas show a low recharge rate and absence of significant circulation the groundwaters in the south of the ci which accumulated several millions of years ago are highly mineralized the increase in the exploitation of the ci widely over the present day recharge may lead to mining of these very old groundwaters the quality of the groundwater in the north of the ci tozeur ridge group is relatively good today but could be deteriorated in the future without a management of groundwater abstraction in this paper our use of a multi isotopes approach has improved understanding of the local recharge and circulation of groundwater in a continental scale aquifer system at this scale the 14c measurements indicate whether or not an outcrop is an active recharge area the combination of 36cl radioactive decay and 4he

7328,the need for predictions of flow time series persists at ungauged catchments motivating the research goals of our study by means of the sacramento model this paper explores the use of parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics and makes comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters we assessed the performance using the nash sutcliffe ns bias mean monthly hydrograph and flow duration curve fdc the study was conducted on a large dataset of 73 catchments within the eastern us two approaches to the parameter transferability were developed and evaluated i the within homogeneous region parameter transfer using one donor catchment specific to each region ii the parameter transfer disregarding the geographical limits of homogeneous regions where one donor catchment was common to all regions comparisons between both parameter transfers enabled to assess the gain in performance from the parameter regionalization and its respective constraints and limitations the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions outperformed the a priori parameters and led to a decrease in bias and increase in efficiency reaching a median ns of 0 77 and a ns of 0 85 at individual catchments the use of fdc revealed the effect of bias on the inaccuracy of prediction from parameter transfer in one specific region of mountainous and forested catchments the prediction accuracy of the parameter transfer was less satisfactory and equivalent to a priori parameters in this region the parameter transfer from the outsider catchment provided the best performance less biased with smaller uncertainty in medium flow percentiles 40 60 the large disparity of energy conditions explained the lack of performance from parameter transfer in this region besides the subsurface stormflow is predominant and there is a likelihood of lateral preferential flow which according to its specific properties further explained the reduced efficiency testing the parameter transferability using criteria of similar climate and flow characteristics at ungauged catchments and comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters are a novelty the ultimate limitations of both approaches are recognized and recommendations are made for future research keywords parameter transfer ungauged catchments a priori parameters flow duration curve sacramento model 1 introduction estimates of stream flow are a prerequisite for solving a number of engineering and environmental problems i e water quality and supply flood control and stream habitat assessment kokkonen et al 2003 the accuracy of flow prediction in ungauged basins pub is a central issue in hydrological modeling arsenault and brissette 2014 ao et al 2006 sivapalan et al 2003 when no flow records of sufficient length are available at the site of interest regionalization techniques may be applied to derive such estimates kokkonen et al 2003 over the past decade different studies have developed techniques for pub primarily via flow regionalization and model parameterization hrachowitz et al 2013 gan and burges 2006 ren et al 2016 model parameterization in ungauged basins can be achieved using two primary approaches parameter regionalization anda priori parameters determined from catchment properties hrachowitz et al 2013 despite the plethora of studies devoted to this topic there is still no consensus regarding the most efficient approach for model parameterization in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 parajka et al 2013 razavi and couillibaly 2013 regionalization for pub involves the following steps i identification of homogeneous regions where several criteria of homogeneity can be used and ii data transfer observed flow data or calibrated parameters between gauged and ungauged catchments of the same homogenous region in parameter regionalization the rainfall runoff model is calibrated for all the study catchments with observed flows then using a regionalization method the parameters are transferred from the donor gauged catchments to the recipient ungauged catchments within the same region to examine the potential predictive performance at ungauged catchments the simulated flows from parameter transfer are compared with observed flows of recipient gauged catchments that play the role of ungauged catchments i e hundecha and bárdossy 2004 jennings et al 1994 kokkonen et al 2003 norbiato et al 2007 the three most common methods used for parameter regionalization are the regression based approach spatial proximity and physical similarity i e merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 sefton and howarth 1998 young 2006 the regression based approach correlates the calibrated model parameters with physical properties of gauged catchments the correlation is used to determine the model parameters in ungauged catchments merz and blöschl 2004 the spatial proximity approach consists of transferring parameters from neighboring catchments to the ungauged catchment the rationale being that catchments close to one other should have similar hydrologic behavior i e oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2007 in physical similarity approach the catchments with similar physical descriptors exhibit similar hydrologic behaviors i e mcintyre et al 2005 a common issue among the three regionalization approaches is less than satisfactory efficiency i e arsenault and brissette 2014 and a strong dependence on the complexity of the terrain and scale at which the relations are derived bock et al 2015 the model parameter definitions are by nature ambiguous and difficult to determine from a small number of descriptors i e physical and climatic characteristics zhang et al 2008 the lowest efficiency is obtained from the regression based approach the high correlation between model parameters and catchment descriptors does not guarantee efficient predictions kokkonen et al 2003 oudin et al 2010a sefton and howarth 1998 studies of spatial proximity and physical similarity have yielded no evidence of most efficient method i e oudin et al 2008 arsenault and brissette 2014 the spatial proximity has significant uncertainty due to a lack of representativeness of catchment data rainfall as well as issues of identifiability of model parameters skøien and blöschl 2007 more measures other than distances between catchments are needed to refine the predictions in physical similarity the homogeneity of physical descriptors does not necessarily translate into representativeness of model parameters and flow response zhang et al 2008 the most important component of parameter regionalization critical to obtaining satisfactory efficiency is the identification of the geographic extent to which there is homogeneity in hydroclimate characteristics and therefore similarity in hydrologic response bock et al 2015 only a few recent studies have tested parameter transferability within homogeneous regions of similar hydroclimate characteristics using this approach all catchments that are geographically located in the same homogeneous region received the same parameter set i e kim and kaluarachchi 2008 bock et al 2015 likewise for decades in flood regionalization flow data of gauged catchments determined the regional flood frequency distribution to predict floods at ungauged catchments of the same region i e farquharson et al 1992 mimikou and gordios 1989 portela and dias 2005 zrinji and burn 1994 it is worth mentioning that one of the explanatory variables of hydroclimate similarity is the spatial proximity sawicz et al 2011 due to the first order effects of climate and topography on hydrologic response smakhtin 2001 ali et al 2012 therefore similarity in hydroclimate characteristics combines to some extent criteria of spatial proximity and physical similarity but with more robust measures of similarity in hydrologic response in kim and kaluarachchi 2008 each sub basins of a large catchment 176 000 km2 was the spatial extent of similarity in hydroclimate characteristics and the region to conduct parameter transfer bock et al 2015 used flow data of gauged catchments to analyze model parameter sensitivity ps and geographically identify regions of similar ps that is indicative of similarity in model runoff processes all catchments of the same region received the same parameter set the approach yielded satisfactory efficiency of the mean monthly flow predictions bock et al 2015 additional research is needed to evaluate predictions of daily flow time series and provide alternatives to ps while meeting criteria of hydroclimate homogeneity in parameter regionalization the lack of consensus regarding the most efficient approach among the common parameter regionalization methods and the need for more in depth investigation of parameter transfer within homogenous regions of similar hydroclimate characteristics prompted the research goals of this study we investigate the parameter transferability of sacramento model sac sma in the eastern united states us using the geographically contiguous hydroclimatic regions determined by sawicz et al 2011 the homogeneous regions have the uniqueness of being identified based on criteria of similarity in climate and flow characteristics which adds to the novelty of our research in testing parameter transferability previous studies that tested parameter transferability of sac sma used either criteria of spatial proximity in few catchments from us koren et al 2003 or no specific criteria in few distant catchments gan and burges 2006 our primary objective was to quantify the gain in performance attained by the transfer of calibrated parameters from gauged catchments within homogeneous regions trans in relative to 1 model parameterized with a priori parameters derived from soil properties apriori and 2 model parameterized with transferred parameters from a single best performing catchment in the study area trans out we hypothesize that similarity in hydroclimate conditions will improve the efficiency of parameter transferability within homogeneous regions trans in relative to apriori and trans out trans out is not meant to represent a regionalization scheme for pub but instead aids to measure the gain in performance and reveal limitations of trans in the comparison between trans in and apriori will identify the catchments conditions where predictions from a priori parameters are better worse than predictions from the regionalization approach we are unaware of other studies that make similar comparisons our goal is to provide insights into the usage of the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions and the a priori parameters for pub in the u s and elsewhere 2 study area and dataset a total of 73 catchments from the eastern us were used in this study the catchments range in size from 67 km2 to 8052 km2 20 of the catchments have sizes above 4000 km2 the climate in the study region is mainly humid coopersmith et al 2012 perennial snow cover is absent for most catchments and does not exceed 3 of the surface area for individual catchments berghuijs et al 2014 time series data of daily streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet for all catchments were provided by mopex project duan et al 2006 the data are freely available and were retrieved from the following website www nws noaa gov oh mopex mo datasets htm the flows within this dataset are based on observed data collected by the united states geological survey usgs precipitation is determined by means of weighted averaging using rain gage measurements and prism data schaake et al 2006 the mean areal precipitation estimates result in limited errors schaake et al 2006 the mean monthly precipitation has limited fluctuation through seasons coopersmith et al 2012 sawicz et al 2011 whereas storm characteristics in particular storm intensity have systematic seasonal variation hershfield 1961 potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated on the basis of the noaa evaporation atlas the noaa atlas maps were derived by analysis of evaporation pan data schaake et al 2006 the modified hamon algorithm helped in calculations of the daily pet under the mopex project dingman 2002 sawicz et al 2011 the mopex catchments are minimally impacted by the human influence 3 the homogeneous regions in the study area and their specific characteristics over the last decade pub studies have worked to identify appropriate schemes for homogeneous regions hrachowitz et al 2013 according to wagener et al 2007 the homogeneous regions should be physically meaningful and provide a means to assess the dominant controls on the streamflow patterns mcdonnell and woods 2004 we used the homogeneous regions identified by sawicz et al 2011 that have the ultimate goal of facilitating the predictions at ungauged catchments fig 1 a the homogeneous regions are geographically contiguous and have been identified using six characteristics the streamflow elasticity to precipitation snow day ratio sdr the number of days per year where the precipitation is falling as snow the baseflow index runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve fdc and the slope of the hydrograph rising limb the streamflow elasticity to precipitation and the climate were the most influential in the regionalization followed by the runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve sawicz et al 2011 the regionalization using the six characteristics employed the method of partitioning algorithm by kennard et al 2010 as mentioned in the introduction section the novelty in sawicz et al 2011 is not in the characteristics themselves but in their combination to determine the homogeneous regions and therefore quantify the hydrologic similarity between the catchments we maintain the same regions notations as in sawicz et al 2011 c1 c2 c3 c5 fig 1 a the sdr is generally low across the study area and increases with the increasing latitude r2 0 81 p value 0 001 fig 1 b the largest median value is 25 obtained in c2 fig 1 b in c3 the median value is 22 in c1 it drops to

wetlands are small in all the regions table 1 4 methods 4 1 overview our overall methodology included the following steps detailed below and summarized in the flowchart of fig 2 step 1 performed model simulations for all catchments using a priori parameters apriori calculated fit statistics for the two periods we used for calibration and validation of sac sma model step 2 calibrated the sac sma model to optimize model performance for each catchment step 3 identified calibrated catchment with best performance in each region to be used as donor catchments for a parameter transfer scheme trans in step 4 performed model simulations using parameter transfer scheme trans in calculated fit statistics during calibration and validation period step 5 performed model simulations using parameters from the single best performing catchment for all catchments irrespective of regions trans out calculated fit statistics during calibration and validation period step 6 compared model performance for the parameter transfer scheme trans in to both apriori and trans out simulations interpret sac sma parameters transferability with respect to catchment characteristics 4 2 the sac sma model the sac sma model has been applied worldwide particularly in the different hydroclimate regimes of the united states koren et al 2003 this model of thirteen parameters all cited in the appendix with their respective physical meaning allows for detailed flow simulations dealing with runoff components i e the direct runoff surface runoff interflow and baseflow werkhoven et al 2008 the sac sma conceptual model has a two soil layer structure werkhoven et al 2008 each layer is made of tension and free water storages that interact to simulate the soil moisture and the runoff components koren et al 2000 2003 the tension water storages simulate the evapotranspiration et the daily average pet from mopex data in addition to the daily precipitation are the inputs necessary for the flow simulations 4 3 model simulation with a priori parameters the a priori parameters are determined from physical and empirical equations where the variables are mostly soil derived koren et al 2003 the soil derived variables used in the physical and empirical equations of the a priori parameters are determined from the soil map of the state soil geographic database statsgo of 1 1 km grid the soil map of this fine resolution was constructed via interpolations of the data obtained by soil sampling in some regions the soil sampling is done over large areas once in 100 to 200 km2 koren et al 2003 the statsgo provides at each grid estimates of θwlt the water content at wilting point θs the water content at saturation θfld the water content at field capacity and ks the hydraulic conductivity at saturation these variables determines the a priori values of the parameters simulating the runoff processes in the upper layer subsurface flow and the lower layer of sac sma baseflow duan et al 2001 koren et al 2003 the a priori parameters are available in mopex dataset and are designed to serve as an estimation technique for ungauged catchments koren et al 2003 young 2006 we evaluate the performance of the predictions from a priori parameters apriori using nash sutcliffe ns coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias mean monthly hydrograph mmh and the flow duration curve fdc we compare apriori to trans in this comparison is fair as both approaches are designed to make pub 4 4 model calibration we calibrated the thirteen sac sma model parameters using the shuffle complex algorithm sce ua with 10 000 iterations sorooshian et al 1993 this algorithm is extensively used for sac sma calibration to achieve different research goals such as studying model parameter transferability i e gan and burges 2006 and building a large database for the continental united states i e newman et al 2015 similar to gan and burges 2006 and koren et al 2003 we constrained the calibration to the a priori value of each parameter that is available in mopex this approach is termed constrained calibration strategy gan and burges 2006 koren et al 2003 and it helps to maintain physical consistency and to reduce equifinality we set 35 as the range of deviations allowed from the a priori parameters this range is larger than the range used in koren et al 2003 i e 25 we set this interval to allow for more variability around the default parameters and in the parameters space which is used by the sce ua algorithm to find the global optimum in this study the sample of catchments have limited effect of snow therefore we did not need to use the snow module of the sac sma model we calibrated sac sma for each catchment over 15 years january 1948 december 1963 subsequently we tested the model performance over an independent validation period of 36 years january 1964 december 1999 the calibration adjusted model parameters to best match the daily simulated flows to the daily observed flows using an objective function that minimized the rmse root mean square error we assessed the model performance using the ns coefficient and the pbias in mean flow moriasi et al 2007 4 5 parameter transfer within homogeneous regions trans in we investigated and evaluated a parameter regionalization scheme trans in to transfer parameter values from gauged to ungauged catchments within homogeneous regions for predictions of daily flow time series using sac sma model in trans in we designated one single donor catchment after conducting the sac sma model calibration we determined the catchment in each region with the highest ns coefficient at calibration where the validation ns was quite stable and did not go below 85 of the calibration ns i e arsenault and brissette 2014 in fig 1 a the donor catchment of each region is highlighted with a square we transferred the parameter set of the designated donor catchment to any of the catchments located in the same region of homogeneous climate and flow characteristics recipient catchments any ungauged catchment located in the same region uses the same parameter set to predict the flow data bock et al 2015 past studies demonstrated that using the parameter set of the catchment with the highest ns helped to attain better efficiency from the parameter transfer than transferring the median parameter set of multiple donor catchments i e kim and kaluarachchi 2008 masih et al 2010 oudin et al 2008 evaluations of the predictive performance from trans in use the recipient catchments assuming they are ungauged at individual catchments the performance evaluation assesses the ns pbias predictions of the flow duration curve fdc and the mean monthly hydrograph mmh besides we assess the median percent error of several flow percentiles of the fdc high and low flow percentiles for a more in depth evaluation 4 6 parameter transfer irrespective of the homogeneous regions trans out trans out takes into account all of the heterogeneities in the eastern united states i e catchment energy conditions landscape properties predominant runoff generation mechanism storm characteristics trans out is not a regionalization scheme for pub instead it is used to assess the gain in efficiency from trans in our assessment of the gain in performance from the regionalization through comparisons of trans in with trans out used the same performance measures we noted above ns pbias mmh and fdc in trans out one donor catchment was used to parameterize all catchments for all the regions the donor catchment had the highest ns among all 73 catchments given that trans in employs the catchment with best ns in each of the four regions thus the single best catchment across all regions is one of the four designated catchments for trans in this catchment coincides with the donor catchment of trans in in c1 therefore trans out is not applicable for c1 trans out is a parameter transfer that includes all types of heterogeneities therefore comparisons of trans in with trans out also reveal the extent at which the transferred parameters in trans in are representative of the catchments conditions particularly when trans in and trans out have comparable efficiency this comparison therefore indicates the limitations of the parameter transferability within the homogeneous regions trans in 4 7 interpretation of sac sma parameters transferability we interpret quantitatively the performance from the parameter transfer trans in and trans out in order to determine the representativeness of transferred parameters to catchments conditions in each region first we use the catchment descriptors climate soil properties and elevation and their measures of variation inter quantile variation to explain the satisfactory lack of efficiency of trans in in comparison with trans out in each region the catchment descriptors we employ are the ai the mean elevation and the soil hydrologic properties hgc low infiltration rates hgb medium infiltration rates hga very large infiltration rates see wood and blackburn 1984 second we analyze the correlation of these descriptors with the latitude soil hydrologic properties and the mean elevation ai in order to further understand the geographical extent of the variation and therefore deduce the effect on the parameter transferability furthermore we complement our interpretations of the parameter transferability with analysis of the predominant runoff generation mechanism in each catchment using the topographic index ti distribution the prevalent runoff generation mechanism is indicative of the runoff processes this information is supplementary to explain the representativeness of the transferred parameters in each region from the perspective of runoff processes in the following we explain our approach to calculate the ti distribution at catchment site ti represents the propensity of a point within a catchment to generate saturation excess overland flow beven and kirkby 1979 due to a topographic control on surface and subsurface flows rice and hornberger 1998 ti was first defined by beven and kirkby 1979 as follows 1 ti ln a tan β where ti is the topographic index of a point pixel within a watershed a is the specific upslope area per unit contour length β is the local topographic slope angle acting at the point in this study ti was calculated at the pixel level using a dem of 30 m resolution and algorithms necessary for the determination of specific upslope area a and the local slope angle β rousseau et al 2005 hentati et al 2010 the ti calculation uses the properties of the stream network namely the flow directions and the flow accumulation which both help to identify the riparian zone see hentati et al 2010 the frequency of ti distribution was then determined for each catchment after classification of ti pixel values the differences in the ti frequency distribution at the catchment scale illustrates the wide differences in topographic properties between study catchments and consequently the effect of topography on the flow response according to beven and kirkby 1979 and beven and wood 1983 large values of ti in the tails of the distribution indicate the likelihood of runoff being generated by saturation excess overland flow whereas smaller values in the tails hint to predominant subsurface processes in the runoff generation the flow response depends also on the soil infiltration properties price 2011 ameli et al 2015 therefore our analyses of the runoff generation mechanism using ti serve to reveal the predominant mechanism that is likely to take place as a direct response to topography while we acknowledge the effect of other factors i e soil infiltration rate and permeability on the flow response we use the spatial pattern of the soil hydrologic properties as indicative of the soil infiltration rates and permeability wood and blackburn 1984 5 results and discussion 5 1 performance of parameter transferability and a priori parameters we represent the calibrated parameters values of the donor catchment in each region in table 2 see appendix we used these calibrated parameters to conduct trans in in each region trans in outperformed the prediction from trans out for all of the homogeneous regions except in c3 the improvements are mainly a higher median ns and or less biased predictions with lower variation see the values of ns and pbias with their respective variation listed in parentheses in table 3 on the other hand trans in outperformed the apriori with a particularly higher efficiency and or less biased predictions except for c3 table 3 below we present the performance results for c1 and c5 followed by c2 and c3 the former two regions exhibited the highest performance in trans in in c1 trans in outperformed the apriori and led to predictions with higher median efficiency and limited bias small median pbias in table 3 the mmh and the fdc of a typical catchment exhibited a good fit of trans in and apriori with the observed flow fig 3 a however the median percent error of the fdc at several percentiles exhibited larger errors for apriori particularly for the low and large flow percentiles fig 4 a in c5 trans in outperformed trans out the gain in performance due to trans in is mainly higher ns and less biased predictions table 3 the mmh from the typical catchment did not exhibit a difference in performance between trans in and trans out and the observed mmh fig 3 b however the fdc from trans in at the typical catchment had a better fit than the fdc from trans out fig 3 b the median percent errors of the fdc in trans out were larger for all of the flow percentiles compared with trans in particularly until the 75th percentile the apriori remained less efficient and more biased see the large values of pbias with larger variation listed in table 3 the mmh predicted by apriori in a typical catchment underestimates the large flows compared with the observed mmh and the one predicted from trans in fig 3 b the predicted fdc from apriori in the same typical catchment deviates at the upper and lower tails from the observed fdc and from the fdc predicted using trans in fig 3 b the median percent errors of the fdc are larger than those obtained from trans in in most of the percentiles fig 4 b in c2 and c3 the predictions from trans in were either of limited bias compared with those of trans out c2 or were outperformed by those of trans out c3 below we present the performance of parameter transferability in both regions that we compare with apriori in c2 located in the northeastern us the improvement of trans in compared with trans out see the less biased predictions listed in table 2 was not visible from the typical mmh fig 3 c contrarily in the typical fdc the fdc from trans out deviated from the observed fdc at the upper and the lower tails fig 3 c the limited bias of trans in led to smaller median percent errors of the fdc than trans out fig 4 c apriori was less efficient and more biased than trans in but slightly more efficient than trans out table 3 these findings are clear in the predictions of fdcs and values of the median percent errors fig 3 c and 4 c respectively we noted more errors in the fdc predictions with apriori than with trans in these results highlight that a priori parameters are less representative of the catchment conditions in c2 than the transferred parameters by trans in in c3 contrarily to previous regions trans out outperformed trans in and apriori higher median ns and lower pbias of smaller variation during the calibration and validation periods table 3 trans in and apriori had similar performance in c3 table 3 the differences in the efficiency were not visible based on the typical mmh and the typical fdc all predicted fdcs deviated from observed fdcs at the lower tail fig 3 d however the median percent errors of the fdc revealed the differences in efficiency between trans in trans out and apriori the larger efficiency of tran out yielded better predictions than trans in and apriori mainly medium flows of the fdc particularly between 30 and 70 of the exceedance probability and was comparable to trans in and apriori at low and high flow percentiles fig 4 d 5 2 evaluation interpretation and discussion of parameter transferability and a priori parameters below we interpret and discuss the performance results for c1 and c5 followed by c2 and c3 the good performance of trans in in c1 indicates that the transferred parameters are representative of the catchments conditions in this region most of the catchments are at low elevation and a few are located in appalachian mountains fig 1 a and 4 we found that ai was statistically correlated with the mean elevation r2 0 33 p value 0 0001 this relation is mainly explained by the pet decrease with elevation as found in swift et al 1988 the change in ai with elevation was not large according to the small inter quantile range and the median value fig 1 c in c1 the catchments have similar energy conditions and are mostly water limited the energy conditions are important for flow predictions as pet is one of the inputs in sac sma model parameters transfer between catchments of similar energy conditions has a large effect on trans in efficiency we note that most of soils in c1 are well drained mainly hgb with some proportions of hgc figs 6 and 7 b and c a saturation excess overland flow dominates in majority of catchments fig 8 the subsurface storm flow is prevalent in few catchments at high elevations all of which helps to explain the satisfactory prediction from trans in in c1 in conditions of predominant saturation excess overland flow the large infiltration rates lead to an increase in the groundwater level which enhances the groundwater contribution mainly the surface flow from the saturated areas and base flow the saturated surface flow and base flow are both determined by the groundwater level huang et al 2016 in the few catchments where subsurface storm flow is dominant and soils are well drained the groundwater contribution is also important as a result of recharge in the vadose zone according to isotope hydrology in steep terrain with conductive soils the new infiltrating water pushes the old subsurface runoff to induce stream flow in the channel i e buttle 1994 this understanding demonstrates that groundwater contribution is important in catchments of c1 and is consistent with the base flow index bfi being large in this region sawicz et al 2011 the similarity in the groundwater effect between catchments further explains the efficiency from trans in and supports the claim that transferred parameters are representative of catchment conditions in c1 considering the smaller efficiency of apriori we suggest that the soil derived values of the a priori parameters are less representative of the catchments conditions in c1 than the regionalization approach the catchments in c5 are all located at low elevations with the exception of one catchment of higher elevation see the outlier in fig 5 and refer to the digital elevation model shown in fig 1 a provided that ai is correlated to mean elevations p value 0 0001 there is homogeneity in the energy conditions where all c5 catchments are water limited with a very small inter quantile range of ai fig 1 c only one catchment is energy limited see the outlier in fig 1 c saturated excess overland flow is prevalent in c5 catchments of well drained soils hgb soil proportions are dominant compared with hgc except in one catchment figs 6 and 6 a b likewise the catchments in c1 these characteristics of runoff processes and soil enhance the groundwater contribution and are consistent with bfi being the largest larger than in c1 and the flow being the most mitigated the smallest slope of the fdc as stated in sawicz et al 2011 the catchments conditions and predominant runoff generation mechanism explained the large efficiency of trans in not affected by the presence of one outlier visible in figs 1 c and 7 c transferring parameters from an outsider catchment trans out the catchment belong to c1 leads to poor efficiency in the predictions due to differences between c1 and c5 although the donor catchment in trans out is the closest to c5 fig 1 a the catchments in c5 have i the shortest duration of storms ii the most stringent water limited conditions fig 1 c iii the lowest elevations fig 5 and iv the smallest hgc proportions fig 7 c in conditions of the predominant saturation excess these attributes generate flows with characteristics different from those of c1 it has been shown that climate factors interact with the runoff generation mechanism and influence the runoff response where for instance the semi arid conditions fosters the dominance of infiltration excess surface runoff huang et al 2016 in c2 the less biased predictions from trans in and the lack of efficiency of trans out are pertinent and reveals the extent to which the catchments are hydrologically similar and the transferred parameter by trans in are representative of catchments conditions the catchments properties in c2 and their differences from c1 explain the gain in performance associated with trans in compared with trans out in c2 most of the catchments are energy limited except two outliers with a small range of variation compared with c1 fig 1 c hence c2 have homogeneous energy conditions with lower median ai than in c1 there is a very small range of variation in the value of snow day ratio sdr in c2 fig 1 b which further illustrates the homogeneity in climate and its effect on runoff response and subsequently on trans in efficiency the sdr although it is small in c2 median 25 is influential on the runoff response singh and xu 1997 ye et al 2012 in this region of the northeast the soils are mostly poorly drained the hgc proportions are the largest figs 6 a and 7 c the runoff generation mechanism in c2 is mainly dominated by saturation excess fig 8 very few catchments belong to the middle category of the ti fig 8 where saturation excess and the subsurface storm flow are equivalent in their effect on the flow response beven and kirkby 1979 beven and wood 1983 therefore the interaction of the homogeneous climate soil and energy characteristics with the runoff generation mechanism primarily saturation excess fosters the hydrologic similarity between catchments and explains the efficient performance of trans in an example of interaction between climate landscape properties and runoff generation mechanism is presented in bronstert et al 2002 the differences between c1 and c2 lead to differences in the flow response the catchments in c2 have steeper slope of the fdcs than those in c1 see sawicz et al 2011 and the lack of efficiency of trans out further demonstrates that parameters of one donor catchment with best predictions are representative of catchments conditions in c2 in c3 the poor efficiency of trans in compared with trans out indicates some level of heterogeneity and explains the lower performance of the parameter regionalization trans in in c3 although the catchments are energy limited low pet the ai is characterized by large variations and a large inter quantile range suggesting that the catchments have heterogeneous energy conditions fig 1 c there are catchments that are more energy limited low pet and others that are more water limited high pet the pet is one of the inputs into the sac sma model hence the transfer of parameters that are calibrated in different conditions of energy and water does not help to attain high efficiency all catchments in c3 are forested table 1 and mountainous with higher elevations than other regions figs 1 a and 5 there is also large variation in the mean elevation among catchments fig 5 the soils are poorly drained fig 6 with the lowest proportions of hgb fig 7 b and among the highest proportions of hgc fig 7 c according to the ti analysis subsurface storm flow dominates in c3 fig 8 the disparity in the mean elevation likely leads to differences in the response provided that the hydraulic gradient is proportional to the topographic gradient in mountainous catchments butt et al 2001 moreover in similar conditions of runoff generation mechanism and within forested mountainous catchments there is a likelihood of preferential flow mcdonnell et al 2007 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 the dominant subsurface storm flow and the non uniformity of the soil porosity with depth are among the factors that result in preferential flow the non uniformity in the soil porosity is related to the macropores resulting from the decayed living roots and from the biological activity that fosters preferential pathways in the subsurface zone bonell 1993 in all of the forested mountainous catchments dominated by subsurface storm flow from other regions c1 and c2 lateral preferential flow is likely however likelihood of such flow is even higher in c3 because i the physiography is more complex i e it has the steepest topography the highest elevation the lowest proportion of hgb and ii the hga soils characterized by very large infiltration rates have the largest proportions with the largest inter quantile range figs 6 and 7 d consequently non uniformity in the porosity and the preferential pathways is more probable in c3 which results in a more pronounced effect of preferential flow and further explains the low performance from trans in current physically based and conceptual models including sac sma often ignore the effect of preferential flow weiler and mcdonnell 2007 therefore we recognize its effect as a source of uncertainty in other predictions from c3 apriori trans out in ideal conditions where the preferential flow is simulated by the model structure the parameter transfer within c3 trans in will not lead to high performance because i of the same reasons noted above related to the disparity in the catchment conditions and ii the nature of preferential flow being specific to characteristics of each catchment the density of preferential pathways changes as a resultof soil texture porosity the root zone density and the density of decayed living roots brammer and mcdonnell 1996 bronstert 1999 mcdonnell et al 2007 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 additional research is necessary to properly simulate lateral preferential flow and investigate techniques to measure the differences similarities in the effects of this peculiar flow between catchments in the same region the relatively better performance of trans out in c3 only for medium flow percentiles might refer to the outsider donor catchment located in c1 being spatially close to catchments in c3 where dominant runoff generation mechanisms are the same the subsurface stormflow dominates the donor catchment of trans out and the catchments in c3 figs 1 and 8 the results from trans out and the likelihood of preferential flow indicate limitations of the parameter regionalization and suggest the need for other measures of similarity to relocate the catchments in c3 we propose adding other characteristics in the regionalization to assess the effect of preferential flow that can be complemented by physically based measures of soil characteristics i e porosity permeability and other measures related to pet i e ai in order to reduce the heterogeneity in energy conditions improving the efficiency from the parameter regionalization in regions of very complex landscape properties is a research venue that requires in depth investigations in the eastern united states the spatial pattern of soils led us to notice that hgc proportions are correlated with the latitude this relation is statistically significant r2 0 47 r 0 68 p value 0 001 the latitude explains 47 of the hgc variation in the eastern united states it is difficult to conjecture the reasons for this tight correlation but the geology structure that interacts with the topography and climate agents i e storm characteristics may be the potential factors the climate and soil hydrologic properties hgc proportions are correlated with latitude in eastern us and both contribute to the flow response wagener et al 2007 they can be used to identify the homogeneous regions however the performance from the parameter transfer would probably not be as efficient as the parameter regionalization approach investigated in the current study the climate and the physical descriptors do not capture the effect of interaction between all factors contributing to the flow response i e climate soil texture runoff generation mechanism groundwater porosity preferential pathways troch et al 2013 note that a previous regional study by oudin et al 2010b demonstrated that only 60 of the hydrologically similar catchments are physically similar the overlap was statistically significant in 40 of the catchments classified based on physical similarity the parameters are not transferable this finding supports our claim of using catchments characteristics that capture the interaction between all factors contributing to the flow response in the regionalization scheme we conjecture that the more the effect of interaction is captured the more efficient are the predictions from the parameter transfer our study demonstrates that when mmhs do not exhibit differences between several predictions the fdcs have diverse shapes according to analyses of the median percent error in each simulation consequently two main facts emerge concerning fdc use i it reveals the bias effect on flow simulation inaccuracy and ii it is advantageous for a more reliable parameter transfer assessment which is urgently needed for accurate pub several past pub studies have regarded fdc as a fundamental daily stream flow statistic archfield et al 2013 for example kapangaziwiri et al 2009 2012 analyzed fdcs to assess predictions from parameter regionalization masih et al 2010 delineated regions of homogenous hydrologic behavior based on similarity of the fdc farmer et al 2014 used the fdc of gauged basins to predict flow percentiles in ungauged basins using nonlinear spatial interpolations we therefore suggest using the fdc to better assess pub in combination with the efficiency measures of ns and pbias our assessments using fdc suggest giving new paradigms in the evaluation of model prediction a try the use of summary metrics involving measures of the fdc i e slope of the fdc rising limb density declining limb density in sadegh et al 2015 and vrugt and sadegh 2013 showed great promises for prediction evaluations it ensured that simulated response depicts accurately the observed flow behaviors this finding is consistent with our results fdc being more efficient in prediction evaluation than mmh and classic residual based metrics the problem resides in the convoluted error residuals of the observed and the simulated time series according to sadegh et al 2015 the summary metrics have the advantage to be relatively insensitive to forcing data errors which is particularly desirable in the context of non stationarity the summary metrics therefore avoid proclaiming non stationarity for the wrong reasons errors on the rainfall data sadegh et al 2015 5 2 1 which approach to use for pub the a priori parameters or the parameter regionalization in all the regions the comparisons of the efficiency from parameter transfer with apriori highlighted the uncertainty in using the a priori parameters to make pub compared to a parameter regionalization approach the lowest performance low median ns and high pbias from apriori was in c2 and c3 table 3 apriori was equivalent to trans in in c3 where trans in was the least efficient across the regions this finding does not allow to recommend the use of a priori parameters for pub slightly better predictions from apriori occurred in the catchments from c1 and c5 table 3 but never exceeded trans in this finding suggests that a priori parameters in c2 and c3 have among the highest uncertainty and are less representative of the catchments conditions the complex landscape properties of c3 and c2 i e the steepest topography with the finest soil texture suggests that the poor performance of apriori is related to the larger uncertainty in soil data interpolations from statsgo this uncertainty may relate to the lack of soil sampling in several regions with complex terrain koren et al 2003 more research is required to further analyze the uncertainty in the sac sma a priori parameters and their effect on flow predictions our findings suggests that it is better to use a parameter regionalization approach similar to what we present in this study for pub future research would consider comparing predictions from a priori parameters with predictions from other regionalization approaches i e regression spatial proximity similarity in physical properties to further evaluate the use of sac sma a priori parameters in predictions at ungauged catchments 5 3 comparisons with previous studies comparisons of the efficiency results with findings from other studies demonstrate that none of the catchments had predictions as poor and as biased as those reported by gan and burges 2006 these authors used the same model to investigate the parameter transferability over geographically distant mopex catchments these differences demonstrate the benefit of using hydrologically similar catchments for the parameter transfer our results outperform predictions from the spatial proximity which provided better predictions than the physical similarity in a study by oudin et al 2008 the median ns attained 0 77 in our study but it did not exceed 0 7 for spatial proximity and 0 69 for physical similarity in oudin et al 2008 in arsenault and brissette 2014 the efficiency of the physical similarity did not exceed 0 75 at individual catchments this efficiency is lower than the value of 0 85 the maximum we obtained in this study at individual catchments despite the limitations the effect of interaction which is captured by the climate and flow characteristics used in the regionalization explain the better performance we obtained compared with separate use of spatial proximity and physical similarity criteria note that oudin et al 2008 considered the spatial proximity and physical similarity as complementary and that the average of flow simulation from both approaches can be used to improve the prediction efficiency given the satisfactory performance we obtained in this study and the fact that homogeneous regions implicitly combine aspects of spatial proximity and physical similarity the proposition of oudin et al 2008 suggesting to combine predictions from two regionalization methods may represent a worth testing approach to investigate in future studies this so called multiregionalization scheme requires identification of a priori regionalization approaches to obtain the average of flow simulation leading to the best performance after combination oudin et al 2008 our prediction performance was consistent with other studies transferring the parameters between hydrologically similar catchments bock et al 2015 obtained a median ns of 0 76 from the parameter transfer within regions of similar parameter sensitivity the performance in individual catchments in our study exceeded the maximum value of 0 78 reported by masih et al 2010 who used the criterion of similarity in the fdc for parameter regionalization 6 conclusions this paper evaluated the performance from the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics subsequently it compared the performance from the parameter regionalization to the prediction efficiency from the soil derived a priori parameters that are designed to make predictions at ungauged catchments the study was conducted in the eastern us using 73 catchments we employed the sac sma model and the geographically contiguous regions determined by sawicz et al 2011 using climate and flow characteristics our results showed that parameter transfer within homogeneous regions reduced the bias and increased the predictions efficiency it reaches a median ns of 0 77 and a ns of 0 85 at individual catchments the use of the fdc was advantageous in revealing the effect of bias on the flow simulation inaccuracy the satisfactory efficiency from the transferred parameters within the homogeneous regions was fostered by the similarity in the effect of interaction between climate physiographic characteristics and predominant runoff generation mechanism the use of the flow characteristics in the regionalization helped to capture the similarity in the effect of interaction the transferred parameters within homogeneous regions outweighed in performance the soil derived a priori parameters therefore it is better to use a regionalization approach to make predictions at ungauged catchments in one region of very complex landscape properties i e forested mountainous catchments steepest topography higher fraction of the poorly drained soils and heterogeneous energy conditions the predictions from the a priori parameters had equivalent efficiency to those from transferred parameters within this region both had poor performance the use of the transferred parameters from an outsider donor catchment slightly improved the predictions i e more accurate predictions of the medium flow percentiles this finding underlined the limitations of the parameter regionalization that affected the efficiency from the parameter transfer the limitations of the approach are in part caused by differences in the energy conditions between the catchments of this specific region and the likelihood of lateral preferential flow that fostered the heterogeneity between the catchments in this region from this perspective there is a room to improve the parameter regionalization within similar conditions of the catchments where we propose to add other measures of similarity in the regionalization examples the aridity index and measures of the effect of preferential flow that can be supported by specific measures of soil characteristics i e porosity permeability expanding our study to larger datasets will have the potential to provide further insights on parameter regionalization using similarity in climate and flow characteristics more limitations of the parameter regionalization are related to the implications of climate variability and change on the homogeneity in each region and consequently on parameter transferability this limitation remains unexplored and it is recommended in future research related to parameter regionalization acknowledgements we thank the three anonymous reviewers

7328,the need for predictions of flow time series persists at ungauged catchments motivating the research goals of our study by means of the sacramento model this paper explores the use of parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics and makes comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters we assessed the performance using the nash sutcliffe ns bias mean monthly hydrograph and flow duration curve fdc the study was conducted on a large dataset of 73 catchments within the eastern us two approaches to the parameter transferability were developed and evaluated i the within homogeneous region parameter transfer using one donor catchment specific to each region ii the parameter transfer disregarding the geographical limits of homogeneous regions where one donor catchment was common to all regions comparisons between both parameter transfers enabled to assess the gain in performance from the parameter regionalization and its respective constraints and limitations the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions outperformed the a priori parameters and led to a decrease in bias and increase in efficiency reaching a median ns of 0 77 and a ns of 0 85 at individual catchments the use of fdc revealed the effect of bias on the inaccuracy of prediction from parameter transfer in one specific region of mountainous and forested catchments the prediction accuracy of the parameter transfer was less satisfactory and equivalent to a priori parameters in this region the parameter transfer from the outsider catchment provided the best performance less biased with smaller uncertainty in medium flow percentiles 40 60 the large disparity of energy conditions explained the lack of performance from parameter transfer in this region besides the subsurface stormflow is predominant and there is a likelihood of lateral preferential flow which according to its specific properties further explained the reduced efficiency testing the parameter transferability using criteria of similar climate and flow characteristics at ungauged catchments and comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters are a novelty the ultimate limitations of both approaches are recognized and recommendations are made for future research keywords parameter transfer ungauged catchments a priori parameters flow duration curve sacramento model 1 introduction estimates of stream flow are a prerequisite for solving a number of engineering and environmental problems i e water quality and supply flood control and stream habitat assessment kokkonen et al 2003 the accuracy of flow prediction in ungauged basins pub is a central issue in hydrological modeling arsenault and brissette 2014 ao et al 2006 sivapalan et al 2003 when no flow records of sufficient length are available at the site of interest regionalization techniques may be applied to derive such estimates kokkonen et al 2003 over the past decade different studies have developed techniques for pub primarily via flow regionalization and model parameterization hrachowitz et al 2013 gan and burges 2006 ren et al 2016 model parameterization in ungauged basins can be achieved using two primary approaches parameter regionalization anda priori parameters determined from catchment properties hrachowitz et al 2013 despite the plethora of studies devoted to this topic there is still no consensus regarding the most efficient approach for model parameterization in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 parajka et al 2013 razavi and couillibaly 2013 regionalization for pub involves the following steps i identification of homogeneous regions where several criteria of homogeneity can be used and ii data transfer observed flow data or calibrated parameters between gauged and ungauged catchments of the same homogenous region in parameter regionalization the rainfall runoff model is calibrated for all the study catchments with observed flows then using a regionalization method the parameters are transferred from the donor gauged catchments to the recipient ungauged catchments within the same region to examine the potential predictive performance at ungauged catchments the simulated flows from parameter transfer are compared with observed flows of recipient gauged catchments that play the role of ungauged catchments i e hundecha and bárdossy 2004 jennings et al 1994 kokkonen et al 2003 norbiato et al 2007 the three most common methods used for parameter regionalization are the regression based approach spatial proximity and physical similarity i e merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 sefton and howarth 1998 young 2006 the regression based approach correlates the calibrated model parameters with physical properties of gauged catchments the correlation is used to determine the model parameters in ungauged catchments merz and blöschl 2004 the spatial proximity approach consists of transferring parameters from neighboring catchments to the ungauged catchment the rationale being that catchments close to one other should have similar hydrologic behavior i e oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2007 in physical similarity approach the catchments with similar physical descriptors exhibit similar hydrologic behaviors i e mcintyre et al 2005 a common issue among the three regionalization approaches is less than satisfactory efficiency i e arsenault and brissette 2014 and a strong dependence on the complexity of the terrain and scale at which the relations are derived bock et al 2015 the model parameter definitions are by nature ambiguous and difficult to determine from a small number of descriptors i e physical and climatic characteristics zhang et al 2008 the lowest efficiency is obtained from the regression based approach the high correlation between model parameters and catchment descriptors does not guarantee efficient predictions kokkonen et al 2003 oudin et al 2010a sefton and howarth 1998 studies of spatial proximity and physical similarity have yielded no evidence of most efficient method i e oudin et al 2008 arsenault and brissette 2014 the spatial proximity has significant uncertainty due to a lack of representativeness of catchment data rainfall as well as issues of identifiability of model parameters skøien and blöschl 2007 more measures other than distances between catchments are needed to refine the predictions in physical similarity the homogeneity of physical descriptors does not necessarily translate into representativeness of model parameters and flow response zhang et al 2008 the most important component of parameter regionalization critical to obtaining satisfactory efficiency is the identification of the geographic extent to which there is homogeneity in hydroclimate characteristics and therefore similarity in hydrologic response bock et al 2015 only a few recent studies have tested parameter transferability within homogeneous regions of similar hydroclimate characteristics using this approach all catchments that are geographically located in the same homogeneous region received the same parameter set i e kim and kaluarachchi 2008 bock et al 2015 likewise for decades in flood regionalization flow data of gauged catchments determined the regional flood frequency distribution to predict floods at ungauged catchments of the same region i e farquharson et al 1992 mimikou and gordios 1989 portela and dias 2005 zrinji and burn 1994 it is worth mentioning that one of the explanatory variables of hydroclimate similarity is the spatial proximity sawicz et al 2011 due to the first order effects of climate and topography on hydrologic response smakhtin 2001 ali et al 2012 therefore similarity in hydroclimate characteristics combines to some extent criteria of spatial proximity and physical similarity but with more robust measures of similarity in hydrologic response in kim and kaluarachchi 2008 each sub basins of a large catchment 176 000 km2 was the spatial extent of similarity in hydroclimate characteristics and the region to conduct parameter transfer bock et al 2015 used flow data of gauged catchments to analyze model parameter sensitivity ps and geographically identify regions of similar ps that is indicative of similarity in model runoff processes all catchments of the same region received the same parameter set the approach yielded satisfactory efficiency of the mean monthly flow predictions bock et al 2015 additional research is needed to evaluate predictions of daily flow time series and provide alternatives to ps while meeting criteria of hydroclimate homogeneity in parameter regionalization the lack of consensus regarding the most efficient approach among the common parameter regionalization methods and the need for more in depth investigation of parameter transfer within homogenous regions of similar hydroclimate characteristics prompted the research goals of this study we investigate the parameter transferability of sacramento model sac sma in the eastern united states us using the geographically contiguous hydroclimatic regions determined by sawicz et al 2011 the homogeneous regions have the uniqueness of being identified based on criteria of similarity in climate and flow characteristics which adds to the novelty of our research in testing parameter transferability previous studies that tested parameter transferability of sac sma used either criteria of spatial proximity in few catchments from us koren et al 2003 or no specific criteria in few distant catchments gan and burges 2006 our primary objective was to quantify the gain in performance attained by the transfer of calibrated parameters from gauged catchments within homogeneous regions trans in relative to 1 model parameterized with a priori parameters derived from soil properties apriori and 2 model parameterized with transferred parameters from a single best performing catchment in the study area trans out we hypothesize that similarity in hydroclimate conditions will improve the efficiency of parameter transferability within homogeneous regions trans in relative to apriori and trans out trans out is not meant to represent a regionalization scheme for pub but instead aids to measure the gain in performance and reveal limitations of trans in the comparison between trans in and apriori will identify the catchments conditions where predictions from a priori parameters are better worse than predictions from the regionalization approach we are unaware of other studies that make similar comparisons our goal is to provide insights into the usage of the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions and the a priori parameters for pub in the u s and elsewhere 2 study area and dataset a total of 73 catchments from the eastern us were used in this study the catchments range in size from 67 km2 to 8052 km2 20 of the catchments have sizes above 4000 km2 the climate in the study region is mainly humid coopersmith et al 2012 perennial snow cover is absent for most catchments and does not exceed 3 of the surface area for individual catchments berghuijs et al 2014 time series data of daily streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet for all catchments were provided by mopex project duan et al 2006 the data are freely available and were retrieved from the following website www nws noaa gov oh mopex mo datasets htm the flows within this dataset are based on observed data collected by the united states geological survey usgs precipitation is determined by means of weighted averaging using rain gage measurements and prism data schaake et al 2006 the mean areal precipitation estimates result in limited errors

data schaake et al 2006 the modified hamon algorithm helped in calculations of the daily pet under the mopex project dingman 2002 sawicz et al 2011 the mopex catchments are minimally impacted by the human influence 3 the homogeneous regions in the study area and their specific characteristics over the last decade pub studies have worked to identify appropriate schemes for homogeneous regions hrachowitz et al 2013 according to wagener et al 2007 the homogeneous regions should be physically meaningful and provide a means to assess the dominant controls on the streamflow patterns mcdonnell and woods 2004 we used the homogeneous regions identified by sawicz et al 2011 that have the ultimate goal of facilitating the predictions at ungauged catchments fig 1 a the homogeneous regions are geographically contiguous and have been identified using six characteristics the streamflow elasticity to precipitation snow day ratio sdr the number of days per year where the precipitation is falling as snow the baseflow index runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve fdc and the slope of the hydrograph rising limb the streamflow elasticity to precipitation and the climate were the most influential in the regionalization followed by the runoff ratio and the slope of the flow duration curve sawicz et al 2011 the regionalization using the six characteristics employed the method of partitioning algorithm by kennard et al 2010 as mentioned in the introduction section the novelty in sawicz et al 2011 is not in the characteristics themselves but in their combination to determine the homogeneous regions and therefore quantify the hydrologic similarity between the catchments we maintain the same regions notations as in sawicz et al 2011 c1 c2 c3 c5 fig 1 a the sdr is generally

wetlands are small in all the regions table 1 4 methods 4 1 overview our overall methodology included the following steps detailed below and summarized in the flowchart of fig 2 step 1 performed model simulations for all catchments using a priori parameters apriori calculated fit statistics for the two periods we used for calibration and validation of sac sma model step 2 calibrated the sac sma model to optimize model performance for each catchment step 3 identified calibrated catchment with best performance in each region to be used as donor catchments for a parameter transfer scheme trans in step 4 performed model simulations using parameter transfer scheme trans in calculated fit statistics during calibration and validation period step 5 performed model simulations using parameters from the single best performing catchment for all catchments irrespective of regions trans out calculated fit statistics during calibration and validation period step 6 compared model performance for the parameter transfer scheme trans in to both apriori and trans out simulations interpret sac sma parameters transferability with respect to catchment characteristics 4 2 the sac sma model the sac sma model has been applied worldwide particularly in the different hydroclimate regimes of the united states koren et al 2003 this model of thirteen parameters all cited in the appendix with their respective physical meaning allows for detailed flow simulations dealing with runoff components i e the direct runoff surface runoff interflow and baseflow werkhoven et al 2008 the sac sma conceptual model has a two soil layer structure werkhoven et al 2008 each layer is made of tension and free water storages that interact to simulate the soil moisture and the runoff components koren et al 2000 2003 the tension water storages simulate the evapotranspiration et the daily average pet from mopex data in addition to the daily precipitation are the inputs necessary for the flow simulations 4 3 model simulation with a priori parameters the a priori parameters are determined from physical and empirical equations where the variables are mostly soil derived koren et al 2003 the soil derived variables used in the physical and empirical equations of the a priori parameters are determined from the soil map of the state soil geographic database statsgo of 1 1 km grid the soil map of this fine resolution was constructed via interpolations of the data obtained by soil sampling in some regions the soil sampling is done over large areas once in 100 to 200 km2 koren et al 2003 the statsgo provides at each grid estimates of θwlt the water content at wilting point θs the water content at saturation θfld the water content at field capacity and ks the hydraulic conductivity at saturation these variables determines the a priori values of the parameters simulating the runoff processes in the upper layer subsurface flow and the lower layer of sac sma baseflow duan et al 2001 koren et al 2003 the a priori parameters are available in mopex dataset and are designed to serve as an estimation technique for ungauged catchments koren et al 2003 young 2006 we evaluate the performance of the predictions from a priori parameters apriori using nash sutcliffe ns coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias mean monthly hydrograph mmh and the flow duration curve fdc we compare apriori to trans in this comparison is fair as both approaches are designed to make pub 4 4 model calibration we calibrated the thirteen sac sma model parameters using the shuffle complex algorithm sce ua with 10 000 iterations sorooshian et al 1993 this algorithm is extensively used for sac sma calibration to achieve different research goals such as studying model parameter transferability i e gan and burges 2006 and building a large database for the continental united states i e newman et al 2015 similar to gan and burges 2006 and koren et al 2003 we constrained the calibration to the a priori value of each parameter that is available in mopex this approach is termed constrained calibration strategy gan and burges 2006 koren et al 2003 and it helps to maintain physical consistency and to reduce equifinality we set 35 as the range of deviations allowed from the a priori parameters this range is larger than the range used in koren et al 2003 i e 25 we set this interval to allow for more variability around the default parameters and in the parameters space which is used by the sce ua algorithm to find the global optimum in this study the sample of catchments have limited effect of snow therefore we did not need to use the snow module of the sac sma model we calibrated sac sma for each catchment over 15 years january 1948 december 1963 subsequently we tested the model performance over an independent validation period of 36 years january 1964 december 1999 the calibration adjusted model parameters to best match the daily simulated flows to the daily observed flows using an objective function that minimized the rmse root mean square error we assessed the model performance using the ns coefficient and the pbias in mean flow moriasi et al 2007 4 5 parameter transfer within homogeneous regions trans in we investigated and evaluated a parameter regionalization scheme trans in to transfer parameter values from gauged to ungauged catchments within homogeneous regions for predictions of daily flow time series using sac sma model in trans in we designated one single donor catchment after conducting the sac sma model calibration we determined the catchment in each region with the highest ns coefficient at calibration where the validation ns was quite stable and did not go below 85 of the calibration ns i e arsenault and brissette 2014 in fig 1 a the donor catchment of each region is highlighted with a square we transferred the parameter set of the designated donor catchment to any of the catchments located in the same region of homogeneous climate and flow characteristics recipient catchments any ungauged catchment located in the same region uses the same parameter set to predict the flow data bock et al 2015 past studies demonstrated that using the parameter set of the catchment with the highest ns helped to attain better efficiency from the parameter transfer than transferring the median parameter set of multiple donor catchments i e kim and kaluarachchi 2008 masih et al 2010 oudin et al 2008 evaluations of the predictive performance from trans in use the recipient catchments assuming they are ungauged at individual catchments the performance evaluation assesses the ns pbias predictions of the flow duration curve fdc and the mean monthly hydrograph mmh besides we assess the median percent error of several flow percentiles of the fdc high and low flow percentiles for a more in depth evaluation 4 6 parameter transfer irrespective of the homogeneous regions trans out trans out takes into account all of the heterogeneities in the eastern united states i e catchment energy conditions landscape properties predominant runoff generation mechanism storm characteristics trans out is not a regionalization scheme for pub instead it is used to assess the gain in efficiency from trans in our assessment of the gain in performance from the regionalization through comparisons of trans in with trans out used the same performance measures we noted above ns pbias mmh and fdc in trans out one donor catchment was used to parameterize all catchments for all the regions the donor catchment had the highest ns among all 73 catchments given that trans in employs the catchment with best ns in each of the four regions thus the single best catchment across all regions is one of the four designated catchments for trans in this catchment coincides with the donor catchment of trans in in c1 therefore trans out is not applicable for c1 trans out is a parameter transfer that includes all types of heterogeneities therefore comparisons of trans in with trans out also reveal the extent at which the transferred parameters in trans in are representative of the catchments conditions particularly when trans in and trans out have comparable efficiency this comparison therefore indicates the limitations of the parameter transferability within the homogeneous regions trans in 4 7 interpretation of sac sma parameters transferability we interpret quantitatively the performance from the parameter transfer trans in and trans out in order to determine the representativeness of transferred parameters to catchments conditions in each region first we use the catchment descriptors climate soil properties and elevation and their measures of variation inter quantile variation to explain the satisfactory lack of efficiency of trans in in comparison with trans out in each region the catchment descriptors we employ are the ai the mean elevation and the soil hydrologic properties hgc low infiltration rates hgb medium infiltration rates hga very large infiltration rates see wood and blackburn 1984 second we analyze the correlation of these descriptors with the latitude soil hydrologic properties and the mean elevation ai in order to further understand the geographical extent of the variation and therefore deduce the effect on the parameter transferability furthermore we complement our interpretations of the parameter transferability with analysis of the predominant runoff generation mechanism in each catchment using the topographic index ti distribution the prevalent runoff generation mechanism is indicative of the runoff processes this information is supplementary to explain the representativeness of the transferred parameters in each region from the perspective of runoff processes in the following we explain our approach to calculate the ti distribution at catchment site ti represents the propensity of a point within a catchment to generate saturation excess overland flow beven and kirkby 1979 due to a topographic control on surface and subsurface flows rice and hornberger 1998 ti was first defined by beven and kirkby 1979 as follows 1 ti ln a tan β where ti is the topographic index of a point pixel within a watershed a is the specific upslope area per unit contour length β is the local topographic slope angle acting at the point in this study ti was calculated at the pixel level using a dem of 30 m resolution and algorithms necessary for the determination of specific upslope area a and the local slope angle β rousseau et al 2005 hentati et al 2010 the ti calculation uses the properties of the stream network namely the flow directions and the flow accumulation which both help to identify the riparian zone see hentati et al 2010 the frequency of ti distribution was then determined for each catchment after classification of ti pixel values the differences in the ti frequency distribution at the catchment scale illustrates the wide differences in topographic properties between study catchments and consequently the effect of topography on the flow response according to beven and kirkby 1979 and beven and wood 1983 large values of ti in the tails of the distribution indicate the likelihood of runoff being generated by saturation excess overland flow whereas smaller values in the tails hint to predominant subsurface processes in the runoff generation the flow response depends also on the soil infiltration properties price 2011 ameli et al 2015 therefore our analyses of the runoff generation mechanism using ti serve to reveal the predominant mechanism that is likely to take place as a direct response to topography while we acknowledge the effect of other factors i e soil infiltration rate and permeability on the flow response we use the spatial pattern of the soil hydrologic properties as indicative of the soil infiltration rates and permeability wood and blackburn 1984 5 results and discussion 5 1 performance of parameter transferability and a priori parameters we represent the calibrated parameters values of the donor catchment in each region in table 2 see appendix we used these calibrated parameters to conduct trans in in each region trans in outperformed the prediction from trans out for all of the homogeneous regions except in c3 the improvements are mainly a higher median ns and or less biased predictions with lower variation see the values of ns and pbias with their respective variation listed in parentheses in table 3 on the other hand trans in outperformed the apriori with a particularly higher efficiency and or less biased predictions except for c3 table 3 below we present the performance results for c1 and c5 followed by c2 and c3 the former two regions exhibited the highest performance in trans in in c1 trans in outperformed the apriori and led to predictions with higher median efficiency and limited bias small median pbias in table 3 the mmh and the fdc of a typical catchment exhibited a good fit of trans in and apriori with the observed flow fig 3 a however the median percent error of the fdc at several percentiles exhibited larger errors for apriori particularly for the low and large flow percentiles fig 4 a in c5 trans in outperformed trans out the gain in performance due to trans in is mainly higher ns and less biased predictions table 3 the mmh from the typical catchment did not exhibit a difference in performance between trans in and trans out and the observed mmh fig 3 b however the fdc from trans in at the typical catchment had a better fit than the fdc from trans out fig 3 b the median percent errors of the fdc in trans out were larger for all of the flow percentiles compared with trans in particularly until the 75th percentile the apriori remained less efficient and more biased see the large values of pbias with larger variation listed in table 3 the mmh predicted by apriori in a typical catchment underestimates the large flows compared with the observed mmh and the one predicted from trans in fig 3 b the predicted fdc from apriori in the same typical catchment deviates at the upper and lower tails from the observed fdc and from the fdc predicted using trans in fig 3 b the median percent errors of the fdc are larger than those obtained from trans in in most of the percentiles fig 4 b in c2 and c3 the predictions from trans in were either of limited bias compared with those of trans out c2 or were outperformed by those of trans out c3 below we present the performance of parameter transferability in both regions that we compare with apriori in c2 located in the northeastern us the improvement of trans in compared with trans out see the less biased predictions listed in table 2 was not visible from the typical mmh fig 3 c contrarily in the typical fdc the fdc from trans out deviated from the observed fdc at the upper and the lower tails fig 3 c the limited bias of trans in led to smaller median percent errors of the fdc than trans out fig 4 c apriori was less efficient and more biased than trans in but slightly more efficient than trans out table 3 these findings are clear in the predictions of fdcs and values of the median percent errors fig 3 c and 4 c respectively we noted more errors in the fdc predictions with apriori than with trans in these results highlight that a priori parameters are less representative of the catchment conditions in c2 than the transferred parameters by trans in in c3 contrarily to previous regions trans out outperformed trans in and apriori higher median ns and lower pbias of smaller variation during the calibration and validation periods table 3 trans in and apriori had similar performance in c3 table 3 the differences in the efficiency were not visible based on the typical mmh and the typical fdc all predicted fdcs deviated from observed fdcs at the lower tail fig 3 d however the median percent errors of the fdc revealed the differences in efficiency between trans in trans out and apriori the larger efficiency of tran out yielded better predictions than trans in and apriori mainly medium flows of the fdc particularly between 30 and 70 of the exceedance probability and was comparable to trans in and apriori at low and high flow percentiles fig 4 d 5 2 evaluation interpretation and discussion of parameter transferability and a priori parameters below we interpret and discuss the performance results for c1 and c5 followed by c2 and c3 the good performance of trans in in c1 indicates that the transferred parameters are representative of the catchments conditions in this region most of the catchments are at low elevation and a few are located in appalachian mountains fig 1 a and 4 we found that ai was statistically correlated with the mean elevation r2 0 33 p value 0 0001 this relation is mainly explained by the pet decrease with elevation as found in swift et al 1988 the change in ai with elevation was not large according to the small inter quantile range and the median value fig 1 c in c1 the catchments have similar energy conditions and are mostly water limited the energy conditions are important for flow predictions as pet is one of the inputs in sac sma model parameters transfer between catchments of similar energy conditions has a large effect on trans in efficiency we note that most of soils in c1 are well drained mainly hgb with some proportions of hgc figs 6 and 7 b and c a saturation excess overland flow dominates in majority of catchments fig 8 the subsurface storm flow is prevalent in few catchments at high elevations all of which helps to explain the satisfactory prediction from trans in in c1 in conditions of predominant saturation excess overland flow the large infiltration rates lead to an increase in the groundwater level which enhances the groundwater contribution mainly the surface flow from the saturated areas and base flow the saturated surface flow and base flow are both determined by the groundwater level huang et al 2016 in the few catchments where subsurface storm flow is dominant and soils are well drained the groundwater contribution is also important as a result of recharge in the vadose zone according to isotope hydrology in steep terrain with conductive soils the new infiltrating water pushes the old subsurface runoff to induce stream flow in the channel i e buttle 1994 this understanding demonstrates that groundwater contribution is important in catchments of c1 and is consistent with the base flow index bfi being large in this region sawicz et al 2011 the similarity in the groundwater effect between catchments further explains the efficiency from trans in and supports the claim that transferred parameters are representative of catchment conditions in c1 considering the smaller efficiency of apriori we suggest that the soil derived values of the a priori parameters are less representative of the catchments conditions in c1 than the regionalization approach the catchments in c5 are all located at low elevations with the exception of one catchment of higher elevation see the outlier in fig 5 and refer to the digital elevation model shown in fig 1 a provided that ai is correlated to mean elevations p value 0 0001 there is homogeneity in the energy conditions where all c5 catchments are water limited with a very small inter quantile range of ai fig 1 c only one catchment is energy limited see the outlier in fig 1 c saturated excess overland flow is prevalent in c5 catchments of well drained soils hgb soil proportions are dominant compared with hgc except in one catchment figs 6 and 6 a b likewise the catchments in c1 these characteristics of runoff processes and soil enhance the groundwater contribution and are consistent with bfi being the largest larger than in c1 and the flow being the most mitigated the smallest slope of the fdc as stated in sawicz et al 2011 the catchments conditions and predominant runoff generation mechanism explained the large efficiency of trans in not affected by the presence of one outlier visible in figs 1 c and 7 c transferring parameters from an outsider catchment trans out the catchment belong to c1 leads to poor efficiency in the predictions due to differences between c1 and c5 although the donor catchment in trans out is the closest to c5 fig 1 a the catchments in c5 have i the shortest duration of storms ii the most stringent water limited conditions fig 1 c iii the lowest elevations fig 5 and iv the smallest hgc proportions fig 7 c in conditions of the predominant saturation excess these attributes generate flows with characteristics different from those of c1 it has been shown that climate factors interact with the runoff generation mechanism and influence the runoff response where for instance the semi arid conditions fosters the dominance of infiltration excess surface runoff huang et al 2016 in c2 the less biased predictions from trans in and the lack of efficiency of trans out are pertinent and reveals the extent to which the catchments are hydrologically similar and the transferred parameter by trans in are representative of catchments conditions the catchments properties in c2 and their differences from c1 explain the gain in performance associated with trans in compared with trans out in c2 most of the catchments are energy limited except two outliers with a small range of variation compared with c1 fig 1 c hence c2 have homogeneous energy conditions with lower median ai than in c1 there is a very small range of variation in the value of snow day ratio sdr in c2 fig 1 b which further illustrates the homogeneity in climate and its effect on runoff response and subsequently on trans in efficiency the sdr although it is small in c2 median 25 is influential on the runoff response singh and xu 1997 ye et al 2012 in this region of the northeast the soils are mostly poorly drained the hgc proportions are the largest figs 6 a and 7 c the runoff generation mechanism in c2 is mainly dominated by saturation excess fig 8 very few catchments belong to the middle category of the ti fig 8 where saturation excess and the subsurface storm flow are equivalent in their effect on the flow response beven and kirkby 1979 beven and wood 1983 therefore the interaction of the homogeneous climate soil and energy characteristics with the runoff generation mechanism primarily saturation excess fosters the hydrologic similarity between catchments and explains the efficient performance of trans in an example of interaction between climate landscape properties and runoff generation mechanism is presented in bronstert et al 2002 the differences between c1 and c2 lead to differences in the flow response the catchments in c2 have steeper slope of the fdcs than those in c1 see sawicz et al 2011 and the lack of efficiency of trans out further demonstrates that parameters of one donor catchment with best predictions are representative of catchments conditions in c2 in c3 the poor efficiency of trans in compared with trans out indicates some level of heterogeneity and explains the lower performance of the parameter regionalization trans in in c3 although the catchments are energy limited low pet the ai is characterized by large variations and a large inter quantile range suggesting that the catchments have heterogeneous energy conditions fig 1 c there are catchments that are more energy limited low pet and others that are more water limited high pet the pet is one of the inputs into the sac sma model hence the transfer of parameters that are calibrated in different conditions of energy and water does not help to attain high efficiency all catchments in c3 are forested table 1 and mountainous with higher elevations than other regions figs 1 a and 5 there is also large variation in the mean elevation among catchments fig 5 the soils are poorly drained fig 6 with the lowest proportions of hgb fig 7 b and among the highest proportions of hgc fig 7 c according to the ti analysis subsurface storm flow dominates in c3 fig 8 the disparity in the mean elevation likely leads to differences in the response provided that the hydraulic gradient is proportional to the topographic gradient in mountainous catchments butt et al 2001 moreover in similar conditions of runoff generation mechanism and within forested mountainous catchments there is a likelihood of preferential flow mcdonnell et al 2007 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 the dominant subsurface storm flow and the non uniformity of the soil porosity with depth are among the factors that result in preferential flow the non uniformity in the soil porosity is related to the macropores resulting from the decayed living roots and from the biological activity that fosters preferential pathways in the subsurface zone bonell 1993 in all of the forested mountainous catchments dominated by subsurface storm flow from other regions c1 and c2 lateral preferential flow is likely however likelihood of such flow is even higher in c3 because i the physiography is more complex i e it has the steepest topography the highest elevation the lowest proportion of hgb and ii the hga soils characterized by very large infiltration rates have the largest proportions with the largest inter quantile range figs 6 and 7 d consequently non uniformity in the porosity and the preferential pathways is more probable in c3 which results in a more pronounced effect of preferential flow and further explains the low performance from trans in current physically based and conceptual models including sac sma often ignore the effect of preferential flow weiler and mcdonnell 2007 therefore we recognize its effect as a source of uncertainty in other predictions from c3 apriori trans out in ideal conditions where the preferential flow is simulated by the model structure the parameter transfer within c3 trans in will not lead to high performance because i of the same reasons noted above related to the disparity in the catchment conditions and ii the nature of preferential flow being specific to characteristics of each catchment the density of preferential pathways changes as a resultof soil texture porosity the root zone density and the density of decayed living roots brammer and mcdonnell 1996 bronstert 1999 mcdonnell et al 2007 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 additional research is necessary to properly simulate lateral preferential flow and investigate techniques to measure the differences similarities in the effects of this peculiar flow between catchments in the same region the relatively better performance of trans out in c3 only for medium flow percentiles might refer to the outsider donor catchment located in c1 being spatially close to catchments in c3 where dominant runoff generation mechanisms are the same the subsurface stormflow dominates the donor catchment of trans out and the catchments in c3 figs 1 and 8 the results from trans out and the likelihood of preferential flow indicate limitations of the parameter regionalization and suggest the need for other measures of similarity to relocate the catchments in c3 we propose adding other characteristics in the regionalization to assess the effect of preferential flow that can be complemented by physically based measures of soil characteristics i e porosity permeability and other measures related to pet i e ai in order to reduce the heterogeneity in energy conditions improving the efficiency from the parameter regionalization in regions of very complex landscape properties is a research venue that requires in depth investigations in the eastern united states the spatial pattern of soils led us to notice that hgc proportions are correlated with the latitude this relation is statistically significant r2 0 47 r 0 68 p value 0 001 the latitude explains 47 of the hgc variation in the eastern united states it is difficult to conjecture the reasons for this tight correlation but the geology structure that interacts with the topography and climate agents i e storm characteristics may be the potential factors the climate and soil hydrologic properties hgc proportions are correlated with latitude in eastern us and both contribute to the flow response wagener et al 2007 they can be used to identify the homogeneous regions however the performance from the parameter transfer would probably not be as efficient as the parameter regionalization approach investigated in the current study the climate and the physical descriptors do not capture the effect of interaction between all factors contributing to the flow response i e climate soil texture runoff generation mechanism groundwater porosity preferential pathways troch et al 2013 note that a previous regional study by oudin et al 2010b demonstrated that only 60 of the hydrologically similar catchments are physically similar the overlap was statistically significant in 40 of the catchments classified based on physical similarity the parameters are not transferable this finding supports our claim of using catchments characteristics that capture the interaction between all factors contributing to the flow response in the regionalization scheme we conjecture that the more the effect of interaction is captured the more efficient are the predictions from the parameter transfer our study demonstrates that when mmhs do not exhibit differences between several predictions the fdcs have diverse shapes according to analyses of the median percent error in each simulation consequently two main facts emerge concerning fdc use i it reveals the bias effect on flow simulation inaccuracy and ii it is advantageous for a more reliable parameter transfer assessment which is urgently needed for accurate pub several past pub studies have regarded fdc as a fundamental daily stream flow statistic archfield et al 2013 for example kapangaziwiri et al 2009 2012 analyzed fdcs to assess predictions from parameter regionalization masih et al 2010 delineated regions of homogenous hydrologic behavior based on similarity of the fdc farmer et al 2014 used the fdc of gauged basins to predict flow percentiles in ungauged basins using nonlinear spatial interpolations we therefore suggest using the fdc to better assess pub in combination with the efficiency measures of ns and pbias our assessments using fdc suggest giving new paradigms in the evaluation of model prediction a try the use of summary metrics involving measures of the fdc i e slope of the fdc rising limb density declining limb density in sadegh et al 2015 and vrugt and sadegh 2013 showed great promises for prediction evaluations it ensured that simulated response depicts accurately the observed flow behaviors this finding is consistent with our results fdc being more efficient in prediction evaluation than mmh and classic residual based metrics the problem resides in the convoluted error residuals of the observed and the simulated time series according to sadegh et al 2015 the summary metrics have the advantage to be relatively insensitive to forcing data errors which is particularly desirable in the context of non stationarity the summary metrics therefore avoid proclaiming non stationarity for the wrong reasons errors on the rainfall data sadegh et al 2015 5 2 1 which approach to use for pub the a priori parameters or the parameter regionalization in all the regions the comparisons of the efficiency from parameter transfer with apriori highlighted the uncertainty in using the a priori parameters to make pub compared to a parameter regionalization approach the lowest performance low median ns and high pbias from apriori was in c2 and c3 table 3 apriori was equivalent to trans in in c3 where trans in was the least efficient across the regions this finding does not allow to recommend the use of a priori parameters for pub slightly better predictions from apriori occurred in the catchments from c1 and c5 table 3 but never exceeded trans in this finding suggests that a priori parameters in c2 and c3 have among the highest uncertainty and are less representative of the catchments conditions the complex landscape properties of c3 and c2 i e the steepest topography with the finest soil texture suggests that the poor performance of apriori is related to the larger uncertainty in soil data interpolations from statsgo this uncertainty may relate to the lack of soil sampling in several regions with complex terrain koren et al 2003 more research is required to further analyze the uncertainty in the sac sma a priori parameters and their effect on flow predictions our findings suggests that it is better to use a parameter regionalization approach similar to what we present in this study for pub future research would consider comparing predictions from a priori parameters with predictions from other regionalization approaches i e regression spatial proximity similarity in physical properties to further evaluate the use of sac sma a priori parameters in predictions at ungauged catchments 5 3 comparisons with previous studies comparisons of the efficiency results with findings from other studies demonstrate that none of the catchments had predictions as poor and as biased as those reported by gan and burges 2006 these authors used the same model to investigate the parameter transferability over geographically distant mopex catchments these differences demonstrate the benefit of using hydrologically similar catchments for the parameter transfer our results outperform predictions from the spatial proximity which provided better predictions than the physical similarity in a study by oudin et al 2008 the median ns attained 0 77 in our study but it did not exceed 0 7 for spatial proximity and 0 69 for physical similarity in oudin et al 2008 in arsenault and brissette 2014 the efficiency of the physical similarity did not exceed 0 75 at individual catchments this efficiency is lower than the value of 0 85 the maximum we obtained in this study at individual catchments despite the limitations the effect of interaction which is captured by the climate and flow characteristics used in the regionalization explain the better performance we obtained compared with separate use of spatial proximity and physical similarity criteria note that oudin et al 2008 considered the spatial proximity and physical similarity as complementary and that the average of flow simulation from both approaches can be used to improve the prediction efficiency given the satisfactory performance we obtained in this study and the fact that homogeneous regions implicitly combine aspects of spatial proximity and physical similarity the proposition of oudin et al 2008 suggesting to combine predictions from two regionalization methods may represent a worth testing approach to investigate in future studies this so called multiregionalization scheme requires identification of a priori regionalization approaches to obtain the average of flow simulation leading to the best performance after combination oudin et al 2008 our prediction performance was consistent with other studies transferring the parameters between hydrologically similar catchments bock et al 2015 obtained a median ns of 0 76 from the parameter transfer within regions of similar parameter sensitivity the performance in individual catchments in our study exceeded the maximum value of 0 78 reported by masih et al 2010 who used the criterion of similarity in the fdc for parameter regionalization 6 conclusions this paper evaluated the performance from the parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics subsequently it compared the performance from the parameter regionalization to the prediction efficiency from the soil derived a priori parameters that are designed to make predictions at ungauged catchments the study was conducted in the eastern us using 73 catchments we employed the sac sma model and the geographically contiguous regions determined by sawicz et al 2011 using climate and flow characteristics our results showed that parameter transfer within homogeneous regions reduced the bias and increased the predictions efficiency it reaches a median ns of 0 77 and a ns of 0 85 at individual catchments the use of the fdc was advantageous in revealing the effect of bias on the flow simulation inaccuracy the satisfactory efficiency from the transferred parameters within the homogeneous regions was fostered by the similarity in the effect of interaction between climate physiographic characteristics and predominant runoff generation mechanism the use of the flow characteristics in the regionalization helped to capture the similarity in the effect of interaction the transferred parameters within homogeneous regions outweighed in performance the soil derived a priori parameters therefore it is better to use a regionalization approach to make predictions at ungauged catchments in one region of very complex landscape properties i e forested mountainous catchments steepest topography higher fraction of the poorly drained soils and heterogeneous energy conditions the predictions from the a priori parameters had equivalent efficiency to those from transferred parameters within this region both had poor performance the use of the transferred parameters from an outsider donor catchment slightly improved the predictions i e more accurate predictions of the medium flow percentiles this finding underlined the limitations of the parameter regionalization that affected the efficiency from the parameter transfer the limitations of the approach are in part caused by differences in the energy conditions between the catchments of this specific region and the likelihood of lateral preferential flow that fostered the heterogeneity between the catchments in this region from this perspective there is a room to improve the parameter regionalization within similar conditions of the catchments where we propose to add other measures of similarity in the regionalization examples the aridity index and measures of the effect of preferential flow that can be supported by specific measures of soil characteristics i e porosity permeability expanding our study to larger datasets will have the potential to provide further insights on parameter regionalization using similarity in climate and flow characteristics more limitations of the parameter regionalization are related to the implications of climate variability and change on the homogeneity in each region and consequently on parameter transferability this limitation remains unexplored and it is recommended in future research related to parameter regionalization acknowledgements we thank the three anonymous reviewers

7329,traditional flood risk analysis focuses on the probability of flood events exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures while neglecting the influence of sedimentation in river channels on regional flood control systems this work advances traditional flood risk analysis by proposing a univariate and copula based bivariate hydrological risk framework which incorporates both flood control and sediment transport in developing the framework the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by exploiting the copula based model moreover a monte carlo based algorithm is designed to quantify the sampling uncertainty associated with univariate and bivariate hydrological risk analyses two catchments located on the loess plateau are selected as study regions the upper catchments of the xianyang and huaxian stations denoted as ucx and uch respectively the univariate and bivariate return periods risk and reliability in the context of uncertainty for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport are assessed for the study regions the results indicate that sedimentation triggers higher risks of damaging the safety of local flood control systems compared with the event that amf exceeds the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the ucx and uch moreover there is considerable sampling uncertainty affecting the univariate and bivariate hydrologic risk evaluation which greatly challenges measures of future flood mitigation in addition results also confirm that the developed framework can estimate conditional probabilities associated with different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios aiming for flood control and sediment transport the proposed hydrological risk framework offers a promising technical reference for flood risk analysis in sandy regions worldwide keywords floodrisk analysis floodcontrol and sediment transport copula uncertainty loess plateau 1 introduction examining flood risk is extremely beneficial and indispensable for hydraulic engineering design and flood mitigation this topic has received enormous worldwide attention to date whether from a univariate or multivariate perspective rossi et al 1984 burn 1990 webb and betancourt 1992 brath et al 2006 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 shankman et al 2006 wood and lettenmaier 2006 zhang and singh 2006 kay et al 2009 reddy and ganguli 2012 viglione et al 2013a b fu and butler 2014 sraj et al 2015 ozga zielinski et al 2016 however previous studies focused predominantly on the hazards associated with floods i e the phenomenon that higher flood magnitude results in larger flood losses e g economic loss environmental loss barredo 2009 zaman et al 2012 lópez and francés 2013 jongman et al 2014 mcaneney et al 2017 therefore the probability risk of flood discharge volume exceeding a threshold i e the design flood of downstream flood control works is the provided information for flood control departments volpi and fiori 2014 vittal et al 2015 li et al 2016 however it is worthy of note that there are many non negligible practical benefits of floods such as enhancing ecosystem health replenishing reservoirs recharging ground water or transporting sediment in river channels eaton and lapointe 2001 ward et al 2001 thomaz et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 dahan et al 2008 rosenberg et al 2011 in this context higher flood discharge volume signifies more benefits and vice versa vanrheenen et al 2004 payne et al 2004 di baldassarre et al 2017 harden and o connor 2017 therefore knowledge of the probability of floods non exceeding certain thresholds is equally crucial for water resource managers and policy makers particularly on sediment transport issues however research on this issue has not been conducted to date and thus performing univariate and bivariate flood risk analyses of the hazards and benefits associated with floods has motivated our work in this study our interest is the impact of floodwater on sediment transport water discharge and sediment transport are two primary elements that maintain the healthy development of river channels particularly in sandy regions song et al 2010 tian et al 2016 during low to mean discharge stages sediment accumulates in the watercourses during floods these accumulated sediments are resuspended and transported downstream ogston et al 2000 ciszewski 2001 lenzi et al 2006 therefore effective flow discharge during floods is crucial for transporting these sediments and maintaining the balance between sediment load and water volume otherwise low flow discharge during floods induces sediment accumulation which triggers channel deposition and subsequently results in the decline in channel gradient and the shrinkage of the river channel consequently the sediment transport capacity of the river channel reduces and thus seriously impairs the flood regulation and affects regional flood control security xu 2002 wang et al 2005 he et al 2015 in light of the above investigating the probability of floods less than certain thresholds i e the appropriate instream flow requirements for sediment transport is of great importance to maintain the vigor of river ecosystems and the safety of regional flood control systems additionally another noteworthy point in flood risk analysis in practical applications is the uncertainty caused by the small size of hydrological samples i e the limited size of hydrological records saad et al 2014 fan et al 2016a b c qi et al 2016 serinaldi 2016 this uncertainty source is frequently overlooked in the univariate and multivariate frequency analyses due to the difficulties of estimation and interpretation salvadori et al 2011 serinaldi 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 highlighted that this uncertainty should be seriously considered to avoid misinterpretation of bivariate return periods and incoherent conclusions when assessing the risk of extreme hydrometeorological events michailidi and bacchi 2017 stated that flood risk evaluation without accounting for this uncertainty is deceiving in spite of this however this issue has not yet received significant attention serinaldi 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 dung et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore in this study the sampling uncertainty in bivariate risk evaluation is assessed by using a monte carlo based algorithm given the above concerns a framework for univariate and bivariate flood risk estimation under uncertainty is developed for flood control and sediment transport in sandy regions first the univariate risk of floods is calculated by considering both the damages and benefits of floods in rain dominant watersheds floods are generally caused by extreme precipitation events milly et al 2008 blöschl et al 2015 machado et al 2015 huang et al 2016 additionally in practical terms reducing the flood risk also requires information on extreme precipitation events kiem and verdon kidd 2013 madsen et al 2014 liu et al 2017 therefore the second part of this study examines the bivariate risk of floods and extreme precipitation events for local flood control and the sediment transport of river channels here the commonly used copula functions are employed salvadori 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 fu and butler 2014 ozga zielinski et al 2016 fan et al 2016a b c finally the conditional probabilities of occurring different flood discharge magnitudes under given various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated according to the joint dependence structure between floods and extreme precipitation events which is beneficial for practical flood control and sediment transport the loess plateau lp located in the middle yellow river basin of china is one of the most severely eroded areas in the world zhang and liu 2005 and is known as the cradle of chinese civilization to date the lp has received much attention from the government and international organizations wei et al 2006 cong et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 liang et al 2015 annual average soil erosion on the lp reaches approximately 2000 2500 t km2 and 60 of the area suffers severe soil loss zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 severe soil erosion results in the transport of vast amounts of sediment up to approximately 1 6 billion t year into the yellow river which gives this river the highest sediment concentration in the world li et al 2009 most of the sediment is deposited on the bottom of the river channel when the river flows downstream he et al 2015 the severe sedimentation in the lower yellow river makes the bed continuously rise and poses a great challenge to flood control xu 2002 peng et al 2010 wang et al 2016 moreover the sediment deposition is much higher during the flood season june september than that in other months fang et al 2008 therefore to decrease the stagnated and accumulated sediment in the channel a certain amount of instream flow during the flood season is extremely crucial investigating the probability of floods that do not exceed certain flood discharge magnitudes can provide valuable information for sediment transport in river channels however most previous studies have primarily focused on the frequency of low flows and drought events because of the arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate on the lp ma et al 2013 du et al 2015 huang et al 2014 studies investigating flood risk remain few and even fewer take sediment transport into account therefore the main objective of this work is to examine the univariate and bivariate risk of flood and extreme precipitation events in catchments of the lp the primary novelty of this study is 1 the design of a flood risk analysis framework for flood control and sedimentation management and the derivation of the conditional probability of different flood discharge magnitudes under various extreme precipitation scenarios and 2 the identification of the associated uncertainty in univariate and bivariate flood risk evaluation by a monte carlo based algorithm to provide more robust insights for practical flood control and sedimentation management although catchments of the lp are selected as study regions methods adopted in this study have no restrictions that would prevent them from being applied to other sandy regions the remainder of the paper is constructed as follows section 2 states the problem in the catchments of the lp section 3 describes the data collection section 4 introduces the methods adopted in this study the results and discussion are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the main conclusions drawn from the study 2 statement of the problem our study area is the weihe river basin situated between 104 and 107 e and 33 34 n fig 1 the basin has a typical continental climate and lies in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone in the southern part of the lp peng et al 2010 the weihe river hereafter wr provides the water supply for 9300 km2 of fertile fields in the guanzhong plain and 61 of the shaanxi province s population guo et al 2017 additionally the start point of the well known silk road economic belt xi an city is situated in this basin the wr flows into the yellow river with hyper concentrated sediment at tongguan station fig 1 where the yellow river makes an approximately 90 turn and flows east the wr basin is one of the most serious soil loss areas on the lp areas suffering from severe soil loss cover approximately 65 of the total land area of this basin song et al 2010 serious soil loss has caused severe sediment deposition in the lower reach of the wr which poses great challenges for local flood control li et al 2006 2013 sedimentation in the sanmenxia reservoir shown in fig 1 113 5 km away from tongguan station has enhanced the bed elevation at tongguan wu et al 2004 wang et al 2007 during 1960 1969 the tongguan elevation abruptly rose from 323 m to 328 5 m long and chien 1986 long 1996 the rising tongguan elevation triggered retrogressive siltation waves in the wr and prevented sediment transport from the wr into the yellow river continuous sediment deposition thus occurred in the lower wr because of the rising tongguan elevation the coupled effects of serious soil loss in the wr basin and increasing tongguan elevation has caused shrinkage of the wr channel and a decline in its flood discharge capability as a result the flood risk has increased and the capacity of levees to prevent floods in the lower wr has been reduced from a 50 year flood frequency to the current 10 year frequency song et al 2010 regional industrial and agricultural economic productivity and more importantly xi an the capital city of shanxi province in the lower reach of the wr are gravely threatened in light of the above changes flood control problems in the wr basin are twofold one is that flood peak discharge exceeds the design flood of the levees downstream and the other is sedimentation from severe soil loss in the upper wr and retrogressive siltation waves induced by the increasing tongguan elevation that prevent sediment transport which increases flood risks given the above information the aims of flood control operations in the wr basin are to ensure the safety of levees downstream and people living near the wr and promote sediment transport of the wr 3 dataset the backwater region of the sanmenxia reservoir extends to the xianyang hydrological station wang and hu 2009 moreover the upper catchment of xianyang station is a flood prone region in the wr basin huaxian station is the control station of the wr therefore the upper catchments of xianyang and huaxian stations are selected as study regions in the current work shown in fig 1 they are abbreviated as ucx and uch respectively annual maximum flood records denoted as amf for 1960 2014 from the xianyang and huaxian stations are used the locations of the two stations are displayed in fig 1 the data were provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which takes the main responsibility of monitoring collecting and disposing hydrological information in the yellow river basin the data quality was strictly controlled before being released according to the specification for complication and publication of hydrological yearbook sl 460 2009 and measures of the yellow river for the hydrological management http www yellowriver gov cn zwzc zcfg gz 200612 t20061222 75846 html daily precipitation data for 1960 2014 are provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn the flood discharge is closely linked to the accumulated rainfall amounts before the occurrence of annual peaks teegavarapu 2012 and the extreme precipitation event pr used in this work is thus defined as 1 pr i l l n rain i where pr denotes the accumulated rainfall from the 1st to the i th day l is the occurrence time of peak discharge q n n 0 1 2 3 4 indicates the lag time i e the time from peak discharge to the beginning of rainfall and rain i means the i th day of rainfall pr 1 pr 2 pr 3 pr 4 and pr 5 represent the accumulated 1 2 3 4 and 5 day consecutive rainfall amounts i e n 0 n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 respectively the thiessen polygon method is applied to compute the areal accumulated rainfall to select the extreme precipitation events most closely correlated to amf the correlation coefficients spearman s rho and kendall s tau are computed table 1 the spearman s rho and kendall s tau are rank based coefficients which are robust to departures from normality from table 1 it can be found that pr 2 and pr 3 are most closely correlated with amf gauged at xianyang and huaxian stations respectively 4 methodologies as mentioned in the introduction the aim of this paper is to develop a univariate and copula based bivariate hydrological risk framework focusing on flood control and sediment transport for sandy regions fig 2 presents the schematic diagram of this developed framework following fig 2 sections 4 1 and 4 2 illustrate the univariate and bivariate flood risk analyses section 4 3 exhibits the determination of conditional probability of flood peak discharge under given extreme precipitation scenarios approach on uncertainty estimation for the flood risk evaluation and conditional probability determination is described in section 4 4 4 1 univariate flood risk analysis 4 1 1 marginal distribution selection the generalized extreme value distribution gev pearson type iii distribution p3 lognormal distribution logn normal distribution norm and gamma distribution gam are adopted to fit the amf and pr series these parametric distributions are popular in modeling the marginal distributions of extreme hydrological events due to their better performance zhang and singh 2007 benkhaled et al 2014 fan et al 2016a b c kamal et al 2017 the maximum likelihood ml method is used to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions the goodness of fit test the kolmogorov smirnov k s approach is employed to evaluate the validity of these distribution models zhang and singh 2012 the k s statistic aims to quantify the largest vertical difference between the empirical and estimated distributions massey 1951 which is defined as 2 k s sup x f x f e x where sup denotes the supremum and f x and f e x indicate the estimated and empirical distributions respectively here the empirical distribution is estimated by the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 the p value of the k s statistic was estimated by the monte carlo simulation for details see lilliefors 1969 the r packages available from viglione et al 2013a b novack gottshall and wang 2016 were used for the p value estimation then the corrected akaike information criterion aicc is used to select the most appropriate model from among the candidate distribution models which is much stricter than the classical aic particularly when the sample size is limited burnham and anderson 2004 the aicc is defined by 3 aicc 2 ln maximized loglikelihood 2 pa 2 pa pa 1 n pa 1 where pa is the number of estimated parameters and n is the length of observations the bayes information criterion bic schwarz 1978 is also used to select the appropriate model which penalizes the log likelihood function by adding the number of parameters multiplied by the logarithm of the sample size n the specific formula is expressed as 4 bic 2 ln maximized loglikelihood ln n pa the best fitting model is selected as having the minimum aicc and bic values 4 1 2 univariate return periods and risk in the current work the univariate flood risk is first derived based on the return period also called recurrence intervals of the annual maximum flood discharge based on the flood control problems in the wr basin described in section 2 the return period is defined as 1 the average interval in years between amf events that exceeds a certain magnitude amf 1 and 2 the average interval in years between amf events that does not exceed a certain magnitude amf 2 amf 1 and amf 2 denote the design flood hereafter df of levee downstream and instream flow requirements for sediment transport hereafter ifrst in the lower wr respectively generally scouring the sediment in the river channel is implemented under the premise of ensuring the safety of downstream levees therefore ifrst should be less than df the two types of return periods are associated with the probabilities of amf exceeding df and amf not exceeding ifrst shown in fig 3 a and b amf df and amf ifrst events are defined as dangerous events for the safety of a local flood control system otherwise amf df and amf ifrst events are conductive from the perspective of a local flood control system the ifrst amf df event is favorable for the system as shown in fig 3 c for the sake of simplicity the conditions of amf exceeding the df event amf not exceeding the ifrst event and amf ifrst or amf df are denoted as case 1 2 and 3 respectively the random variable x represents the year of the first occurrence of the previously mentioned events under the assumption of independence and stationarity probabilities of occurrence of the case 1 case 2 and case 3 events for the first time in year x x x 1 2 are expressed as follows mood et al 1974 salas and obeysekera 2014 du et al 2015 case 1 5 f x p x x 1 f amf df x 1 f amf df 1 p 1 x 1 p 1 where f x is the geometric probability law p 1 f amf df and f is the cumulative distribution function denoted as cdf of the annual flood discharge case 2 6 f x p x x 1 f amf ifrst x 1 f amf ifrst 1 p 2 x 1 p 2 where p 2 f amf ifrst case 3 7 f x p x x 1 f amf ifrst or amf df x 1 f amf ifrst or amf df 1 p 1 p 2 x 1 p 1 p 2 therefore the corresponding return period i e the expected value x is similarly the variance of x the expected value of the squared deviation from e x is expressed as 9 var x e x e x 2 e x 2 e x 2 1 p 1 p 1 2 case 1 1 p 2 p 2 2 case 2 1 p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 2 case 3 the coefficient of variation of x a standardized measure of the relative change of e x is defined as 10 cv x var x e x 1 p 1 case 1 1 p 2 case 2 1 p 1 p 2 case 3 in practical flood management risk is the probability of occurrence of an exceedance flood event dangerous or undesirable event over a given project life of n years salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 du et al 2015 fan et al 2016a b c therefore the hydrological risk can also be expressed as 11 risk x 1 n f x p 1 x 1 n 1 p 1 x 1 1 1 p 1 n case 1 p 2 x 1 n 1 p 2 x 1 1 1 p 2 n case 2 p 1 p 2 x 1 n 1 p 1 p 2 x 1 1 1 p 1 p 2 n case 3 note that the risk of failure can be computed from the return period t i e risk 1 1 1 t n the reliability which signifies the probability that a dangerous event will not occur within a project life of n years i e that a system will remain in a satisfactory case within its lifetime is defined as 12 reliability 1 risk 1 p 1 n case 1 1 p 2 n case 2 1 p 1 p 2 n case 3 risk eq 11 and reliability eq 12 are derived for case 1 case 3 and can be applied to other regions worldwide with similar flood control problems 4 2 bivariate flood risk analysis 4 2 1 copula function construction the copula as introduced by sklar 1959 is a powerful tool for modeling the dependence structures of individual variables the main advantage of copulas is that they allow modeling the joint dependence structure without any restrictions on marginal distributions therefore the copula function has been extensively used in the hydrology field zhang and singh 2006 karmakar and simonovic 2009 reddy and ganguli 2012 zhang et al 2012 fan et al 2016a b c fan et al 2017 xu et al 2017 a d dimensional copula is defined as a multivariate distribution function f 0 1 d 0 1 linking standard uniform marginal distributions formally the copula can be divided into two components individual univariate distributions and a copula function describing dependence structures between variables based on the copula and its parameter s according to sklar s theorem one d dimensional multivariate distribution function f for random variables x 1 x 2 x d with marginal distribution of f 1 f 2 fd can be expressed as 13 f x 1 x d c f 1 x 1 f d x d θ where θ is the copula parameter vector and f d x d f x x is the marginal distribution of x d tail dependence is another important property of a copula embrechts et al 2003 which can be used to measure the dependence among extremal random events for the sake of simplicity the theoretical details of the coefficient of tail dependence are referred to aas 2004 in the current work the ml method is used to estimate the copula parameter s the cramér von mises statistic cramér 1928 von mises 1931 is used for goodness of fit testing in the field of hydrology the elliptical copulas student t copula gaussian copula etc and archimedean copulas clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula etc are two most frequently used copula families genest et al 2007 kao and govindaraju 2008 ma et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 vernieuwe et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 chang et al 2016 in this study we select the student t copula appendix a to model the joint dependence structure between amf and pr there are several reasons behind this selection first compared to the bivariate student distribution marginals of student t copula are not restricted to the student t distribution with the same degrees of freedom rodriguez 2007 additionally the student t copula can capture the dependence between variables in the left and right tails without giving up flexibility to describe dependence in the center by contrast other popular copulas capture one pattern of tail dependence such as clayton copula gumbel copula or zero tail dependence such as gaussian copula frank copula however present study focuses on the dependence structure between pairs of amf and pr values in the left tail i e the lower left quadrant and right tail i e upper right quadrant as shown in fig 4 given the above the student t copula is employed to characterize the joint behavior of amf and pr values in this study readers interested in more theoretical details of the student t copula are referred to the papers by cambanis et al 1981 and fang et al 2002 4 2 2 joint return periods and risk to conduct a bivariate risk analysis the commonly used joint probability behaviors focus on the so called or and and cond events sraj et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 fig 4 displays the joint probabilities of or and and cond operators for case 1 and case 2 the corresponding joint probability behaviors for case 1 shown in the upper panel of fig 4 are expressed as 1 amf df or pr pr 2 amf df and pr pr and 3 amf df pr pr the joint probability behaviors for case 2 shown in the lower panel of fig 4 are 1 amf ifrst or pr pr 2 amf ifrst and pr pr and 3 amf ifrst pr pr from the perspective of a local flood control system there are various combinations of flood and precipitation events for the bivariate case additionally once the probabilities of the above joint probability behaviors for case 1 and case 2 are calculated that for case 3 can be derived by the addition and subtraction formula of probability and the generalized total probability formula therefore we restrict our attention to the bivariate joint probability behaviors for case 1 and case 2 in the current work for the sake of simplicity the joint return periods for case 1 also called primary return periods can be expressed as 14 t or 1 p amf df or pr pr 1 1 c f amf df f pr pr 15 t and 1 p amf df and pr pr 1 1 f amf df f pr pr c f amf df f pr pr 16 t cond 1 p amf df pr pr 1 p amf df pr pr p pr pr 1 1 f amf df f pr pr c f amf df f pr pr 1 f pr pr substituting eq 15 into eq 16 it can be found that eq 16 can also be written as t cond 1 f pr pr t and t and the primary return periods for the case 2 are defined as 17 t or 1 p amf ifrst or pr pr 1 f amf ifrst f pr pr c f amf ifrst f pr pr 18 t and 1 p amf ifrst and pr pr 1 c f amf ifrst f pr pr 19 t cond 1 p amf ifrst pr pr 1 p amf ifrst pr pr p pr pr 1 c f amf ifrst f pr pr f pr pr substituting eq 18 into eq 19 it can be found that eq 19 can be expressed as t cond f pr pr t and t and considering the above several inequalities between t or t and and t cond exist for any given copula 20 t or t and 21 t cond t and the corresponding risk and reliability associated with the return period of joint probability behaviors can be expressed as 22 risk 1 1 1 t n 23 reliability 1 1 t n 4 3 conditional statistics of amf under given precipitation scenarios in practical terms water resources managers want to identify how possible it is that amf exceeds or does not exceed certain thresholds under given extreme precipitation events therefore we examine the conditional probability of amf under various extreme precipitation scenarios the conditional exceedance probability of amf df given pr pr is defined as 24 f amf df pr pr 1 c f amf df f pr pr f pr pr 1 f amf df pr pr the conditional unexceedance probability of amf ifrst given pr pr is expressed as 25 f amf ifrst pr pr c f amf ifrst f pr pr f pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr according to the formula of holohedral probability and bayes formula the conditional probability that ifrst amf df given pr pr is denoted as 26 f ifrst amf df pr pr f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr given pr pr f min df ifrst amf max df ifrst pr pr denotes the probability of a flood peak discharge less than the design flood of levee downstream and higher than the instream flow requirement for sediment transport 4 4 uncertainty estimation for joint probability behaviors to determine the impact of sampling uncertainty on the evaluation of risk of bivariate extreme hydrometeorological events and conditional probabilities of amf given precipitation scenarios the following monte carlo based procedures motivated by serinaldi 2016 are designed 1 estimate the vector of parameters ξ ξ α x α y θ of the joint distribution h x y ξ c f x α x f y α y θ simultaneously using the ml method given in appendix b 2 simulate b bivariate samples of size n as z x y x ij y ij i 1 n j 1 b from the fitted bivariate model h x y ξ n is equal to the length of the observed sample b is set to 9999 in this study 3 estimate the vector of parameters ξ j for the simulated sample z j using the maximum likelihood method 4 compute the primary t or t and and t cond return periods for different x y pairs moreover compute the conditional probabilities of x under given different y scenarios 5 estimate confidence intervals for t or t and t cond and conditional probabilities at the 95 confidence level 5 results and discussion 5 1 marginal distribution selection to test the randomness of variables the autocorrelations for amf and pr series are computed and shown in fig s1 supplemental material it can be inferred from fig s1 that these autocorrelations cannot pass the significance test at the 5 significance level therefore we accept the hypothesis that amf and pr in the two study regions are random variables figs s2 and s3 illustrate the fitted marginal distributions by the gev p3 logn norm and gam distributions for the amf and pr series in the ucx and uch respectively the two figures both display relatively high degree of similarity among the five curves in the two regions the estimated parameters for these candidate distributions are displayed in table s1 supplemental material given the similarity among the five distributions we performed the k s goodness of fit test and estimated the aicc and bic to select the most appropriate distributions to model the amf and pr series the corresponding results exhibited in table s2 demonstrate that these candidate distributions are suitable for fitting the distribution of amf and pr series with the assist of aicc and bic indicators the gam distribution is selected as the most appropriate one to model the amf and pr series in the two regions 5 2 copula function construction once the marginal distribution is chosen the next step is to estimate the copula parameters the estimated parameters of the student t copula are listed in table 2 the goodness of fit statistics sn of the cramér von mises criterion and its associated p value based on n 9999 parametric bootstrap samples are also given in table 2 large value of sn indicates the large distance between the estimated and the empirical copulas p value 0 05 means that the estimated copula can be accepted at the 5 significance level results displayed in table 2 illustrate that the student t copula can be applied to model the dependence structure between amf and pr series in each region at 5 significance level 5 3 flood risk analysis for flood control and sediment transport 5 3 1 univariate flood risk analysis fig 5 displays the univariate flood return period and its associated confidence interval denoted as ci for case 1 and case 2 in the current work the sampling uncertainty related to the limited size of hydrological records is discovered by the monte carlo sampling method i e the parametric bootstrapping method the amf observations are resampled 9999 times and for each resample the gamma distribution is fitted thin gray lines in fig 5 in this study each simulation is generated from a random seed and the figure thus displays the effects of sampling variability on the simulated amf series to select the percentiles the 9999 quantile estimates are ranked the 250th and 9750th values are used to depict the 2 5 and 97 5 points of the distribution i e the 95 ci red dotted lines in fig 5 one can assess the risk of occurrence of different flood magnitudes for both flood control and sediment transport purposes from fig 5 the width of ci for flood return periods at the 95 confidence level is used to measure the uncertainty shown in fig 5 wider ci denotes larger uncertainty the results highlight that large uncertainties in univariate flood return periods exist for both case 1 and case 2 for a given return period the 95 ci of df involved in case 1 and ifrst involved in case 2 is wide specifically ci is wide for high flows and narrow for low flows in case 1 whereas it is the opposite in case 2 for case 1 for a univariate return period of 15 years in the ucx the df can span from 3873 to 5941 m3 s 34 81 difference for 20 years it ranges from 4165 to 6450 m3 s 35 43 difference as for case 2 in the ucx the ifrst for a univariate return period of 15 years at the 95 confidence interval spans from 287 to 695 m3 s 58 71 difference and for 20 years it spans from 234 to 613 m3 s 61 83 difference from the above it can be found that univariate flood frequency analyses for flood control and sediment transport both are plagued with considerable uncertainty the large uncertainty makes it difficult for the management departments to determine the scientific design flood for hydraulic engineering and flood control operation of reservoirs therefore reducing the uncertainty of flood return period estimation is essential for flood control in practice particularly the sampling uncertainty however it is worthy of note that although the length of hydrological records used in this study is comparatively long 55 years for a hydrological context it is still not sufficient to constrain the uncertainty to tight limits therefore as merz and blöschl 2008 and dung et al 2015 suggested increasing the information content by temporal spatial or causal data expansion such as the historical and paleo flood data is necessary and beneficial for responding such high uncertainty and obtain a more reliable estimation of flood return period as for selecting the suitable df for the hydraulic engineering e g levee dam and determining appropriate ifrst for sediment transport in the context of high uncertainty as hu et al 2013 suggested management departments can employ the point estimate of flood design value and add one modification value for it the modification value should be determined with the assist of ci of flood return periods apparently the larger the modification value is the lower risk of flood levee overflowing and the higher construction cost of the lee is otherwise the reverse specifically the importance of flood control objects is another one important reference factor when determining the modification value zhang et al 2014 discovered that the tongguan elevation decreases when flood peak discharge observed at huaxian station is 2000 m3 s and that the decrease degree is dramatic when flood peak discharge is 3000 m3 s li et al 2010 highlighted that flood peak discharge more than 2500 m3 s observed at huaxian station is significantly negatively correlated with the tongguan elevation flood peak discharge less than 2500 m3 s is insufficient to decrease the tongguan elevation therefore 2500 m3 s is treated in the current work as an effective ifrst in the wr basin local flood control departments have rechecked the flood control ability of hydraulic structures in the lower wr and suggested that the gauged flood discharge at huaxian station should be 5760 m3 s for the safety of the levee in the wr basin table 3 shows the risk and reliability of occurrence of different flood events for flood control and sediment transport in the wr basin the hydraulic project life is given as 10 years i e n 10 for the case 1 eq 11 with respect to sediment transport water sediment regulation by reservoirs is generally considered an effective measure to solve the sedimentation problem in the yellow river wang et al 2006 li and sheng 2011 miao et al 2016 wu et al 2016 suggested that the water sediment regulation can be performed every 3 years at least with the premise of meeting the water demands of agriculture industry and daily life therefore we define risk as the probability of occurrence of flood peak discharge less than 2500 m3 s over 3 years i e n 3 for the case 2 eq 11 take the uch for example it can be seen from table 3 that the probability of occurrence of the amf 5760 m3 s event i e case 1 is 0 05 95 ci 0 01 0 09 and that the corresponding return period reaches 22 14 years 95 ci 11 22 76 49 years during the design life of 10 years the risk that an amf 5760 m3 s event will occur before or at the 10th year is 0 37 95 ci 0 12 0 61 on the other hand within the 10 years the reliability that an amf 5760 m3 s event will not occur is 0 71 95 ci 0 46 0 92 in fact it can be deduced from the formulas of risk and reliability i e eqs 11 and 12 that the risk varies inversely to the return period while the reliability is proportional to the return period therefore if management departments tend to decrease the so called risk or increase the reliability in practice increasing the design flood level for levees is compulsory for the case 2 in the uch the probability that an amf 2500 m3 s event will occur is huge 0 66 95 ci 0 56 0 77 which means that this event will occur once every 1 51 years 95 ci 1 30 1 77 the corresponding risk reaches 0 96 95 ci 0 92 0 99 whereas the reliability is only 0 15 95 ci 0 08 0 26 the high risk implies that scouring sediment in the river channel depending merely on the natural flood event is insufficient therefore floodwater released by the reservoir in the upstream region of huaxian station is crucially important for sediment transport in the lower wr the dongzhuang reservoir located in the jinghe river the largest tributary of wr is under construction with completion scheduled by 2022 a primary goal of this reservoir is to conduct water sediment regulation to reduce the sedimentation in the lower wr and thus to decrease the flood risk then the tongguan elevation will be decreased consequently the safety of the flood control system in the lower wr will be further enhanced case 3 i e amf 5760 m3 s or amf 2500 m3 s reflects the events impairing the safety of the local flood control system therefore according to the addition formula of probability the probability of a case 3 event occurring is the sum of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 m3 s which is 0 69 95 ci 0 62 0 78 the probability is close to that of case 2 0 66 95 ci 0 56 0 77 it signifies that sedimentation will be the primary factor impairing the safety of the local flood control system therefore appropriate water sediment regulation scheme using the dongzhuang reservoir is of great significance for sediment transport in the wr basin and the sum of discharge from the dongzhuang reservoir and that gauged at xianyang station can t be 2500 m3 s in doing so probability of floods due to channel sedimentation will be reduced greatly 5 3 2 bivariate return period and risk analysis building the joint distribution of amf and pr and evaluating their bivariate risk are beneficial for better understanding risks between extreme hydro climatic events candela et al 2014 figs s4 and s5 supplemental material exhibit the primary return periods for flood control and sediment transport in the wr decision makers can identify the corresponding flood risk information for different flood and extreme precipitation events from figs 6and 7 which is extremely beneficial for practical flood control and mitigation fan et al 2016a b c in the lower wr 5760 and 2500 m3 s are critical thresholds for flood control and sediment transport therefore we calculated the return periods for different flood related events and their 95 ci in figs 6 and 7 and table 4 to provide more complete information note that in the ucx f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 calculated using the fitted gamma distribution are 0 9633 and 0 6635 respectively in the uch f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 are 0 9511 and 0 4708 respectively using the fitted gamma distribution of the pr 2 pr 3 series we calculated the values of pr 2 pr 3 with equal probabilities of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 events in the ucx uch listed in table 4 values of pr 2 with equal probabilities of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 events in the ucx are 58 12 mm and 28 89 mm respectively while values of pr 3 in the uch are 52 96 mm and 26 95 mm respectively from figs 6 and 7 and table 4 it can be inferred that the uncertainties of bivariate return periods induced by the limited sample size are very large and should generate critical concern for future flood mitigation taking the uch as an example the t or for an amf 5760 or pr 3 48 32 event is 9 35 years 95 ci 5 65 21 52 years which overlaps that for amf 5760 or pr 3 67 37 i e 20 14 years 95 ci 10 10 66 87 years similarly the t or for an amf 2500 or pr 3 15 19 event is 2 06 years 95 ci 1 68 2 66 years which overlaps that for amf 2500 or pr 3 29 27 i e 1 5 years 95 ci 1 30 1 79 years this phenomenon i e the return periods overlap is also found in the works of serinaldi 2013 dung et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 due to the considerable uncertainty of the flood risk assessment michailidi and bacchi 2017 stated that any attempt to obscure this uncertainty could create a false notion about its existence in a multivariate problem therefore taking the uncertainty into account when developing flood control policies is of critical importance specifically as suggested in section 5 3 1 management departments can improve the levee design standard and increase water release from reservoirs although it would increase the cost and decrease economic profit with the assist of the above uncertainty evaluation results for the sake of simplicity we don t display the risk and reliability results in figs 6 and 7 and table 4 if one is interested in the risk and reliability of different flood related events the derived eqs 22 and 23 can be used to compute risk and reliability on the basis of the return periods of different flood events these large uncertainties pose significant challenges for the design of hydraulic engineering and the development of flood control and mitigation scheme particularly the guanzhong plain an important chinese agricultural production region and xi an city known as one of the four major ancient civilization capitals both lie in the floodplain of the wr huang et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty of copula based risk analyses for this region should generate critical concern particularly when developing policies for flood control and hazard mitigation 5 4 conditional probabilities of amf under given extreme precipitation events based on the joint distribution of amf and pr the conditional probabilities of amf under given pr scenarios can be examined in present study according to the specific thresholds of flood peak discharge for flood control and sediment transport the conditional probabilities f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr and f ifrst amf df pr pr are explored these conditional probabilities help to identify the possibilities of the occurrence of amf df event amf ifrst event and ifrst amf df event under different extreme precipitation conditions in practice with the assist of rainfall forecast information management departments can deduce the conditional probabilities of different flood events by constructing the joint dependence between amf and pr and subsequently develop scientific flood control policies for flood control and sediment transport in practical terms given a potentially extreme future precipitation scenario the probabilities of the occurrence of specific flood peak discharge exceeding df not exceeding ifrst and varying in the domain ifrst df can be discovered from fig 8 this information would be important for performing effective flood control measures to ensure the safety of local flood control systems moreover we also discovered the uncertainties of these conditional probabilities the results are also shown in fig 8 from which a flood control department can identify the conditional probabilities and their 95 confidence intervals for any extreme precipitation scenarios of interest taking uch as an example conditioned on pr 3 52 96 mm in the future the conditional probabilities f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr and f ifrst amf df pr pr are 0 18 95 ci 0 06 0 38 0 12 95 ci 0 05 0 29 and 0 70 95 ci 0 50 0 79 respectively analogous to the uncertainty in the bivariate return periods estimation uncertainty in the conditional probability estimation in the two study regions is also noticeable 6 summary and conclusions in this study a univariate and bivariate hydrological risk framework is developed to perform flood risk analysis for flood control and sediment transport this framework considers both the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures and instream flow requirements for sediment transport consequently the univariate and bivariate return period risk and reliability are derived for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport the bivariate hydrological risk is examined by exploiting the copula based joint distribution model of annual maximum flood discharge amf and extreme precipitation pr moreover the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by the joint distribution of amf and pr this information is valuable for maintaining the safety of local flood control systems moreover one monte carlo based algorithm is proposed to disclose the impact of sampling uncertainty on hydrological risk evaluation in order to provide more robust and practical information for local flood control and hydraulic engineering design two sub catchments of the loess plateau ucx and uch the upper catchments of xianyang and huaxian stations are selected as the study regions floods and sedimentation in river channels in the two regions greatly impair the safety of local flood control systems our framework is thus used to analyze the hydrological risk in the study regions primary conclusions are shown as below sedimentation in river channels poses greater threat to the safety of flood control systems compared with the flood peak discharge exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the two sub catchments of the lp given this management departments should pay more attention on reservoir operation scheme for scouring sediment in river channel under the premise of ensuring the safe operation of hydraulic structures in the regions the uncertainties of univariate and bivariate flood risk in the uch and ucx are considerably large for example in the uch return periods of the amf 5760 m3 s or pr 58 12 mm event can reach between 9 53 and 59 99 years the considerable uncertainty should generate critical attention particularly when developing policies for flood control and mitigation specifically confronted with the great uncertainty of flood risk assessment to ensure the safety of human life and property during floods management departments can improve the levee design standard and increase water release from reservoirs for sediment delivery additionally by applying the conditional probability distributions of amf upon various extreme precipitation scenarios eqs 24 26 management departments can deduce the conditional probabilities of different flood events with the assist of rainfall forecast information and subsequently develop scientific flood relevant policies for flood control and sedimentation management the developed flood risk assessment framework can potentially help decision makers in flood control and mitigation by providing valuable insights toward assessing flood risk focusing on flood control and sediment transport in sandy regions this framework is also

7329,traditional flood risk analysis focuses on the probability of flood events exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures while neglecting the influence of sedimentation in river channels on regional flood control systems this work advances traditional flood risk analysis by proposing a univariate and copula based bivariate hydrological risk framework which incorporates both flood control and sediment transport in developing the framework the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by exploiting the copula based model moreover a monte carlo based algorithm is designed to quantify the sampling uncertainty associated with univariate and bivariate hydrological risk analyses two catchments located on the loess plateau are selected as study regions the upper catchments of the xianyang and huaxian stations denoted as ucx and uch respectively the univariate and bivariate return periods risk and reliability in the context of uncertainty for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport are assessed for the study regions the results indicate that sedimentation triggers higher risks of damaging the safety of local flood control systems compared with the event that amf exceeds the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the ucx and uch moreover there is considerable sampling uncertainty affecting the univariate and bivariate hydrologic risk evaluation which greatly challenges measures of future flood mitigation in addition results also confirm that the developed framework can estimate conditional probabilities associated with different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios aiming for flood control and sediment transport the proposed hydrological risk framework offers a promising technical reference for flood risk analysis in sandy regions worldwide keywords floodrisk analysis floodcontrol and sediment transport copula uncertainty loess plateau 1 introduction examining flood risk is extremely beneficial and indispensable for hydraulic engineering design and flood mitigation this topic has received enormous worldwide attention to date whether from a univariate or multivariate perspective rossi et al 1984 burn 1990 webb and betancourt 1992 brath et al 2006 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 shankman et al 2006 wood and lettenmaier 2006 zhang and singh 2006 kay et al 2009 reddy and ganguli 2012 viglione et al 2013a b fu and butler 2014 sraj et al 2015 ozga zielinski et al 2016 however previous studies focused predominantly on the hazards associated with floods i e the phenomenon that higher flood magnitude results in larger flood losses e g economic loss environmental loss barredo 2009 zaman et al 2012 lópez and francés 2013 jongman et al 2014 mcaneney et al 2017 therefore the probability risk of flood discharge volume exceeding a threshold i e the design flood of downstream flood control works is the provided information for flood control departments volpi and fiori 2014 vittal et al 2015 li et al 2016 however it is worthy of note that there are many non negligible practical benefits of floods such as enhancing ecosystem health replenishing reservoirs recharging ground water or transporting sediment in river channels eaton and lapointe 2001 ward et al 2001 thomaz et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 dahan et al 2008 rosenberg et al 2011 in this context higher flood discharge volume signifies more benefits and vice versa vanrheenen et al 2004 payne et al 2004 di baldassarre et al 2017 harden and o connor 2017 therefore knowledge of the probability of floods non exceeding certain thresholds is equally crucial for water resource managers and policy makers particularly on sediment transport issues however research on this issue has not been conducted to date and thus performing univariate and bivariate flood risk analyses of the hazards and benefits associated with floods has motivated our work in this study our interest is the impact of floodwater on sediment transport water discharge and sediment transport are two primary elements that maintain the healthy development of river channels particularly in sandy regions song et al 2010 tian et al 2016 during low to mean discharge stages sediment accumulates in the watercourses during floods these accumulated sediments are resuspended and transported downstream ogston et al 2000 ciszewski 2001 lenzi et al 2006 therefore effective flow discharge during floods is crucial for transporting these sediments and maintaining the balance between sediment load and water volume otherwise low flow discharge during floods induces sediment accumulation which triggers channel deposition and subsequently results in the decline in channel gradient and the shrinkage of the river channel consequently the sediment transport capacity of the river channel reduces and thus seriously impairs the flood regulation and affects regional flood control security xu 2002 wang et al 2005 he et al 2015 in light of the above investigating the probability of floods less than certain thresholds i e the appropriate instream flow requirements for sediment transport is of great importance to maintain the vigor of river ecosystems and the safety of regional flood control systems additionally another noteworthy point in flood risk analysis in practical applications is the uncertainty caused by the small size of hydrological samples i e the limited size of hydrological records saad et al 2014 fan et al 2016a b c qi et al 2016 serinaldi 2016 this uncertainty source is frequently overlooked in the univariate and multivariate frequency analyses due to the difficulties of estimation and interpretation salvadori et al 2011 serinaldi 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 highlighted that this uncertainty should be seriously considered to avoid misinterpretation of bivariate return periods and incoherent conclusions when assessing the risk of extreme hydrometeorological events michailidi and bacchi 2017 stated that flood risk evaluation without accounting for this uncertainty is deceiving in spite of this however this issue has not yet received significant attention serinaldi 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 dung et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore in this study the sampling uncertainty in bivariate risk evaluation is assessed by using a monte carlo based algorithm given the above concerns a framework for univariate and bivariate flood risk estimation under uncertainty is developed for flood control and sediment transport in sandy regions first the univariate risk of floods is calculated by considering both the damages and benefits of floods in rain dominant watersheds floods are generally caused by extreme precipitation events milly et al 2008 blöschl et al 2015 machado et al 2015 huang et al 2016 additionally in practical terms reducing the flood risk also requires information on extreme precipitation events kiem and verdon kidd 2013 madsen et al 2014 liu et al 2017 therefore the second part of this study examines the bivariate risk of floods and extreme precipitation events for local flood control and the sediment transport of river channels here the commonly used copula functions are employed salvadori 2004 salvadori and de michele 2010 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 fu and butler 2014 ozga zielinski et al 2016 fan et al 2016a b c finally the conditional probabilities of occurring different flood discharge magnitudes under given various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated according to the joint dependence structure between floods and extreme precipitation events which is beneficial for practical flood control and sediment transport the loess plateau lp located in the middle yellow river basin of china is one of the most severely eroded areas in the world zhang and liu 2005 and is known as the cradle of chinese civilization to date the lp has received much attention from the government and international organizations wei et al 2006 cong et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 liang et al 2015 annual average soil erosion on the lp reaches approximately 2000 2500 t km2 and 60 of the area suffers severe soil loss zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 severe soil erosion results in the transport of vast amounts of sediment up to approximately 1 6 billion t year into the yellow river which gives this river the highest sediment concentration in the world li et al 2009 most of the sediment is deposited on the bottom of the river channel when the river flows downstream he et al 2015 the severe sedimentation in the lower yellow river makes the bed continuously rise and poses a great challenge to flood control xu 2002 peng et al 2010 wang et al 2016 moreover the sediment deposition is much higher during the flood season june september than that in other months fang et al 2008 therefore to decrease the stagnated and accumulated sediment in the channel a certain amount of instream flow during the flood season is extremely crucial investigating the probability of floods that do not exceed certain flood discharge magnitudes can provide valuable information for sediment transport in river channels however most previous studies have primarily focused on the frequency of low flows and drought events because of the arid and semi arid continental monsoon climate on the lp ma et al 2013 du et al 2015 huang et al 2014 studies investigating flood risk remain few and even fewer take sediment transport into account therefore the main objective of this work is to examine the univariate and bivariate risk of flood and extreme precipitation events in catchments of the lp the primary novelty of this study is 1 the design of a flood risk analysis framework for flood control and sedimentation management and the derivation of the conditional probability of different flood discharge magnitudes under various extreme precipitation scenarios and 2 the identification of the associated uncertainty in univariate and bivariate flood risk evaluation by a monte carlo based algorithm to provide more robust insights for practical flood control and sedimentation management although catchments of the lp are selected as study regions methods adopted in this study have no restrictions that would prevent them from being applied to other sandy regions the remainder of the paper is constructed as follows section 2 states the problem in the catchments of the lp section 3 describes the data collection section 4 introduces the methods adopted in this study the results and discussion are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the main conclusions drawn from the study 2 statement of the problem our study area is the weihe river basin situated between 104 and 107 e and 33 34 n fig 1 the basin has a typical continental climate and lies in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone in the southern part of the lp peng et al 2010 the weihe river hereafter wr provides the water supply for 9300 km2 of fertile fields in the guanzhong plain and 61 of the shaanxi province s population guo et al 2017 additionally the start point of the well known silk road economic belt xi an city is situated in this basin the wr flows into the yellow river with hyper concentrated sediment at tongguan station fig 1 where the yellow river makes an approximately 90 turn and flows east the wr basin is one of the most serious soil loss areas on the lp areas suffering from severe soil loss cover approximately 65 of the total land area of this basin song et al 2010 serious soil loss has caused severe sediment deposition in the lower reach of the wr which poses great challenges for local flood control li et al 2006 2013 sedimentation in the sanmenxia reservoir shown in fig 1 113 5 km away from tongguan station has enhanced the bed elevation at tongguan wu et al 2004 wang et al 2007 during 1960 1969 the tongguan elevation abruptly rose from 323 m to 328 5 m long and chien 1986 long 1996 the rising tongguan elevation triggered retrogressive siltation waves in the wr and prevented sediment transport from the wr into the yellow river continuous sediment deposition thus occurred in the lower wr because of the rising tongguan elevation the coupled effects of serious soil loss in the wr basin and increasing tongguan elevation has caused shrinkage of the wr channel and a decline in its flood discharge capability as a result the flood risk has increased and the capacity of levees to prevent floods in the lower wr has been reduced from a 50 year flood frequency to the current 10 year frequency song et al 2010 regional industrial and agricultural economic productivity and more importantly xi an the capital city of shanxi province in the lower reach of the wr are gravely threatened in light of the above changes flood control problems in the wr basin are twofold one is that flood peak discharge exceeds the design flood of the levees downstream and the other is sedimentation from severe soil loss in the upper wr and retrogressive siltation waves induced by the increasing tongguan elevation that prevent sediment transport which increases flood risks given the above information the aims of flood control operations in the wr basin are to ensure the safety of levees downstream and people living near the wr and promote sediment transport of the wr 3 dataset the backwater region of the sanmenxia reservoir extends to the xianyang hydrological station wang and hu 2009 moreover the upper catchment of xianyang station is a flood prone region in the wr basin huaxian station is the control station of the wr therefore the upper catchments of xianyang and huaxian stations are selected as study regions in the current work shown in fig 1 they are abbreviated as ucx and uch respectively annual maximum flood records denoted as amf for 1960 2014 from the xianyang and huaxian stations are used the locations of the two stations are displayed in fig 1 the data were provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which takes the main responsibility of monitoring collecting and disposing hydrological information in the yellow river basin the data quality was strictly controlled before being released according to the specification for complication and publication of hydrological yearbook sl 460 2009 and measures of the yellow river for the hydrological management http www yellowriver gov cn zwzc zcfg gz 200612 t20061222 75846 html daily precipitation data for 1960 2014 are provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn the flood discharge is closely linked to the accumulated rainfall amounts before the occurrence of annual peaks teegavarapu 2012 and the extreme precipitation event pr used in this work is thus defined as 1 pr i l l n rain i where pr denotes the accumulated rainfall from the 1st to the i th day l is the occurrence time of peak discharge q n n 0 1 2 3 4 indicates the lag time i e the time from peak discharge to the beginning of rainfall and rain i means the i th day of rainfall pr 1 pr 2 pr 3 pr 4 and pr 5 represent the accumulated 1 2 3 4 and 5 day consecutive rainfall amounts i e n 0 n 1 n 2 n 3 and n 4 respectively the thiessen polygon method is applied to compute the areal accumulated rainfall to select the extreme precipitation events most closely correlated to amf the correlation coefficients spearman s rho and kendall s tau are computed table 1 the spearman s rho and kendall s tau are rank based coefficients which are robust to departures from normality from table 1 it can be found that pr 2 and pr 3 are most closely correlated with amf gauged at xianyang and huaxian stations respectively 4 methodologies as mentioned in the introduction the aim of this paper is to develop a univariate and copula based bivariate hydrological risk framework focusing on flood control and sediment transport for sandy regions fig 2 presents the schematic diagram of this developed framework following fig 2 sections 4 1 and 4 2 illustrate the univariate and bivariate flood risk analyses section 4 3 exhibits the determination of conditional probability of flood peak discharge under given extreme precipitation scenarios approach on uncertainty estimation for the flood risk evaluation and conditional probability determination is described in section 4 4 4 1 univariate flood risk analysis 4 1 1 marginal distribution selection the generalized extreme value distribution gev pearson type iii distribution p3 lognormal distribution logn normal distribution norm and gamma distribution gam are adopted to fit the amf and pr series these parametric distributions are popular in modeling the marginal distributions of extreme hydrological events due to their better performance zhang and singh 2007 benkhaled et al 2014 fan et al 2016a b c kamal et al 2017 the maximum likelihood ml method is used to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions the goodness of fit test the kolmogorov smirnov k s approach is employed to evaluate the validity of these distribution models zhang and singh 2012 the k s statistic aims to quantify the largest vertical difference between the empirical and estimated distributions massey 1951 which is defined as 2 k s sup x f x f e x where sup denotes the supremum and f x and f e x indicate the estimated and empirical distributions respectively here the empirical distribution is estimated by the gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 the p value of the k s statistic was estimated by the monte carlo simulation for details see lilliefors 1969 the r packages available from viglione et al 2013a b novack gottshall and wang 2016 were used for the p value estimation then the corrected akaike information criterion aicc is used to select the most appropriate model from among the candidate distribution models which is much stricter than the classical aic particularly when the sample size is limited burnham and anderson 2004 the aicc is defined by 3 aicc 2 ln maximized loglikelihood 2 pa 2 pa pa 1 n pa 1 where pa is the number of estimated parameters and n is the length of observations the bayes information criterion bic schwarz 1978 is also used to select the appropriate model which penalizes the log likelihood function by adding the number of parameters multiplied by the logarithm of the sample size n the specific formula is expressed as 4 bic 2 ln maximized loglikelihood ln n pa the best fitting model is selected as having the minimum aicc and bic values 4 1 2 univariate return periods and risk in the current work the univariate flood risk is first derived based on the return period also called recurrence intervals of the annual maximum flood discharge based on the flood control problems in the wr basin described in section 2 the return period is defined as 1 the average interval in years between amf events that exceeds a certain magnitude amf 1 and 2 the average interval in years between amf events that does not exceed a certain magnitude amf 2 amf 1 and amf 2 denote the design flood hereafter df of levee downstream and instream flow requirements for sediment transport hereafter ifrst in the lower wr respectively generally scouring the sediment in the river channel is implemented under the premise of ensuring the safety of downstream levees therefore ifrst should be less than df the two types of return periods are associated with the probabilities of amf exceeding df and amf not exceeding ifrst shown in fig 3 a and b amf df and amf ifrst events are defined as dangerous events for the safety of a local flood control system otherwise amf df and amf ifrst events are conductive from the perspective of a local flood control system the ifrst amf df event is favorable for the system as shown in fig 3 c for the sake of simplicity the conditions of amf exceeding the df event amf not exceeding the ifrst event and amf ifrst or amf df are denoted as case 1 2 and 3 respectively the random variable x represents the year of the first occurrence of the previously mentioned events under the assumption of independence and stationarity probabilities of occurrence of the case 1 case 2 and case 3 events for the first time in year x x x 1 2 are expressed as follows mood et al 1974 salas and obeysekera 2014 du et al 2015 case 1 5 f x p x x 1 f amf df x 1 f amf df 1 p 1 x 1 p 1 where f x is the geometric probability law p 1 f amf df and f is the cumulative distribution function denoted as cdf of the annual flood discharge case 2 6 f x p x x 1 f amf ifrst x 1 f amf ifrst 1 p 2 x 1 p 2 where p 2 f amf ifrst case 3 7 f x p x x 1 f amf ifrst or amf df x 1 f amf ifrst or amf df 1 p 1 p 2 x 1 p 1 p 2 therefore the corresponding return period i e the expected value x is similarly the variance of x the expected value of the squared deviation from e x is expressed as 9 var x e x e x 2 e x 2 e x 2 1 p 1 p 1 2 case 1 1 p 2 p 2 2 case 2 1 p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 2 case 3 the coefficient of variation of x a standardized measure of the relative change of e x is defined as 10 cv x var x e x 1 p 1 case 1 1 p 2 case 2 1 p 1 p 2 case 3 in practical flood management risk is the probability of occurrence of an exceedance flood event dangerous or undesirable event over a given project life of n years salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 du et al 2015 fan et al 2016a b c therefore the hydrological risk can also be expressed as 11 risk x 1 n f x p 1 x 1 n 1 p 1 x 1 1 1 p 1 n case 1 p 2 x 1 n 1 p 2 x 1 1 1 p 2 n case 2 p 1 p 2 x 1 n 1 p 1 p 2 x 1 1 1 p 1 p 2 n case 3 note that the risk of failure can be computed from the return period t i e risk 1 1 1 t n the reliability which signifies the probability that a dangerous event will not occur within a project life of n years i e that a system will remain in a satisfactory case within its lifetime is defined as 12 reliability 1 risk 1 p 1 n case 1 1 p 2 n case 2 1 p 1 p 2 n case 3 risk eq 11 and reliability eq 12 are derived for case 1 case 3 and can be applied to other regions worldwide with similar flood control problems 4 2 bivariate flood risk analysis 4 2 1 copula function construction the copula as introduced by sklar 1959 is a powerful tool for modeling the dependence structures of individual variables the main advantage of copulas is that they allow modeling the joint dependence structure without any restrictions on marginal distributions therefore the copula function has been extensively used in the hydrology field zhang and singh 2006 karmakar and simonovic 2009 reddy and ganguli 2012 zhang et al 2012 fan et al 2016a b c fan et al 2017 xu et al 2017 a d dimensional copula is defined as a multivariate distribution function f 0 1 d 0 1 linking standard uniform marginal distributions formally the copula can be divided into two components individual univariate distributions and a copula function describing dependence structures between variables based on the copula and its parameter s according to sklar s theorem one d dimensional multivariate distribution function f for random variables x 1 x 2 x d with marginal distribution of f 1 f 2 fd can be expressed as 13 f x 1 x d c f 1 x 1 f d x d θ where θ is the copula parameter vector and f d x d f x x is the marginal distribution of x d tail dependence is another important property of a copula embrechts et al 2003 which can be used to measure the dependence among extremal random events for the sake of simplicity the theoretical details of the coefficient of tail dependence are referred to aas 2004 in the current work the ml method is used to estimate the copula parameter s the cramér von mises statistic cramér 1928 von mises 1931 is used for goodness of fit testing in the field of hydrology the elliptical copulas student t copula gaussian copula etc and archimedean copulas clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula etc are two most frequently used copula families genest et al 2007 kao and govindaraju 2008 ma et al 2013 sraj et al 2015 vernieuwe et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 chang et al 2016 in this study we select the student t copula appendix a to model the joint dependence structure between amf and pr there are several reasons behind this selection first compared to the bivariate student distribution marginals of student t copula are not restricted to the student t distribution with the same degrees of freedom rodriguez 2007 additionally the student t copula can capture the dependence between variables in the left and right tails without giving up flexibility to describe dependence in the center by contrast other popular copulas capture one pattern of tail dependence such as clayton copula gumbel copula or zero tail dependence such as gaussian copula frank copula however present study focuses on the dependence structure between pairs of amf and pr values in the left tail i e the lower left quadrant and right tail i e upper right quadrant as shown in fig 4 given the above the student t copula is employed to characterize the joint behavior of amf and pr values in this study readers interested in more theoretical details of the student t copula are referred to the papers by cambanis et al 1981 and fang et al 2002 4 2 2 joint return periods and risk to conduct a bivariate risk analysis the commonly used joint probability behaviors focus on the so called or and and cond events sraj et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 fig 4 displays the joint probabilities of or and and cond operators for case 1 and case 2 the corresponding joint probability behaviors for case 1 shown in the upper panel of fig 4 are expressed as 1 amf df or pr pr 2 amf df and pr pr and 3 amf df pr pr the joint probability behaviors for case 2 shown in the lower panel of fig 4 are 1 amf ifrst or pr pr 2 amf ifrst and pr pr and 3 amf ifrst pr pr from the perspective of a local flood control system there are various combinations of flood and precipitation events for the bivariate case additionally once the probabilities of the above joint probability behaviors for case 1 and case 2 are calculated that for case 3 can be derived by the addition and subtraction formula of probability and the generalized total probability formula therefore we restrict our attention to the bivariate joint probability behaviors for case 1 and case 2 in the current work for the sake of simplicity the joint return periods for case 1 also called primary return periods can be expressed as 14 t or 1 p amf df or pr pr 1 1 c f amf df f pr pr 15 t and 1 p amf df and pr pr 1 1 f amf df f pr pr c f amf df f pr pr 16 t cond 1 p amf df pr pr 1 p amf df pr pr p pr pr 1 1 f amf df f pr pr c f amf df f pr pr 1 f pr pr substituting eq 15 into eq 16 it can be found that eq 16 can also be written as t cond 1 f pr pr t and t and the primary return periods for the case 2 are defined as 17 t or 1 p amf ifrst or pr pr 1 f amf ifrst f pr pr c f amf ifrst f pr pr 18 t and 1 p amf ifrst and pr pr 1 c f amf ifrst f pr pr 19 t cond 1 p amf ifrst pr pr 1 p amf ifrst pr pr p pr pr 1 c f amf ifrst f pr pr f pr pr substituting eq 18 into eq 19 it can be found that eq 19 can be expressed as t cond f pr pr t and t and considering the above several inequalities between t or t and and t cond exist for any given copula 20 t or t and 21 t cond t and the corresponding risk and reliability associated with the return period of joint probability behaviors can be expressed as 22 risk 1 1 1 t n 23 reliability 1 1 t n 4 3 conditional statistics of amf under given precipitation scenarios in practical terms water resources managers want to identify how possible it is that amf exceeds or does not exceed certain thresholds under given extreme precipitation events therefore we examine the conditional probability of amf under various extreme precipitation scenarios the conditional exceedance probability of amf df given pr pr is defined as 24 f amf df pr pr 1 c f amf df f pr pr f pr pr 1 f amf df pr pr the conditional unexceedance probability of amf ifrst given pr pr is expressed as 25 f amf ifrst pr pr c f amf ifrst f pr pr f pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr according to the formula of holohedral probability and bayes formula the conditional probability that ifrst amf df given pr pr is denoted as 26 f ifrst amf df pr pr f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr given pr pr f min df ifrst amf max df ifrst pr pr denotes the probability of a flood peak discharge less than the design flood of levee downstream and higher than the instream flow requirement for sediment transport 4 4 uncertainty estimation for joint probability behaviors to determine the impact of sampling uncertainty on the evaluation of risk of bivariate extreme hydrometeorological events and conditional probabilities of amf given precipitation scenarios the following monte carlo based procedures motivated by serinaldi 2016 are designed 1 estimate the vector of parameters ξ ξ α x α y θ of the joint distribution h x y ξ c f x α x f y α y θ simultaneously using the ml method given in appendix b 2 simulate b bivariate samples of size n as z x y x ij y ij i 1 n j 1 b from the fitted bivariate model h x y ξ n is equal to the length of the observed sample b is set to 9999 in this study 3 estimate the vector of parameters ξ j for the simulated sample z j using the maximum likelihood method 4 compute the primary t or t and and t cond return periods for different x y pairs moreover compute the conditional probabilities of x under given different y scenarios 5 estimate confidence intervals for t or t and t cond and conditional probabilities at the 95 confidence level 5 results and discussion 5 1 marginal distribution selection to test the randomness of variables the autocorrelations for amf and pr series are computed and shown in fig s1 supplemental material it can be inferred from fig s1 that these autocorrelations cannot pass the significance test at the 5 significance level therefore we accept the hypothesis that amf and pr in the two study regions are random variables figs s2 and s3 illustrate the fitted marginal distributions by the gev p3 logn norm and gam distributions for the amf and pr series in the ucx and uch respectively the two figures both display relatively high degree of similarity among the five curves in the two regions the estimated parameters for these candidate distributions are displayed in table s1 supplemental material given the similarity among the five distributions we performed the k s goodness of fit test and estimated the aicc and bic to select the most appropriate distributions to model the amf and pr series the corresponding results exhibited in table s2 demonstrate that these candidate distributions are suitable for fitting the distribution of amf and pr series with the assist of aicc and bic indicators the gam distribution is selected as the most appropriate one to model the amf and pr series in the two regions 5 2 copula function construction once the marginal distribution is chosen the next step is to estimate the copula parameters the estimated parameters of the student t copula are listed in table 2 the goodness of fit statistics sn of the cramér von mises criterion and its associated p value based on n 9999 parametric bootstrap samples are also given in table 2 large value of sn indicates the large distance between the estimated and the empirical copulas p value 0 05 means that the estimated copula can be accepted at the 5 significance level results displayed in table 2 illustrate that the student t copula can be applied to model the dependence structure between amf and pr series in each region at 5 significance level 5 3 flood risk analysis for flood control and sediment transport 5 3 1 univariate flood risk analysis fig 5 displays the univariate flood return period and its associated confidence interval denoted as ci for case 1 and case 2 in the current work the sampling uncertainty related to the limited size of hydrological records is discovered by the monte carlo sampling method i e the parametric bootstrapping method the amf observations are resampled 9999 times and for each resample the gamma distribution is fitted thin gray lines in fig 5 in this study each simulation is generated from a random seed and the figure thus displays the effects of sampling variability on the simulated amf series to select the percentiles the 9999 quantile estimates are ranked the 250th and 9750th values are used to depict the 2 5 and 97 5 points of the distribution i e the 95 ci red dotted lines in fig 5 one can assess the risk of occurrence of different flood magnitudes for both flood control and sediment transport purposes from fig 5 the width of ci for flood return periods at the 95 confidence level is used to measure the uncertainty shown in fig 5 wider ci denotes larger uncertainty the results highlight that large uncertainties in univariate flood return periods exist for both case 1 and case 2 for a given return period the 95 ci of df involved in case 1 and ifrst involved in case 2 is wide specifically ci is wide for high flows and narrow for low flows in case 1 whereas it is the opposite in case 2 for case 1 for a univariate return period of 15 years in the ucx the df can span from 3873 to 5941 m3 s 34 81 difference for 20 years it ranges from 4165 to 6450 m3 s 35 43 difference as for case 2 in the ucx the ifrst for a univariate return period of 15 years at the 95 confidence interval spans from 287 to 695 m3 s 58 71 difference and for 20 years it spans from 234 to 613 m3 s 61 83 difference from the above it can be found that univariate flood frequency analyses for flood control and sediment transport both are plagued with considerable uncertainty the large uncertainty makes it difficult for the management departments to determine the scientific design flood for hydraulic engineering and flood control operation of reservoirs therefore reducing the uncertainty of flood return period estimation is essential for flood control in practice particularly the sampling uncertainty however it is worthy of note that although the length of hydrological records used in this study is comparatively long 55 years for a hydrological context it is still not sufficient to constrain the uncertainty to tight limits therefore as merz and blöschl 2008 and dung et al 2015 suggested increasing the information content by temporal spatial or causal data expansion such as the historical and paleo flood data is necessary and beneficial for responding such high uncertainty and obtain a more reliable estimation of flood return period as for selecting the suitable df for the hydraulic engineering e g levee dam and determining appropriate ifrst for sediment transport in the context of high uncertainty as hu et al 2013 suggested management departments can employ the point estimate of flood design value and add one modification value for it the modification value should be determined with the assist of ci of flood return periods apparently the larger the modification value is the lower risk of flood levee overflowing and the higher construction cost of the lee is otherwise the reverse specifically the importance of flood control objects is another one important reference factor when determining the modification value zhang et al 2014 discovered that the tongguan elevation decreases when flood peak discharge observed at huaxian station is 2000 m3 s and that the decrease degree is dramatic when flood peak discharge is 3000 m3 s li et al 2010 highlighted that flood peak discharge more than 2500 m3 s observed at huaxian station is significantly negatively correlated with the tongguan elevation flood peak discharge less than 2500 m3 s is insufficient to decrease the tongguan elevation therefore 2500 m3 s is treated in the current work as an effective ifrst in the wr basin local flood control departments have rechecked the flood control ability of hydraulic structures in the lower wr and suggested that the gauged flood discharge at huaxian station should be 5760 m3 s for the safety of the levee in the wr basin table 3 shows the risk and reliability of occurrence of different flood events for flood control and sediment transport in the wr basin the hydraulic project life is given as 10 years i e n 10 for the case 1 eq 11 with respect to sediment transport water sediment regulation by reservoirs is generally considered an effective measure to solve the sedimentation problem in the yellow river wang et al 2006 li and sheng 2011 miao et al 2016 wu et al 2016 suggested that the water sediment regulation can be performed every 3 years at least with the premise of meeting the water demands of agriculture industry and daily life therefore we define risk as the probability of occurrence of flood peak discharge less than 2500 m3 s over 3 years i e n 3 for the case 2 eq 11 take the uch for example it can be seen from table 3 that the probability of occurrence of the amf 5760 m3 s event i e case 1 is 0 05 95 ci 0 01 0 09 and that the corresponding return period reaches 22 14 years 95 ci 11 22 76 49 years during the design life of 10 years the risk that an amf 5760 m3 s event will occur before or at the 10th year is 0 37 95 ci 0 12 0 61 on the other hand within the 10 years the reliability that an amf 5760 m3 s event will not occur is 0 71 95 ci 0 46 0 92 in fact it can be deduced from the formulas of risk and reliability i e eqs 11 and 12 that the risk varies inversely to the return period while the reliability is proportional to the return period therefore if management departments tend to decrease the so called risk or increase the reliability in practice increasing the design flood level for levees is compulsory for the case 2 in the uch the probability that an amf 2500 m3 s event will occur is huge 0 66 95 ci 0 56 0 77 which means that this event will occur once every 1 51 years 95 ci 1 30 1 77 the corresponding risk reaches 0 96 95 ci 0 92 0 99 whereas the reliability is only 0 15 95 ci 0 08 0 26 the high risk implies that scouring sediment in the river channel depending merely on the natural flood event is insufficient therefore floodwater released by the reservoir in the upstream region of huaxian station is crucially important for sediment transport in the lower wr the dongzhuang reservoir located in the jinghe river the largest tributary of wr is under construction with completion scheduled by 2022 a primary goal of this reservoir is to conduct water sediment regulation to reduce the sedimentation in the lower wr and thus to decrease the flood risk then the tongguan elevation will be decreased consequently the safety of the flood control system in the lower wr will be further enhanced case 3 i e amf 5760 m3 s or amf 2500 m3 s reflects the events impairing the safety of the local flood control system therefore according to the addition formula of probability the probability of a case 3 event occurring is the sum of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 m3 s which is 0 69 95 ci 0 62 0 78 the probability is close to that of case 2 0 66 95 ci 0 56 0 77 it signifies that sedimentation will be the primary factor impairing the safety of the local flood control system therefore appropriate water sediment regulation scheme using the dongzhuang reservoir is of great significance for sediment transport in the wr basin and the sum of discharge from the dongzhuang reservoir and that gauged at xianyang station can t be 2500 m3 s in doing so probability of floods due to channel sedimentation will be reduced greatly 5 3 2 bivariate return period and risk analysis building the joint distribution of amf and pr and evaluating their bivariate risk are beneficial for better understanding risks between extreme hydro climatic events candela et al 2014 figs s4 and s5 supplemental material exhibit the primary return periods for flood control and sediment transport in the wr decision makers can identify the corresponding flood risk information for different flood and extreme precipitation events from figs 6and 7 which is extremely beneficial for practical flood control and mitigation fan et al 2016a b c in the lower wr 5760 and 2500 m3 s are critical thresholds for flood control and sediment transport therefore we calculated the return periods for different flood related events and their 95 ci in figs 6 and 7 and table 4 to provide more complete information note that in the ucx f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 calculated using the fitted gamma distribution are 0 9633 and 0 6635 respectively in the uch f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 are 0 9511 and 0 4708 respectively using the fitted gamma distribution of the pr 2 pr 3 series we calculated the values of pr 2 pr 3 with equal probabilities of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 events in the ucx uch listed in table 4 values of pr 2 with equal probabilities of f amf 5760 and f amf 2500 events in the ucx are 58 12 mm and 28 89 mm respectively while values of pr 3 in the uch are 52 96 mm and 26 95 mm respectively from figs 6 and 7 and table 4 it can be inferred that the uncertainties of bivariate return periods induced by the limited sample size are very large and should generate critical concern for future flood mitigation taking the uch as an example the t or for an amf 5760 or pr 3 48 32 event is 9 35 years 95 ci 5 65 21 52 years which overlaps that for amf 5760 or pr 3 67 37 i e 20 14 years 95 ci 10 10 66 87 years similarly the t or for an amf 2500 or pr 3 15 19 event is 2 06 years 95 ci 1 68 2 66 years which overlaps that for amf 2500 or pr 3 29 27 i e 1 5 years 95 ci 1 30 1 79 years this phenomenon i e the return periods overlap is also found in the works of serinaldi 2013 dung et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 serinaldi 2016 due to the considerable uncertainty of the flood risk assessment michailidi and bacchi 2017 stated that any attempt to obscure this uncertainty could create a false notion about its existence in a multivariate problem therefore taking the uncertainty into account when developing flood control policies is of critical importance specifically as suggested in section 5 3 1 management departments can improve the levee design standard and increase water release from reservoirs although it would increase the cost and decrease economic profit with the assist of the above uncertainty evaluation results for the sake of simplicity we don t display the risk and reliability results in figs 6 and 7 and table 4 if one is interested in the risk and reliability of different flood related events the derived eqs 22 and 23 can be used to compute risk and reliability on the basis of the return periods of different flood events these large uncertainties pose significant challenges for the design of hydraulic engineering and the development of flood control and mitigation scheme particularly the guanzhong plain an important chinese agricultural production region and xi an city known as one of the four major ancient civilization capitals both lie in the floodplain of the wr huang et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty of copula based risk analyses for this region should generate critical concern particularly when developing policies for flood control and hazard mitigation 5 4 conditional probabilities of amf under given extreme precipitation events based on the joint distribution of amf and pr the conditional probabilities of amf under given pr scenarios can be examined in present study according to the specific thresholds of flood peak discharge for flood control and sediment transport the conditional probabilities f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr and f ifrst amf df pr pr are explored these conditional probabilities help to identify the possibilities of the occurrence of amf df event amf ifrst event and ifrst amf df event under different extreme precipitation conditions in practice with the assist of rainfall forecast information management departments can deduce the conditional probabilities of different flood events by constructing the joint dependence between amf and pr and subsequently develop scientific flood control policies for flood control and sediment transport in practical terms given a potentially extreme future precipitation scenario the probabilities of the occurrence of specific flood peak discharge exceeding df not exceeding ifrst and varying in the domain ifrst df can be discovered from fig 8 this information would be important for performing effective flood control measures to ensure the safety of local flood control systems moreover we also discovered the uncertainties of these conditional probabilities the results are also shown in fig 8 from which a flood control department can identify the conditional probabilities and their 95 confidence intervals for any extreme precipitation scenarios of interest taking uch as an example conditioned on pr 3 52 96 mm in the future the conditional probabilities f amf df pr pr f amf ifrst pr pr and f ifrst amf df pr pr are 0 18 95 ci 0 06 0 38 0 12 95 ci 0 05 0 29 and 0 70 95 ci 0 50 0 79 respectively analogous to the uncertainty in the bivariate return periods estimation uncertainty in the conditional probability estimation in the two study regions is also noticeable 6 summary and conclusions in this study a univariate and bivariate hydrological risk framework is developed to perform flood risk analysis for flood control and sediment transport this framework considers both the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures and instream flow requirements for sediment transport consequently the univariate and bivariate return period risk and reliability are derived for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport the bivariate hydrological risk is examined by exploiting the copula based joint distribution model of annual maximum flood discharge amf and extreme precipitation pr moreover the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by the joint distribution of amf and pr this information is valuable for maintaining the safety of local flood control systems moreover one monte carlo based algorithm is proposed to disclose the impact of sampling uncertainty on hydrological risk evaluation in order to provide more robust and practical information for local flood control and hydraulic engineering design two sub catchments of the loess plateau ucx and uch the upper catchments of xianyang and huaxian stations are selected as the study regions floods and sedimentation in river channels in the two regions greatly impair the safety of local flood control systems our framework is thus used to analyze the hydrological risk in the study regions primary conclusions are shown as below sedimentation in river channels poses greater threat to the safety of flood control systems compared with the flood peak discharge exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the two sub catchments of the lp given this management departments should pay more attention on reservoir operation scheme for scouring sediment in river channel under the premise of ensuring the safe operation of hydraulic structures in the regions the uncertainties of univariate and bivariate flood risk in the uch and ucx are considerably large for example in the uch return periods of the amf 5760 m3 s or pr 58 12 mm event can reach between 9 53 and 59 99 years the considerable uncertainty should generate critical attention particularly when developing policies for flood control and mitigation specifically confronted with the great uncertainty of flood risk assessment to ensure the safety of human life and property during floods management departments can improve the levee design standard and increase water release from reservoirs for sediment delivery additionally by applying the conditional probability distributions of amf upon various extreme precipitation scenarios eqs 24 26 management departments can deduce the conditional probabilities of different flood events with the assist of rainfall forecast information and subsequently develop scientific flood relevant policies for flood control and sedimentation management the developed flood risk assessment framework can potentially help decision makers in flood control and mitigation by providing valuable insights toward assessing flood risk focusing on flood control and sediment transport in sandy regions this framework is also
