9655,table grape production requires large amount of water which can be problematic in semi arid mediterranean regions where climate change projections anticipated reductions in water availability associated to decreases in precipitation and increases in temperature in this context this study aims to evaluate the effect of contrasting irrigation strategies and climate change scenarios on key water balance variables using a chilean table grape crop as case study a standard and an improved irrigation management treatments were implemented in situ during the 2015 2016 and the 2016 2017 2017 2018 observed growing seasons respectively then the hydrus 1d water transfer model was run to simulate the three observed growing seasons and 27 near future growing seasons 2019 2020 2044 2015 under climate change conditions satisfactory calibration and validation results against soil moisture and water storage measurements were obtained within the first and the second observed growing seasons respectively rrmse values below 5 results during the observed seasons showed that by changing the standard irrigation by the improved irrigation management the water use efficiency wuei increases from 49 5 to 55 7 for the near future the calibrated model shows that under all the tested climate change scenarios irrigation strategies based on supplying 80 and 50 of the crop evapotranspiration etc deficit irrigation scenarios have larger efficiencies compared to the standard irrigation management presenting a higher actual basal crop coefficient and lower percolation similar results were obtained under future extreme climate change years defined as the ratio between model based projections of reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation with the deficit irrigation scenarios having larger efficiencies than the standard irrigation management based on these results it is concluded that by mid century the irrigation management has more relevance than climate change impacts for tables grapes growing under a mediterranean climate in central chile keywords table grapes hydrus global change irrigation strategies water balance 1 introduction table grape vitis vinifera l has presented a high expansion of the international trade and global consumption during the last decades with chile being among the 10 leading exporters of this fruit seccia et al 2015 table grape is a deciduous crop planted in overhead trellis systems and unlike wine grapes its production requires a large amount of water it is cultivated from the atacama desert in the north and throughout the central zone of chile 20 36 south latitude taking advantage of the beneficial climatic conditions and the water reservoirs provided by the near andes mountains that allow the supply of diverse markets according to the date of harvest in particular the aconcagua valley 32 5 s is one of the most important areas for grape production in the country where as rainfall is well below the atmospheric demand during the development of the crop irrigation is mandatory blanke and yuri 2020 in the area drip irrigation system is the most common technique for the production of fruits including tables grapes ciren odepa 2020 despite the declared efficiency of this technology actual irrigation amounts could be largely overestimated beyá marshall and galleguillos 2020 mediterranean climate areas are particularly prone to climate changes effects which have been reported to be already affected by increases in drought intensity and frequency garreaud et al 2017 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 lund et al 2018 verdon kidd et al 2017 in the case of central chile mediterranean region there is evidence that precipitation has decreased over the last 50 years ranging from 5 2 to 1 7 per decade garreaud et al 2020 2017 these trends are stronger that those obtained with climate change models under the rcp8 5 scenario for the 2006 and 2016 period boisier et al 2018 moreover precipitation reductions ranging from 10 to 20 and increases of 1 2 c in mean daily temperature are projected for the 2040 2070 period under the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 climate change scenarios respectively bozkurt et al 2018 as a consequence the 0 c isotherm will increase in altitude decreasing the area of snow reserves and affecting the spring and summer surface runoff thus water for reservoirs and irrigation in the period of maximum crop development could be limited barria et al 2019 on the other hand projections of increasing demand and competition for water food and agriculture organization food and agriculture organization fao 2014 frederiksen 2016 indicate that water availability for agriculture will become more scarce which may trigger a situation of high vulnerability and uncertainty for both productive processes and human consumption malek et al 2017 vicuña et al 2012 woznicki et al 2015 then to achieve sustainability in the table grape production judicious use of water and increases in irrigation efficiency are fundamental phogat et al 2017 typically the analyses of water use for crop production are based on experimental designs considering different irrigation water inputs where measurements of xylem potential sap flow and micrometeorological techniques novák 2012 are needed to monitor the water use in spite of their precision they usually require intensive field campaign with high labor and time costs dietrich et al 2016 phogat et al 2017 also these methods do not allow for continuous long term monitoring of the water use variables limiting their applicability for long term planning in this sense processes based numerical models become an attractive alternative to provide water use simulations of the different variables involved under plausible hypothetical conditions across spatial and temporal scales wilson et al 2001 hydrus šimůnek et al 2015 is a numerical model widely used to simulate water flow in soils under crop conditions this model has previously been used to study components of the water balance of various drip irrigated crops e g almonds phogat and et al 2012 2013a 2013b sorghum ramos et al 2012 citrus phogat et al 2014 corn arbat et al 2013 alfalfa kandelous et al 2012 laboratory experiments kandelous and šimůnek 2010 and in rainfed vineyards with the presence of water tables galleguillos et al 2017 some studies have demonstrated the capability of water transfers process based models to work with forced climate change data to evaluate the long term hydrological response within a agroecosystem examples under annual crops such as wheat bouras et al 2019 or maize abedinpour et al 2014 have been published with the aquacrop model but only few address perennial agroecosystems for instance hallema et al 2014 developed a hydrological scheme for a distributed simulation of local hydrology in a row culture system in quebec canada under different climate change scenarios analyzing the soil water dynamics until 2070 another example is the work of phogat et al 2018a where australian irrigated vineyards were evaluated under present and climate change scenarios however to our knowledge studies that analyze the table grape crops water use under current and climate change scenarios have not yet been conducted in this context this study aims to analyze the performance of different plausible irrigation strategies in production of table grapes under present climate and two near future climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the hydrus 1d water transfer model was implemented to simulate actual crop coefficient and percolation as indicators of irrigation performace to do that plausible irrigation strategies for table grapes were identified from a bibliographic analysis which were then implemented in the calibrated model and run for the near term future the performance of these strategies were compared against standard and improved irrigation managements during the 2015 2016 and the 2016 2017 2017 2018 observed growing seasons afterwards the performance of water use indicators for each identified irrigation strategies under selected future extreme dry and wet crop seasons were assessed 2 materials and methods for a

valparaiso region 32 43 47 s 70 35 48 w fig 2 vines or vitis vinifera l located on a 1 2 ha vineyard were trained on a spanish horizontal trellis system characterized by distances of 3 m between rows and 2 m between vines in this system the plants are conducted on crossed wires located 2 2 m above the surface to facilitate the passage of machinery it is suitable for flat or slightly sloping terrain it allows the cultivars to express all their natural vigor and prune them according to their fruiting habit blanco et al 2010 ibacache et al 1988 and a regular vegetation cover is obtained which is suitable for a 1 d model representation the standard irrigation management installed during the 2015 2016 season correspond to drippers of 4 l h 1 spaced at intervals of 1 m along the rows during winter of 2016 beginning of 2016 2017 growing season and improved irrigation management that considers drippers spaced at 50 cm with discharges of 2 l h 1 replaced the old configuration by implementing the improved irrigation management the average fruit yield varied from 28700 to 34780 kg ha 1 between the 2015 2016 and the 2017 2018 seasons with 90 of production destined for export depicting a high quality production objective according to köppen classification the study area has a cold steppe climate bsk s beck et al 2018 fig 2 with mean annual rainfall of about 259 mm and a

associated to mollic gleysols gm fao unesco 1971 soils of aconcagua valley have electrical conductivity ce values of the saturated soil extract below 0 8 ds m 1 which are below the value of 4 ds m 1 considered limiting for the development of the grapes sellés et al 2012 2 2 model description the hydrus 1d model simulates vertical flows of water solutes and heat in a variable saturation

plant is distributed proportionally to its root density in each horizon and is locally modulated by the soil moisture šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the modulation of the potential extraction by the plant is expressed using the function of feddes feddes et al 1978 the corresponding pressure head threshold values selected were those obtained by feddes et al 1978 for vitis vinifera 0 001 0 0025 0 01 and 0 08 kpa for h1 h2 h3 and h4 respectively hydrus 1d was ran at a daily scale for the observed growing seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 for calibration and verification purposes the model requires soil physical parameters crop cover information meteorological variables and irrigation registers to be able to compute water fluxes in addition soil moisture observations were used to calibrate values of soil parameters and assessed the performance of the model to reproduce soil water content at different depths and overall available soil water storage in addition the 2017 2018 observed season was run together with the 2018 2019 2044 2045 projected period at a daily scale 2 3 input of hydrus 2 3 1 soil hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions described by the van

sandbox 33 kpa corresponding to field capacity fc and 1500 kpa corresponding to permanent wilting point wp using the pressure chamber method dane and hopmans 2002 the particle size distribution was determined using the bouyoucos hydrometer method sandoval et al 2012 initialization values for parameters were taken from the rossetta algorithm and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and alpha α parameter values were calibrated using the inverse procedure available in the hydrus 1d software soil humidity measurements for calibration and verification purposes were made with an frequency domain reflectometry fdr probe model drill and drop sentek technologies with 6 nodes located every 10 cm until 60 cm depth where the roots are concentrated daily measurements were recorded following a standard calibration the final soil hydraulic parameters used in the hydrus 1d simulations are given in table 1 the simulated domain had an effective soil depth 100 cm that was observed in the soil pit boundary condition of the atmosphere at the soil surface includes rainfall irrigation potential soil evaporation ep and potential plant transpiration tp horizontal flow boundary conditions were not considered and a bottom free drainage boundary condition was set since no water table was observed 2 3 2 estimation of potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp hydrus 1 d requires daily estimates of potential transpiration tp and evaporation ep as input parameters in this study the daily inputs of tp and ep were estimated using the fao dual crop coefficient allen et al 2006 where the calculation of the crop basal coefficient kcb and the evaporation coefficient ke that modulate the potential evapotranspirative atmospheric demand are required the values of the basal crop coefficient kcb are specific for each species in its respective phenological stages therefore the maximum crop basal coefficient kcbmax was estimated according to the phenological cycle of the crop during the three simulated observed growing seasons to do that a regression model for the 2017 2018 observed season was calibrated between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained from landsat oli tirs products the leaf area index lai and the intercepted fraction if derived from photosynthetically active radiation par measurements collected in situ during the same period 7 measurements from october to july in 6 marked plants a linear ceptometer ss1 sunscan delta t devices and mobile grids were used to emulate the crop frame the lai ndvi and if ndvi regression models showed an r2 of 0 74 and 0 71 respectively which allowed generating a predictive model of crop coefficient basal and evaporation thus being able to reproduce the existing crop cover conditions in previous seasons from satellite information only the equations obtained are lai 10 52 x ndvi 3 94 and if 1 65 ndvi 0 55 the etc data used to define the future irrigation scenarios were determined by the sum of hydrus 1d computations of potential transpiration and potential evaporation according to fao dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 2006 2 4 evaluation of the model the time cycle of the daily simulations including the warm up period was 990 days the evaluations of the balance were limited to the growing season period that starts the 15th of september till the 30th of april 228 days for each season the modelling outputs during calibration and verfication periods were assessed by estimating four statistical metrics i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse percentage of bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 these errors were calculated from the measured and simulated water content for the first two observed climate seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 at all depths 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm from november 1 to may 31 components of water balance for the three observed seasons 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 were analyzed and discussed in detail to assess the irrigation water productivity wpi defined as the ratio between the marketable yield produced by a crop along the growing season and the irrigation water applied iwu within the same period fernández et al 2020 2 5 identification of irrigation strategies a systematic bibliographic review was carried out to determine the irrigation strategies that are currently being used all over the world for the cultivation of table grapes emphasis was placed on the available water sources quantities of water applied frequency of irrigation and the effects in bunches and berries characteristics for the differents strategies the following keywords were chosen irrigation strategies irrigation distribution water availability productivity controlled deficit irrigation and adaptations to global change the search was carried out in the databases of the information services and libraries of the university of chile like isi web of science science direct wiley and springer the results of the bibliographic review showed that across different climates and cultivars the reduction of a certain percentage in the amount of irrigation does not affect yield and quality of table grapes production it has been reported that for reductions ranging from 10 to 20 respect to etc the yields show certain decreases that are not statistically significant and most importantly maintain both the characteristics of the bunch and the berry and that at the same time allow water savings close to 2000 m3ha 1 permanhani et al 2016 however the reduction of water irrigation presents a limit where it begins to affect yield and or morphophysiological characteristics when reductions exceed 50 of etc the yield is strongly affected in the case of red globe and italy an irrigation with 40 of the potential crop demand produces yield falls of 9 and 10 ton ha 1 respectively with significant alterations in the characteristics of bunch and berry table 2 in summary as for all the varieties of table grapes a reduction to 80 of the etc in irrigation does not affect the yield and quality of the fruit this was considered as the irrigation strategy to be implemented in the study also an irrigation strategy of 50 the etc was considered to represent a sharp decrease in water availability scenario which according to climate change projections on water resources in the aconcagua catchment is a plausible condition dirección general de aguas 2018 these scenarios were implemented in simulations for observed and future climate conditions 2 6 climate change data processing climate change cc data was obtained from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset thrasher and nemani 2015 which comprises an ensemble of 21 general circulation models gcm under two emission scenarios coordinated under the cmip5 project the 21 models correspond to daily time series of simulated precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees 25 km x 25 km the anthropogenic forcing scenarios considered in this study correspond to the risk adverse rcp8 5 and the moderate rcp4 5 scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 which for the near future span plausible warming conditions consistent with the drying trend observed in central chile during the last 4 decades garreaud e tal 2021 boisier et al 2018 and the persistent megadrought of the last 11 years garreaud et al 2020 these models were bias corrected at the local scale using the cr2met centro de ciencias del clima y la resiliencia cr2 2020a 2020b dataset as reference the quantile mapping method kim et al 2015 piani et al 2010 equation below was employed to fit the probability distribution of the observed daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature χ cor f 1 f χ model α model β model α obs β obs where χ cor is the bias corrected value of the gcm χ model is the value obtained by the gcm for a given emission scenario f is the cumulative distribution function cdf gamma of the gcm control period and f 1 is the inverse function of f α is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter the subscripts model and obs indicate the parameters of the gcm and the observed variable respectively daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for the 2019 2046 period were obtained directly from the bias corrected gcm and future potential daily evapotranspiration pet were computed following the hargreaves samani formulation novák 2012 future values of et0 penman monteith required for hydrus simulations were obtained from a linear relationship generated between the values of et0 penman monteith and pet hargreaves samani during the observed growing seasons coefficient of this regression et0 0 76 pet 0 225 r2 0 87 were applied to pet future data to obtain projected et0 to run hydrus simulations for the future scenarios were ran following these conditions i the soil parameters correspond to the values obtained in the calibration season ii the same depth horizons and effective soil depth configurations of the observed period were established iii the basal kc and ke were obtained by averaging the three observed seasons of lai and if assuming a similar canopy crop conditions until mid century tp and ep values along with daily rainfall at the study site during the simulation period were used as time varying upper boundary conditions in the model in relation to the lower boundary conditions simulations were performed with a variable flow condition as opposed to free drainage used for the observed period the modification to parameterization is due to the model was unable to converge during some days of intense and frequent rainfall predicted by the gcm models where a shallow water table could appear due to deeper soil hydraulic discontinuities not detected in the first meter of soil these daily input data simulations were used to run hydrus 1d and simulate water transfers for 9970 day simulation starting on september 15 2019 until december 31 2046 table grape growing seasons defined from middle september until the end of april of the following year are considered for further analysis 2 7 scenarios analysis actual basal crop coefficient akcb defined as the ratio of actual to potential transpiration was chosen as indicator of irrigation performance because it represents the plant hydric stress sensitivity as is modulated by atmospheric demand and soil water availability processes allen et al 2006 paço et al 2014 percolation defined as the cumulative sum of water percolate from the bottom of the first meter soil profile at the end of the season was also chosen since its represent an amount of water loss locally to acquifer xu et al 2017 and because is closely related with potential leaching of fertilizers usually transported with water flow to acquifers williams and kissel 2015 the akcb the percolation and other water balance components were compared between the standard irrigation management and the simulations obtained under hypothetic water restrictions of 50 and 80 etc for the three observed seasons future scenarios were defined according to the bibliographic review of irrigation strategies table 2 and to the rcp climate change projections eight scenario configurations displayed in table 3 were implemented two are based on a business as usual irrigation strategies with 115 of etc bau 1 and bau 2 representing the standard irrigation management for table grapes in chile these scenarios were in agreement with the first observed season standard irrigation strategy where a 114 of etc was applied two mild irrigation scenarios mi 1 and mi 2 with 100 of the etc were also implemented in hydrus these scenarios were in agreement with the improved irrigation management implemented during the 2016 2017 observed season see study site for details four deficit irrigation scenarios were proposed according to the bibliographic review two with a moderate deficit with irrigations of 80 of etc mdi 1 and mdi 2 and two severe deficit with only 50 of etc sdi 1 and sdi 2 a confidence interval method based on the dunnet test available in the r statistical package nparcomp konietschke et al 2015 was implemented to contrast simulations of akcb and percolation of the different irrigation strategies under present and future climate conditions three future extreme dry and wet crop seasons were identified for each rcp climate change scenario based on the ratio of evapotranspiration and precipitation for the hydrological year may 1 to march 31 a dry year correspond to high values of this ratio i e high rates of et0 and low rainfall values the opposite situation was considered for wet years years were ranked according to the ratio and three extreme dry and extreme wet years were chosen daily akcb and percolation values for each irrigation strategy were averaged for these years these values were considered for comparison against the standard irrigation strategy using the confidence interval method 3 results 3 1 performance of the model the consistency of the hydrus 1d simulations were assessed during the calibration november 1 of 2015 to may 31 of 2016 and verification november 1 of 2016 to may 31 of 2017 periods by analyzing the residual calibration errors i e the differences between the measured and the simulated soil moisture profiles for each depth the analysis was performed considering the residual calibration errors as a function of the soil depth the residual calibration error during the simulation period and the differences between measurements and simulations for soil water storage the mean relative rmse profile i e the ratio of absolute rmse to mean observed value marked as rrmse for calibration period ranged from 10 8 to 8 8 with a mean value of 9 9 fig 3a the highest values of rmse and rrmse were observed around the depths of 40 and 60 cm the rmse also varied from one depth to another with values ranging from 29 5 in the 10 cm to 40 1 mm 60 cm for the verification period the rmse varies from 39 9 to 29 0 mm and the rrmse varies from 13 9 to 10 1 according to depth with an average value of 12 6 fig 3b as shown in fig 4 the rmse between in situ soil moisture water storage and hydrus 1d outputs was estimated in 9 83 mm 2 66 relative for calibration and 11 9 mm 3 12 relative for verification periods a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 71 was obtained for calibration period and of 0 63 for verificacion period indicating a good performance of the model the visual inspection of the simulated times series of water storage shows a good representation of the dynamics of water content in the soil fig 4b with respect to the temporal dynamics of soil water storage a high adjustment is observed between simulated and measured values for the period of active root functioning december to the end of april 3 2 observed period water use efficiency and water balance soil water balances during the observed seasons showed differences in quantity frequency and dates of irrigations fig 5 evidencing changes in the irrigation managements implemented during the 2016 2017 season more irrigation was applied in the first stages of plant growth in comparison to 2015 2016 reducing the contributions made in the middle and final stages of the crop where total leaf development and berry growth were completed the contribution of irrigation for all the studied seasons is shown in table 4 regarding water balance components table 4 there is a clear change in efficiency when introducing this new irrigation strategy indeed 66 of the water entering the system considering precipitation is used as evapotranspiration and a 31 correspond to loss as percolation in the first season compared to 93 used in evapotranspiration and 10 loss as percolation in average for the second and third observed seasons since actual transpiration does not reach its potential a slight excess water stress is evident in all observed seasons actual transpiration deficits of 14 5 and 2 in comparison to the potential transpiration were observed during the first second and third seasons respectively that is explained by changes in the amount of water applied for irrigation with respect to etc potential of the crop which decreased from 114 to 87 of the et0 a large temporal dynamic was noticed during the three observed seasons with seasonal variations of daily actual evapotranspiration eta values between 0 12 and 5 4 mm d 1 0 71 4 6 mm d 1 and 0 4 4 7 for the first second and third seasons respectively for the first season 2015 2016 during the spring and fall months no excess water stress was observed since the evapotranspiration rates were close to the reference evapotranspiration et0 and because they correspond to the beginning and end of the irrigation season characterized by less frequent irrigations the second and third observed irrigation seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 presented an evaporation rate very close to the et0 during the spring and fall months for the months of december january and february summer in the first two observed seasons the eta does not reach the estimated potential since these months normally concentrate the maximum frequency and lenght of irrigations the excess of water may be the reason why the eta does not reach its potential respect to irrigation water productivity wpi a considerable improvement was observed from the first to the second and third observed seasons with an increase of 55 7 and 43 1 respectively at the same time a decrease in the consumption of irrigation water was observed for the second 22 and third season 28 these changes in the water balance components represent an increase in the production of field fruit 21 in the second and 7 in the third table 4 as reported by the indicators the performance of the standard irrigation management showed important flaws during the 2015 2016 growing season high frequency and a large amount of water were applied to the crops reaching until 30 mm every two or three days in each irrigation this irrigation management produced very low akcb values reaching almost 0 in the middle of the season and high percolation amounts during the same period fig 5 the analysis for alternative irrigation strategies under observed climate conditions showed irrigation volumes varying between 5906 8250 m3ha 1 for bau 6370 4938 m3 ha 1 for the mdi and 3982 3086 m3 ha 1 for the sdi scenarios these irrigation volumes may produce changes in the performance indicators under the sdi treatment a decrease in akcb is observed from november until the end of the season for the three simulated seasons with values of akcb descending to 0 5 fig 5 for mdi actual transpiration remains relatively close to its potential being slightly higher during the two first seasons and similar during the third observed season showing average akcb values varying from 0 92 to 0 97 fig 5 these values are similar to those reported under observed conditions regarding percolation larger differences were simulated with respect to standard irrigation management for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons with amounts varyng from 2 to 4 6 mm instead of the 86 3 295 3 mm computed for the present condition supplementary material 1 season 2017 2018 showed similar results with respect to standard management mainly explained by a strong precipitation event that totaled 73 2 mm at the beginning of the season which produces a large amount of percolation 3 3 evaluation of water balance components for different irrigation strategies under climate change scenarios for a better understanding of the projected water balance components it is relevant to examine the future climate projections in the area a quick assessment of the et0 time series projected under the cmip5 ensemble of climate change models for the next 27 hydrological years is shown in supplementary material 2 yearly et0 during this period 2019 2046 varied from 812 3 to 1037 5 mm year 1 under the rcp4 5 with an average of 1009 9 41 42 mm year 1 for the case of rcp8 5 scenario the projected et0 varied from 809 42 to 1055 0 mm year 1 with an average value of 1016 7 45 7 mm year 1 an increasing trend is observed for both climate change scenarios with values around 7 3 9 2 larger than historical et0 at the end of the period considering the 2015 2018 period the bias corrected gcm precipitation time series for the same period is shown in the supplementary material 3 simulations of yearly precipitations for the future period 2019 2046 under the rcp4 5 scenario indicate values ranging around 196 7 and 298 4 mm with an average of 242 6 26 8 while for the rcp8 5 they ranged from 194 65 to 293 7 mm with an average of 243 7 27 3 mm per year an increasing trend is also observed for both scenarios and values at the end of the period are 7 3 10 5 larger than present values since 2015 2018 supplementary material 3 for the crop growing season increases of 7 8 10 1 in the et0 were obtained by the end of the period for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively compared to the observed period projections of precipitation indicate decreasing trends of 27 7 and 37 less than observed years 2015 2018 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively supplementary material 2 the growing season mean akcb during the 2019 2045 period obtained under the cc projections presents low variability until the middle of the century current irrigation strategies applied under both cc future conditions may produce lower akcb than scenarios with lesser amount of irrigation fig 6 according to the et0 pp ratio calculated for the hidrological year the driest irrigation season identified under the rcp4 5 scenario was the 2044 2045 year which correspond to the year with minimum accumulated precipitation of the study period this season together with the 2034 2035 showed the worst performance of akcb for the sdi 1 scenarios fig 6 not affecting notoriously the performance of the other scenarios for the rcp8 5 the driest growing season was the 2037 2038 year where the mean akcb under the sdi strategy is similar to the response under the mdi strategy after the season 2033 2034 the akcb performance of sdi 2 is slightly worse than mdi 2 but is always better in term of percolation during the rest of the growing seasons the best performance according to the akcb is obtained under the mdi 1 and sdi 2 scenarios with values varying from 0 92 to 0 97 and from 0 92 to 0 96 respectively mean akcb are 0 92 0 004 0 95 0 001 0 96 0 001 0 97 0 007 for bau 1 mi 1 mdi 1 and sdi 2 scenarios respectively furterhmore mean akcb values are 0 92 0 003 0 95 0 001 0 96 0 001 and 0 96 0 008 for the bau 2 mi 2 mdi 2 and sdi 2 scenarios respectively regarding percolation as expected the greater amounts are obtained under the control irrigation scenarios bau 1 and bau 2 with varying amounts within each season and until the middle of the century the largest percolation losses are simulated under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7 each time irrigation volume is reduced the simulated percolation decreases with an average of 213 3 17 106 16 9 1 23 2 5 0 12 0 25 mm under the scenarios bau 1 mi 1 mdi 1 and sdi 1 respectively percolation reductions of 223 6 11 7 106 3 8 22 1 6 3 0 2 0 5 mm were simulated under the bau 2 mi 2 mdi 2 and sdi 2 respectively the analysis of future wet extreme growing seasons showed that under the rcp4 5 climate scenario wet years depicted an average simulated et0 of 1006 14 8 mm in the season may to end of march and of 287 8 9 3 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 3 5 0 06 meanwhile dry growing seasons shows in average an et0 of 1036 mm 1 7 and 204 4 6 7 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 5 1 0 17 for the rcp8 5 wet years depicted an average of et0 of 1018 27 7 mm and 280 7 11 7 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 3 6 0 2 while dry growing seasons showed an et0 of 1026 4 20 6 mm and 198 2 9 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 5 2 0 15 significant differences for akcb were found during the extreme growing seasons under both emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the wet seasons of rcp4 5 showed significant differences between the control and the three scenarios fig 8a with highest differences simulated under the mdi 1 scenario in contrast during dry growing seasons fig 8b the greatest difference is observed in sdi 1 similar results were observed under the rcp8 5 climate scenario where significant differences between the control bau 2 and the other irrigation scenarios were simulated during the extreme wet growing seasons based on the akcb a better performance is obtained with the mdi 2 scenario fig 8c and during dry seasons similar significant differences were observed with better performance of sdi 2 fig 8d significant differences were also observed across irrigation scenarios for percolation fig 9 however percolation indicates values lower than the standard bau 1 2 in fig 9 with the greater difference for the sdi 1 scenario 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the model the performance of the model here calibrated to simulate water content r2 0 71 and 0 63 is similar to results reported in previous studies that used hydrus in irrigated crops arbat et al 2005 phogat et al 2018a 2017 2014 2013b 2013a tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 2012 furthermore all the soil parameter values are within the ranges reported in the literature phogat et al 2018b 2018a 2017 2016 although the model used in this study has a good performance at a local scale the satisfactory simulation of soil moisture anticipates the potential of applying this methodology at the field level and have a reliable representation of the temporal behaviour of soil moisture the greatest differences in soil water storage simulations were obtained at the end of the winter period and during spring after large or prolonged rainfall which could be explained by an inadequate characterization of vegetation functioning and or the lack of consideration for lateral water flows within the vadose zone galleguillos et al 2017 2011 it is known that the root profile changes in response to spatial and temporal distributions of water in the soil following a physiological optimization that minimizes the carbon cost of the root system and satisfies the water demand of the canopy neumann and cardon 2012 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 this unbalance could be explained by changes in the spatial distribution of water content on soil where rainfall produce a well distributed water content contrary to the located root distribution induced by irrigation drip systems the complete root architecture and hydraulic properties of the root system are important in assessing the three dimensional variability of water distribution šejna and genuchten 2018 in this sense the one dimensional approach applied in this study could undermine the effect of the real distribution of roots during these rainy periods reducing the model performance finally as the model is limited to an effective soil depth of one meter the possible existence of soil discontinuities below this depth that generate a perched watertable or changes in the water infiltration rate are not considered šimůnek et al 2015 4 2 model uncertainties the modeling exercise carried out does not contain a physiological representation that considers the adaptation of plants to a changing environment this is relevant to be considered in future assessments as increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations have been reported noaa esrl 2020 which may change the vegetation functioning and water consumption an instantaneous response to high atmospheric co2 is an increase in photosynthesis and a decrease in transpiration due to the increase availability of substrate for c fixation and partial closure of the stomas respectively kizildeniz et al 2018 2015 rogiers et al 2011 as a result the rate of water loss from leaves or transpiration is reduced kimball 2016 as in other c3 species the most common of the three metabolic carbon fixation pathways where photosynthesis is limited by the availability of co2 the vine responds to the increase in co2 with an increase in vegetative growth and yield however long term exposure to co2 leads to a phenomenon known as photosynthetic acclimatization or downward regulation which decreases the photosynthetic capacity of the vine resulting in less clear effects on the physiology and growth of the vine kizildeniz et al 2018 the representation of the functioning of agricultural systems using process based models is a complex exercise since it requires a large number of parameters and variables physical properties of the soil moisture profile root distribution canopy structure water inputs and outputs among others which could increase uncertainty galleguillos et al 2011 include physiological adaptations in a future context introduces a major challenge that requires experimental conditions difficult to achieve in the field and only replicable in greenhouses with controlled conditions kizildeniz et al 2018 2015 martínez lüscher et al 2015 in that way the selected approach represents an operational alternative for predicting the water balance in future scenarios especially in medium term temporal windows such as this study 4 3 irrigation management and water balance components as previously indicated a change in the irrigation management was implemented during the observed period which improved the water use efficiency akcb changes from 14 to 3 the irrigation system was improved from a single line of drippers spaced at 1 m with 4 l h 1 to a double line with drippers spaced at 50 cm and 2 l h 1 in addition irrigation length and frequency was implemented based on soil moisture threshold defined according to the probe observations beyá marshall et al 2021 beyá marshall and galleguillos 2020 by doing that the evaporation disminished 26 6 and 24 3 of total evapotranspiration during second and third observed growing seasons within satisfactory margins for this irrigation and soil type er raki et al 2010 these decrease could be explained by the reductions in irrigation lenght and frequency that avoid lateral wetting of the irrigated bulb and by an earlier increase of the leaf area index during spring data not shown which implies an earlier canopy full coverage with lesser direct sun exposure of the bare soil in relation to actual evapotranspiration eta which is directly linked to akcb values three important results stand out a simulated maximum daily et rates under optimal conditions showed similar values 5 mm d 1 than those reported in studies using lysimeters in the same valley but for crimson and thompson seedless cultivars ferreyra et al 2006 villagra et al 2014 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 simulations of eta have also been reported for hydrus 1d under rainfed vineyards in southern france when comparing against eddy covariance measurements galleguillos et al 2017 this highlights the potential of hydrus 1d as a tool for estimating water requirements for vitis vinifera on a farm scale under different soil water management conditions irrigation or rainfed b a considerable decreased in the akcb was simulated during the end of december despite an important atmospheric demand and good vegetation coverage a possible explanation could be a malfunctioning of transpiration process caused by root hypoxia or anoxia triggered by a prolonged period of saturated water condition due to excesive time and frequency of irrigation friedman and naftaliev 2012 c the percolation efficiency expressed as the percentage of irrigated water applied showed an important improvement from 35 8 during the first season standard irrigation management to 13 4 and 9 6 when the deficit irrigation strategy was applied during the second and third observed season respectively this results depict an improvement of the water management strategy adopted the latter observed seasons as reported by other studies in the literature table 2 this case of study improved its productivity when managing irrigation based on water deficit strategies reductions of irrigation volumes ranging from 18 to 27 applied during the second and third observed season generate water savings of about 2000 m3 ha 1 and wuei increases ranging from 3 48 to 5 42 kg m 3 this is concordant with a study carried out in the same aconcagua valley but for thompson seedlesss table grape cultivar which established that a 50 reduction of etc from 1 2 etc to 0 6 etc produces a decrease of water uso of almost 7000 m3ha 1 with no significant reduction in yield and increases on wuei of 3 kg m 3 from 2 3 to 5 3 kg m 3 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 according to the results obtained under alternative irrigations scenarios during the observed period important saving of water could be obtained e g 2500 m3ha 1 for season 2015 2016 irrigating an 80 of the etc in fact for the local climatic conditions optimal yield and berry weight can be obtained under that irrigation configuration while respecting the 4000 m3ha 1 of minimum irrigation amount as a threshold williams et al 2010 other studies show that simply reducing the irrigation threshold in terms of etc 70 80 or stopping it around 13 21 days before harvest saves a considerable amount of water from 300 m3 ha 1 to 2400 3000 m3 ha 1 per season without affecting the yield or quality conesa et al 2016 2014 serman et al 2004 in chile studies of crimson seedless table grape showed that irrigation deficit of 75 of the etc approximately 8500 m3 ha 1 does not cause significant losses in exportable fruit compared to the fully irrigated control allowing a water saving of about 2800 m3 ha 1 throughout the season ferreyra et al 2006 similarly gálvez et al 2014 applied deficit irrigation strategies for red globe and thompson seedless testing irrigation reductions of 5620 m3 ha 1 50 total irrigation and 487 m3 ha 1 which did not compromise the yield or bunch quality furthermore increases in the wue for red globe from 4 4 to 9 8 kg m 3 and from 2 9 to 3 1 kg m 3 for thompson were obtained which agrees with the wue obtained in this study 4 4 sensitivity of water balance components to global change scenarios in the study area near term cc projections for the forcing variables shows a clear increasing tendency for et0 and a not so pronounced decrease of precipitation when comparing with the observed period supplementary material 2 and 3 this can be explained because the last ten hydrological years 2010 2020 have been affected by the so called mega drought event garreaud et al 2017 during the megadrought reductions of about 34 have been observed in the aconcagua catchment agromet 2021 centro de ciencia del clima y la resiliencia cr2 2020b and although gcms project drier futures in the catchment the occurrence of a 10 year drought with the magnitude of the md is still very unlikely as indicated in the supplementary material 4 the md has an exceedance probability of about 100 under the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 scenario based on the blue line and only few gcms simulations 4 of 21 show that the md would have an exceedance probability of about 85 very unlikely during the following decades furthermore this study was conducting using the cmip5 ensamble of models currently the cmip6 ensamble is available which has been reported to have a larger climate sensitivity zelinka et al 2019 implying the results here presented could be an underestimation of future climate change the sdi and the mdi irrigation strategies demonstrated good performance for the akcb and the percolations indicators under observed conditions mdi largely surpass the bau and the sdi irrigation strategies this was validaded by the implemented field strategy during the second and third observed season which correspond to approximately the 80 of etc the wuei indicator reinforces this result by including the productivity term which is relevant for the industry at the moment of deciding for an irrigation criteria the sdi irrigation strategy is not recommended under megadrought conditions because the reduction of akcb is explained by an hydric stress condition that would likely also affect productivity gálvez et al 2014 permanhani et al 2016 temnani et al 2021 weiler et al 2019 when analizing the same strategies under future contrasting climate change scenarios both deficit irrigation strategies showed better performances than the standard irrigation management strategy although an akcb reduction was expected under the sdi scenario due to hydric stress this was only obtained under dry future seasons this can be explained by the occurrences of projected rainfalls that provide additional water to the system especially during spring and summer months which have not occurred under current megadrought scenario in spite of the good performance of the restricted irrigation strategy it should be taken with caution since productivity was not simulated by the model and even if akcb could demonstrated and adequate yearly hydric status a certain degree of hydric stress in specific periods could affect key physiological process such as stem water potential and stomatal conductance gálvez et al 2014 weiler et al 2019 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 and hence affecting exportable fruit produced permanhani et al 2016 this is why the mdi irrigation strategy appears to be the better compromise of increase of akcb and reduction of percolation while not compromising crop productivity gálvez et al 2014 williams et al 2010 actual transpiration obtained by hydrus 1d is directly associated with the function of feddes where soil potential that defines the extraction of water by the roots is modulated by four threshold values feddes et al 1978 in this representation a sharp decrease in transpiration is expected when excess water is present in the soil which is not so pronounced for hydric stress conditions this is why bau scenarios always performed worse than the deficit irrigation scenarios this is observed for both akcb and percolation indicators under present climate conditions and under the two contrasting climate change scenarios according to climate change projections important rainfall events could occur during crop seasons for the near term future this phenomena can lead to large percolation amounts which can cause more than only local loss of water to acquifers but also the accelerated transport of agrochemicals affecting water quality and hence human population and ecosystems li et al 2018 puckett and survey 2011 it is recommended to estimate and correct water demands based on year by year projections considering the intrinsic uncertainty and the local irrigation system barik et al 2017 precise short term forecasting of precipitation and availability of water in the catchment and its distribution should be considered in irrigation strategies to prevent the effect of future extreme rainfalls cao et al 2019 the study area is currently under water availability restrictions and changes in the projected hydrometeorological conditions may further exacerbate this situation affecting agriculture especially those who required large amount of water to produce exportable fruit bozkurt et al 2018 dirección general de aguas 2018 efforts should be taken to improve water irrigation efficiency with the inclusion of validated novel technological tools such as the use of soil moisture probes remote sensing data and process based models beyá marshall and galleguillos 2020 callejas et al 2014 this efforts have demonstrated to increase efficiency and productivity in different agricultural systems elliot et al 2014 5 conclusions satisfactory daily simulations of water transfers variables for three observed growing seasons were achieved with hydrus 1d model applied on a drip irrigated table grape crop from a mediterranean climate region of chile actual basal crop coefficients akcb of 0 82 0 95 and 0 97 were determined for the crop during the observed period large inefficiencies in term of akcb and percolation were identified for the standard irrigation management where several cases of stressed plant roots caused by excess water in the soil were observed differences in irrigation efficiencies were monitored when irrigation set up was modified with 80 of etc defined as the better irrigation strategy under current climate conditions after forcing the model with the constrasting rcp climate change scenarios the deficit irrigation strategies of 80 and 50 etc always presented a better performance in terms of akcb and percolation than the current standard irrigation management especially under near future extreme dry and wet scenarios this study demonstrated that deficit irrigation strategies compared to those currently used guarantee better production and lower water consumption this relationship of improvement in the irrigation water management strategy is consistently projected under near future climate change scenarios demonstrating that irrigation management has a greater impact than the future agro climatic conditions of the site this can be explained as the irrigation treatment defines when and how much water enters the system allowing or preventing the plant from transpiring satisfactorily this is an important contribution to the discussion on adaptation measures toward water security in water stressed regions with high irrigation requirements to strenghten the results future work should consider more model repetitions considering table grape plots representive of different climatic irrigation management and productive conditions in order to make a more

9655,table grape production requires large amount of water which can be problematic in semi arid mediterranean regions where climate change projections anticipated reductions in water availability associated to decreases in precipitation and increases in temperature in this context this study aims to evaluate the effect of contrasting irrigation strategies and climate change scenarios on key water balance variables using a chilean table grape crop as case study a standard and an improved irrigation management treatments were implemented in situ during the 2015 2016 and the 2016 2017 2017 2018 observed growing seasons respectively then the hydrus 1d water transfer model was run to simulate the three observed growing seasons and 27 near future growing seasons 2019 2020 2044 2015 under climate change conditions satisfactory calibration and validation results against soil moisture and water storage measurements were obtained within the first and the second observed growing seasons respectively rrmse values below 5 results during the observed seasons showed that by changing the standard irrigation by the improved irrigation management the water use efficiency wuei increases from 49 5 to 55 7 for the near future the calibrated model shows that under all the tested climate change scenarios irrigation strategies based on supplying 80 and 50 of the crop evapotranspiration etc deficit irrigation scenarios have larger efficiencies compared to the standard irrigation management presenting a higher actual basal crop coefficient and lower percolation similar results were obtained under future extreme climate change years defined as the ratio between model based projections of reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation with the deficit irrigation scenarios having larger efficiencies than the standard irrigation management based on these results it is concluded that by mid century the irrigation management has more relevance than climate change impacts for tables grapes growing under a mediterranean climate in central chile keywords table grapes hydrus global change irrigation strategies water balance 1 introduction table grape vitis vinifera l has presented a high expansion of the international trade and global consumption during the last decades with chile being among the 10 leading exporters of this fruit seccia et al 2015 table grape is a deciduous crop planted in overhead trellis systems and unlike wine grapes its production requires a large amount of water it is cultivated from the atacama desert in the north and throughout the central zone of chile 20 36 south latitude taking advantage of the beneficial climatic conditions and the water reservoirs provided by the near andes mountains that allow the supply of diverse markets according to the date of harvest in particular the aconcagua valley 32 5 s is one of the most important areas for grape production in the country where as rainfall is well below the atmospheric demand during the development of the crop irrigation is mandatory blanke and yuri 2020 in the area drip irrigation system is the most common technique for the production of fruits including tables grapes ciren odepa 2020 despite the declared efficiency of this technology actual irrigation amounts could be largely overestimated beyá marshall and galleguillos 2020 mediterranean climate areas are particularly prone to climate changes effects which have been reported to be already affected by increases in drought intensity and frequency garreaud et al 2017 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 lund et al 2018 verdon kidd et al 2017 in the case of central chile mediterranean region there is evidence that precipitation has decreased over the last 50 years ranging from 5 2 to 1 7 per decade garreaud et al 2020 2017 these trends are stronger that those obtained with climate change models under the rcp8 5 scenario for the 2006 and 2016 period boisier et al 2018 moreover precipitation reductions ranging from 10 to 20 and increases of 1 2 c in mean daily temperature are projected for the 2040 2070 period under the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 climate change scenarios respectively bozkurt et al 2018 as a consequence the 0 c isotherm will increase in altitude decreasing the area of snow reserves and affecting the spring and summer surface runoff thus water for reservoirs and irrigation in the period of maximum crop development could be limited barria et al 2019 on the other hand projections of increasing demand and competition for water food and agriculture organization food and agriculture organization fao 2014 frederiksen 2016 indicate that water availability for agriculture will become more scarce which may trigger a situation of high vulnerability and uncertainty for both productive processes and human consumption malek et al 2017 vicuña et al 2012 woznicki et al 2015 then to achieve sustainability in the table grape production judicious use of water and increases in irrigation efficiency are fundamental phogat et al 2017 typically the analyses of water use for crop production are based on experimental designs considering different irrigation water inputs where measurements of xylem potential sap flow and micrometeorological techniques novák 2012 are needed to monitor the water use in spite of their precision they usually require intensive field campaign with high labor and time costs dietrich et al 2016 phogat et al 2017 also these methods do not allow for continuous long term monitoring of the water use variables limiting their applicability for long term planning in this sense processes based numerical models become an attractive alternative to provide water use simulations of the different variables involved under plausible hypothetical conditions across spatial and temporal scales wilson et al 2001 hydrus šimůnek et al 2015 is a numerical model widely used to simulate water flow in soils under crop conditions this model has previously been used to

of water transfers process based models to work with forced climate change data to evaluate the long term hydrological response within a agroecosystem examples under annual crops such as wheat bouras et al 2019 or maize abedinpour et al 2014 have been published with the aquacrop model but only few address perennial agroecosystems for instance hallema et al 2014 developed a hydrological scheme for a distributed simulation of local hydrology in a row culture system in quebec canada under different climate change scenarios analyzing the soil water dynamics until 2070 another example is the work of phogat et al 2018a where australian irrigated vineyards were evaluated under present and climate change scenarios however to our knowledge studies that analyze the table grape crops water use under current and climate change scenarios have not yet been conducted in this context this study aims to analyze the performance of different plausible irrigation strategies in production of table grapes under present climate and two near future climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the hydrus 1d water transfer model was implemented to simulate actual crop coefficient and percolation as indicators of irrigation performace to do that plausible irrigation strategies for table grapes were identified from a bibliographic analysis which were then implemented in the calibrated model and run for the near term future the performance of these strategies were compared against standard and improved irrigation managements during the 2015 2016 and the 2016 2017 2017 2018 observed growing seasons afterwards the performance of water use indicators for each identified irrigation strategies under selected future extreme dry and wet crop seasons were assessed 2 materials and methods for a

terrain it allows the cultivars to express all their natural vigor and prune them according to their fruiting habit blanco et al 2010 ibacache et al 1988 and a regular vegetation cover is obtained which is suitable for a 1 d model representation the standard irrigation management installed during the 2015 2016 season correspond to drippers of 4 l h 1 spaced at intervals of 1 m along the rows during winter of 2016 beginning of 2016 2017 growing season and improved irrigation management that considers drippers spaced at 50 cm with discharges of 2 l h 1 replaced the old configuration by implementing the improved irrigation management the average fruit yield varied from 28700 to 34780 kg ha 1 between the 2015 2016 and the 2017 2018 seasons with 90 of production destined for export

physical parameters crop cover information meteorological variables and irrigation registers to be able to compute water fluxes in addition soil moisture observations were used to calibrate values of soil parameters and assessed the performance of the model to reproduce soil water content at different depths and overall available soil water storage in addition the 2017 2018 observed season was run together with the 2018 2019 2044 2045 projected period at a daily scale 2 3 input of hydrus 2 3 1 soil hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions described by the van

reflectometry fdr probe model drill and drop sentek technologies with 6 nodes located every 10 cm until 60 cm depth where the roots are concentrated daily measurements were recorded following a standard calibration the final soil hydraulic parameters used in the hydrus 1d simulations are given in table 1 the simulated domain had an effective soil depth 100 cm that was observed in the soil pit boundary condition of the atmosphere at the soil surface includes rainfall irrigation potential soil evaporation ep and potential plant transpiration tp horizontal flow boundary conditions were not considered and a bottom free drainage boundary condition was set since no water table was observed 2 3 2 estimation of potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp hydrus 1 d requires daily estimates of potential transpiration tp and evaporation ep as input parameters in this study the daily inputs of tp and ep were estimated using the fao dual crop coefficient allen et al 2006 where the calculation of the crop basal coefficient kcb and the evaporation coefficient ke that modulate the potential evapotranspirative atmospheric demand are required the values of the basal crop coefficient kcb are specific for each species in its respective phenological stages therefore the maximum crop basal coefficient kcbmax was estimated according to the phenological cycle of the crop during the

computations of potential transpiration and potential evaporation according to fao dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 2006 2 4 evaluation of the model the time cycle of the daily simulations including the warm up period was 990 days the evaluations of the balance were limited to the growing season period that starts the 15th of september till the 30th of april 228 days for each season the modelling outputs during calibration and verfication periods were assessed by estimating four statistical metrics i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse percentage of bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 these errors were calculated from the measured and simulated water content for the first two observed climate seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 at all depths 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm from november 1 to may 31 components of water balance for the three observed seasons 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 were analyzed and discussed in detail to assess the irrigation water productivity wpi defined as the ratio between the marketable yield produced by a crop along the growing season and the irrigation water applied iwu within the same period fernández et al 2020 2 5 identification of irrigation strategies a systematic bibliographic review was carried out to determine the irrigation strategies that are currently being used all over the world for the cultivation of table grapes emphasis was placed on the available water sources quantities of water applied frequency of irrigation and the effects in bunches and berries characteristics for the differents strategies the following keywords were chosen irrigation strategies irrigation distribution water availability productivity controlled deficit irrigation and adaptations to global change the search was carried out in the databases of the information services and libraries of the university of chile like isi web of science science direct wiley and springer the results of the bibliographic review showed that across different climates and cultivars the reduction of a certain percentage in the amount of irrigation does not affect yield and quality of table grapes production it has been reported that for reductions ranging from 10 to 20 respect to etc the yields show certain decreases that are not statistically significant and most importantly maintain both the characteristics of the bunch and the berry and that at the same time allow water savings close to 2000 m3ha 1 permanhani et al 2016 however the reduction of water irrigation presents a limit where it begins to affect yield and or morphophysiological characteristics when reductions exceed 50 of etc the yield is strongly affected in the case of red globe and italy an irrigation with 40 of the potential crop demand produces yield falls of 9 and 10 ton ha 1 respectively with significant alterations in the characteristics of bunch and berry table 2 in summary as for all the varieties of table grapes a reduction to 80 of the etc in irrigation does not affect the yield and quality of the fruit this was considered as the irrigation strategy to be implemented in the study also an irrigation strategy of 50 the etc was considered to represent a sharp decrease in water availability scenario which according to climate change projections on water resources in the aconcagua catchment is a plausible condition dirección general de aguas 2018 these scenarios were implemented in simulations for observed and future climate conditions 2 6 climate change data processing climate change cc data was obtained from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset thrasher and nemani 2015 which comprises an ensemble of 21 general circulation models gcm under two emission scenarios coordinated under the cmip5 project the 21 models correspond to daily time series of simulated precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures with a spatial resolution of 0 25 degrees 25 km x 25 km the anthropogenic forcing scenarios considered in this study correspond to the risk adverse rcp8 5 and the moderate rcp4 5 scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 which for the near future span plausible warming conditions consistent with the drying trend observed in central chile during the last 4 decades garreaud e tal 2021 boisier et al 2018 and the persistent megadrought of the last 11 years garreaud et al 2020 these models were bias corrected at the local scale using the cr2met centro de ciencias del clima y la resiliencia cr2 2020a 2020b dataset as reference the quantile mapping method kim et al 2015 piani et al 2010 equation below was employed to fit the probability distribution of the observed daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature χ cor f 1 f χ model α model β model α obs β obs where χ cor is the bias corrected value of the gcm χ model is the value obtained by the gcm for a given emission scenario f is the cumulative distribution function cdf gamma of the gcm control period and f 1 is the inverse function of f α is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter the subscripts model and obs indicate the parameters of the gcm and the observed variable respectively daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures for the 2019 2046 period were obtained directly from the bias corrected gcm and future potential daily evapotranspiration pet were computed following the hargreaves samani formulation novák 2012 future values of et0 penman monteith required for hydrus simulations were obtained from a linear relationship generated between the values of et0 penman monteith and pet hargreaves samani during the observed growing seasons coefficient of this regression et0 0 76 pet 0 225 r2 0 87 were applied to pet future data to obtain projected et0 to run hydrus simulations for the future scenarios were ran following these conditions i the soil parameters correspond to the values obtained in the calibration season ii the same depth horizons and effective soil depth configurations of the observed period were established iii the basal kc and ke were obtained by averaging the three observed seasons of lai and if assuming a similar canopy crop conditions until mid century tp and ep values along with daily rainfall at the study site during the simulation period were used as time varying upper boundary conditions in the model in relation to the lower boundary conditions simulations were performed with a variable flow condition as opposed to free drainage used for the observed period the modification to parameterization is due to the model was unable to converge during some days of intense and frequent rainfall predicted by the gcm models where a shallow water table could appear due to deeper soil hydraulic discontinuities not detected in the first meter of soil these daily input data simulations were used to run hydrus 1d and simulate water transfers for 9970 day simulation starting on september 15 2019 until december 31 2046 table grape growing seasons defined from middle september until the end of april of the following year are considered for further analysis 2 7 scenarios analysis actual basal crop coefficient akcb defined as the ratio of actual to potential transpiration was chosen as indicator of irrigation performance because it represents the plant hydric stress sensitivity as is modulated by atmospheric demand and soil water availability processes allen et al 2006 paço et al 2014 percolation defined as the cumulative sum of water percolate from the bottom of the first meter soil profile at the end of the season was also chosen since its represent an amount of water loss locally to acquifer xu et al 2017 and because is closely related with potential leaching of fertilizers usually transported with water flow to acquifers williams and kissel 2015 the akcb the percolation and other water balance components were compared between the standard irrigation management and the simulations obtained under hypothetic water restrictions of 50 and 80 etc for the three observed seasons future scenarios were defined according to the bibliographic review of irrigation strategies table 2 and to the rcp climate change projections eight scenario configurations displayed in table 3 were implemented two are based on a business as usual irrigation strategies with 115 of etc bau 1 and bau 2 representing the standard irrigation management for table grapes in chile these scenarios were in agreement with the first observed season standard irrigation strategy where a 114 of etc was applied two mild irrigation scenarios mi 1 and mi 2 with 100 of the etc were also implemented in hydrus these scenarios were in agreement with the improved irrigation management implemented during the 2016 2017 observed season see study site for details four deficit irrigation scenarios were proposed according to the bibliographic review two with a moderate deficit with irrigations of 80 of etc mdi 1 and mdi 2 and two severe deficit with only 50 of etc sdi 1 and sdi 2 a confidence interval method based on the dunnet test available in the r statistical package nparcomp konietschke et al 2015 was implemented to contrast simulations of akcb and percolation of the different irrigation strategies under present and future climate conditions three future extreme dry and wet crop seasons were identified for each rcp climate change scenario based on the ratio of evapotranspiration and precipitation for the hydrological year may 1 to march 31 a dry year correspond to high values of this ratio i e high rates of et0 and low rainfall values the opposite situation was considered for wet years years were ranked according to the ratio and three extreme dry and extreme wet years were chosen daily akcb and percolation values for each irrigation strategy were averaged for these years these values were considered for comparison against the standard irrigation strategy using the confidence interval method 3 results 3 1 performance of the model the consistency of the hydrus 1d simulations were assessed during the calibration november 1 of 2015 to may 31 of 2016 and verification november 1 of 2016 to may 31 of 2017 periods by analyzing the residual calibration errors i e the differences between the measured and the simulated soil moisture profiles for each depth the analysis was performed considering the residual calibration errors as a function of the soil depth the residual calibration error during the simulation period and the differences between measurements and simulations for soil water storage the mean relative rmse profile i e the ratio of absolute rmse to mean observed value marked as rrmse for calibration period ranged from 10 8 to 8 8 with a mean value of 9 9 fig 3a the highest values of rmse and rrmse were observed around the depths of 40 and 60 cm the rmse also varied from one depth to another with values ranging from 29 5 in the 10 cm to 40 1 mm 60 cm for the verification period the rmse varies from 39 9 to 29 0 mm and the rrmse varies from 13 9 to 10 1 according to depth with an average value of 12 6 fig 3b as shown in fig 4 the rmse between in situ soil moisture water storage and hydrus 1d outputs was estimated in 9 83 mm 2 66 relative for calibration and 11 9 mm 3 12 relative for verification periods a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 71 was obtained for calibration period and of 0 63 for verificacion period indicating a good performance of the model the visual inspection of the simulated times series of water storage shows a good representation of the dynamics of water content in the soil fig 4b with respect to the temporal dynamics of soil water storage a high adjustment is observed between simulated and measured values for the period of active root functioning december to the end of april 3 2 observed period water use efficiency and water balance soil water balances during the observed seasons showed differences in quantity frequency and dates of irrigations fig 5 evidencing changes in the irrigation managements implemented during the 2016 2017 season more irrigation was applied in the first stages of plant growth in comparison to 2015 2016 reducing the contributions made in the middle and final stages of the crop where total leaf development and berry growth were completed the contribution of irrigation for all the studied seasons is shown in table 4 regarding water balance components table 4 there is a clear change in efficiency when introducing this new irrigation strategy indeed 66 of the water entering the system considering precipitation is used as evapotranspiration and a 31 correspond to loss as percolation in the first season compared to 93 used in evapotranspiration and 10 loss as percolation in average for the second and third observed seasons since actual transpiration does not reach its potential a slight excess water stress is evident in all observed seasons actual transpiration deficits of 14 5 and 2 in comparison to the potential transpiration were observed during the first second and third seasons respectively that is explained by changes in the amount of water applied for irrigation with respect to etc potential of the crop which decreased from 114 to 87 of the et0 a large temporal dynamic was noticed during the three observed seasons with seasonal variations of daily actual evapotranspiration eta values between 0 12 and 5 4 mm d 1 0 71 4 6 mm d 1 and 0 4 4 7 for the first second and third seasons respectively for the first season 2015 2016 during the spring and fall months no excess water stress was observed since the evapotranspiration rates were close to the reference evapotranspiration et0 and because they correspond to the beginning and end of the irrigation season characterized by less frequent irrigations the second and third observed irrigation seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 presented an evaporation rate very close to the et0 during the spring and fall months for the months of december january and february summer in the first two observed seasons the eta does not reach the estimated potential since these months normally concentrate the maximum frequency and lenght of irrigations the excess of water may be the reason why the eta does not reach its potential respect to irrigation water productivity wpi a considerable improvement was observed from the first to the second and third observed seasons with an increase of 55 7 and 43 1 respectively at the same time a decrease in the consumption of irrigation water was observed for the second 22 and third season 28 these changes in the water balance components represent an increase in the production of field fruit 21 in the second and 7 in the third table 4 as reported by the indicators the performance of the standard irrigation management showed important flaws during the 2015 2016 growing season high frequency and a large amount of water were applied to the crops reaching until 30 mm every two or three days in each irrigation this irrigation management produced very low akcb values reaching almost 0 in the middle of the season and high percolation amounts during the same period fig 5 the analysis for alternative irrigation strategies under observed climate conditions showed irrigation volumes varying between 5906 8250 m3ha 1 for bau 6370 4938 m3 ha 1 for the mdi and 3982 3086 m3 ha 1 for the sdi scenarios these irrigation volumes may produce changes in the performance indicators under the sdi treatment a decrease in akcb is observed from november until the end of the season for the three simulated seasons with values of akcb descending to 0 5 fig 5 for mdi actual transpiration remains relatively close to its potential being slightly higher during the two first seasons and similar during the third observed season showing average akcb values varying from 0 92 to 0 97 fig 5 these values are similar to those reported under observed conditions regarding percolation larger differences were simulated with respect to standard irrigation management for 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons with amounts varyng from 2 to 4 6 mm instead of the 86 3 295 3 mm computed for the present condition supplementary material 1 season 2017 2018 showed similar results with respect to standard management mainly explained by a strong precipitation event that totaled 73 2 mm at the beginning of the season which produces a large amount of percolation 3 3 evaluation of water balance components for different irrigation strategies under climate change scenarios for a better understanding of the projected water balance components it is relevant to examine the future climate projections in the area a quick assessment of the et0 time series projected under the cmip5 ensemble of climate change models for the next 27 hydrological years is shown in supplementary material 2 yearly et0 during this period 2019 2046 varied from 812 3 to 1037 5 mm year 1 under the rcp4 5 with an average of 1009 9 41 42 mm year 1 for the case of rcp8 5 scenario the projected et0 varied from 809 42 to 1055 0 mm year 1 with an average value of 1016 7 45 7 mm year 1 an increasing trend is observed for both climate change scenarios with values around 7 3 9 2 larger than historical et0 at the end of the period considering the 2015 2018 period the bias corrected gcm precipitation time series for the same period is shown in the supplementary material 3 simulations of yearly precipitations for the future period 2019 2046 under the rcp4 5 scenario indicate values ranging around 196 7 and 298 4 mm with an average of 242 6 26 8 while for the rcp8 5 they ranged from 194 65 to 293 7 mm with an average of 243 7 27 3 mm per year an increasing trend is also observed for both scenarios and values at the end of the period are 7 3 10 5 larger than present values since 2015 2018 supplementary material 3 for the crop growing season increases of 7 8 10 1 in the et0 were obtained by the end of the period for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively compared to the observed period projections of precipitation indicate decreasing trends of 27 7 and 37 less than observed years 2015 2018 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively supplementary material 2 the growing season mean akcb during the 2019 2045 period obtained under the cc projections presents low variability until the middle of the century current irrigation strategies applied under both cc future conditions may produce lower akcb than scenarios with lesser amount of irrigation fig 6 according to the et0 pp ratio calculated for the hidrological year the driest irrigation season identified under the rcp4 5 scenario was the 2044 2045 year which correspond to the year with minimum accumulated precipitation of the study period this season together with the 2034 2035 showed the worst performance of akcb for the sdi 1 scenarios fig 6 not affecting notoriously the performance of the other scenarios for the rcp8 5 the driest growing season was the 2037 2038 year where the mean akcb under the sdi strategy is similar to the response under the mdi strategy after the season 2033 2034 the akcb performance of sdi 2 is slightly worse than mdi 2 but is always better in term of percolation during the rest of the growing seasons the best performance according to the akcb is obtained under the mdi 1 and sdi 2 scenarios with values varying from 0 92 to 0 97 and from 0 92 to 0 96 respectively mean akcb are 0 92 0 004 0 95 0 001 0 96 0 001 0 97 0 007 for bau 1 mi 1 mdi 1 and sdi 2 scenarios respectively furterhmore mean akcb values are 0 92 0 003 0 95 0 001 0 96 0 001 and 0 96 0 008 for the bau 2 mi 2 mdi 2 and sdi 2 scenarios respectively regarding percolation as expected the greater amounts are obtained under the control irrigation scenarios bau 1 and bau 2 with varying amounts within each season and until the middle of the century the largest percolation losses are simulated under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7 each time irrigation volume is reduced the simulated percolation decreases with an average of 213 3 17 106 16 9 1 23 2 5 0 12 0 25 mm under the scenarios bau 1 mi 1 mdi 1 and sdi 1 respectively percolation reductions of 223 6 11 7 106 3 8 22 1 6 3 0 2 0 5 mm were simulated under the bau 2 mi 2 mdi 2 and sdi 2 respectively the analysis of future wet extreme growing seasons showed that under the rcp4 5 climate scenario wet years depicted an average simulated et0 of 1006 14 8 mm in the season may to end of march and of 287 8 9 3 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 3 5 0 06 meanwhile dry growing seasons shows in average an et0 of 1036 mm 1 7 and 204 4 6 7 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 5 1 0 17 for the rcp8 5 wet years depicted an average of et0 of 1018 27 7 mm and 280 7 11 7 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 3 6 0 2 while dry growing seasons showed an et0 of 1026 4 20 6 mm and 198 2 9 mm of precipitation average of ratio is 5 2 0 15 significant differences for akcb were found during the extreme growing seasons under both emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the wet seasons of rcp4 5 showed significant differences between the control and the three scenarios fig 8a with highest differences simulated under the mdi 1 scenario in contrast during dry growing seasons fig 8b the greatest difference is observed in sdi 1 similar results were observed under the rcp8 5 climate scenario where significant differences between the control bau 2 and the other irrigation scenarios were simulated during the extreme wet growing seasons based on the akcb a better performance is obtained with the mdi 2 scenario fig 8c and during dry seasons similar significant differences were observed with better performance of sdi 2 fig 8d significant differences were also observed across irrigation scenarios for percolation fig 9 however percolation indicates values lower than the standard bau 1 2 in fig 9 with the greater difference for the sdi 1 scenario 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the model the performance of the model here calibrated to simulate water content r2 0 71 and 0 63 is similar to results reported in previous studies that used hydrus in irrigated crops arbat et al 2005 phogat et al 2018a 2017 2014 2013b 2013a tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 2012 furthermore all the soil parameter values are within the ranges reported in the literature phogat et al 2018b 2018a 2017 2016 although the model used in this study has a good performance at a local scale the satisfactory simulation of soil moisture anticipates the potential of applying this methodology at the field level and have a reliable representation of the temporal behaviour of soil moisture the greatest differences in soil water storage simulations were obtained at the end of the winter period and during spring after large or prolonged rainfall which could be explained by an inadequate characterization of vegetation functioning and or the lack of consideration for lateral water flows within the vadose zone galleguillos et al 2017 2011 it is known that the root profile changes in response to spatial and temporal distributions of water in the soil following a physiological optimization that minimizes the carbon cost of the root system and satisfies the water demand of the canopy neumann and cardon 2012 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 this unbalance could be explained by changes in the spatial distribution of water content on soil where rainfall produce a well distributed water content contrary to the located root distribution induced by irrigation drip systems the complete root architecture and hydraulic properties of the root system are important in assessing the three dimensional variability of water distribution šejna and genuchten 2018 in this sense the one dimensional approach applied in this study could undermine the effect of the real distribution of roots during these rainy periods reducing the model performance finally as the model is limited to an effective soil depth of one meter the possible existence of soil discontinuities below this depth that generate a perched watertable or changes in the water infiltration rate are not considered šimůnek et al 2015 4 2 model uncertainties the modeling exercise carried out does not contain a physiological representation that considers the adaptation of plants to a changing environment this is relevant to be considered in future assessments as increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations have been reported noaa esrl 2020 which may change the vegetation functioning and water consumption an instantaneous response to high atmospheric co2 is an increase in photosynthesis and a decrease in transpiration due to the increase availability of substrate for c fixation and partial closure of the stomas respectively kizildeniz et al 2018 2015 rogiers et al 2011 as a result the rate of water loss from leaves or transpiration is reduced kimball 2016 as in other c3 species the most common of the three metabolic carbon fixation pathways where photosynthesis is limited by the availability of co2 the vine responds to the increase in co2 with an increase in vegetative growth and yield however long term exposure to co2 leads to a phenomenon known as photosynthetic acclimatization or downward regulation which decreases the photosynthetic capacity of the vine resulting in less clear effects on the physiology and growth of the vine kizildeniz et al 2018 the representation of the functioning of agricultural systems using process based models is a complex exercise since it requires a large number of parameters and variables physical properties of the soil moisture profile root distribution canopy structure water inputs and outputs among others which could increase uncertainty galleguillos et al 2011 include physiological adaptations in a future context introduces a major challenge that requires experimental conditions difficult to achieve in the field and only replicable in greenhouses with controlled conditions kizildeniz et al 2018 2015 martínez lüscher et al 2015 in that way the selected approach represents an operational alternative for predicting the water balance in future scenarios especially in medium term temporal windows such as this study 4 3 irrigation management and water balance components as previously indicated a change in the irrigation management was implemented during the observed period which improved the water use efficiency akcb changes from 14 to 3 the irrigation system was improved from a single line of drippers spaced at 1 m with 4 l h 1 to a double line with drippers spaced at 50 cm and 2 l h 1 in addition irrigation length and frequency was implemented based on soil moisture threshold defined according to the probe observations beyá marshall et al 2021 beyá marshall and galleguillos 2020 by doing that the evaporation disminished 26 6 and 24 3 of total evapotranspiration during second and third observed growing seasons within satisfactory margins for this irrigation and soil type er raki et al 2010 these decrease could be explained by the reductions in irrigation lenght and frequency that avoid lateral wetting of the irrigated bulb and by an earlier increase of the leaf area index during spring data not shown which implies an earlier canopy full coverage with lesser direct sun exposure of the bare soil in relation to actual evapotranspiration eta which is directly linked to akcb values three important results stand out a simulated maximum daily et rates under optimal conditions showed similar values 5 mm d 1 than those reported in studies using lysimeters in the same valley but for crimson and thompson seedless cultivars ferreyra et al 2006 villagra et al 2014 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 simulations of eta have also been reported for hydrus 1d under rainfed vineyards in southern france when comparing against eddy covariance measurements galleguillos et al 2017 this highlights the potential of hydrus 1d as a tool for estimating water requirements for vitis vinifera on a farm scale under different soil water management conditions irrigation or rainfed b a considerable decreased in the akcb was simulated during the end of december despite an important atmospheric demand and good vegetation coverage a possible explanation could be a malfunctioning of transpiration process caused by root hypoxia or anoxia triggered by a prolonged period of saturated water condition due to excesive time and frequency of irrigation friedman and naftaliev 2012 c the percolation efficiency expressed as the percentage of irrigated water applied showed an important improvement from 35 8 during the first season standard irrigation management to 13 4 and 9 6 when the deficit irrigation strategy was applied during the second and third observed season respectively this results depict an improvement of the water management strategy adopted the latter observed seasons as reported by other studies in the literature table 2 this case of study improved its productivity when managing irrigation based on water deficit strategies reductions of irrigation volumes ranging from 18 to 27 applied during the second and third observed season generate water savings of about 2000 m3 ha 1 and wuei increases ranging from 3 48 to 5 42 kg m 3 this is concordant with a study carried out in the same aconcagua valley but for thompson seedlesss table grape cultivar which established that a 50 reduction of etc from 1 2 etc to 0 6 etc produces a decrease of water uso of almost 7000 m3ha 1 with no significant reduction in yield and increases on wuei of 3 kg m 3 from 2 3 to 5 3 kg m 3 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 according to the results obtained under alternative irrigations scenarios during the observed period important saving of water could be obtained e g 2500 m3ha 1 for season 2015 2016 irrigating an 80 of the etc in fact for the local climatic conditions optimal yield and berry weight can be obtained under that irrigation configuration while respecting the 4000 m3ha 1 of minimum irrigation amount as a threshold williams et al 2010 other studies show that simply reducing the irrigation threshold in terms of etc 70 80 or stopping it around 13 21 days before harvest saves a considerable amount of water from 300 m3 ha 1 to 2400 3000 m3 ha 1 per season without affecting the yield or quality conesa et al 2016 2014 serman et al 2004 in chile studies of crimson seedless table grape showed that irrigation deficit of 75 of the etc approximately 8500 m3 ha 1 does not cause significant losses in exportable fruit compared to the fully irrigated control allowing a water saving of about 2800 m3 ha 1 throughout the season ferreyra et al 2006 similarly gálvez et al 2014 applied deficit irrigation strategies for red globe and thompson seedless testing irrigation reductions of 5620 m3 ha 1 50 total irrigation and 487 m3 ha 1 which did not compromise the yield or bunch quality furthermore increases in the wue for red globe from 4 4 to 9 8 kg m 3 and from 2 9 to 3 1 kg m 3 for thompson were obtained which agrees with the wue obtained in this study 4 4 sensitivity of water balance components to global change scenarios in the study area near term cc projections for the forcing variables shows a clear increasing tendency for et0 and a not so pronounced decrease of precipitation when comparing with the observed period supplementary material 2 and 3 this can be explained because the last ten hydrological years 2010 2020 have been affected by the so called mega drought event garreaud et al 2017 during the megadrought reductions of about 34 have been observed in the aconcagua catchment agromet 2021 centro de ciencia del clima y la resiliencia cr2 2020b and although gcms project drier futures in the catchment the occurrence of a 10 year drought with the magnitude of the md is still very unlikely as indicated in the supplementary material 4 the md has an exceedance probability of about 100 under the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 scenario based on the blue line and only few gcms simulations 4 of 21 show that the md would have an exceedance probability of about 85 very unlikely during the following decades furthermore this study was conducting using the cmip5 ensamble of models currently the cmip6 ensamble is available which has been reported to have a larger climate sensitivity zelinka et al 2019 implying the results here presented could be an underestimation of future climate change the sdi and the mdi irrigation strategies demonstrated good performance for the akcb and the percolations indicators under observed conditions mdi largely surpass the bau and the sdi irrigation strategies this was validaded by the implemented field strategy during the second and third observed season which correspond to approximately the 80 of etc the wuei indicator reinforces this result by including the productivity term which is relevant for the industry at the moment of deciding for an irrigation criteria the sdi irrigation strategy is not recommended under megadrought conditions because the reduction of akcb is explained by an hydric stress condition that would likely also affect productivity gálvez et al 2014 permanhani et al 2016 temnani et al 2021 weiler et al 2019 when analizing the same strategies under future contrasting climate change scenarios both deficit irrigation strategies showed better performances than the standard irrigation management strategy although an akcb reduction was expected under the sdi scenario due to hydric stress this was only obtained under dry future seasons this can be explained by the occurrences of projected rainfalls that provide additional water to the system especially during spring and summer months which have not occurred under current megadrought scenario in spite of the good performance of the restricted irrigation strategy it should be taken with caution since productivity was not simulated by the model and even if akcb could demonstrated and adequate yearly hydric status a certain degree of hydric stress in specific periods could affect key physiological process such as stem water potential and stomatal conductance gálvez et al 2014 weiler et al 2019 zúñiga espinoza et al 2015 and hence affecting exportable fruit produced permanhani et al 2016 this is why the mdi irrigation strategy appears to be the better compromise of increase of akcb and reduction of percolation while not compromising crop productivity gálvez et al 2014 williams et al 2010 actual transpiration obtained by hydrus 1d is directly associated with the function of feddes where soil potential that defines the extraction of water by the roots is modulated by four threshold values feddes et al 1978 in this representation a sharp decrease in transpiration is expected when excess water is present in the soil which is not so pronounced for hydric stress conditions this is why bau scenarios always performed worse than the deficit irrigation scenarios this is observed for both akcb and percolation indicators under present climate conditions and under the two contrasting climate change scenarios according to climate change projections important rainfall events could occur during crop seasons for the near term future this phenomena can lead to large percolation amounts which can cause more than only local loss of water to acquifers but also the accelerated transport of agrochemicals affecting water quality and hence human population and ecosystems li et al 2018 puckett and survey 2011 it is recommended to estimate and correct water demands based on year by year projections considering the intrinsic uncertainty and the local irrigation system barik et al 2017 precise short term forecasting of precipitation and availability of water in the catchment and its distribution should be considered in irrigation strategies to prevent the effect of future extreme rainfalls cao et al 2019 the study area is currently under water availability restrictions and changes in the projected hydrometeorological conditions may further exacerbate this situation affecting agriculture especially those who required large amount of water to produce exportable fruit bozkurt et al 2018 dirección general de aguas 2018 efforts should be taken to improve water irrigation efficiency with the inclusion of validated novel technological tools such as the use of soil moisture probes remote sensing

al 2014 5 conclusions satisfactory daily simulations of water transfers variables for three observed growing seasons were achieved with hydrus 1d model applied on a drip irrigated table grape crop from a mediterranean climate region of chile actual basal crop coefficients akcb of 0 82 0 95 and 0 97 were determined for the crop during the observed period large inefficiencies in term of akcb and percolation were identified for the standard irrigation management where several cases of stressed plant roots caused by excess water in the soil were observed differences in irrigation efficiencies were monitored when irrigation set up was modified with 80 of etc defined as the better irrigation strategy under current climate conditions after forcing the model with the constrasting rcp climate change scenarios the deficit irrigation strategies of 80 and 50 etc always presented a better performance in terms of akcb and percolation than the current standard irrigation management especially under near future extreme dry and wet scenarios this study demonstrated that deficit irrigation strategies compared to those currently used guarantee better production and lower water consumption this relationship of improvement in the irrigation water management strategy is consistently projected under near future climate change scenarios demonstrating that irrigation management has a greater impact than the future agro climatic conditions of the site this can be explained as the irrigation treatment defines when and how much water enters the system allowing or preventing the plant from transpiring satisfactorily this is an important contribution to the discussion on adaptation measures toward water security in water stressed regions with high irrigation requirements to strenghten

9656,mulching can improve crop productivity in semi arid regions by improving hydrothermal conditions however there is a lack of systematic understanding of hydrothermal coordination mechanisms in long term field experiments which is also critical for sustainable agricultural development this experiment had four treatments 1 plastic mulching pm 2 sand mulching sm 3 alternate plastic and sand mulching psm and 4 without mulching ck the results showed that before sowing the soil water storage in the 0 300 cm profile of the pm sm and psm treatments increased by 20 4 13 9 and 12 2 compared with ck respectively the water consumption was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in the filling stage and the 10 accumulated soil temperature in pm sm and psm increased by 126 9 58 3 and 77 3 in the seedling jointing stage compared with ck respectively there was a significant positive correlation between maize growth rate and 10 accumulated soil temperature in all treatments in the seedling tasseling stage and the response sensitivities of maize growth rate to 10 accumulated soil temperature of pm sm and psm were highest in seedling jointing jointing tasseling and filling stages respectively there was a significant positive correlation between maize growth rate and seasonal water consumption and response sensitivity was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in the seedling jointing jointing tasseling and tasseling filling stages and pm psm sm ck in the filling stage the seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage was most critical to yield formation and mulching reduced this response sensitivity after 10 years of cropping the soil water storage in the 0 300 cm profile decreased by 230 8 202 9 243 8 and 228 2 mm in the pm sm psm and ck treatments

people wang et al 2018 thus mulching practice is crucial for safeguarding food security in semi arid areas of the loess plateau previous studies showed that soil hydrothermal conditions are key factors for maize growth and yield increase chen et al 2015 martínez et al 2016 zhu and li 2017 hydrothermal coordination effects follow from plastic film mulching improving soil hydrothermal conditions which prolongs crop growth by 5 7 days and increases aboveground dry weight by 27 8 41 1 our long term positioning experiment showed that mulching could increase maize yield in any type of rainfall year dry normal or wet with greater increases for years with more drought similar to the results of liu et al 2020 the possible reason is that the hydrothermal coordination mechanism of mulching varies with different growth stages and type of rainfall year however there are few relevant published reports in this study a 10 year positioning test was carried out using spring maize with soil water storage sws in the 0 300 cm profile before planting 10 c accumulated soil temperature at the seasonal water consumption growth rates and yield of maize were measured correlations of 10 c at

sustainability before sowing the sws in the 0 300 cm profile of the pm sm and psm treatments increased by 10 2 30 5 6 7 21 1 and 5 4 19 0 compared with ck respectively table 1 after harvest the sws in the 0 300 cm profile in pm sm and psm treatments decreased by 7 3 20 6 5 5 23 3 and 5 2 24 6 compared with ck respectively there were no significant differences among treatments in wet years after 10 years of cropping the sws in the 0 300 cm profile decreased by 230 8 202 9 243 8 and 228 2 mm in pm sm psm and ck respectively 3 3 effects of mulching practices on 10 at during maize growth in the seedling jointing stage the 10 ats of the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 126 9 58 3 and 77 3 respectively compared with ck table 2 in the jointing tasseling stage the 10 at of the pm was significantly higher than those of the other treatments and there were no significant differences among sm psm and ck in 2011 and 2012 in 2013 2015 and 2018 the 10 c at of pm was significantly higher than those of other treatments with no significant differences between sm and psm which were both significantly higher than ck there were no significant differences among all treatments in the other years and in tasseling filling and filling stages there were no significant differences among all treatments 3 4 effects of mulching practice on maize seasonal water consumption in the seedling jointing stage water consumption of pm sm and psm treatments significantly decreased by 22 4 23 1 and 22 6 mm compared with ck respectively table 3 in the jointing tasseling stage water consumption in pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 45 3 26 4 and 33 9 mm compared with ck respectively in the tasseling filling stage water consumption of pm was significantly higher than the other treatments and 34 4 mm higher than for ck there were no significant differences between sm and psm but they were significantly higher by 18 2 and 24 7 mm compared with ck respectively in the filling stage water consumption was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck with all significantly differing water consumption of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 47 9 20 5 and 31 2 mm compared with ck respectively 3 5 effects of mulching practice on maize growth rate in the seedling jointing stage the maize growth rates of the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 143 9 75 1 and 85 3 compared with ck respectively table 4 herein the growth rates of pm sm and psm did not significantly differ from each other in 2012 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 but were significantly higher than for ck in the jointing tasseling stage growth rates in pm sm and psm treatments increased by 165 8 104 7 and 139 2 compared to ck respectively with significant differences among the mulching practices in 2012 2013 2015 and 2018 in the tasseling filling and filling stages the growth rates were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and significantly differed among these growth rates increased by 141 6 and 121 9 in pm 72 0 and 45 3 in sm 108 4 and 83 2 in psm respectively compared to ck 3 6 correlation of maize growth rates with 10 at the maize growth rates of all treatments were significantly positively correlated with 10 at in seedling jointing and jointing tasseling stages fig 3 in the tasseling filling and filling stages growth rates for all mulching practices were significantly positively correlated with 10 at the response intensity varied at the different growth stages and pm sm and psm treatments were the strongest in seedling jointing jointing tasseling and filling stages respectively this indicated that regulating intensities of the different mulching practices on soil hydrothermal conditions differed among growth stages which might be a mechanism to optimize mulching practices 3 7 correlations between maize growth rates and seasonal water consumption the seasonal water consumptions in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with maize growth rates in seedling jointing jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 4 the response intensities of growth rates to seasonal water consumption differed among growth stages the response intensities were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in seedling jointing jointing tasseling and tasseling filling stages and pm psm sm ck in the filling stage this showed that mulching practices promoted maize at the vegetative stage by enhancing its response to water and improved its drought resistance and ensured its stable yield increase by reducing the sensitivity of reproductive growth to water at the filling stage 3 8 correlations between seasonal water consumption and grain yield maize yields in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with seasonal water consumption in jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 5 the response intensities of yield to seasonal water consumption were highest in the jointing tasseling stage in all treatments and mulching reduced this sensitivity thus seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however droughts often occur at this stage in the region and mulching increased production by reducing the yield sensitivity to seasonal water consumption in this stage 3 9 effects of mulching practices on maize yield water consumption and wue the mulching practices significantly increased maize yield but with differences for years with different rainfall table 5 maize yields were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and significantly differed when annual precipitation ranged within 323 1 418 3 mm 2009 2011 and 2015 2017 the yield of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 330 5 157 3 and 223 4 compared with ck respectively and with more droughts the more yields increased when annual precipitation ranged within 484 4 533 3 mm 2012 2014 and 2018 the yields did not significantly differ between pm and psm and both were significantly higher than for sm and ck with pm 27 3 and 193 4 higher and psm 18 7 and 173 9 higher respectively there were no significant differences among et in all treatments the wues were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and wues in pm sm and psm increased by 299 7 145 7 and 200 0 compared with ck respectively when annual precipitation was 323 1 418 3 mm 2009 2011 and 2015 2017 the wues of the pm and psm treatments did not significantly differ and were significantly higher than for sm and ck when annual precipitation was 484 4 533 3 mm 2012 2014 and 2018 4 discussion 4 1 mulching coordinated the seasonal soil hydrothermal relationship and improved maize growth yield and wue low temperatures and droughts occurring at early growth stages of spring maize are considered to be two main factors inhibiting the development of maize reproductive organs on the loess plateau li et al 2016a mulching significantly increases soil accumulative temperature at the early stages of maize growth promotes soil water and heat moving upward during the freezing thawing cycle and significantly increases sws before sowing wang et al 2013 2020 li et al 2016a which is beneficial for the emergence and formation of healthy and strong seedlings in this study the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased sws in 0 300 cm before sowing and the 10 at in the seedling jointing stage which provided a good hydrothermal environment for maize growth consistent with other research results fan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 2020 deng et al 2020 in the region drought not only occurs in the early stage of maize growth but also during the whole growth period and especially during the jointing tasseling or tasseling filling stages the water consumption peaks of spring maize will inevitably affect the maize reproductive growth resulting in a decrease in the allocated proportion of energy to reproductive growth and yield wang et al 2014 research shows that mulching can regulate the water consumption process and accelerate utilization of soil water when precipitation is insufficient at jointing tasseling or tasseling filling stages which ensures normal maize reproductive growth wang et al 2013 2018 zhang et al 2019a deng et al 2020 we obtained the same result and increases in water consumptions were the largest in the pm treatment followed by psm and sm compared with ck yields of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 330 5 157 3 and 223 4 respectively and correspondingly wue increased by 299 7 145 7 and 200 0 however what is the relationship between growth rates and 10 c at and water consumption at different growth stages of maize how does maize growth rate respond to changes in accumulated temperature and water consumption at its different growth stages how does grain yield respond to seasonal water consumption at present no relevant reports have addressed these questions this study analyzed the relationships and response intensities between maize growth rates and seasonal hydrothermal changes and the grain yield responses to seasonal water consumption at different growth stages the growth rates were significantly positively correlated with 10 ats and seasonal water consumption in all treatments and mulching enhanced the response intensities which were ranked in order of pm psm sm ck in the seedling jointing stage figs 3 and 4 in the jointing tasseling stage growth rates in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with 10 at and seasonal water consumption the response intensities to 10 at were ranked in the order of sm psm pm ck and to water consumption in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 the reason for the different order was that as air temperature rose soil temperatures were not the main limiting factor for maize growth and the soil temperatures were ranked in the order of pm psm sm so that the sensitivities to the accumulative soil temperature changes were ranked in the order of sm psm pm with the ck water and heat exchanges were strong but large hydrothermal fluctuations were not conducive to maize growth so that maize growth responses to soil water and heat changes were weak the aboveground and underground parts for mulching practices grew more vigorously with their water use strengthened so that the responses to water consumption were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in the tasseling filling stage there was no significant correlation of maize growth rates with 10 at but a significant positive correlation with seasonal water consumption and the responses intensities were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 the reason for the order was occurrence of the highest temperatures which could meet the needs of maize growth in the jointing tasseling stage so that it became insensitive to changes in accumulative temperature and so there was no significant correlation with 10 at early maize growth was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck the strong plants have strong metabolism and strong sensitivity to water so that sensitivity of maize growth rate to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the same order the warming effect of mulching occurred once again and maize water consumption reached a maximum in the filling stage so that the sensitivity of growth to soil temperature and water increased the growth rates were significantly positively correlated with 10 at except for ck and seasonal water consumption the response intensity to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the order of ck sm psm pm the possible reason was that water consumption of maize decreased with decreasing precipitation deng et al 2020 plastic film mulching can regulate and redistribute precipitation in time and space li et al 2016a so that maize can store more water in a low water requirement stage and use it in a high water requirement stage wang et al 2013 2018 zhang et al 2019a in this study mulching practice reduced the sensitivity of material transport to water and the response intensity of maize growth to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 maize yield in all treatments was significantly positively correlated with seasonal water consumption in jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 5 the response intensities were highest in the jointing tasseling stage in all treatments and mulching reduced the sensitivity this showed that seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however drought often occurs at this stage in the region and mulching increased production by reducing the sensitivity of yield to seasonal water consumption in this stage 4 2 obvious advantages for pm under annual precipitation 420 mm and similar performance of pm and psm under annual precipitation 420 mm the effects of plastic film mulching on maize yield and yield stability vary significantly with local climatic conditions increasing yield in areas with limited hydrothermal conditions gong et al 2015 li et al 2016d c d wang et al 2016a 2016b liu et al 2020 and increasing maize yield to a lesser extent in areas with abundant hydrothermal conditions sand mulching can maintain stable yields on farmland however it is difficult to cultivate and fertilize and the long term successive cropping leads to degenerated farmland soil salinization successive cropping obstacles and low water and fertilizer use efficiencies which have become a bottleneck restricting sustainable and healthy development of sand mulching ma et al 2018 du et al 2019 exploring farming practices suitable for different regions and balancing their production and ecology has become essential and led to a focus on sustainable agricultural development in semi arid rainfed areas in this study seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however drought often occurs at this stage in the region mulching practices could coordinate hydrothermal relations at different stages of maize and improve its productivity and yields wues were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck for annual precipitation below 420 mm with significant differences table 5 herein with the pm treatment yield and wue were more greatly increased in years of more drought consistent with other research gong et al 2015 li et al 2016b 2016c 2016d wang et al 2016a 2016b however yield and wue did not significantly differ between pm and psm for annual precipitation exceeding 420 mm these indicated that the pm had obvious advantages for annual precipitation below 420 mm and pm and psm did not perform differently for annual precipitation above 420 mm 5 conclusions mulching significantly increased the sws before sowing and accumulative soil temperature before jointing and alleviated stresses resulting from low temperature and drought in the early growth of maize mulching improved maize vegetative growth by enhancing its response intensity to 10 c at and water consumption at early growth stages and stabilized and promoted reproductive growth of maize by reducing its sensitivity of material transport to water at the seed filling stage the seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage was most critical to yield formation and mulching reduced sensitivity of this response this showed that mulching improved maize productivity by coordinating hydrothermal relations at key growth stages considering the production and environmental effects overall the pm treatment should be preferentially adopted in areas with rainfall below 420 mm and the psm in areas with rainfall above 420 mm so as to reduce plastic film use and environmental risks credit authorship contribution statement experimental design h l w x c z g p z x f y h z h y j f y f m and k n l

mulching also balances crop water demand and soil water supply hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 becker et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 promotes water consumption after flowering wang et al 2018 and improves the ratio of transpiration to evaporation fang et al 2021 these adjustments promote root absorption of limited resources farmer et al 2016 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a and photosynthesis hou et al 2019 thus significantly increasing crop yield and water use efficiency wue therefore mulching is widely used in the production of maize wheat potato and other crops increasing their yields by more 30 zhang et al 2019b and economic income by about 29 zhang et al 2020 in semi arid rainfed areas in particular with the introduction of double ridge and furrow plastic mulching and furrow planting in 2006 maize yield reached 8 81 t ha 1 wang et al 2013 dong et al 2017 during 2006 2013 the average annual increase of grain production was 856 000 t which is enough to feed 2 14 million people wang et al 2018 thus mulching practice is crucial for safeguarding food security in semi arid areas of the loess plateau previous studies showed that soil hydrothermal conditions are key factors for maize growth and yield increase chen et al 2015 martínez et al 2016 zhu and li 2017 hydrothermal coordination effects follow from plastic film mulching improving soil hydrothermal conditions which prolongs crop growth by 5 7 days and increases aboveground dry weight by 27 8 41 1 our long term positioning experiment showed that mulching could increase maize yield in any type of rainfall year dry normal or wet with greater increases for years with more drought similar to the results of liu et al 2020 the possible reason is that the hydrothermal coordination mechanism of mulching varies with different growth stages and type of rainfall year however there are few relevant published reports in this study a 10 year positioning test was carried out using spring maize with soil water storage sws in the 0 300 cm profile before planting 10 c accumulated soil temperature at the seasonal water consumption growth rates and yield of maize were measured correlations of 10 c at and seasonal water consumption with growth rates at different maize growth stages were analyzed in order to clarify the soil hydrothermal coordination mechanism and the effects on maize development and farmland productivity of different mulching practices and to then provide a theoretical basis for exploring the corresponding technical methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and

2011 and 2015 2016 were drought years 2012 2014 and 2017 were normal years and 2013 and 2018 were wet years the annual average temperature during the test period was 6 33 7 25 with a cv of 0 05 rainfall during seedling jointing jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages was 37 9 136 5 21 5 191 5 7 9 103 7 and 16 7 146 6 mm respectively with cvs of 0 31 0 58 0 86 and 0 72 during

sustainability before sowing the sws in the 0 300 cm profile of the pm sm and psm treatments increased by 10 2 30 5 6 7 21 1 and 5 4 19 0 compared with ck respectively table 1 after harvest the sws in the 0 300 cm profile in pm sm and psm treatments decreased by 7 3 20 6 5 5 23 3 and 5 2 24 6 compared with ck respectively there were no significant differences among treatments in wet years after 10 years of cropping the sws in the 0 300 cm profile decreased by 230 8 202 9 243 8 and 228 2 mm in pm sm psm and ck respectively 3 3 effects of mulching practices on 10 at during maize growth in the seedling jointing stage the 10 ats of the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 126 9 58 3 and 77 3 respectively compared with ck table 2 in the jointing tasseling stage the 10 at of the pm was significantly higher than those of the other treatments and there were no significant differences among sm psm and ck in 2011 and 2012 in 2013 2015 and 2018 the 10 c at of pm was significantly higher than those of other treatments with no significant differences between sm and psm which were both significantly higher than ck there were no significant differences among all treatments in the other years and in tasseling filling and filling stages there were no significant differences among all treatments 3 4 effects of mulching practice on maize seasonal water consumption in the seedling jointing stage water consumption of pm sm and psm treatments significantly decreased by 22 4 23 1 and 22 6 mm compared with ck respectively table 3 in the jointing tasseling stage water consumption in pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 45 3 26 4 and 33 9 mm compared with ck respectively in the tasseling filling stage water consumption of pm was significantly higher than the other treatments and 34 4 mm higher than for ck there were no significant differences between sm and psm but they were significantly higher by 18 2 and 24 7 mm compared with ck respectively in the filling stage water consumption was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck with all significantly differing water consumption of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 47 9 20 5 and 31 2 mm compared with ck respectively 3 5 effects of mulching practice on maize growth rate in the seedling jointing stage the maize growth rates of the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased by 143 9 75 1 and 85 3 compared with ck respectively table 4 herein the growth rates of pm sm and psm did not significantly differ from each other in 2012 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 but were significantly higher than for ck in the jointing tasseling stage growth rates in pm sm and psm treatments increased by 165 8 104 7 and 139 2 compared to ck respectively with significant differences among the mulching practices in 2012 2013 2015 and 2018 in the tasseling filling and filling stages the growth rates were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and significantly differed among these growth rates increased by 141 6 and 121 9 in pm 72 0 and 45 3 in sm 108 4 and 83 2 in psm respectively compared to ck 3 6 correlation of maize growth rates with 10 at the maize growth rates of all treatments were significantly positively correlated with 10 at in seedling jointing and jointing tasseling stages fig 3 in the tasseling filling and filling stages growth rates for all mulching practices were significantly positively correlated with 10 at the response intensity varied at the different growth stages and pm sm and psm treatments were the strongest in seedling jointing jointing tasseling and filling stages respectively this indicated that regulating intensities of the different mulching practices on soil hydrothermal conditions differed among growth stages which might be a mechanism to optimize mulching practices 3 7 correlations between maize growth rates and seasonal water consumption the seasonal water consumptions in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with maize growth rates in seedling jointing jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 4 the response intensities of growth rates to seasonal water consumption differed among growth stages the response intensities were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in seedling jointing jointing tasseling and tasseling filling stages and pm psm sm ck in the filling stage this showed that mulching practices promoted maize at the vegetative stage by enhancing its response to water and improved its drought resistance and ensured its stable yield increase by reducing the sensitivity of reproductive growth to water at the filling stage 3 8 correlations between seasonal water consumption and grain yield maize yields in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with seasonal water consumption in jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 5 the response intensities of yield to seasonal water consumption were highest in the jointing tasseling stage in all treatments and mulching reduced this sensitivity thus seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however droughts often occur at this stage in the region and mulching increased production by reducing the yield sensitivity to seasonal water consumption in this stage 3 9 effects of mulching practices on maize yield water consumption and wue the mulching practices significantly increased maize yield but with differences for years with different rainfall table 5 maize yields were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and significantly differed when annual precipitation ranged within 323 1 418 3 mm 2009 2011 and 2015 2017 the yield of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 330 5 157 3 and 223 4 compared with ck respectively and with more droughts the more yields increased when annual precipitation ranged within 484 4 533 3 mm 2012 2014 and 2018 the yields did not significantly differ between pm and psm and both were significantly higher than for sm and ck with pm 27 3 and 193 4 higher and psm 18 7 and 173 9 higher respectively there were no significant differences among et in all treatments the wues were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck and wues in pm sm and psm increased by 299 7 145 7 and 200 0 compared with ck respectively when annual precipitation was 323 1 418 3 mm 2009 2011 and 2015 2017 the wues of the pm and psm treatments did not significantly differ and were significantly higher than for sm and ck when annual precipitation was 484 4 533 3 mm 2012 2014 and 2018 4 discussion 4 1 mulching coordinated the seasonal soil hydrothermal relationship and improved maize growth yield and wue low temperatures and droughts occurring at early growth stages of spring maize are considered to be two main factors inhibiting the development of maize reproductive organs on the loess plateau li et al 2016a mulching significantly increases soil accumulative temperature at the early stages of maize growth promotes soil water and heat moving upward during the freezing thawing cycle and significantly increases sws before sowing wang et al 2013 2020 li et al 2016a which is beneficial for the emergence and formation of healthy and strong seedlings in this study the pm sm and psm treatments significantly increased sws in 0 300 cm before sowing and the 10 at in the seedling jointing stage which provided a good hydrothermal environment for maize growth consistent with other research results fan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 2020 deng et al 2020 in the region drought not only occurs in the early stage of maize growth but also during the whole growth period and especially during the jointing tasseling or tasseling filling stages the water consumption peaks of spring maize will inevitably affect the maize reproductive growth resulting in a decrease in the allocated proportion of energy to reproductive growth and yield wang et al 2014 research shows that mulching can regulate the water consumption process and accelerate utilization of soil water when precipitation is insufficient at jointing tasseling or tasseling filling stages which ensures normal maize reproductive growth wang et al 2013 2018 zhang et al 2019a deng et al 2020 we obtained the same result and increases in water consumptions were the largest in the pm treatment followed by psm and sm compared with ck yields of pm sm and psm treatments increased by 330 5 157 3 and 223 4 respectively and correspondingly wue increased by 299 7 145 7 and 200 0 however what is the relationship between growth rates and 10 c at and water consumption at different growth stages of maize how does maize growth rate respond to changes in accumulated temperature and water consumption at its different growth stages how does grain yield respond to seasonal water consumption at present no relevant reports have addressed these questions this study analyzed the relationships and response intensities between maize growth rates and seasonal hydrothermal changes and the grain yield responses to seasonal water consumption at different growth stages the growth rates were significantly positively correlated with 10 ats and seasonal water consumption in all treatments and mulching enhanced the response intensities which were ranked in order of pm psm sm ck in the seedling jointing stage figs 3 and 4 in the jointing tasseling stage growth rates in all treatments were significantly positively correlated with 10 at and seasonal water consumption the response intensities to 10 at were ranked in the order of sm psm pm ck and to water consumption in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 the reason for the different order was that as air temperature rose soil temperatures were not the main limiting factor for maize growth and the soil temperatures were ranked in the order of pm psm sm so that the sensitivities to the accumulative soil temperature changes were ranked in the order of sm psm pm with the ck water and heat exchanges were strong but large hydrothermal fluctuations were not conducive to maize growth so that maize growth responses to soil water and heat changes were weak the aboveground and underground parts for mulching practices grew more vigorously with their water use strengthened so that the responses to water consumption were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck in the tasseling filling stage there was no significant correlation of maize growth rates with 10 at but a significant positive correlation with seasonal water consumption and the responses intensities were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 the reason for the order was occurrence of the highest temperatures which could meet the needs of maize growth in the jointing tasseling stage so that it became insensitive to changes in accumulative temperature and so there was no significant correlation with 10 at early maize growth was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck the strong plants have strong metabolism and strong sensitivity to water so that sensitivity of maize growth rate to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the same order the warming effect of mulching occurred once again and maize water consumption reached a maximum in the filling stage so that the sensitivity of growth to soil temperature and water increased the growth rates were significantly positively correlated with 10 at except for ck and seasonal water consumption the response intensity to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the order of ck sm psm pm the possible reason was that water consumption of maize decreased with decreasing precipitation deng et al 2020 plastic film mulching can regulate and redistribute precipitation in time and space li et al 2016a so that maize can store more water in a low water requirement stage and use it in a high water requirement stage wang et al 2013 2018 zhang et al 2019a in this study mulching practice reduced the sensitivity of material transport to water and the response intensity of maize growth to seasonal water consumption was ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck figs 3 and 4 maize yield in all treatments was significantly positively correlated with seasonal water consumption in jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling stages fig 5 the response intensities were highest in the jointing tasseling stage in all treatments and mulching reduced the sensitivity this showed that seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however drought often occurs at this stage in the region and mulching increased production by reducing the sensitivity of yield to seasonal water consumption in this stage 4 2 obvious advantages for pm under annual precipitation 420 mm and similar performance of pm and psm under annual precipitation 420 mm the effects of plastic film mulching on maize yield and yield stability vary significantly with local climatic conditions increasing yield in areas with limited hydrothermal conditions gong et al 2015 li et al 2016d c d wang et al 2016a 2016b liu et al 2020 and increasing maize yield to a lesser extent in areas with abundant hydrothermal conditions sand mulching can maintain stable yields on farmland however it is difficult to cultivate and fertilize and the long term successive cropping leads to degenerated farmland soil salinization successive cropping obstacles and low water and fertilizer use efficiencies which have become a bottleneck restricting sustainable and healthy development of sand mulching ma et al 2018 du et al 2019 exploring farming practices suitable for different regions and balancing their production and ecology has become essential and led to a focus on sustainable agricultural development in semi arid rainfed areas in this study seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage contributed the most to yield however drought often occurs at this stage in the region mulching practices could coordinate hydrothermal relations at different stages of maize and improve its productivity and yields wues were ranked in the order of pm psm sm ck for annual precipitation below 420 mm with significant differences table 5 herein with the pm treatment yield and wue were more greatly increased in years of more drought consistent with other research gong et al 2015 li et al 2016b 2016c 2016d wang et al 2016a 2016b however yield and wue did not significantly differ between pm and psm for annual precipitation exceeding 420 mm these indicated that the pm had obvious advantages for annual precipitation below 420 mm and pm and psm did not perform differently for annual precipitation above 420 mm 5 conclusions mulching significantly increased the sws before sowing and accumulative soil temperature before jointing and alleviated stresses resulting from low temperature and drought in the early growth of maize mulching improved maize vegetative growth by enhancing its response intensity to 10 c at and water consumption at early growth stages and stabilized and promoted reproductive growth of maize by reducing its sensitivity of material transport to water at the seed filling stage the seasonal water consumption in the jointing tasseling stage was most critical to yield formation and mulching reduced sensitivity of this response this showed that mulching improved maize productivity by coordinating hydrothermal relations at key growth stages considering the production and environmental effects overall the pm treatment should be preferentially adopted in areas with rainfall below 420 mm and the psm in areas with rainfall above 420 mm so as to reduce plastic film use and environmental risks credit authorship contribution statement experimental design h l w x c z g p z x f y h z h y j f y f m and k n l

in irrigation and n inputs maximizes maize yield up to an optimum level liu and zhang 2007 irmak 2015a 2015b and this level can vary substantially with region climate and soil characteristics management practices hybrid and other factors limited n availability as well as water deficits in the crop root zone can impact critical plant traits such as leaf area index lai photosynthesis rate radiation light interception and use efficiency leaf area duration net assimilation rate chlorophyll content rubisco activity shoot weight plant n uptake and hence biomass production and grain yield novoa and loomis 1981 eck 1984 pandey et al 1984 2005 muchow 1988 mccullough et al 1994 moreover water and n supply are critical not only for yield increase but is also important for maintaining appropriate balance of these critical inputs in the plant root zone for grain quality mason and d croz mason 2002 nitrogen fertilizer is typically applied either post harvest in fall or spring before planting globally farmers mostly tend to apply pre plant n scharf and lory 2002 and this may lead to poor synchrony between n and crop demand furthermore when excessive n is applied with the goal of creating a non nitrogen stress conditions to increase yield productivity this can cause significant environmental including surface and groundwater resources human and animal health pollution risks when overirrigation is practiced this can cause anaerobic conditions in the plant root zone that can negatively impact plant water and nutrient uptake and can also increase leaching potential both of which can result in reduced productivity the last few decades have seen increased environmental issues in both water donner and kucharik 2008 zhang et al 2015 zillén et al 2008 and air aneja et al 2009 due to suboptimal n fertilizer and irrigation management for maize production maize has the most considerable portion of n losses among all cereals st luce et al 2011 in the u s maize accounts for the most abundant fraction 37 51 of the total annual n consumption snyder 2012 in nebraska nitrates have been ranked as the most common source of nebraska s groundwater contamination due to extensive irrigated maize production in approximately 1 82 million hectares usda 2018 in addition to other forms of n loses when n applications are made as a one time application in fall after harvest or early spring before planting precipitation especially excessive precipitation can accelerate n leaching in season or split side dressed n applications during critical crop growth stages has been suggested as a management option to potentially minimize n losses and increase n use efficiency welch et al 1971 stanley and rhoads 1977 russelle et al 1981 fox et al 1986 tarkalson et al 2009 hammad et al 2018 in season n applications can utilize irrigation systems i e center pivot subsurface drip and other forms of pressurized irrigation systems to deliver desired smaller n amounts to the crop at any stage with high efficiency and distribution uniformity a number of studies compared in season n timing applications prior to v8 maize growth stage against pre season or at planting n application jokela and randall 1989 roth et al 1995 bundy et al 1992 reeves and touchton 1986 stecker et al 1993 the primary goals of these studies were to develop best management practices to maximize grain yields and n use efficiencies under different environmental conditions among very limited research a comparison between pre plant and in season n applications on medium and fine textured soils showed that in season n applications are not likely to increase maize yields over the pre plant application in most growing seasons bundy 1986 nelson and macgregor 1973 stevenson and baldwin 1969 polito and voss 1991 reported from a 3 yr study in iowa that maize yield did not increase when splitting n applications between pre plant and in season as compared with pre plant n applications only randall et al 1997 found similar observations across three ridge tilled sites in minnesota tarkalson et al 2009 reported that there were no significant differences in maize grain yields between two n application rates that were made based on the university of nebraska lincoln s unl recommended algorithm rate minus 20 as split n applications at pre plant during planting and at v14 growth stage on a silt loam soil on the other hand there are studies that found it is advantageous to carry out split n applications crop n demand is varied among the maize growing stages and splitting the total n amount for in season applications may provide sufficient n supply at different crop growth stages that may effectively improve yields ciampitti and vyn 2011 liu et al 2014 therefore timing n with the exact required rate can be crucial to maximizing yield production vetsch and randall 2004 raun et al 2011 mahama et al 2016 this strategy may eliminate or at least reduce the duration of causing n to be susceptible to be lost by leaching denitrification ammonia volatilization and denitrification particularly during irrigation periods and or excessive precipitation events maharjan et al 2014 found that split urea application strategy increased yield and n uptake with lower nitrate leaching when compared to pre plant applied urea they reported that the direct n2o emissions were significantly lower under the split urea application the impact of split applications has also been observed to be a function of the irrigation water amount maharjan et al 2014 reported that full irrigation led to increase in no 3 leaching but did not impact n2o emissions horváth et al 2010 reported higher n losses under full irrigation treatments as well as increased direct n2o emissions when compared with deficit irrigation treatments in sandy soil in a semi arid condition extensive n fertilizer is applied in irrigated maize production globally and in the midwestern us

under sprinkler and micro irrigation have increased by about 9 5 and 763 respectively while there was a 25 decline in acreage under surface irrigation usda nass 2014 this dramatic shift of irrigated acreage from surface to sprinkler and micro irrigation is directed towards enhancing water use efficiency using more efficient irrigation technology in the light of increasing water scarcity and due to allocation moratoriums in irrigation water withdrawal irrigation and n dynamics have been shown to demonstrate interactions with each other and hence should be managed in a coupled manner especially when n is applied via irrigation system in sprinkler and microirrigation including sdi systems understanding these coupled effects of irrigation and n timing are becoming increasingly important due to a increasing interest in split n application to reduce environmental pollution from n b increasing interest in deficit or limited irrigation to maximize water use efficiency under limited water supply and irrigation capacities and c the adoption of high efficiency sprinkler and micro irrigation systems however to the best knowledge of the authors research efforts that investigate these interactions their impacts on crop growth and productivity and how do these impacts vary across surface sprinkler and microirrigation systems for maize grown under the same environment and management conditions simultaneously have not been investigated the lack of experimentally derived data information and knowledge are likely due to the extreme challenges that does not make such research economically labor wise and time wise feasible this research is aimed at fulfilling these critical infrastructural and management requirements to accomplish the goal of quantifying and evaluating coupled impacts of irrigation rates and n timing management strategies on maize growth development and yield productivity and possible differences in these impacts under surface furrow irrigation or fi sprinkler center pivot irrigation or cp and micro irrigation subsurface drip irrigation or sdi methods in the same field with the same slope soil properties and environmental conditions specifically these impacts were investigated via measuring and evaluating differences in maize growth and development lai plant height and stem diameter and grain yield when managed under

samples plant and grain samples were taken at harvest from 10 plants of each treatment from each field for plant n content analyses 2 5 2 canopy growth and development and growing degree days leaf area index lai was measured on a weekly to bi weekly basis from v3 3 leaf collar through r6 physiological maturity stages using the model lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa plant height was measured from v3 through r1 silking stage on a weekly to bi weekly basis plant height was measured as the distance between the soil surface near the stem to the tip of the longest leaf before tasseling and or to the tip of the tassel after tasseling stage both lai and plant height were sampled roughly in the same area in the plot interior leaf collar method leaf collar visible was used to determine the physiological growth stages ten plants from the middle of the plots two replications per treatment that represented at least 50 of the population were used to stage vegetative reproductive growth stages on a weekly to bi weekly basis throughout both growing seasons stem diameter cm was measured from 10 plants from the interior row that randomly sampled by using a vernier caliper at r3 i e kernel milk stage at the base of the stem above the soil surface growing degree days gdd was used as the base scale to represent the progression of in season maize growth and development gdd c is a quantitative indicator to denote the heat accumulation throughout the growing season which is considered as one of the significant factors that control the rate of plant development in addition to other factors such as soil water status fertilizers light daylight length etc the cumulative gdd was calculated using the most widely accepted method mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 eq 1 the air temperature data used for computation of gdd was measured at an agricultural weather data network awdn automated weather station managed by the high plains regional climate center hprcc 2 cumulative gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t base where tmax and tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and tbase is the crop specific base temperature taken as 10 c for days when the average of tmax and tmin was lower than tbase it was replaced by the tbase and hence gdd for that day was computed as 0 no upper limit for temperature e g 30 c for maize was imposed because there exists strong evidence to show that transpiration and hence assimilation processes are not hindered at such temperatures 30 c under the environmental conditions at the experimental site irmak and mutiibwa 2010 2 6 experimental design and statistical analysis while the treatments were the same between the irrigation methods each experimental field had a different experimental design layout which was a function of irrigation system design the cp field had a split split plot design with n application timing in the main plots and the irrigation application levels in the subplots with four replications for each treatment the sdi and fi fields had a randomized complete block design with three replications for each treatment to distinguish potential significant differences in lai plant height stem diameter and grain yield as a result of treatments imposed glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc 2003 cary nc usa was used for statistical analyses a fisher s protected least significant differences lsd test was conducted at the 95 confidence level to determine if there were significant differences between the treatments and identify which ones are different from each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions monthly summaries of meteorological variables at the experimental site during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons along with long term 1983 2015 30 year climatology means are presented in table 2 the 2017 growing season was wetter than 2016 growing season and most of the high precipitation events occurred during may and late september through october nevertheless both growing seasons were drier than the long term mean growing season precipitation fig 4 by 24 in 2016 and 5 in 2017 during 2017 growing season the site received about 58 mm of precipitation after planting which along with low air temperatures caused delay in maize emergence by about a week table 2 the maximum tmax minimum tmin and average tavg air temperatures were slightly warmer 0 4 1 0 and 0 7 c in the 2016 growing season than in 2017 the warmer temperatures in 2016 contributed to the increase in the accumulated growing degree days from planting to harvest from emergence to harvest cumulated gdd values were 1752 and 1589 c in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively maize was harvested at 179 days after planting dap november 01 in 2016 except fi field which was harvested 152 dap october 05 and at 178 dap november 06 in 2017 relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 were higher by 5 6 and 18 respectively in the 2016 growing season than 2017 the substantial u2 variability across the two seasons did not proportionally translate into rh variability incoming solar radiation rs during 2016 growing season was 1 6 lower than in 2017 but was similar to long term mean rs 3 2 irrigation level and method and n management impacts on plant height plant height is an important plant growth and development variable that influences numerous plant physiological and biophysical properties such as light interception aerodynamic resistance radiation absorption leaf area etc also plant height has strong correlation to lai djaman et al 2013 which can provide a practical approach for estimating this variable averaged maize plant height by n and irrigation method as well as plant height distribution as a function of cumulative gdd for different n and irrigation level treatments in the cp sdi and fi methods in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in figs 5c d 6 7 8 and table 3 overall there was a significant difference p 0 05 in plant height in the fi between the given irrigation level within the growing season for example plant height values were significantly higher at fit 80 fit 60 fit irrigation levels in 2016 than for the respective treatments in 2017 growing seasons also in terms of method differences including all treatments the plant height values were significantly p 0 05 higher in order of fi cp sdi in 2016 growing season and they were significantly p 0 05 higher in order of cp sdi fi in 2017 growing in comparison of the combination of non traditional nt methods of nt 1 and nt 2 vs tn with respect to irrigation method i e cp and sdi differences by holding levels of irrigation nitrogen and year constant showed that there were significantly higher p 0 05 plant height values in cp method than in sdi 60 fit nt cp sdi 60 fit tn cp sdi 80 fit nt and cp sdi fit tn in 2016 growing season and in cp sdi 60 fit nt cp sdi 80 fit nt and cp sdi fit tn in 2017 growing season the plant height was significantly lower in the rft than 60 fit 80 fit and fit tn irrigation level in the fi method in 2016 season and in the rft than 80 fit and fit irrigation levels in 2017 growing season on the other hand there was no significant difference p 0 05 between rft and other irrigation levels in the sdi in both years the rft plant height was significantly lower than those in the fit tn in both years table 3 plant height was influenced by irrigation treatments across all irrigation methods more in 2016 than in 2017 as expected the lower and higher plant heights were observed at rft and fit respectively across the n treatments irrigation methods and years however in most cases plant height had similar magnitudes between the irrigation treatments of 60 fit 80 fit and fit across the irrigation methods n treatments and years the lowest plant height of 2 3 fi rft 2 4 sdi rft and 2 5 m cp rft was observed in the 2016 growing season and 2 2 fi rft 2 4 sdi rft and 2 4 m cp rft was observed in 2017 this result was similar to the findings of chilundo et al 2016 that similarly findings was reported by o robles et al 2017 that differences in maize height were observed between the two growing seasons of 2015 1 96 m and 2016 2 15 m seasons and the irrigation treatment had significantly affect maize height in 2016 under low pressure solid set sprinkler irrigation system in contrast in the work of chilundo et al 2016 reported that irrigation methods of furrow and drip irrigation methods had not influenced maize height and irrigation 75 of the crop water requirement level yielded higher plant than 100 level researchers e g birch et al 2002 bennouna et al 2004 reported that maize when exposed to water stress during vegetative and tasseling stages reduce plant height soler et al 2007 reported that maize under rainfed conditions had 5 reduction in height as compared with maize under irrigated conditions 2 17 m the measured maximum maize height of 2 7 cp fit tn 2 5 sdi fit tn 2 6 fi fit tn 2 8 cp fit nt 1 2 6 sdi fit nt 1 2 7 cp fit nt 2 and 2 6 m sdi fit nt 2 was observed in 2016 growing season and 2 6 cp fit tn 2 4 sdi fit tn 2 4 fi fit tn 2 7 cp fit nt 1 2 6 sdi fit nt 12 7 cp fit nt 2 and 2 6 m sdi fit nt 2 in 2017 growing season across years and treatments plant height reached peaked measures around 104 dap august 17 and 95 dap august 14 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 irrigation level and method and n management impacts on leaf area index the seasonal 2016 2017 patterns of lai as a function of cumulative growing degree days cgdd for all n and irrigation treatments for cp sdi and fi methods are presented in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively the impact of n timing and irrigation levels across three irrigation methods were studied using two lai features a mean lai during the growing season and b peak lai during the growing season no significant difference was detected for the seasonal mean lai between 2016 and 2017 for cp and sdi methods but fi had significantly higher p 0 0001 lai in 2017 than in 2016 however within each growing season lai showed significant differences among the irrigation methods table 3 in 2016 lai was significantly p 0 05 higher in sdi by 5 8 than cp and by 9 6 than fi while there were no significant differences p 0 0681 between cp and fi but cp had 3 8 higher magnitudes than fi in 2017 lai in fi was significantly p 0 0031 higher by 6 1 than cp but there were no significant differences p 0 5734 between fi and sdi moreover sdi was significantly p 0 0107 higher by 5 1 than cp mean lai was found to be significantly different among irrigation methods but only for specific irrigation levels for example in the 60 fit lai was significantly p 0 0051 higher in fi than cp and in cp than sdi p 0 0036 and also in sdi than fi p 0 044 and cp than sdi p 0 0321 for the 80 fit and higher in sdi than fi for fit mean lai was significantly different between cp and sdi methods when averaged over n timing year and irrigation levels moreover mean lai showed significant differences p 0 05 between the rf and all irrigation levels across all the irrigation methods generally there was no significant difference p 0 05 between mean and peak lai any of the irrigation except rft and nitrogen treatments in both years at both seasonally averaged lai and peaked lai table 3 the peak lai of 5 0 5 7 and 4 2 m2 m 2 occurred at 77 95 and 61 dap july 21 august 8 and july 5 in 2016 while peak lai of 5 6 6 0 and 5 4 m2 m 2 occurred at 81 81 and 61 dap july 31 july 31 and july 11 in 2017 in the cp sdi and fi respectively the peak lai of 6 4 6 3 and 5 6 m2 m 2 were observed in fit tn fit nt 1 and 60 fit tn for cp sdi and fi during 2016 respectively during 2017 the peak lai of 6 5 6 1 and 5 8 was observed in 60 fit nt 1 fit nt 1 and 60 fit tn for cp sdi and fi respectively the mean lai was not impacted by any limited irrigation treatment because the initial soil water content was similarly sufficient between the treatments and there was no water stress impact on plant growth and development and thus lai was similar in most of the treatments the differences in soil water availability in various treatments and thus lai only began to appear later in the season as a function of irrigation treatment but differences were not large enough to be statistically significant or affect foliage growth the lowest mean lai was found in rft across all irrigation methods during both growing seasons also rft reached its peak lai earlier than other treatments since the imposition of water stress causes a tendency for plants to senesce mature early the peak lai values varied among irrigation methods and growing seasons as well as in their time of occurrence in 2017 as well as 2016 growing season the mean of peak lai in tn treatment across all irrigation levels was similar between cp 5 9 and sdi 5 8 but was 7 3 higher than the average of irrigation treatments in fi 5 5 the mean of peak lai of nt 1 and nt 2 across all irrigation levels was 7 higher in cp 6 2 than sdi 5 8 13 higher in cp 6 2 than fi and 5 5 higher in sdi than fi there were no substantial differences between peak and mean lai in nt 1 and nt 2 across the irrigation treatments within a given irrigation method and between cp and sdi in 2016 the mean of peak lai across the irrigation all treatments fit 80 fit and 60 fit for the tn treatment was identical for cp 6 2 and sdi 6 2 which were 24 greater than that in fi 5 0 the irrigation method had a substantial influence on lai and this could be attributed to the differences in irrigation efficiency achieved in these irrigation methods irrigation efficiency of sdi cp fi higher irrigation efficiency may allow greater quantity of water retention in the soil profile root zone per unit of water pumped in sdi and cp methods than in fi moreover the potential for nutrient leaching can be highest in fi method followed by cp and sdi however we observe from our findings that lai was not impacted by tn or nt application of nitrogen in and across cp and sdi methods the mean lai values in nt 1 and nt 2 across all irrigation levels were similar to that of tn treatment within sdi and cp as well as across them this means crop obtained adequate n from the root zone in either n application treatment i e tn and nt 1 and nt 2 there were no substantial differences in lai across the n and irrigation treatments in sdi as mentioned previously the two n treatments only differed in application timing and not amount this implies that while nt nitrogen application at least theoretically is intended to improve n uptake we did not observe this in our experiments at least when lai differences are considered this might be due to lower opportunity for n leaching or loss at the site or during the growing seasons moreover the n amounts that were applied were conservatively sufficient based on unl recommendations and carefully measured site specific nitrogen credentials and nitrogen requirements this strategy when combined with well distributed wetting events potentially ensured maximum plant n uptake and rendered minimal opportunity for n loss eventually making tn or nt nitrogen management strategies more or less equivalent although the imposed irrigation and n timing treatments did not have a consistent impact on lai this does not imply that the growth and development was not affected and other parameters of growth and productivity have to be evaluated the peak lai among irrigation methods clearly varied consistently especially in fi method overall the observations of maize lai measured in this research are in accordance with lai measured previously under various irrigation methods irmak and djaman 2016a 2016b and irrigation levels djaman et al 2013 in the same site barideh et al 2018 reported that the highest maize lai rate was observed under conventional irrigation method as compared to alternate partial root zone irrigation and fixed partial root zone irrigation khalili et al 2020 also reported that the maize lai was decreased at 50 irrigation level significantly p 0 05 compared to 100 irrigation level on maize under alternate furrow irrigation system 3 4 treatment impacts on physiological development and stem diameter the two growing seasons had similar time i e dap on reaching the three maize stages i e v8 vt and r3 that was planned to receive the in season n applications across irrigation methods i e cp and sdi and treatments maize reached v8 vt and r3 growth stages around 48 73 and 89 dap june 22 july 17 and august 2 respectively in 2016 growing season and it reached v8 vt and r3 stages around 43 74 and 92 dap june 23 july 24 and august 11 respectively in 2017 n treatments i e pre plant n application and in season n applications irrigation treatments and methods did not affect maize growth and development in terms of time required reaching the aforementioned stages the results from the averaged lai of irrigation treatments including rft conditions for a given year and n treatment demonstrated that there was a difference in lai magnitude n treatments i e higher lai in nt 1 and nt 2 over tn at cp and sdi methods figs 9b d 10b and d however the differences were larger between the irrigation treatments for the given n treatment figs 9a c 10a c 11a and c moreover the initiation of the changing in lai magnitudes varied depending on the irrigation level coupled with given nitrogen treatment irrigation method and year figs 9 10 and 11 in the past three decades researchers have used stem diameter changes in plant water assessment and plant response to different environmental variables and management stem diameter was shown to be related to the plant water status klepper et al 1971 molz and klepper 1972 jarvis 1975 in this research stem diameter was measured to evaluate the agronomic traits larger plant stem diameter usually indicates more reserves and energy accumulation thus more and a better grain filling also it tends to provide a support structure for the ears the largest stem diameter of 2 39 fit nt 1 2 43 60 fit nt 1 and 2 25 fit tn cm was observed at cp sdi and fi methods in 2016 growing season respectively and 2 83 60 fit nt 2 2 79 80 fit tn and 2 46 80 fit tn cm at cp sdi and fi methods in 2017 respectively table 3 there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the treatments within cp and fi except few pairwise combinations that had a significant difference in sdi in the 2016 growing season table 3 however there were some pairwise differences between the treatments at cp and sdi in 2017 growing season a possible explanation for this might be that the plants were not impacted by the water deficit in 2016 as it was more pronounced in 2017 growing season also the inconsistency observed between the fields and years may be due to the soil spatial variability and as a result variations in soil water distribution and re distribution from irrigation and or rainfall there was not a significant p 0 05 three way interaction between all the variables when comparing tn treatment across all methods however the two way interactions irrigation method by year interaction and the year by irrigation treatment interaction were both significant p 0 05 all irrigation methods showed significantly higher values in 2017 growing season than 2016 growing season for a given irrigation method in comparison of irrigation methods there was only one significant difference in 2017 growing season for example the averaged stem diameter across tn treatments and irrigation levels in the sdi was significantly higher than cp and fi also plants in cp field had significantly higher stem diameter than those in fi field considering all three n timing application strategies across cp and sdi the four way and three way interactions were not significant when comparing the years by irrigation method for the same n treatments stem diameters were significantly higher in 2017 than in 2016 kang et al 2000 found that maize stem diameter showed no significant differences among three irrigation methods of alternate furrow irrigation fixed furrow irrigation and conventional furrow irrigation and three levels of irrigation amounts in maize production in an arid area environment rasool et al 2020 in experiments to study the behavior of deficit drip irrigation system under three four irrigation levels of 100 90 75 and 60 of etc respectively and furrow irrigation system they reported that maize stem diameter had slight differences among 100 90 and 75 of etc under surface drip irrigation system whereas observed a notable decrease in 60 etc and furrow irrigation system 3 5 relationship between maize lai and plant height field measurements of plant lai can be difficult and more complex task than measuring plant height which is a very simple process thus experimentally established relationships between plant height and lai can be used as a more practical approach to estimate lai and as an index to quantify plant growth rate the relationships between the two variables developed in this research can provide opportunity to estimate lai from plant height under different irrigation levels and n management strategies under different irrigation methods which has not been done previously however the limitation of this approach raises up at the point when lai starts to decrease while plant height remains relatively constant after it reaches its maxima strong linear relationships were observed between lai and plant height in all irrigation and n treatments and all irrigation methods and years figs 12 13 and 14 the slopes across n and irrigation treatments for a given irrigation method increased from rft to fit and ranged from 2 05 to 2 21 for cp from 2 16 to 2 27 for sdi and from 1 82 to 1 94 for fi another significant aspect is that the slopes for the pooled data were similar between tn and nt nitrogen treatments in cp and sdi methods fig 12k and l for tn and 17k and l for nt this suggests that there was no considerable n treatment impact on the lai vs plant height relationship thereby on the magnitude of the slope value the slopes were higher in cp and sdi than fi this could be due to greater lai values corresponding with the plant height values in the beginning of the 2017 growing season than in 2016 and this inconstancy in fi likely to be related mainly to the lower irrigation efficiency data not shown in fi as compared with the cp and sdi this means that the soil moisture in the plant root zone in fi is susceptible to a greater distribution variability in fi than in cp and sdi and this potentially led to increased plant growth variation in plant height vs lai relationship soil moisture distribution variability is normalized or less with cp and sdi methods especially in the fit than in fi the main reason for this is that plants uptake soil water more uniformly in fit irrigation level in the cp and sdi than fi in accordance with the present results previous studies by other researchers pieri and fuchs 1990 sadek et al 2006 djaman et al 2013 also demonstrated linear and strong relationships between plant height and lai for cotton and maize however no research quantified these relationships for maize for different irrigation and nitrogen management under three different irrigation methods under the same management and environmental conditions 3 6 irrigation and nitrogen treatments and irrigation methods impacts on maize grain yield maize grain yields across all the treatments ranged from 9 6 to 16 6 mg ha 1 cp 9 1 16 4 mg ha 1 sdi and 9 8 15 2 mg ha 1 fi in 2016 and from 9 3 to 17 0 mg ha 1 cp 10 9 16 1 mg ha 1 sdi and 7 9 14 0 mg ha 1 fi in 2017 table 3 for all treatments the grain yield exhibited an upward trend with increasing applied irrigation amount the highest grain yields were measured in the fit irrigation level across all n treatments i e tn nt 1 and nt 2 in all three irrigation methods in both years table 3 however the highest grain yield of 17 0 mg ha 1 was observed in cp in 2017 grain yields were notably altered by irrigation levels for the tn nitrogen and nt nitrogen treatments for the given irrigation method and general trend was increasing in grain yield with an increase in irrigation amount table 3 the generally average grain yield across all treatments including both cp and sdi were marginally 1 6 higher in 2017 than in 2016 and grain yields between the two growing seasons were not significant p 0 05 for the same treatments as a result of the same maize variety same agronomic practices and similar weather parameters i e solar radiation and gdd although the total amount of irrigation and rainfall was higher in 2017 the uneven rainfall distribution in 2016 led to an insignificant impact on grain yield production one of the reasons of higher yield in 2017 is that cooler tmax during the reproductive stage coupled with relatively cooler tmin for the growing season and higher vpd data not shown high air temperatures 30 c during the reproductive stage may limit photosynthesis process and adversely affect grain filling and hot nights may also reduce grain production by increasing respiration process using sugar as energy rather than kernel production and that is why maize prefers cooler nights with ambient temperatures of around 15 5 c however fi showed significantly higher p 0 05 yields in 2016 than that in 2017 table 3 which primarily associated with the soil at that specific site this might suggest that the most combination and concentration of mineral nutrients were adequately available in the soil in the 2016 growing season and relatively consumed or even leached mobile nutrients in 2017 because of the higher amount of seasonal total irrigation amount applied in most cases the coefficient of variance cv values of the grain yields calculated by the ratio of the standard deviation of the grain yield to the mean of the grain yield were relatively small indicating small variations between the replications of a given treatment table 3 the cv values of grain yield for the three irrigation methods treatments and two years were below 20 except the rft treatment in the sdi in 2016 indicating low yield variability between the replications there were relatively high cv values in the fi method field in 2017 in addition to the rft treatment in sdi in 2016 the three type tests of fixed effects showed that the irrigation treatments p 0 0006 and the irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0024 were significant on grain yield production average grain yield across the irrigation levels i e fit 80 fit and 60 fit for the tn treatment at the given irrigation method within a year showed significant differences between fi and cp and it was 8 1 and 25 5 higher in cp in 2016 and 2017 respectively also between fi and sdi which had 8 1 and 23 higher yield in sdi in 2016 and 2017 respectively this could be due to fi having higher irrigation depths applied and lower irrigation efficiency because of the difficulties on ensuring uniform distribution of water with the fi method as compared with cp and sdi methods as well as less water storage in the plant root zone and higher water losses through deep percolation and surface run off data not shown in the fi method as compared with sdi and cp methods moreover the irrigation efficiency for the fi method is approximately 45 65 as compared with 75 85 for the cp and 95 for the sdi methods therefore this higher water losses in the fi method may cause increased n leaching from the plant root zone which can negatively affect maize n uptake and grain yield there was no significant difference p 0 05 within a year between sdi and cp methods in any of the growing season when grouping the irrigation levels across the irrigation methods and years there were significant yield differences between 60 fit and 80 fit and 60 fit and fit irrigation treatments there was no significant difference between the 80 fit and fit treatments in comparison between three n levels tn nt 1 and nt 2 in the sdi and cp irrigation methods and fit 80 fit and 60 fit irrigation levels for both years the statistical tests of fixed effects showed that three irrigation treatment was significant p 0 0001 on grain yield production while the irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0551 was not significant moreover significant differences were found between years within irrigation method in cp p 0 0121 higher yield in 2017 and between cp and sdi p 0 0012 higher yield in cp in 2017 these findings indicate that maize grain yields under cp with combined n treatments can be optimized the irrigation methodology and n timing applications strategies interactions on maize grain yields more effectively than in sdi in 2017 however the grouped n treatments need further investigation to unravel the actual n treatment impact on yield as explained in the next paragraph furthermore there were significant differences between all levels of the irrigation treatment between 60 fit and 80 fit p 0 0001 higher yield in 80 fit and between 60 fit and fit p 0 0001 higher yield in the fit as well as between 80 fit and fit p 0 0101 higher yield in the fit grouping nt 1 and nt 2 vs tn treatment across the irrigation levels and years in cp and sdi methods it was found that the irrigation treatment p 0 0001 and irrigation method x nitrogen interactions were significant p 0 0453 while irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0581 was not significant the nt 1 and nt 2 nitrogen treatments had significantly higher grain yields than tn treatment at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi moreover nt 1 and nt 2 nitrogen treatments in cp method had significantly higher grain yields than in sdi finally there were significant differences between all three irrigation levels and higher yields in the 80 fit than 60 fit and in the fit than 80 fit irrigation levels these results indicate that the lower yield in the tn treatment in both sdi and cp as compared with grouped nt n treatments was a result of the possibility of n loss via leaching when it applied as a one time application at pre plant therefore the n was not available adequately as compared with split n application methods which maintained n readily available for crops throughout the growing season and plants had more opportunity to access n as needed on the other hand there was no significant difference between nt 1 and nt 2 therefore nt 1 can be considered as a preferred management practice which could maximize the economic return by saving the fourth time side dress n application at r3 growth stage the tn 1 yielded 4 3 higher in the cp than that in sdi method and the tn 2 was similar between sdi and cp the individual seasonal statistical analysis for cp sdi and fi method is presented in table 3 in fi maize grain yields ranged from 9 8 to 15 2 mg ha 1 and from 7 9 m to 14 0 mg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the highest grain yields of 15 2 and 14 0 mg ha 1 were observed in the 2016 and 2017 growing season respectively table 3 the three type tests of fixed effects showed that both irrigation treatment and year were significant on grain yield production with p values of 0 0001 and 0 00175 respectively the fi method did not have any significant difference p 0 05 among the three irrigation levels of 60 fit 80 fit and fit in both years however rft was significantly lower p 0 05 than 60 fit 80 fit and fit levels in both growing seasons as explained previously table 3 pooled grain yields data showed that the comparisons in the 60 fit irrigation level were significantly different between the two years and higher in 2016 than 2017 also it was marginally significantly p 0 0495 different between 60 fit and fit irrigation levels higher grain yield with fit the statistical analysis with more data points may increase values in the upper and lower limit as a result the yield response was clearly shown in the pooled data in the 60 fit however there was no significant difference between 80 fit and fit because the pooled yield results were similar and as a result the 80 fit irrigation level can be recommended as an effective management practice in water limiting areas in sdi method maize grain yields ranged from 9 1 to 16 0 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 0 16 8 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 0 16 8 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2016 yield ranged from 10 9 to 16 1 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 15 9 16 5 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 4 16 7 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2017 superior grain yields were obtained for nt treatments of nt 1 and nt 2 at the three irrigation levels as compared with tn treatment and the year effect was not significant p 0 5964 on grain yield production thus the statistical analysis was tested the pooled data between the irrigation treatments within each of the different nitrogen treatments which indicated that the crop responded to treatments similarly the simple effect comparisons did not show any significant differences between the n treatments within each irrigation level on the other hand there were significant differences between the irrigation levels within each of the different nitrogen treatments therefore nt treatments showed a significant difference between 60 fit and fit levels at tn 1 and between rft and 60 fit 80 fit and fit levels the results confirm that the nt 1 is an effective practice to maximize yield production under the sdi method with 60 fit and 80 fit irrigation levels in cp method maize grain yields ranged from 9 6 to 16 6 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 4 17 3 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 2 17 3 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2016 yield ranged from 9 3 to 17 0 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 5 17 8 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 6 17 6 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2017 the nt 1 and nt 2 treatments at three irrigation levels were performed superiorly as compared with tn treatment similar to the sdi method the year effect was not significant p 0 1733 hence the statistical analysis was tested the pooled data and showed that there were some significant differences between the n treatments within some of the irrigation levels for example at three irrigation levels of 60 fit 80 fit and fit there were significant differences in nt 1 vs tn and nt 2 vs tn treatment with higher yields in both nt treatments also there were more significant differences between the irrigation levels within each n treatments as compared with the sdi method whereas the irrigation levels within each of the different nitrogen treatments showed significant differences for example in the nt 1 there was only one significant difference between 60 fit and fit while in the nt 2 there were significant differences between 60 fit and 80 fit and between 60 fit and fit when comparing the grain yield in the fit irrigation level with the results of djaman et al 2013 at the same research site and irrigation method the grain yields were higher in this current research by 12 than the measured value of 15 5 mg ha 1 in the nt 1 and nt 2 in 2016 and 13 5 15 than the measured value of 15 5 mg ha 1 t at nt 1 and nt 2 in 2017 respectively similarly our results were higher 23 5 cp nt 1 to 13 cp nt 2 in 2016 and 27 cp nt 1 to 26 cp nt 2 in 2017 respectively than a result of a research conducted by irmak et al 2019 at the same location under linear move sprinkler irrigation system these results cast a new light on both nt 1 and nt 2 n management that they perform better than tn especially nt 2 had greater yield than nt 1 the tn showed that the statistical differences were found between rft and 60 fit 80 fit and fit irrigation levels with rft treatment having lower yields at fit and also between 60 fit and fit irrigation level with 60 fit having lower yields than fit these results indicate that the cp method maximized n availability when it applied via the system fertigation because the system tends to apply n uniformly over the entire field and that may lead to maximize n availability in the soil especially topsoil profile 3 7 spatial grain yield and frequency distribution while the treatment mean grain yields depict plot aggregated crop response to irrigation amount and n fertilizer timing it is worthwhile to decipher the spatial distribution of yield response across the fields the high resolution yield monitoring capabilities of the harvester allowed for analytically quantifying the distribution characteristics and mapping grain yield in each field the yield monitor data was interpolated using inverse distance weighing technique in arcmap 10 7 esri redlands ca grain yield maps clearly demonstrate the spatial variability that was encountered upon harvest because of treatment imposition in 2016 and 2017 figs 15a and 16a moreover the maps also allow for a fair comparison of how each field performed across the two growing seasons and bring out the year to year variability variation in the frequency distribution of maize grain yield was considerably affected by the methodology of the given irrigation system and the combination of the weather variables for the given season both maps 2016 and 2017 had some areas of yield variation that were not management driven but rather other error sources such as reduced yields from center pivot tracks and irregular harvester maneuvers around permanently installed instrumentation in the field these erroneous data points were removed before analyzing the frequency distribution of grain yields in each field the frequency distribution of grain yields achieved in each field in 2016 and 2017 are shown in figs 15b and 16b the frequency distribution figs 15b and 16b analyzed and classified 39617 12632 and 1924 grid cells for the cp sdi and fi fields respectively into grain yield bins of 2 mg ha 1 ranging from 0 to 18 mg ha 1 comparing cp and sdi fields across figs 15a and 16a it can be deduced that grain yields were higher in 2017 than 2016 due to conducive weather conditions explained earlier in section 3 6 although this difference was statistically insignificant when averaged across the fields on a finer spatial scale it was found that substantially greater proportion of the cp and sdi fields showed greater yields in 2017 than the remainder of both the fields on the other hand fi showed greater yields in 2016 than 2017 across majority of the acreage of the field which was attributed to soil characteristics and nutrient availability see section 3 6 this year to year difference is also easily detectable from the rainfed treatments e g 4 sectors in cp field corresponding to 0 t which are darker brown in 2016 than 2017 also evident is the importance of using broader outer spans for detecting treatment effects in cp due to the suboptimal irrigation application precision in narrower inner spans the contrast of crop response to water availability at upstream and downstream ends of the fi field is also visible in both years the frequency distributions figs 15b and 16b convey the grain yield distribution as affected by various irrigation methods among the three irrigation methods cp and sdi had narrower distributions than fi which is evident from the mean absolute deviation mad of the data points in figs 15b and 16b mad was the lowest implying narrowest distribution for cp 1 44 mg ha 1 followed by sdi 1 83 mg ha 1 and fi 2 42 mg ha 1 in 2016 whereas it was lowest for sdi 1 21 mg ha 1 closely followed by cp 1 23 mg ha 1 and fi 3 51 mg ha 1 in 2017 the highest frequency of occurrence proportion of field falling under a given yield bin was found for the 14 16 mg ha 1 range for both cp and sdi whereas for fi 12 14 mg ha 1 range had the highest frequency very closely followed by 14 16 mg ha 1 since all fields had the same proportion of their respective acreages under various treatments it is interesting to note the contrast among the yield distribution in fi vs cp and sdi figs 15b and 16b against largely symmetric and unimodal distributions observed for cp and sdi fi had presents a more uniform and rather bimodal distribution in 2017 this is attributable to the lower irrigation efficiency higher deep percolation and runoff and increased n leaching in fi cp in 2016 and sdi in 2017 had the highest area proportion 55 under the peak grain yield bin 14 16 mg ha 1 whereas fi only had 30 and 21 of area under its peak grain yield bin of 12 14 mg ha 1 while roughly the same area was under the 14 16 mg ha 1 this underscores the importance of irrigation efficiency differences among the three irrigation methods which is highest for sdi followed by cp and fi the sub plot level high resolution yield analysis corroborates earlier observation of decrease in the spread of yield distribution lowering of mad with an increase in irrigation efficiency 4 summary and conclusions the effect of coupled impacts of irrigation rates and n timing management strategies on maize growth development and yield productivity under different irrigation methods were investigated by field experiments in in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climates near clay center nebraska usa results reveal that in all cases lai showed higher values in the nt 1 and nt 2 n treatments over tn treatment across the two irrigation methods of cp and sdi in both growing seasons irrigation method had a substantial influence on lai seasonal trends and it was higher at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi than in fi method across the irrigation levels n treatments and both growing seasons the peak lai values varied between the irrigation methods and years as well as in terms of the time they occurred there was a statistical difference between the nt nitrogen treatments and tn treatment at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi utilizing seasonally averaged lai approach was better than the peaked lai approach on reflecting more realistic crop growth development determinations the cp method had a statistically higher plant height than sdi and fi and sdi method had higher plant height than fi stem diameter was not influenced by the irrigation method and n treatment but was influenced by irrigation level in the cp and sdi in 2017 grain yields were notably altered by irrigation level for the tn and nt nitrogen treatments for the given irrigation method across all treatments and years yields were statistically higher at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi similar between cp and sdi than fi in general results suggest that both cp and sdi performed superiorly than fi in terms of maize grain yield production across all irrigation levels fit 80 fit and 60 fit and n application timing treatments the nt 1 in the 80 fit showed the best grain yield production among the combination of irrigation level and n application timing treatments this research has provided deeper quantitative insight in terms of better understanding the irrigation levels and n management vs crop growth and development variables and grain yield under three different irrigation methods these research findings can aid in developing best management strategies in terms of

irrigation method had a substantial influence on lai and both cp and sdi had 24 higher averaged lai than fi across traditional n treatments the highest grain yields were observed under nt 1 and nt 2 at fit across the irrigation methods the highest grain yields of 17 3 16 8 and 15 2 mg ha 1 were observed in 100 nt 1 cp 100 nt 1 sdi and 100 t fi in the 2016 growing season respectively and 17 8 16 7 and 14 mg ha 1 were observed in 100 nt 1 cp 100 nt 2 sdi and 100 t fi in the 2017 growing season respectively the traditional n treatment showed significantly p 0 05 higher yield under cp than fi 8 1

in irrigation and n inputs maximizes maize yield up to an optimum level liu and zhang 2007 irmak 2015a 2015b and this level can vary substantially with region climate and soil characteristics management practices hybrid and other factors limited n availability as well as water deficits in the crop root zone can impact critical plant traits such as leaf area index lai photosynthesis rate radiation light interception and use efficiency leaf area duration net assimilation rate chlorophyll content rubisco activity shoot weight plant n uptake and hence biomass production and grain yield novoa and loomis 1981 eck 1984 pandey et al 1984 2005 muchow 1988 mccullough et al 1994 moreover water and n supply are critical not only for yield increase but is also important for maintaining appropriate balance of these critical inputs in the plant root zone for grain quality mason and d croz mason 2002 nitrogen fertilizer is typically applied either post harvest in fall or spring before planting globally farmers mostly tend to apply pre plant n scharf and lory 2002 and this may lead to poor synchrony between n and crop demand furthermore when excessive n is applied with the goal of creating a non nitrogen stress conditions to increase yield productivity this can cause significant environmental including surface and groundwater resources human and animal health pollution risks when overirrigation is practiced this can cause anaerobic conditions in the plant root zone that can negatively impact plant water and nutrient uptake and can also increase leaching potential both of which can result in reduced productivity the last few decades have seen increased environmental issues in both water donner and kucharik 2008 zhang et al 2015 zillén et al 2008 and air aneja et al 2009 due to suboptimal n fertilizer and irrigation management for maize production maize has the most considerable portion of n losses among all cereals st luce et al 2011 in the u s maize accounts for the most abundant fraction 37 51 of the total annual n consumption snyder 2012 in nebraska nitrates have been ranked as the most common source of nebraska s groundwater contamination due to extensive irrigated maize production in approximately 1 82 million hectares usda 2018 in addition to other forms of n loses when n applications are made as a one time application in fall after harvest or early spring before planting precipitation especially excessive precipitation can accelerate n leaching in season or split side dressed n applications during critical crop growth stages has been suggested as a management option to potentially minimize n losses and increase n use efficiency welch et al 1971 stanley and rhoads 1977 russelle et al 1981 fox et al 1986 tarkalson et al 2009 hammad et al 2018 in season n applications can utilize irrigation systems i e center pivot subsurface drip and other forms of pressurized irrigation systems to deliver desired smaller n amounts to the crop at any stage with high efficiency and distribution uniformity a number of studies compared in season n timing applications prior to v8 maize growth stage against pre season or at planting n application jokela and randall 1989 roth et al 1995 bundy et al 1992 reeves and touchton 1986 stecker et al 1993 the primary goals of these studies were to develop best management practices to maximize grain yields and n use efficiencies under different environmental conditions among very limited research a comparison between pre plant and in season n applications on medium and fine textured soils showed that in season n applications are not likely to increase maize yields over the pre plant application in most growing seasons bundy 1986 nelson and macgregor 1973 stevenson and baldwin 1969 polito and voss 1991 reported from a 3 yr study in iowa that maize yield did not increase when splitting n applications between pre plant and in season as compared with pre plant n applications only randall et al 1997 found similar observations across three ridge tilled sites in minnesota tarkalson et al 2009 reported that there were no significant differences in maize grain yields between two n application rates that were made based on the university of nebraska lincoln s unl recommended algorithm rate minus 20 as split n applications at pre plant during planting and at v14 growth stage on a silt loam soil on the other hand there are studies that found it is advantageous to carry out split n applications crop n demand is varied among the maize growing stages and splitting the total n amount for in season applications may provide sufficient n supply at different crop growth stages that may effectively improve yields ciampitti and vyn 2011 liu et al 2014 therefore timing n with the exact required rate can be crucial to maximizing yield production vetsch and randall 2004 raun et al 2011 mahama et al 2016 this strategy may eliminate or at least reduce the duration of causing n to be susceptible to be lost by leaching denitrification ammonia volatilization and denitrification particularly during irrigation periods and or excessive precipitation events maharjan et al 2014 found that split urea application strategy increased yield and n uptake with lower nitrate leaching when compared to pre plant applied urea they reported that the direct n2o emissions were significantly lower under the split urea application the impact of split applications has also been observed to be a function of the irrigation water amount maharjan et al 2014 reported that full irrigation led to increase in no 3 leaching but did not impact n2o emissions horváth et al 2010 reported higher n losses under full irrigation treatments as well as increased direct n2o emissions when compared with deficit irrigation treatments in sandy soil in a semi arid condition extensive n fertilizer is applied in irrigated maize production globally and in the midwestern us including nebraska the total irrigated acreage in nebraska is about 3 5 million ha usda 2018 with center pivot irrigation sprinkler irrigation being the dominant irrigation method which constitutes about 85 2 9 million ha followed by surface furrow irrigation fi as 14 5 506 517 ha and subsurface drip irrigation micro irrigation at 0 85 30 000 ha during 2008 2013 the proportion of irrigated land under sprinkler and micro irrigation have increased by about 9 5 and 763 respectively while there was a 25 decline in acreage under surface irrigation usda nass 2014 this dramatic shift of irrigated acreage from surface to sprinkler and micro irrigation is directed towards enhancing water use efficiency using more efficient irrigation technology in the light of increasing water scarcity and due to allocation moratoriums in irrigation water withdrawal irrigation and n dynamics have been shown to demonstrate interactions with each other and hence should be managed in a coupled manner especially when n is applied via irrigation system in sprinkler and microirrigation including sdi systems understanding these coupled effects of irrigation and n timing are becoming increasingly important due to a increasing interest in split n application to reduce environmental pollution from n b increasing interest in deficit or limited irrigation to maximize water use efficiency under limited water supply and irrigation capacities and c the adoption of high efficiency sprinkler and micro irrigation systems however to the best knowledge of the authors research efforts that investigate these interactions their impacts on crop growth and productivity and how do these impacts vary across surface sprinkler and microirrigation systems for maize grown under the same environment and management conditions simultaneously have not been investigated the lack of experimentally derived data information and knowledge are likely due to the extreme challenges that does not make such research economically labor wise and time wise feasible this research is aimed at fulfilling these critical infrastructural and management requirements to accomplish the goal of quantifying and evaluating coupled impacts of irrigation rates and n timing management strategies on maize growth development and yield productivity and possible differences in these impacts under surface furrow irrigation or fi sprinkler center pivot irrigation or cp and micro irrigation subsurface drip irrigation or sdi methods in the same field with the same slope soil properties and environmental

area index lai was measured on a weekly to bi weekly basis from v3 3 leaf collar through r6 physiological maturity stages using the model lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa plant height was measured from v3 through r1 silking stage on a weekly to bi weekly basis plant height was measured as the distance between the soil surface near the stem to the tip of the longest leaf before tasseling and or to the tip of the tassel after tasseling stage both lai and plant height were sampled roughly in the same area in the plot interior leaf collar method leaf collar visible was used to determine the physiological growth stages ten plants from the middle of the plots two replications per treatment that represented at least 50 of the population were used to stage vegetative reproductive growth stages on a weekly to bi weekly basis throughout both growing seasons stem diameter cm was measured from 10 plants from the interior row that randomly sampled by using a vernier caliper at r3 i e kernel milk stage at the base of the stem above the soil surface growing degree days gdd was used as the base scale to represent the progression of in season maize growth and development gdd c is a quantitative indicator to denote the heat accumulation throughout the growing season which is considered as one of the significant factors that control the rate of plant development in addition to other factors such as soil water status fertilizers light daylight length etc the cumulative gdd was calculated using the most widely accepted method mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 eq 1 the air temperature data used for computation of gdd was measured at an agricultural weather data network awdn automated weather station managed by the high plains regional climate center hprcc 2 cumulative gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t base where tmax and tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and tbase is the crop specific base temperature taken as 10 c for days when the average of tmax and tmin was lower than tbase it was replaced by the tbase and hence gdd for that day was computed as 0 no upper limit for temperature e g 30 c for maize was imposed because there exists strong evidence to show that transpiration and hence assimilation processes are not hindered at such temperatures 30 c under the environmental conditions at the experimental site irmak and mutiibwa 2010 2 6 experimental design and statistical analysis while the treatments were the same between the irrigation methods each experimental field had a different experimental design layout which was a function of irrigation system design the cp field had a split split plot design with n application timing in the main plots and the irrigation application levels in the subplots with four replications for each treatment the sdi and fi fields had a randomized complete block design with three replications for each treatment to distinguish potential significant differences in lai plant height stem diameter and grain yield as a result of treatments imposed glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc 2003 cary nc usa was used for statistical analyses a fisher s protected least significant differences lsd test was conducted at the 95 confidence level to determine if there were significant differences between the treatments and identify which ones are different from each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions monthly summaries of meteorological variables at the experimental site during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons along with long term 1983 2015 30 year climatology means are presented in table 2 the 2017 growing season was wetter than 2016 growing season and most of the high precipitation events occurred during may and late september through october nevertheless both growing seasons were drier than the long term mean growing season precipitation fig 4 by 24 in 2016 and 5 in 2017 during 2017 growing season the site received about 58 mm of precipitation after planting which along with low air temperatures caused delay in maize emergence by about a week table 2 the maximum tmax minimum tmin and average tavg air temperatures were slightly warmer 0 4 1 0 and 0 7 c in the 2016 growing season than in 2017 the warmer temperatures in 2016 contributed to the increase in the accumulated growing degree days from planting to harvest from emergence to harvest cumulated gdd values were 1752 and 1589 c in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively maize was harvested at 179 days after planting dap november 01 in 2016 except fi field which was harvested 152 dap october 05 and at 178 dap november 06 in 2017 relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 were higher by 5 6 and 18 respectively in the 2016 growing season than 2017 the substantial u2 variability across the two seasons did not proportionally translate into rh variability incoming solar radiation rs during 2016 growing season was 1 6 lower than in 2017 but was similar to long term mean rs 3 2 irrigation level and method and n management impacts on plant height plant height is an important plant growth and development variable that influences numerous plant physiological and biophysical properties such as light interception aerodynamic resistance radiation absorption leaf area etc also plant height has strong correlation to lai djaman et al 2013 which can provide a practical approach for estimating this variable averaged maize plant height by n and irrigation method as well as plant height distribution as a function of cumulative gdd for different n and irrigation level treatments in the cp sdi and fi methods in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in figs 5c d 6 7 8 and table 3 overall there was a significant difference p 0 05 in plant height in the fi between the given irrigation level within the growing season for example plant height values were significantly higher at fit 80 fit 60 fit irrigation levels in 2016 than for the respective treatments in 2017 growing seasons also in terms of method differences including all treatments the plant height values were significantly p 0 05 higher in order of fi cp sdi in 2016 growing season and they were significantly p 0 05 higher in order of cp sdi fi in 2017 growing in comparison of the combination of non traditional nt methods of nt 1 and nt 2 vs tn with respect to irrigation method i e cp and sdi differences by holding levels of irrigation nitrogen and year constant showed that there were significantly higher p 0 05 plant height values in cp method than in sdi 60 fit nt cp sdi 60 fit tn cp sdi 80 fit nt and cp sdi fit tn in 2016 growing season and in cp sdi 60 fit nt cp sdi 80 fit nt and cp sdi fit tn in 2017 growing season the plant height was significantly lower in the rft than 60 fit 80 fit and fit tn irrigation level in the fi method in 2016 season and in the rft than 80 fit and fit irrigation levels in 2017 growing season on the other hand there was no significant difference p 0 05 between rft and other irrigation levels in the sdi in both years the rft plant height was significantly lower than those in the fit tn in both years table 3 plant height was influenced by irrigation treatments across all irrigation methods more in 2016 than in 2017 as expected the lower and higher plant heights were observed at rft and fit respectively across the n treatments irrigation methods and years however in most cases plant height had similar magnitudes between the irrigation treatments of 60 fit 80 fit and fit across the irrigation methods n treatments and years the lowest plant height of 2 3 fi rft 2 4 sdi rft and 2 5 m cp rft was observed in the 2016 growing season and 2 2 fi rft 2 4 sdi rft and 2 4 m cp rft was observed in 2017 this result was similar to the findings of chilundo et al 2016 that similarly findings was reported by o robles et al 2017 that differences in maize height were observed between the two growing seasons of 2015 1 96 m and 2016 2 15 m seasons and the irrigation treatment had significantly affect maize height in 2016 under low pressure solid set sprinkler irrigation system in contrast in the work of chilundo et al 2016 reported that irrigation methods of furrow and drip irrigation methods had not influenced maize height and irrigation 75 of the crop water requirement level yielded higher plant than 100 level researchers e g birch et al 2002 bennouna et al 2004 reported that maize when exposed to water stress during vegetative and tasseling stages reduce plant height soler et al 2007 reported that maize under rainfed conditions had 5 reduction in height as compared with maize under irrigated conditions 2 17 m the measured maximum maize height of 2 7 cp fit tn 2 5 sdi fit tn 2 6 fi fit tn 2 8 cp fit nt 1 2 6 sdi fit nt 1 2 7 cp fit nt 2 and 2 6 m sdi fit nt 2 was observed in 2016 growing season and 2 6 cp fit tn 2 4 sdi fit tn 2 4 fi fit tn 2 7 cp fit nt 1 2 6 sdi fit nt 12 7 cp fit nt 2 and 2 6 m sdi fit nt 2 in 2017 growing season across years and treatments plant height reached peaked measures around 104 dap august 17 and 95 dap august 14 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 3 3 irrigation level and method and n management impacts on leaf area index the seasonal 2016 2017 patterns of lai as a function of cumulative growing degree days cgdd for all n and irrigation treatments for cp sdi and fi methods are presented in figs 9 10 and 11 respectively the impact of n timing and irrigation levels across three irrigation methods were studied using two lai features a mean lai during the growing season and b peak lai during the growing season no significant difference was detected for the seasonal mean lai between 2016 and 2017 for cp and sdi methods but fi had significantly higher p 0 0001 lai in 2017 than in 2016 however within each growing season lai showed significant differences among the irrigation methods table 3 in 2016 lai was significantly p 0 05 higher in sdi by 5 8 than cp and by 9 6 than fi while there were no significant differences p 0 0681 between cp and fi but cp had 3 8 higher magnitudes than fi in 2017 lai in fi was significantly p 0 0031 higher by 6 1 than cp but there were no significant differences p 0 5734 between fi and sdi moreover sdi was significantly p 0 0107 higher by 5 1 than cp mean lai was found to be significantly different among irrigation methods but only for specific irrigation levels for example in the 60 fit lai was significantly p 0 0051 higher in fi than cp and in cp than sdi p 0 0036 and also in sdi than fi p 0 044 and cp than sdi p 0 0321 for the 80 fit and higher in sdi than fi for fit mean lai was significantly different between cp and sdi methods when averaged over n timing year and irrigation levels moreover mean lai showed significant differences p 0 05 between the rf and all irrigation levels across all the irrigation methods generally there was no significant difference p 0 05 between mean and peak lai any of the irrigation except rft and nitrogen treatments in both years at both seasonally averaged lai and peaked lai table 3 the peak lai of 5 0 5 7 and 4 2 m2 m 2 occurred at 77 95 and 61 dap july 21 august 8 and july 5 in 2016 while peak lai of 5 6 6 0 and 5 4 m2 m 2 occurred at 81 81 and 61 dap july 31 july 31 and july 11 in 2017 in the cp sdi and fi respectively the peak lai of 6 4 6 3 and 5 6 m2 m 2 were observed in fit tn fit nt 1 and 60 fit tn for cp sdi and fi during 2016 respectively during 2017 the peak lai of 6 5 6 1 and 5 8 was observed in 60 fit nt 1 fit nt 1 and 60 fit tn for cp sdi and fi respectively the mean lai was not impacted by any limited irrigation treatment because the initial soil water content was similarly sufficient between the treatments and there was no water stress impact on plant growth and development and thus lai was similar in most of the treatments the differences in soil water availability in various treatments and thus lai only began to appear later in the season as a function of irrigation treatment but differences were not large enough to be statistically significant or affect foliage growth the lowest mean lai was found in rft across all irrigation methods during both growing seasons also rft reached its peak lai earlier than other treatments since the imposition of water stress causes a tendency for plants to senesce mature early the peak lai values varied among irrigation methods and growing seasons as well as in their time of occurrence in 2017 as well as 2016 growing season the mean of peak lai in tn treatment across all irrigation levels was similar between cp 5 9 and sdi 5 8 but was 7 3 higher than the average of irrigation treatments in fi 5 5 the mean of peak lai of nt 1 and nt 2 across all irrigation levels was 7 higher in cp 6 2 than sdi 5 8 13 higher in cp 6 2 than fi and 5 5 higher in sdi than fi there were no substantial differences between peak and mean lai in nt 1 and nt 2 across the irrigation treatments within a given irrigation method and between cp and sdi in 2016 the mean of peak lai across the irrigation all treatments fit 80 fit and 60 fit for the tn treatment was identical for cp 6 2 and sdi 6 2 which were 24 greater than that in fi 5 0 the irrigation method had a substantial influence on lai and this could be attributed to the differences in irrigation efficiency achieved in these irrigation methods irrigation efficiency of sdi cp fi higher irrigation efficiency may allow greater quantity of water retention in the soil profile root zone per unit of water pumped in sdi and cp methods than in fi moreover the potential for nutrient leaching can be highest in fi method followed by cp and sdi however we observe from our findings that lai was not impacted by tn or nt application of nitrogen in and across cp and sdi methods the mean lai values in nt 1 and nt 2 across all irrigation levels were similar to that of tn treatment within sdi and cp as well as across them this means crop obtained adequate n from the root zone in either n application treatment i e tn and nt 1 and nt 2 there were no substantial differences in lai across the n and irrigation treatments in sdi as mentioned previously the two n treatments only differed in application timing and not amount this implies that while nt nitrogen application at least theoretically is intended to improve n uptake we did not observe this in our experiments at least when lai differences are considered this might be due to lower opportunity for n leaching or loss at the site or during the growing seasons moreover the n amounts that were applied were conservatively sufficient based on unl recommendations and carefully measured site specific nitrogen credentials and nitrogen requirements this strategy when combined with well distributed wetting events potentially ensured maximum plant n uptake and rendered minimal opportunity for n loss eventually making tn or nt nitrogen management strategies more or less equivalent although the imposed irrigation and n timing treatments did not have a consistent impact on lai this does not imply that the growth and development was not affected and other parameters of growth and productivity have to be evaluated the peak lai among irrigation methods clearly varied consistently especially in fi method overall the observations of maize lai measured in this research are in accordance with lai measured previously under various irrigation methods irmak and djaman 2016a 2016b and irrigation levels djaman et al 2013 in the same site barideh et al 2018 reported that the highest maize lai rate was observed under conventional irrigation method as compared to alternate partial root zone irrigation and fixed partial root zone irrigation khalili et al 2020 also reported that the maize lai was decreased at 50 irrigation level significantly p 0 05 compared to 100 irrigation level on maize under alternate furrow irrigation system 3 4 treatment impacts on physiological development and stem diameter the two growing seasons had similar time i e dap on reaching the three maize stages i e v8 vt and r3 that was planned to receive the in season n applications across irrigation methods i e cp and sdi and treatments maize reached v8 vt and r3 growth stages around 48 73 and 89 dap june 22 july 17 and august 2 respectively in 2016 growing season and it reached v8 vt and r3 stages around 43 74 and 92 dap june 23 july 24 and august 11 respectively in 2017 n treatments i e pre plant n application and in season n applications irrigation treatments and methods did not affect maize growth and development in terms of time required reaching the aforementioned stages the results from the averaged lai of irrigation treatments including rft conditions for a given year and n treatment demonstrated that there was a difference in lai magnitude n treatments i e higher lai in nt 1 and nt 2 over tn at cp and sdi methods figs 9b d 10b and d however the differences were larger between the irrigation treatments for the given n treatment figs 9a c 10a c 11a and c moreover the initiation of the changing in lai magnitudes varied depending on the irrigation level coupled with given nitrogen treatment irrigation method and year figs 9 10 and 11 in the past three decades researchers have used stem diameter changes in plant water assessment and plant response to different environmental variables and management stem diameter was shown to be related to the plant water status klepper et al 1971 molz and klepper 1972 jarvis 1975 in this research stem diameter was measured to evaluate the agronomic traits larger plant stem diameter usually indicates more reserves and energy accumulation thus more and a better grain filling also it tends to provide a support structure for the ears the largest stem diameter of 2 39 fit nt 1 2 43 60 fit nt 1 and 2 25 fit tn cm was observed at cp sdi and fi methods in 2016 growing season respectively and 2 83 60 fit nt 2 2 79 80 fit tn and 2 46 80 fit tn cm at cp sdi and fi methods in 2017 respectively table 3 there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the treatments within cp and fi except few pairwise combinations that had a significant difference in sdi in the 2016 growing season table 3 however there were some pairwise differences between the treatments at cp and sdi in 2017 growing season a possible explanation for this might be that the plants were not impacted by the water deficit in 2016 as it was more pronounced in 2017 growing season also the inconsistency observed between the fields and years may be due to the soil spatial variability and as a result variations in soil water distribution and re distribution from irrigation and or rainfall there was not a significant p 0 05 three way interaction between all the variables when comparing tn treatment across all methods however the two way interactions irrigation method by year interaction and the year by irrigation treatment interaction were both significant p 0 05 all irrigation methods showed significantly higher values in 2017 growing season than 2016 growing season for a given irrigation method in comparison of irrigation methods there was only one significant difference in 2017 growing season for example the averaged stem diameter across tn treatments and irrigation levels in the sdi was significantly higher than cp and fi also plants in cp field had significantly higher stem diameter than those in fi field considering all three n timing application strategies across cp and sdi the four way and three way interactions were not significant when comparing the years by irrigation method for the same n treatments stem diameters were significantly higher in 2017 than in 2016 kang et al 2000 found that maize stem diameter showed no significant differences among three irrigation methods of alternate furrow irrigation fixed furrow irrigation and conventional furrow irrigation and three levels of irrigation amounts in maize production in an arid area environment rasool et al 2020 in experiments to study the behavior of deficit drip irrigation system under three four irrigation levels of 100 90 75 and 60 of etc respectively and furrow irrigation system they reported that maize stem diameter had slight differences among 100 90 and 75 of etc under surface drip irrigation system whereas observed a notable decrease in 60 etc and furrow irrigation system 3 5 relationship between maize lai and plant height field measurements of plant lai can be difficult and more complex task than measuring plant height which is a very simple process thus experimentally established relationships between plant height and lai can be used as a more practical approach to estimate lai and as an index to quantify plant growth rate the relationships between the two variables developed in this research can provide opportunity to estimate lai from plant height under different irrigation levels and n management strategies under different irrigation methods which has not been done previously however the limitation of this approach raises up at the point when lai starts to decrease while plant height remains relatively constant after it reaches its maxima strong linear relationships were observed between lai and plant height in all irrigation and n treatments and all irrigation methods and years figs 12 13 and 14 the slopes across n and irrigation treatments for a given irrigation method increased from rft to fit and ranged from 2 05 to 2 21 for cp from 2 16 to 2 27 for sdi and from 1 82 to 1 94 for fi another significant aspect is that the slopes for the pooled data were similar between tn and nt nitrogen treatments in cp and sdi methods fig 12k and l for tn and 17k and l for nt this suggests that there was no considerable n treatment impact on the lai vs plant height relationship thereby on the magnitude of the slope value the slopes were higher in cp and sdi than fi this could be due to greater lai values corresponding with the plant height values in the beginning of the 2017 growing season than in 2016 and this inconstancy in fi likely to be related mainly to the lower irrigation efficiency data not shown in fi as compared with the cp and sdi this means that the soil moisture in the plant root zone in fi is susceptible to a greater distribution variability in fi than in cp and sdi and this potentially led to increased plant growth variation in plant height vs lai relationship soil moisture distribution variability is normalized or less with cp and sdi methods especially in the fit than in fi the main reason for this is that plants uptake soil water more uniformly in fit irrigation level in the cp and sdi than fi in accordance with the present results previous studies by other researchers pieri and fuchs 1990 sadek et al 2006 djaman et al 2013 also demonstrated linear and strong relationships between plant height and lai for cotton and maize however no research quantified these relationships for maize for different irrigation and nitrogen management under three different irrigation methods under the same management and environmental conditions 3 6 irrigation and nitrogen treatments and irrigation methods impacts on maize grain yield maize grain yields across all the treatments ranged from 9 6 to 16 6 mg ha 1 cp 9 1 16 4 mg ha 1 sdi and 9 8 15 2 mg ha 1 fi in 2016 and from 9 3 to 17 0 mg ha 1 cp 10 9 16 1 mg ha 1 sdi and 7 9 14 0 mg ha 1 fi in 2017 table 3 for all treatments the grain yield exhibited an upward trend with increasing applied irrigation amount the highest grain yields were measured in the fit irrigation level across all n treatments i e tn nt 1 and nt 2 in all three irrigation methods in both years table 3 however the highest grain yield of 17 0 mg ha 1 was observed in cp in 2017 grain yields were notably altered by irrigation levels for the tn nitrogen and nt nitrogen treatments for the given irrigation method and general trend was increasing in grain yield with an increase in irrigation amount table 3 the generally average grain yield across all treatments including both cp and sdi were marginally 1 6 higher in 2017 than in 2016 and grain yields between the two growing seasons were not significant p 0 05 for the same treatments as a result of the same maize variety same agronomic practices and similar weather parameters i e solar radiation and gdd although the total amount of irrigation and rainfall was higher in 2017 the uneven rainfall distribution in 2016 led to an insignificant impact on grain yield production one of the reasons of higher yield in 2017 is that cooler tmax during the reproductive stage coupled with relatively cooler tmin for the growing season and higher vpd data not shown high air temperatures 30 c during the reproductive stage may limit photosynthesis process and adversely affect grain filling and hot nights may also reduce grain production by increasing respiration process using sugar as energy rather than kernel production and that is why maize prefers cooler nights with ambient temperatures of around 15 5 c however fi showed significantly higher p 0 05 yields in 2016 than that in 2017 table 3 which primarily associated with the soil at that specific site this might suggest that the most combination and concentration of mineral nutrients were adequately available in the soil in the 2016 growing season and relatively consumed or even leached mobile nutrients in 2017 because of the higher amount of seasonal total irrigation amount applied in most cases the coefficient of variance cv values of the grain yields calculated by the ratio of the standard deviation of the grain yield to the mean of the grain yield were relatively small indicating small variations between the replications of a given treatment table 3 the cv values of grain yield for the three irrigation methods treatments and two years were below 20 except the rft treatment in the sdi in 2016 indicating low yield variability between the replications there were relatively high cv values in the fi method field in 2017 in addition to the rft treatment in sdi in 2016 the three type tests of fixed effects showed that the irrigation treatments p 0 0006 and the irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0024 were significant on grain yield production average grain yield across the irrigation levels i e fit 80 fit and 60 fit for the tn treatment at the given irrigation method within a year showed significant differences between fi and cp and it was 8 1 and 25 5 higher in cp in 2016 and 2017 respectively also between fi and sdi which had 8 1 and 23 higher yield in sdi in 2016 and 2017 respectively this could be due to fi having higher irrigation depths applied and lower irrigation efficiency because of the difficulties on ensuring uniform distribution of water with the fi method as compared with cp and sdi methods as well as less water storage in the plant root zone and higher water losses through deep percolation and surface run off data not shown in the fi method as compared with sdi and cp methods moreover the irrigation efficiency for the fi method is approximately 45 65 as compared with 75 85 for the cp and 95 for the sdi methods therefore this higher water losses in the fi method may cause increased n leaching from the plant root zone which can negatively affect maize n uptake and grain yield there was no significant difference p 0 05 within a year between sdi and cp methods in any of the growing season when grouping the irrigation levels across the irrigation methods and years there were significant yield differences between 60 fit and 80 fit and 60 fit and fit irrigation treatments there was no significant difference between the 80 fit and fit treatments in comparison between three n levels tn nt 1 and nt 2 in the sdi and cp irrigation methods and fit 80 fit and 60 fit irrigation levels for both years the statistical tests of fixed effects showed that three irrigation treatment was significant p 0 0001 on grain yield production while the irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0551 was not significant moreover significant differences were found between years within irrigation method in cp p 0 0121 higher yield in 2017 and between cp and sdi p 0 0012 higher yield in cp in 2017 these findings indicate that maize grain yields under cp with combined n treatments can be optimized the irrigation methodology and n timing applications strategies interactions on maize grain yields more effectively than in sdi in 2017 however the grouped n treatments need further investigation to unravel the actual n treatment impact on yield as explained in the next paragraph furthermore there were significant differences between all levels of the irrigation treatment between 60 fit and 80 fit p 0 0001 higher yield in 80 fit and between 60 fit and fit p 0 0001 higher yield in the fit as well as between 80 fit and fit p 0 0101 higher yield in the fit grouping nt 1 and nt 2 vs tn treatment across the irrigation levels and years in cp and sdi methods it was found that the irrigation treatment p 0 0001 and irrigation method x nitrogen interactions were significant p 0 0453 while irrigation method x year interaction p 0 0581 was not significant the nt 1 and nt 2 nitrogen treatments had significantly higher grain yields than tn treatment at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi moreover nt 1 and nt 2 nitrogen treatments in cp method had significantly higher grain yields than in sdi finally there were significant differences between all three irrigation levels and higher yields in the 80 fit than 60 fit and in the fit than 80 fit irrigation levels these results indicate that the lower yield in the tn treatment in both sdi and cp as compared with grouped nt n treatments was a result of the possibility of n loss via leaching when it applied as a one time application at pre plant therefore the n was not available adequately as compared with split n application methods which maintained n readily available for crops throughout the growing season and plants had more opportunity to access n as needed on the other hand there was no significant difference between nt 1 and nt 2 therefore nt 1 can be considered as a preferred management practice which could maximize the economic return by saving the fourth time side dress n application at r3 growth stage the tn 1 yielded 4 3 higher in the cp than that in sdi method and the tn 2 was similar between sdi and cp the individual seasonal statistical analysis for cp sdi and fi method is presented in table 3 in fi maize grain yields ranged from 9 8 to 15 2 mg ha 1 and from 7 9 m to 14 0 mg ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the highest grain yields of 15 2 and 14 0 mg ha 1 were observed in the 2016 and 2017 growing season respectively table 3 the three type tests of fixed effects showed that both irrigation treatment and year were significant on grain yield production with p values of 0 0001 and 0 00175 respectively the fi method did not have any significant difference p 0 05 among the three irrigation levels of 60 fit 80 fit and fit in both years however rft was significantly lower p 0 05 than 60 fit 80 fit and fit levels in both growing seasons as explained previously table 3 pooled grain yields data showed that the comparisons in the 60 fit irrigation level were significantly different between the two years and higher in 2016 than 2017 also it was marginally significantly p 0 0495 different between 60 fit and fit irrigation levels higher grain yield with fit the statistical analysis with more data points may increase values in the upper and lower limit as a result the yield response was clearly shown in the pooled data in the 60 fit however there was no significant difference between 80 fit and fit because the pooled yield results were similar and as a result the 80 fit irrigation level can be recommended as an effective management practice in water limiting areas in sdi method maize grain yields ranged from 9 1 to 16 0 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 0 16 8 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 0 16 8 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2016 yield ranged from 10 9 to 16 1 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 15 9 16 5 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 4 16 7 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2017 superior grain yields were obtained for nt treatments of nt 1 and nt 2 at the three irrigation levels as compared with tn treatment and the year effect was not significant p 0 5964 on grain yield production thus the statistical analysis was tested the pooled data between the irrigation treatments within each of the different nitrogen treatments which indicated that the crop responded to treatments similarly the simple effect comparisons did not show any significant differences between the n treatments within each irrigation level on the other hand there were significant differences between the irrigation levels within each of the different nitrogen treatments therefore nt treatments showed a significant difference between 60 fit and fit levels at tn 1 and between rft and 60 fit 80 fit and fit levels the results confirm that the nt 1 is an effective practice to maximize yield production under the sdi method with 60 fit and 80 fit irrigation levels in cp method maize grain yields ranged from 9 6 to 16 6 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 4 17 3 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 2 17 3 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2016 yield ranged from 9 3 to 17 0 mg ha 1 in tn treatment 16 5 17 8 mg ha 1 in tn 1 and 16 6 17 6 mg ha 1 in nt 2 in 2017 the nt 1 and nt 2 treatments at three irrigation levels were performed superiorly as compared with tn treatment similar to the sdi method the year effect was not significant p 0 1733 hence the statistical analysis was tested the pooled data and showed that there were some significant differences between the n treatments within some of the irrigation levels for example at three irrigation levels of 60 fit 80 fit and fit there were significant differences in nt 1 vs tn and nt 2 vs tn treatment with higher yields in both nt treatments also there were more significant differences between the irrigation levels within each n treatments as compared with the sdi method whereas the irrigation levels within each of the different nitrogen treatments showed significant differences for example in the nt 1 there was only one significant difference between 60 fit and fit while in the nt 2 there were significant differences between 60 fit and 80 fit and between 60 fit and fit when comparing the grain yield in the fit irrigation level with the results of djaman et al 2013 at the same research site and irrigation method the grain yields were higher in this current research by 12 than the measured value of 15 5 mg ha 1 in the nt 1 and nt 2 in 2016 and 13 5 15 than the measured value of 15 5 mg ha 1 t at nt 1 and nt 2 in 2017 respectively similarly our results were higher 23 5 cp nt 1 to 13 cp nt 2 in 2016 and 27 cp nt 1 to 26 cp nt 2 in 2017 respectively than a result of a research conducted by irmak et al 2019 at the same location under linear move sprinkler irrigation system these results cast a new light on both nt 1 and nt 2 n management that they perform better than tn especially nt 2 had greater yield than nt 1 the tn showed that the statistical differences were found between rft and 60 fit 80 fit and fit irrigation levels with rft treatment having lower yields at fit and also between 60 fit and fit irrigation level with 60 fit having lower yields than fit these results indicate that the cp method maximized n availability when it applied via the system fertigation because the system tends to apply n uniformly over the entire field and that may lead to maximize n availability in the soil especially topsoil profile 3 7 spatial grain yield and frequency distribution while the treatment mean grain yields depict plot aggregated crop response to irrigation amount and n fertilizer timing it is worthwhile to decipher the spatial distribution of yield response across the fields the high resolution yield monitoring capabilities of the harvester allowed for analytically quantifying the distribution characteristics and mapping grain yield in each field the yield monitor data was interpolated using inverse distance weighing technique in arcmap 10 7 esri redlands ca grain yield maps clearly demonstrate the spatial variability that was encountered upon harvest because of treatment imposition in 2016 and 2017 figs 15a and 16a moreover the maps also allow for a fair comparison of how each field performed across the two growing seasons and bring out the year to year variability variation in the frequency distribution of maize grain yield was considerably affected by the methodology of the given irrigation system and the combination of the weather variables for the given season both maps 2016 and 2017 had some areas of yield variation that were not management driven but rather other error sources such as reduced yields from center pivot tracks and irregular harvester maneuvers around permanently installed instrumentation in the field these erroneous data points were removed before analyzing the frequency distribution of grain yields in each field the frequency distribution of grain yields achieved in each field in 2016 and 2017 are shown in figs 15b and 16b the frequency distribution figs 15b and 16b analyzed and classified 39617 12632 and 1924 grid cells for the cp sdi and fi fields respectively into grain yield bins of 2 mg ha 1 ranging from 0 to 18 mg ha 1 comparing cp and sdi fields across figs 15a and 16a it can be deduced that grain yields were higher in 2017 than 2016 due to conducive weather conditions explained earlier in section 3 6 although this difference was statistically insignificant when averaged across the fields on a finer spatial scale it was found that substantially greater proportion of the cp and sdi fields showed greater yields in 2017 than the remainder of both the fields on the other hand fi showed greater yields in 2016 than 2017 across majority of the acreage of the field which was attributed to soil characteristics and nutrient availability see section 3 6 this year to year difference is also easily detectable from the rainfed treatments e g 4 sectors in cp field corresponding to 0 t which are darker brown in 2016 than 2017 also evident is the importance of using broader outer spans for detecting treatment effects in cp due to the suboptimal irrigation application precision in narrower inner spans the contrast of crop response to water availability at upstream and downstream ends of the fi field is also visible in both years the frequency distributions figs 15b and 16b convey the grain yield distribution as affected by various irrigation methods among the three irrigation methods cp and sdi had narrower distributions than fi which is evident from the mean absolute deviation mad of the data points in figs 15b and 16b mad was the lowest implying narrowest distribution for cp 1 44 mg ha 1 followed by sdi 1 83 mg ha 1 and fi 2 42 mg ha 1 in 2016 whereas it was lowest for sdi 1 21 mg ha 1 closely followed by cp 1 23 mg ha 1 and fi 3 51 mg ha 1 in 2017 the highest frequency of occurrence proportion of field falling under a given yield bin was found for the 14 16 mg ha 1 range for both cp and sdi whereas for fi 12 14 mg ha 1 range had the highest frequency very closely followed by 14 16 mg ha 1 since all fields had the same proportion of their respective acreages under various treatments it is interesting to note the contrast among the yield distribution in fi vs cp and sdi figs 15b and 16b against largely symmetric and unimodal distributions observed for cp and sdi fi had presents a more uniform and rather bimodal distribution in 2017 this is attributable to the lower irrigation efficiency higher deep percolation and runoff and increased n leaching in fi cp in 2016 and sdi in 2017 had the highest area proportion 55 under the peak grain yield bin 14 16 mg ha 1 whereas fi only had 30 and 21 of area under its peak grain yield bin of 12 14 mg ha 1 while roughly the same area was under the 14 16 mg ha 1 this underscores the importance of irrigation efficiency differences among the three irrigation methods which is highest for sdi followed by cp and fi the sub plot level high resolution yield analysis corroborates earlier observation of decrease in the spread of yield distribution lowering of mad with an increase in irrigation efficiency 4 summary and conclusions the effect of coupled impacts of irrigation rates and n timing management strategies on maize growth development and yield productivity under different irrigation methods were investigated by field experiments in in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climates near clay center nebraska usa results reveal that in all cases lai showed higher values in the nt 1 and nt 2 n treatments over tn treatment across the two irrigation methods of cp and sdi in both growing seasons irrigation method had a substantial influence on lai seasonal trends and it was higher at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi than in fi method across the irrigation levels n treatments and both growing seasons the peak lai values varied between the irrigation methods and years as well as in terms of the time they occurred there was a statistical difference between the nt nitrogen treatments and tn treatment at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi utilizing seasonally averaged lai approach was better than the peaked lai approach on reflecting more realistic crop growth development determinations the cp method had a statistically higher plant height than sdi and fi and sdi method had higher plant height than fi stem diameter was not influenced by the irrigation method and n treatment but was influenced by irrigation level in the cp and sdi in 2017 grain yields were notably altered by irrigation level for the tn and nt nitrogen treatments for the given irrigation method across all treatments and years yields were statistically higher at both irrigation methods of cp and sdi similar between cp and sdi than fi in general results suggest that both cp and sdi performed superiorly than fi in terms of maize grain yield production across all irrigation levels fit 80 fit and 60 fit and n application timing treatments the nt 1 in the 80 fit showed the best grain yield production among the combination of irrigation level and n application timing treatments this research has provided deeper quantitative insight in terms of better understanding the irrigation levels and n management vs crop growth and development variables and grain yield under three different irrigation methods these research findings can aid in developing best management strategies in terms of

9658,groundwater extraction through electrically operated tubewells offers a resilient source of irrigation supply in arid regions especially during droughts however interrupted and low voltage electric supply with limited availability and frequent trips increases repair and maintenance costs of tubewell irrigation and reduces tubewell discharge resulting in less efficient and non uniform water application this study evaluates performance of an indigenous system of groundwater irrigation that was evolved over the generations in arid region of gujarat india to address electricity triggered issues of irrigated agriculture in this system groundwater extracted during electricity availability hours is stored in surface reservoirs for later supplying to irrigate crops under gravity flow irrespective of electricity availability a comprehensive survey of the indigenous system is conducted in a village of gujarat to make inventory of all tubewells and storage reservoirs about their depth size pump type and horsepower command area crops irrigation timing and frequency etc discharge of tubewells was measured and their locations were recorded results revealed that the indigenous system is advantageous over the direct tubewell irrigation in terms of 37 4 higher water delivery rate and 50 more average irrigation capacity these findings prove adequacy of the indigenous system in regulating irrigation supplies to deal with electricity induced intricacies of irrigated agriculture amount of water lost through unit area of earthen seepage and evaporation 2 77 m and masonry evaporation 1 22 m reservoirs collectively accounts for a negligible proportion 0 9 of groundwater draft furthermore a methodology is devised to precisely estimate village level groundwater draft for irrigation which is validated by 0 9 deviation between observed and predicted values of groundwater draft moreover the indigenous system is simple cost effective and easy to implement in other parts of the world especially in arid regions of the developing countries where low voltage and intermitted electricity supply persists keywords groundwater irrigation groundwater draft estimation storage reservoir irrigation capacity indigenous system arid region 1 introduction groundwater is the more reliable and resilient source of irrigation water supply than surface water especially during times of drought famiglietti et al 2011 in the year 2010 approximately 800 km3 of groundwater was extracted throughout the world mainly for supplying irrigation and 67 of this amount is consumed in order of use in india the united states of america usa china iran and pakistan burek et al 2016 assured electricity plays an important role in enabling groundwater irrigation and thus leading to increased agricultural production and productivity ray 2020 groundwater irrigation draft defined as amount of groundwater extracted for irrigation purpose is a vital component of water balance modeling and is difficult to be estimated precisely both in spatial and temporal domains in literature diverse methods have been evolved or adopted for estimation of groundwater irrigation draft at a regional scale e g ravikumar et al 2005 harou and lund 2008 bhuiyan et al 2009 surinaidu et al 2012 bhadra et al 2016a b ravikumar et al 2005 used the long term groundwater trends and irrigated area for estimating groundwater draft in the upper palar basin of tamil nadu india harou and lund 2008 used a hydro economic optimization model to study the economic effects and water management actions that accompany ending overdraft in a case study of the tulare basin in california usa a geographic information system based water table fluctuation method has been attempted for quantitative modeling of groundwater recharge in the hard rock aravalli terrain of rajasthan india bhuiyan et al 2009 surinaidu et al 2012 developed a regional groundwater flow model for the upper bhima basin of india for estimating groundwater draft and evaluating impacts on groundwater resources for the coming decades bhadra et al 2016a developed a linear groundwater draft model based on the empirical relationship between satellite derived crop acreage and the observed groundwater draft for an arid region of north west india later on bhadra et al 2016b estimated irrigation draft in a semi arid region of rajasthan india to explore impact of water harvesting structures on groundwater recharge keir et al 2018 discussed application of generalized linear models for estimating groundwater extraction rates in the surat cumulative management area of eastern australia the generalized linear modeling is found suitable for estimating groundwater extraction and analyzing uncertainty with the support of measured properties of the random samples for model verification recently tomer et al 2021 used groundwater levels monitored at a fine resolution to provide useful estimates of the urban groundwater budget in bengaluru india it is revealed that well inventory and empirical constants are often used for estimating groundwater draft rao and ramasastri 2012 in arid and semi arid regions accurate assessment of groundwater irrigation draft is further challenging due to large quantities of groundwater withdrawals made for meeting the huge crop water demands bhadra et al 2016a in india the central ground water board cgwb is an apex body involved in monitoring of groundwater draft who has recommended the guidelines provided by the ground water resources estimation committee gec 2015 cgwb 2017 the gec 2015 committee suggested use of well census data method cropping pattern method or power consumption method for estimating groundwater irrigation draft in the country cgwb 2017 however all the suggested methods have certain limitations for example well census method considers an average value of well discharge and operating hours over a large area of an assessment unit such as a block or district of the state machiwal and jha 2015 likewise cropping pattern and power consumption methods are unable to provide exact values of the groundwater draft due to large variations in tubewell discharge pump power and cropping patterns over an area furthermore gec 2015 guidelines are formulated based on a simplistic lumped parameter approach where a few inflow and outflow components of water balance model including groundwater draft are ignored as values of these components are not easily available with the government agencies nevertheless it is emphasized in the literature to attempt micro level or village level assessment of those components to generate reliable database chatterjee and purohit 2009 the accurate estimation of groundwater draft for irrigation at village level requires the fine scale field visits surveys and instantaneous discharge measurements from irrigation wells ray et al 2017 it is revealed from the above discussion that there is a need to develop a methodology for village level estimation of crop specific groundwater draft for irrigation india the world s largest groundwater consumer obtains 60 of the country s irrigation supply from groundwater with average annual withdrawals of 230 km3 chinnasamy et al 2015 dalin et al 2017 jain et al 2021 agriculture consumes almost 90 of the country s groundwater world bank 2020 owing to easily accessible electric power that is either free or available at subsidized rates for groundwater extraction gujarat situated in the western part of the country is among the most rapidly growing indian states in industrial and economic terms nevertheless 57 of total population of the state is rural and more than 45 are engaged in agriculture enterprise shah et al 2008 despite the fact that the state had a vast scope for surface water irrigation the state s agriculture was always at the mercy of rains and groundwater irrigation a remarkable growth of groundwater extraction devices 56 and 585 increase of diesel pumps and electric pumps respectively during 1971 2001 led to curtailment of three phase electric supply in agriculture from 18 to 20 h day 1 in 1980s to 10 12 h day 1 by 2000 shah et al 2008 in addition the three phase electricity of deteriorated quality and less duration often supplied during nights with low voltage and frequent trips damaged pump motors and increased tubewells repair and maintenance costs to evade the poor and inadequate power supply farmers started using phase splitting capacitors to convert single phase and two phase power into three phase to run their pumps it further reduced the voltage downstream while tubewells continued to operate unrestricted for 18 20 h day 1 shah et al 2008 moreover it led to less water flow rates and non uniform application of water in the fields that decreased field water application efficiency mitigating electricity failures for improving reliability of electric power supply is difficult to implement and requires huge investment in gujarat state on the other hand regional farmers have evolved over the generations a unique indigenous strategy to deal with the electricity induced problems of tubewell irrigated agriculture in this indigenous system groundwater is daily extracted for average 8 h period of electricity availability and stored in surface reservoirs later on the stored water is supplied to irrigate crops during daytime under gravity flow regardless of presence absence of electricity supply it is observed that performance of the indigenous irrigation system developed to tackle the problem of intermittent and disrupted power supply in gujarat state of india has never been evaluated in any study until now in addition there is no scientific approach involved in planning and design of the indigenous irrigation system and therefore there is a need to prove the efficacy of the system over the direct tubewell irrigation the present study has been undertaken with two objectives i to devise a methodology for precisely estimating crop specific groundwater draft for irrigation use at village level and ii to comparatively evaluate efficacy of the indigenous irrigation system groundwater stored in surface reservoir and direct tubewell irrigation sanyra village of kachchh district in gujarat was selected for the present study and details of all the irrigation tubewells and indigenous irrigation systems of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs were acquired and tubewells discharge was measured then irrigation capacities of tubewell irrigation and reservoir irrigation were computed and compared crop specific groundwater draft was estimated for every indigenous systems separately considering maximum storage capacity number of outlets and time taken in emptying the reservoir similarly well inventory data such as tubewell discharge number of operating days and hours of the tubewell were used for computing groundwater draft for direct tubewell irrigation furthermore impact of crop acreage on groundwater draft from tubewells was quantified by developing and validating regression models separately for masonry and earthen reservoirs finally reservoir losses were estimated by considering water balance modeling findings of this study are useful for micro level or village level planning and management of the groundwater resources and their best utilization in irrigated agriculture in water stressed dry regions of the country as well as in other parts of the world especially areas experiencing frequent electricity failures and cuts 2 description of study area 2 1 location and climate sanyra village of nakhatrana block located in southwest portion of kachchh district gujarat india is selected for this study the study area encompasses 1211 17 ha lands location map is shown in fig 1 land use land cover map of the study area is depicted in fig 2 the 34 year 1980 2013 mean annual rainfall is 381 mm machiwal et al 2015 rainfall is mainly received during rainy season june through september and remaining months usually remain dry the land elevation varies from 142 to 349 m above the mean sea level msl with an average of 175 6 m msl the mean maximum temperature ranges from 26 7 c january to 39 5 c may and the mean minimum temperature varies from 9 c january to 27 c june cgwb 2013 2 2 soil and land use soil of the study area is mostly sandy in texture and its depth varies from 30 cm to 1 m soil organic carbon soc is usually low c dap 2015 which is the main cause for less water holding capacity of the soils hence frequency and amount of irrigation remain relatively high in comparison to that in other parts of the region of the total geographical area 1211 17 ha about 672 5 ha 55 5 land is under cultivation forest and gauchar lands occupy 250 7 ha 20 7 and 62 1 ha 5 1 lands respectively gauchar lands are the commonly accessible area that is kept for open animal grazing a small drain carrying wastewater crosses the area from west to east in southern part and land area near the drain is categorized as non cultivable land fig 2 residential land or settlement is extended over an area of 15 ha 5 9 2 3 cropping patterns and growing seasons entire year can be divided into three distinct periods depending upon the crop growing seasons i kharif june september ii rabi october february and iii summer march may in kharif season mainly groundnut cotton castor green gram pigeon pea and maize are grown in the area while in rabi season wheat mustard cumin coriander and psyllium husk isabgol are grown the prominent cropping system of the area is castor cotton groundnut in summer season mostly groundnut and fodder crops lucern and pearl millet are grown two intercropping systems of castor with groundnut and pigeon pea with green gram are also found in the area pomegranate mango and date palm are the major orchard crops grown in the area flood irrigations are provided to almost all the crops except drip irrigated orchard crops long dry spells are common even in rainy season and thus crops need to be irrigated during rainy season also 2 4 surface water and groundwater resources in the study area rainwater harvesting for subsequent utilization is not practiced due to scanty rainfall amount and less rainy days thus surface water resources are meager and agricultural and domestic water requirements for humans as well as livestock are completely met from groundwater resources groundwater for drinking purpose is extracted through two government tubewells that are maintained by gram panchayat a gram panchayat represents the village level government body of elected members and is responsible for all administrative decisions taken for welfare of local people groundwater levels depict a wide variation in the study area ranging from 18 3 m below land surface in southeast portion to 115 8 m below land surface in southwest and western portions fig 1 depth of tubewells vary from 68 6 to 182 9 m average 134 9 m below ground level submersible pumps of 15 60 hp are used for groundwater pumping although a diesel operated turbine pump extracts the shallow groundwater in the area 3 indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs a unique system of extracting groundwater and storing it in surface reservoirs for subsequent utilization to provide irrigation under gravity flow is prevailing for the past more than 50 years over a major part of gujarat india in this system subsurface water lifted through electric operated tubewells is stored as surface water which is then fed to crops surface storage reservoirs are made of earthen masonry with brick and stone and reinforced cement concrete rcc there exists no well defined criterion for deciding reservoir size including length width depth and number of outlets although local beneficiaries choose reservoir dimensions depending upon pump capacity tubewell depth well discharge and irrigated area based on their traditional knowledge acquired over the generations four types of groundwater storage cum application mechanisms are prevalent in the area fig 3 which are i groundwater drafted through a pump is directly applied for irrigating crops ii groundwater extracted through a pump is stored in a surface reservoir iii groundwater pumped through more than one pump is stored in a surface reservoir and iv groundwater lifted through multiple pumps is stored in more than one surface reservoir that remain interconnected this type of indigenous system is evolved over the years by local beneficiaries themselves and is considered advantageous over direct tubewell irrigation in tackling multifold problems associated with irregular and restricted supply of electric power three phase electric power is made available for running groundwater extraction pumps on alternate day and night with frequent sudden cuts without prior intimation to farmers for carrying out maintenance works to rectify technical faults in electricity distribution system tubewell irrigation during night times covers significantly less areas in comparison to that covered by irrigation from surface reservoirs executed during day times in border check basin and furrow methods of irrigation daytime irrigation manages irrigation water efficiently with relatively less water losses due to absence of over irrigation in tubewell irrigation interruption in water supply due to sudden cutoff of electricity reduces coverage of irrigated area because certain amount of water is lost in advancing waterfront up to previously approached point this reduces the water application efficiency considerably especially when irrigating 100 150 m long border strips in contrast continuous irrigation supplies from surface reservoirs improves application efficiency under border groundnut lucern etc furrow castor cotton pigeon pea etc and check basin orchard crops methods which still prevail in arid areas relatively less soc and the poor water holding capacity of soil in more than 80 area of arid gujarat kumar and machiwal 2018 requires a continuous supply of irrigation water to ensure uniform water application which is difficult under tubewell irrigation due to uncertain availability of electric power however surface reservoirs having potential of constant irrigation supply save large quantum of water and time in general irrigation water from the surface reservoir is supplied when the reservoir is filled to its storage capacity however some reservoirs take more than one day in being completely filled due to its large storage capacity hence irrigation is provided simultaneously when the reservoir is filled from tubewell water and approaches its maximum storage capacity as farmers desire to use single minute of available limited electric supply it is further seen that discharge of wells in this arid region has been reducing substantially over the years due to fast depleting groundwater levels the groundwater level has reached up to 120 m depth from surface at many places thus irrigating sandy soil with low discharge tubewells consumes more water and time as compared to that irrigated by controlled discharge through surface reservoirs moreover tubewell irrigation in areas where groundwater levels are deeper more than 150 m depth supplies poor quality water of yellowish color with presence of salts ferrous bicarbonate water soluble iron and other impurities on the other hand such groundwater is exposed to oxygen when stored in surface reservoirs and the soluble iron converts into insoluble iron ferric state that deposits at bottom and sides of the reservoirs making the irrigation supplies free from iron kumar and machiwal 2018 the advantages and disadvantages of above four mechanisms of groundwater storage cum application for irrigation are summarized in table 1 4 materials and methods 4 1 field survey and data collection a detailed survey of the study area was carried out in the years 2015 16 and 2016 17 to understand the system of surface storage of groundwater for irrigation adopted by the beneficiaries and to acquire the information about existing groundwater utilization pattern in 2015 16 for crop production the procedure of survey involved direct measurements field observations holding focused group discussions fgds and interaction meetings with resource persons i e head of the village called as sarpanch and farmers of the village cadastral map of the area collected from the revenue department nakhatrana gujarat was geo referenced in geographic information system gis using arcgis with the help of google earth image boundary of the study area was delineated correctly recording location coordinates i e longitude and latitude of the known locations using global positioning system gps near the boundary and further confirmed by the farmers furthermore all the existing production wells 44 in numbers were located in gis platform using their location coordinates land use land cover lulc pattern of the area was drawn on hardcopy of google earth image february 2016 according to the knowledge of local farmers which was later verified using the gps data for selected locations under each lulc class during field visits discharge of all 44 tubewells was measured precisely through volumetric method where the average time taken in thrice fillings of a container of known volume from well water was recorded in addition a complete well inventory was obtained through fgds to gather information about initial depth of tubewell depth of pump from land surface current groundwater depth pump horsepower and extent of well casing and well screens moreover information about crops grown i e crop type and acreage duration of irrigation for different crops time taken in emptying a reservoir irrigation interval for different crops and crop durations were acquired through fgds also irrigation method adopted in command area of different tubewells was seen during field visits and area irrigated in a day and daily irrigation timings were also noted during the interactions with farmers 4 2 determining irrigation capacity of storage reservoirs and irrigation tubewells irrigation capacity is defined as the crop area that can be irrigated by the available reservoir water supplies per unit of time during a single irrigation under gravity flow the concept of irrigation capacity for groundwater irrigation directly from tubewell is discussed by bhadra et al 2016a in this study the average water discharge from the storage reservoir under gravity flow conditions is calculated from the following equation 1 q ri v t t e n o where q ri is the average water discharge for irrigation supply from the ith storage reservoir m3 h 1 v t is the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir m3 t e is the time required in emptying the reservoir under gravity flow h and n o is available number of outlets from the reservoir value of v t was computed from the reservoir dimensions i e length width and depth in case of rectangular shaped reservoir and diameter and depth in case of circular reservoirs which were measured during the field investigations and value of t e was collected for all the storage reservoirs during the fgds then the crop wise irrigation capacity of every storage reservoir was calculated using the expression given below 2 i r i j a c i j p i i j t r i j where i r i j is the irrigation capacity of the ith storage reservoir for jth crop m2 h 1 a c i j is the area of jth crop irrigated through ith reservoir m2 p i i j is irrigation period days of jth crop under the command of ith reservoir and t r i j is the operational time of the ith storage reservoir h day 1 for jth crop the information of command area irrigation period and operational time for different crops irrigated through individual storage reservoirs in the year 2015 16 was collected during field survey fgds and interactions with individual farmers similarly crop wise irrigation capacity i wj in m2 h 1 of the individual 44 tubewells used for irrigation is estimated using the following expression 3 i wj i 1 n j 1 m i r i j q wt q ri where q wt m3 h 1 is the discharge of irrigation tubewell m is number of crops under a storage reservoir and n is number of the storage reservoirs in a tubewell command 4 3 estimating groundwater draft for irrigation 4 3 1 based on storage reservoir data the average depth of water d i j applied to the jth crop in each irrigation is computed based on the irrigation capacity of the ith reservoir for that crop i r i j and average discharge of the reservoir q ri as shown below 4 d i j q ri i r i j water from tubewells to storage reservoirs is transported through underground pipelines in the study area also the storage reservoirs are located within the irrigated fields and irrigation water is directly applied to the fields hence negligible conveyance losses occur in water transmission from tubewell to reservoir furthermore using the information of crop period p c i j in days and irrigation interval i i i j number of irrigations i n i j applied to jth crop under ith storage reservoir are computed as follows 5 i n i j p c i j i i i j total volume of irrigation water v i i j in m3 required for jth crop irrigated through ith reservoir is computed from the following equation 6 v i i j d i j i n i j a c i j 4 3 2 based on well inventory the well inventory data is used to calculate the groundwater draft of 44 individual tubewells used for providing irrigation using the following expression 7 v wt q wt d t h w where v wt is seasonal annual groundwater draft of the tubewell m3 q wt is discharge of the irrigation tubewell m3 h 1 d t is duration of tubewell operation days during a season or year and h w is daily pump operational hours h day 1 tubewell pumps mostly run for average 8 h daily depending on availability of electric supply in the area many farmers use an automated on off electrical switch for operating the tubewell pumps 4 4 quantifying impact of crop acreage on groundwater draft from tubewells 4 4 1 developing regression model in order to see the impact of total crop acreage on the amount of groundwater draft in a year scatter plot is plotted between the total irrigated area and total volume of irrigation water supplied through every storage reservoir in a year the separate scatter plots are plotted for masonry and earthen storage reservoirs the annual total crop acreage is computed by adding areas under different crops grown in a season s under command of a tubewell storage reservoir similarly annual gross groundwater draft is computed by summing up irrigation water amounts applied to different crops over a season s within command area of a tubewell reservoir in a year relationship between the total annual crop acreage and total annual groundwater draft in the area is explored by fitting a second order polynomial regression model to the observed plot for two different kinds of reservoirs the fitted polynomial regression model explains the relationship between the gross irrigated area under storage reservoirs and the total irrigation water applied over three seasons namely kharif rabi and summer the distinct storage reservoirs have a variable amount of irrigation water application due to variations in crop acreages their types and periods the equation of the best fit polynomial regression model is represented as 8 v it v c 1 a it 2 v c 2 a it v m where v it is total annual groundwater draft of a tubewell used for applying irrigation m3 a it is total annual cropped area irrigated over all three seasons through a tubewell m2 v c1 and v c2 are the coefficients of the best fit trend line and v m is the coefficient that indicates the minimum amount of irrigation water required for incorporating evaporation seepage and other management losses from the storage reservoirs m3 magnitude of the water losses from storage reservoir reveals how efficiently groundwater stored in surface water reservoirs is utilized for irrigation 4 4 2 validation of developed model accuracy of the polynomial regression model developed to express relationship between crop acreage and amount of irrigation water is validated by computing correlation coefficient furthermore the amount of irrigation water is re estimated using the developed polynomial regression model by using values of the total irrigated area for the year 2015 16 additional losses from storage reservoirs are incorporated with the measured groundwater irrigation drafts for obtaining the amount of total irrigation water supplied from the tubewells the developed model is further validated by comparing observed and estimated irrigation water amounts by employing four statistical goodness of fit criteria such as coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean error me and relative error re these statistical criteria have been used for validation of mathematical models in hydrological studies e g coppala et al 2005 huo et al 2010 bhadra et al 2016a and their detailed mathematical expressions are available in the literature 4 5 evaluating water losses from storage reservoirs surface reservoirs are effective means of compensating with lower discharge rates and other problems of tubewell irrigation and maintaining a continuous supply of irrigation water however groundwater stored in surface reservoirs is subjected to evaporation and seepage losses depending upon the type of reservoir construction in cement masonry reservoirs seepage loss will not occur and water will be lost only through evaporation whereas both seepage and evaporation losses will occur from earthen reservoirs surface area of storage reservoirs is considerably less than irrigated area and hence the stored water is usually applied to irrigate the fields after the reservoir is filled up to its full storage capacity thus the storage reservoirs are considered to have the water during entire crop duration over two to three seasons and therefore evaporation and seepage losses occur the average depth of water lost through seepage and or evaporation in a year l w m from the storages reservoirs during the entire crop periods is estimated from the following equation 9 l w v w v i a t where a t is the surface area of water storage reservoir m2 which is the average of top and bottom areas in case of trapezoidal shaped reservoir 5 results and discussion 5 1 discharge statistics of tubewells and surface reservoirs during field survey in 2015 16 it was observed that depth of groundwater levels varied from 18 3 to 115 8 m with an average of 83 1 m below ground level in the study area the groundwater depths are found increasing from east to west direction in the area fig 1 most of the high discharge production wells yielding good quality irrigation water are located in the western part of area where forest and gauchar lands are present figs 1 and 2 however agricultural land is mainly situated in the eastern part of the area with less density of wells availability of the poor quality groundwater in the eastern part is the main reason that agricultural lands are irrigated from groundwater extracted from lands outside the agricultural lands where groundwater levels are relatively deeper a large part of the forest lands comes under the common property rights and therefore local farmers are permitted to have lands on lease for a fixed duration to extract groundwater for irrigation purpose thus large quantities of groundwater are extracted from the western side open forest and gauchar lands for filling the storage reservoirs for irrigating the fields subsequently box whisker plots of tubewell depth and discharge pump depth and horsepower hp and groundwater depth are plotted and the same are shown in fig 4 tubewell discharge of 44 wells varies from 8 5 to 72 m3 h 1 with an average value of 44 8 m3 h 1 it is apparent from fig 4 that the pump is installed at a median depth of 94 5 m in a tubewell having median depth of 134 9 m where the groundwater level is situated at median depth of 84 4 m below the ground level 5 2 discharge power relationship results of regression analysis indicating relationship between tubewell discharge and pump hp through a second order polynomial curve accuracy of the fitted curve is adjudged by the goodness of fit criterion i e correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 whose values r 0 90 and r2 0 81 suggest a very strong correlation between well discharge and pump hp correlation based performance criteria are reported to have a biasness and hence the accuracy of second order polynomial function is further evaluated using error based criteria i e root mean square error rmse value of rmse for comparing measured and polynomial function predicted well discharge is computed as 1 6 m3 h 1 which confirms the prediction capability of the model it is seen that pumps of 30 35 and 40 hp are frequently used for lifting groundwater in the area variation in tubewell discharge for 30 35 and 40 hp pumps is examined by coefficient of variation cv whose values for well discharge from 30 35 and 40 hp pumps are obtained as 19 39 and 20 respectively thus it is revealed that variation in well discharge from 35 hp pumps is almost double to that from 30 and 40 hp pumps the average well discharge from 30 35 and 40 hp pumps is computed as 43 6 36 5 and 47 8 m3 h 1 respectively spatial distribution of pump hp and corresponding well discharge data is presented in fig 5 it is seen that pump hp is relatively less in the eastern part where land elevations are low and groundwater levels are shallow well discharge is also less for the less hp pumps lifting shallow groundwater levels in comparison to that of the high hp pumps extracting deeper groundwater in high elevation areas towards western part this result clearly indicate that the deeper aquifer underlying the western hilly terrain is largely exploited for supplying good quality irrigation water than the poor quality water available in shallow aquifer on the eastern portion of the area the extracted groundwater resources are managed by storing in more masonry more than half of total reservoirs than earthen reservoirs storage capacity of the reservoirs varies from 63 to 2402 m3 average 761 8 m3 and rate of the water delivery ranges from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 with an average of 65 9 m3 h 1 the rate of water delivery from reservoirs is markedly higher than discharge of tubewells fig 6 in 40 of total 44 cases only four tubewells fitted with high capacity pumps have discharge higher than water delivery rate of storage reservoirs for an efficiently designed surface reservoir water delivery rate should be more than tubewell discharge it is revealed that either size or dimensions of reservoir or number of outlets is not adequate in four number of cases as the reservoir is designed based on only indigenous knowledge gained by the local beneficiaries and lacks scientific knowledge hence indigenous traditional knowledge needs to be amalgamated with scientific and technical knowledge for planning and optimal design of the surface reservoirs depending upon the tubewell discharge irrigated area type of crops and cropping pattern among others overall the water delivery rate of the reservoirs is 37 4 higher than the tubewell discharge this finding proves the efficacy of the indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs to regulate the discharge and supplying irrigation water through gravity in sandy loam soils of arid regions 5 3 comparing irrigation capacities of reservoirs and tubewells surface reservoirs supply stored groundwater for irrigation directly to agricultural fields and thus water application rate in fields remain the similar to water delivery rate of reservoirs bar charts of crop wise irrigation capacities of tubewells and reservoirs are drawn for comparison and the same are depicted in fig 7 it is revealed that irrigation capacity of reservoirs ranging from 421 7 to 5398 1 m2 h 1 is higher than that of tubewells ranging from 294 7 to 4318 5 m2 h 1 for all the crops under flood irrigation since tubewell discharge varying from 17 0 to 71 2 m3 h 1 is less than water delivery rate of reservoirs varying from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 and storage reservoirs provide continuous supply of irrigation water on an average it is estimated that surface reservoirs requires 3 4 h lesser time than tubewells in irrigating 1 ha land for a given irrigation depth this indicates a 46 saving in time when a field is irrigated through reservoirs in place of tubewells it is further estimated that the average irrigation capacity of reservoirs is 50 higher than that of tubewells with 37 4 increased delivery rate than well discharge this finding verifies that the indigenous system of storing subsurface water in surface reservoirs for irrigation is effective in saving time involved in irrigating fields under the present conditions of low discharge of tubewells in sandy loam soil of arid region furthermore the average irrigation capacity of reservoirs is found minimum 421 7 m2 h 1 for maize and maximum 2313 5 m2 h 1 for pigeon pea fig 7 considering all crops the overall average irrigation capacity of surface reservoirs is estimated at 1370 1 m2 h 1 whereas the average irrigation capacity of tubewells is estimated at 915 0 m2 h 1 it is seen that irrigation capacity of the reservoirs remain more or less similar for a few crops such as i cotton and castor 1253 1 and 1234 1 m2 h 1 ii corriander psyllium husk and fodder 1535 1 1518 2 and 1532 1 m2 h 1 iii kharif and summer groundnut 1132 01 and 1156 7 m2 h 1 however overall variation in irrigation capacity based on reservoir is higher cv 35 in comparison to tubewell cv 28 which indicates knowledge and awareness among farmers for applying different quantities of water to different crops according to their water requirements and soil conditions as irrigation method remains the same for most of the crops in addition different field management practices including type of irrigation method flood irrigation methods such as border furrow and check basin and micro irrigation method such as drip length width and slope range of border strip covered in single irrigation and other minor manual practices adopted for handling the irrigation water may also be responsible at some extent for variation in irrigation capacity it is further observed from fig 7 that differences between irrigation capacities of reservoirs and tubewells are big for pigeon pea 1151 7 m2 h 1 cumin 1007 7 m2 h 1 green gram 855 3 m2 h 1 and coriander 700 8 m2 h 1 which are mainly due to low discharge of tubewells 32 22 71 20 m3 h 1 and high water delivery rate of reservoirs 53 70 93 45 m3 h 1 besides it is experienced that handling continuous supply of irrigation water from storage reservoir is much easier than managing interrupted supply of groundwater from tubewells under electricity cuts slower rate of water flow in case of direct tubewell irrigation may also cause water losses through deep percolation 5 4 irrigation for different crops irrigation methods and seasons the existing practice for irrigating most of the field crops in the study area is flood irrigation with water supplied from surface reservoirs however drip irrigated castor and cotton crops watered from reservoir supplies through another small size pump installed in the reservoir were also seen at some places during field survey in addition all orchard crops including pomegranate mango date palm and a vegetable crop tomato are also seen drip irrigated total quantities of irrigation water applied to different crops were estimated using crop statistics and irrigation information acquired during field visits and estimation process is explained in table 2 it is seen that amount of reservoir supplied water volumes to irrigate different crops increases mainly due to increasing irrigated areas single irrigation depths applied to different crops by flood and drip methods are shown in fig 8 it is learnt that single irrigation depth in orchard crops depends on the age of orchard which is found as the minimum of 0 31 cm for 2 month old orchard of date palm the average irrigation depth for pomegranate 0 5 1 year old and mango 2 year old is 0 72 cm and 1 16 cm respectively the average irrigation depth for flood irrigated field crops varied from 4 0 cm for pigeon pea to 6 4 cm for wheat it is seen from fig 8 that depth of water applied in a single irrigation is relatively less ranging from 4 0 to 4 7 in case of pigeon pea cumin green gram and coriander which may likely be a factor for increased irrigation capacity of the reservoirs as is discussed in the previous section the irrigation water in pigeon pea crop is applied through furrow irrigation method where about half of the area between two consecutive furrows is kept dry which resulted in less irrigation depth total annual irrigation depth varied from 36 9 cm for cumin to 226 7 cm for fodder crops in the study area a cumulative average of annual irrigation depth is estimated at 128 9 cm for all crops grown over 350 7 ha during 2015 16 it is seen from table 2 that the computed values of annual irrigation depths are quite high for almost all the crops in the area which is likely due to hot arid climate sandy loam soil having low water holding capacity and high evaporation and percolation losses application of large number of irrigations was apparently seen during field visits and the same was further confirmed during fgds with farmers on an average it was revealed that a total of 27 33 19 and 17 no of irrigations is applied to flood irrigated castor cotton maize and wheat respectively and 120 180 and 300 no of irrigations to drip irrigated castor tomato and date palm respectively water depth in drip irrigated cotton 90 9 cm is found 44 less than that in furrow irrigated cotton 163 1 cm in case of castor 111 7 cm of water applied through drip irrigation saved 7 4 of water applied through flood irrigation 120 6 cm likewise furrow irrigated castor with average irrigation depth of 140 14 cm is 26 more effective in saving water than furrow irrigated cotton having 177 02 cm irrigation depth it is primarily caused due to more running length of furrows per unit area for cotton in comparison to castor as spacing of furrows is more in case of castor kharif groundnut requiring 90 8 cm of irrigation water is found 37 4 water effective than summer groundnut consuming 124 8 cm of water due to less irrigation frequency and water depth in case of the former growing season of kharif groundnut coincides with rainy season in the area and hence part of plant water needs is fulfilled from the rainwater it is experienced that 473 6 mm of rainfall was received during rainy season of 2015 whereas only 5 4 mm of rainfall occurred during summer season in the area 5 5 groundwater draft estimated by empirical polynomial regression model a wide variation is found in amount of site specific irrigation water supplied from different reservoirs and duty of surface reservoirs varies from 2 6 to 26 3 ha cumec 1 the maximum reservoir duty is achieved under a complex system of five tubewells that are connected to two surface reservoirs it is observed that amount of irrigation application increases with increase in the gross irrigated area gia it is considered the proportionate application of irrigation water for the corresponding gia covered during kharif rabi and summer seasons respectively an empirical second order polynomial model expressing relationship between gia and irrigated water volumes is established using data of 21 masonry and 19 earthen storage reservoirs for 2015 16 through regression analysis and the same is shown in fig 9a and b the value of minimum water lost is found as 4646 6 and 20 137 4 m3 through masonry and earthen storage reservoirs respectively in the area irrespective of gia these results indicate that combined component of water lost through seepage and evaporation in earthen storage reservoirs is more than four times higher than losses through evaporation in masonry reservoirs 5 6 accuracy of model predicted groundwater draft the developed empirical model is used to predict groundwater draft extracted for supplying irrigation water at 40 sites bar charts depicting a comparison between the estimated and model predicted values of groundwater draft at 40 sites is shown in fig 10 overall a difference of 38 547 m3 of water exists in estimated 4 222 855 m3 and model predicted 4 184 308 m3 values of groundwater draft at all sites this indicates a total deviation of 0 9 between estimated and predicted values of groundwater draft which is reasonably fair and this verifies the adequacy of the developed model values of rmse 28 473 7 m3 me 963 7 m3 and re 5 1 further validates the model capability in predicting groundwater draft satisfactorily estimates of the average water depth in a unit irrigated area for 40 sites vary from 39 2 to 231 3 cm ha 1 with an average depth of 134 4 cm ha 1 it is also observed that about 60 of farmers in the area utilize the irrigation water with less than the average depth 5 7 amount of water lost from reservoirs value of annual gross groundwater draft from tubewell irrigation is estimated at 4 560 972 6 m3 for a total area of 350 7 ha and the average annual unit draft is calculated as 13 005 3 m3 ha 1 on the other hand amount of irrigation water applied over the same area through surface reservoirs considering all crops is estimated at 4 520 788 1 m3 annually thus a difference of 40 184 5 m3 of water between amount of groundwater draft and amount of applied irrigation water indicates annual loss of water through seepage and evaporation from the cumulative surface area of 18 420 8 m2 for all 46 surface reservoirs constructed in the study area the amount of water lost annually through the reservoirs accounts for only 0 9 of the total irrigation water supplied from the reservoirs which is not substantial it is further attempted to estimate water losses separately from earthen and masonry reservoirs and estimation of annual water losses for earthen and masonry reservoirs is illustrated in table 3 the results suggest that water lost annually from earthen reservoirs due to seepage and evaporation consist of 2 77 m yr 1 per unit of reservoir area whereas it is only 1 22 m yr 1 per unit of reservoir area in case of masonry reservoirs owing to only evaporation the overall depth of water lost through all reservoirs is computed as 2 18 m yr 1 irrespective of earthen or masonry construction in general amount of water lost through seepage remains higher than that lost through evaporation the total storage capacity of earthen and masonry storage reservoirs is measured as 17 432 11 and 17 220 71 m3 respectively thus the water lost per unit of storage capacity is also higher in case of earthen reservoirs however as a whole a major portion of reservoir water is lost through combined effect of seepage and evaporation from earthen storage reservoirs in the study area as masonry reservoirs are having no seepage loss but excessive evaporation due to arid climate it is felt that there is a need to check evaporation loss from the reservoirs by adopting suitable measures such as different types of cost effective covers made of locally available materials especially from the agricultural wastes it is revealed from the above discussion that the indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs and apply irrigation through gravity flow regulates water delivery rate and saves time involved in irrigation application as per the need of crops and soil conditions of a particular field therefore loss of minor water quantities may be acceptable looking at the amplitude of advantages that are obtained by storing groundwater in surface reservoirs for providing irrigation through gravity flow 6 conclusions this study evaluates efficacy of an indigenous system evolved over the generations by regional farmers of gujarat india to deal with problems of mismanagement of groundwater irrigation through electric operated tubewells under interrupted electric power supply furthermore a methodology is suggested to precisely estimate micro level or village level groundwater draft for irrigated agriculture through a crop specific model it is observed that depth of the submersible electrical pumps installed in tubewells for groundwater extraction for irrigation varied from 30 5 to 121 9 m average 93 6 m from the ground level in the study area whereas tubewell depth ranged from 45 7 to 198 1 m from the ground level with tubewell discharge varying between 4 5 and 72 m3 h 1 average 41 5 m3 h 1 the best fitted relationship between tubewell discharge and pump horsepower hp is represented by a second order polynomial model with reasonable values of correlation coefficient 0 90 coefficient of determination 0 80 and root mean square error rmse 1 6 m3 h 1 it is further observed that the good quality groundwater from a deeper aquifer existing in the western portion is more exploited for irrigation purpose using high hp pumps yielding better discharge than the shallow aquifer situated in the eastern portion it is found that earthen masonry and reinforced cement concrete reservoirs with 63 2402 m3 average 761 8 m3 of storage capacity exist in the area that deliver water at a rate ranging from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 average 65 9 m3 h 1 the mean rate of water delivery for irrigation supplies from reservoir stored groundwater is revealed to be 37 4 higher than that from direct tubewell irrigation which justifies the efficacy of the indigenous system of storing groundwater into surface reservoirs to regulate the discharge appropriately before supplying it through gravity flow for irrigation having no dependency on electric power availability storage reservoirs with 50 more average irrigation capacity than direct tubewell irrigation saves 3 4 h 46 time in irrigating 1 ha land for a given irrigation depth which further validates potency of the storage reservoirs over the tubewell irrigation in the area the average irrigation depth under flood irrigation computed for reservoir irrigation is found to be minimum 4 04 cm for pigeon pea and maximum 6 41 cm for wheat about 2 10 m depth of water is always lost in flood irrigated 1 ha land and then 1 02 m of irrigation depth is needed for every unit increase of irrigated area which emphasizes the need of adopting micro irrigation methods such as sprinkler and drip methods in arid climate of the study area the developed second order polynomial regression model for groundwater draft and crop acreage is adequately validated from 0 9 deviation between observed and model predicted values of groundwater draft whose capability is further verified from satisfactory values of rmse as 28 473 7 m3 mean error as 963 7 m3 and relative error as 5 1 overall water balance modeling of reservoirs indicated that 0 9 of the total groundwater draft is lost through the storage reservoirs in the form of evaporation and seepage also the water lost through earthen seepage and evaporation losses and masonry evaporation loss only reservoirs is estimated separately as 2 77 and 1 22 m per unit of reservoir area it is apparently seen that the water losses from the storage reservoirs are not remarkable and hence the indigenous system may be efficiently used for managing groundwater based irrigation supplies in the arid region of gujarat under interrupted electrical power supply hence the indigenous system is simple cost effective and easy to implement over other solutions of managing and regulating electric supply it is suggested that the second order polynomial regression model developed to estimate groundwater draft from storage reservoirs masonry and earthen can be used as a tool for efficiently managing groundwater resources not only in the study area but also in other arid regions of the world where the groundwater extraction rate is much higher than the recharge rate moreover the indigenous system discussed in this study may be effectively used in other drylands of the world under the conditions of interrupted

9658,groundwater extraction through electrically operated tubewells offers a resilient source of irrigation supply in arid regions especially during droughts however interrupted and low voltage electric supply with limited availability and frequent trips increases repair and maintenance costs of tubewell irrigation and reduces tubewell discharge resulting in less efficient and non uniform water application this study evaluates performance of an indigenous system of groundwater irrigation that was evolved over the generations in arid region of gujarat india to address electricity triggered issues of irrigated agriculture in this system groundwater extracted during electricity availability hours is stored in surface reservoirs for later supplying to irrigate crops under gravity flow irrespective of electricity availability a comprehensive survey of the indigenous system is conducted in a village of gujarat to make inventory of all tubewells and storage reservoirs about their depth size pump type and horsepower command area crops irrigation timing and frequency etc discharge of tubewells was measured and their locations were recorded results revealed that the indigenous system is advantageous over the direct tubewell irrigation in terms of 37 4 higher water delivery rate and 50 more average irrigation capacity these findings prove adequacy of the indigenous system in regulating irrigation supplies to deal with electricity induced intricacies of irrigated agriculture amount of water lost through unit area of earthen seepage and evaporation 2 77 m and masonry evaporation 1 22 m reservoirs collectively accounts for a negligible proportion 0 9 of groundwater draft furthermore a methodology is devised to precisely estimate village level groundwater draft for irrigation which is validated by 0 9 deviation between observed and predicted values of groundwater draft moreover the indigenous system is simple cost effective and easy to implement in other parts

difficult to be estimated precisely both in spatial and temporal domains in literature diverse methods have been evolved or adopted for estimation of groundwater irrigation draft at a regional scale e g ravikumar et al 2005 harou and lund 2008 bhuiyan et al 2009 surinaidu et al 2012 bhadra et al 2016a b ravikumar et al 2005 used the long term groundwater trends and irrigated area for estimating groundwater draft in the upper palar basin of tamil nadu india harou and lund 2008 used a hydro economic optimization model to study the economic effects and water management actions that accompany ending overdraft in a case study of the tulare basin in california usa a geographic information system based water table fluctuation method has been attempted for quantitative modeling of groundwater recharge in the hard rock aravalli terrain of rajasthan india bhuiyan et al 2009 surinaidu et al 2012 developed a regional groundwater flow model for the upper bhima basin of india for estimating groundwater draft and evaluating impacts on groundwater resources for the coming decades bhadra et al 2016a developed a linear groundwater draft model based on the empirical relationship between satellite derived crop acreage and the observed groundwater draft for an arid region of north west india later on bhadra et al 2016b estimated irrigation draft in a semi arid region of rajasthan india to explore impact of water harvesting structures on groundwater recharge keir et al 2018 discussed application of generalized linear models for estimating groundwater extraction rates in the surat cumulative management area of eastern australia the generalized linear modeling is found suitable for estimating groundwater extraction and analyzing uncertainty with the support of measured properties of the random samples for model verification recently tomer et al 2021 used groundwater levels monitored at a fine resolution to provide useful estimates of the urban groundwater budget in bengaluru india it is revealed that well inventory and empirical constants are often used for estimating groundwater draft rao and ramasastri 2012 in arid and semi arid regions accurate assessment of groundwater irrigation draft is further challenging due to large quantities of groundwater withdrawals made for meeting the huge crop water demands bhadra et al 2016a in india the central ground water board cgwb is an apex body involved in monitoring of groundwater draft who has recommended the guidelines provided by the ground water resources estimation committee gec 2015 cgwb 2017 the gec 2015 committee suggested use of well census data method cropping pattern method or power consumption method for estimating groundwater irrigation draft in the country cgwb 2017 however all the suggested methods have certain limitations for example well census method considers an average value of well discharge and operating hours over a large area of an assessment unit such as a block or district of the state machiwal and jha 2015 likewise cropping pattern and power consumption methods are unable to provide exact values of the groundwater draft due to large variations in tubewell discharge pump power and cropping patterns over an area furthermore gec 2015 guidelines are formulated based on a simplistic lumped parameter approach where a few inflow and outflow components of water balance model including groundwater draft are ignored as values of these components are not easily available with the government agencies nevertheless it is emphasized in the literature to attempt micro level or village level assessment of those components to generate reliable database chatterjee and purohit 2009 the accurate estimation of groundwater draft for irrigation at village level requires the fine scale field visits surveys and instantaneous discharge measurements from irrigation wells ray et al 2017 it is revealed from the above discussion that there is a need to develop a methodology for village level estimation of crop specific groundwater draft for irrigation india the world s largest groundwater consumer obtains 60 of the country s irrigation supply from groundwater with average annual withdrawals of 230 km3 chinnasamy et al 2015 dalin et al 2017 jain et al 2021 agriculture consumes almost 90 of the country s groundwater world bank 2020 owing to easily accessible electric power that is either free or available at subsidized rates for groundwater extraction gujarat situated in the western part of the country is among the most rapidly growing indian states in industrial and economic terms nevertheless 57 of total population of the state is rural and more than 45 are engaged in agriculture enterprise shah et al 2008 despite the fact that the state had a vast scope for surface water irrigation the state s agriculture was always at the mercy of rains and groundwater irrigation a remarkable growth of groundwater extraction devices 56 and 585 increase of diesel pumps and electric pumps respectively during 1971 2001 led to curtailment of three phase electric supply in agriculture from 18 to 20 h day 1 in 1980s to 10 12 h day 1 by 2000 shah et al 2008 in addition the three phase electricity of deteriorated quality and less duration often supplied during nights with low voltage and frequent trips damaged pump motors and increased tubewells repair and maintenance costs to evade the poor and inadequate power supply farmers started using phase splitting capacitors to convert single phase and two phase power into three phase to run their pumps it further reduced the voltage downstream while tubewells continued to operate unrestricted for 18 20 h day 1 shah et al 2008 moreover it led to less water flow rates and non uniform application of water in the fields that decreased field water application efficiency mitigating electricity failures for improving reliability of electric power supply is difficult to implement and requires huge investment in gujarat state on the other hand regional farmers have evolved over the generations a unique indigenous strategy to deal with the electricity induced problems of tubewell irrigated agriculture in this indigenous system groundwater is daily extracted for average 8 h period of electricity availability and stored in surface reservoirs later on the stored water is supplied to irrigate crops during daytime under gravity flow regardless of presence absence of electricity supply it is observed that performance of the indigenous irrigation system developed to tackle the problem of intermittent and disrupted power supply in gujarat state of india has never been evaluated in any study until now in addition there is no scientific approach involved in planning and design of the indigenous irrigation system and therefore there is a need to prove the efficacy of the system over the direct tubewell irrigation the present study has been undertaken with two objectives i to devise a methodology for precisely estimating crop specific groundwater draft for irrigation use at village level and ii to comparatively evaluate efficacy of the indigenous irrigation system groundwater stored in surface reservoir and direct tubewell irrigation sanyra village of kachchh district in gujarat was selected for the present study and details of all the irrigation tubewells and indigenous irrigation systems of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs were acquired and tubewells discharge was measured then irrigation capacities of tubewell irrigation and reservoir irrigation were computed and compared crop specific groundwater draft was estimated for every indigenous systems separately considering maximum storage capacity number of outlets and time taken in emptying the reservoir similarly well inventory data such as tubewell discharge number of operating days and hours of the tubewell were used for computing groundwater draft for direct tubewell irrigation furthermore impact of crop acreage on groundwater draft from tubewells was quantified by developing and validating regression models separately for masonry and earthen reservoirs finally reservoir losses were estimated by considering water balance modeling findings of this study are useful for micro level or village level planning and management of the groundwater resources and their best utilization in irrigated agriculture in water stressed dry regions of the country as well as in other parts of the world especially areas experiencing frequent electricity failures and cuts 2 description of study area 2 1 location and climate sanyra village of nakhatrana block located in southwest portion of kachchh district gujarat india is selected for this study the study area encompasses 1211 17 ha lands location map is shown in fig 1 land use land cover map of the study area is depicted in fig 2 the 34 year 1980 2013 mean annual rainfall is 381 mm machiwal et al 2015 rainfall is mainly received during rainy season june through september and remaining months usually remain dry the land elevation varies from 142 to 349 m above the mean sea level msl with an average of 175 6 m msl the mean maximum temperature ranges from 26 7 c january to 39 5 c may and the mean minimum temperature varies from 9 c january to 27 c june cgwb 2013 2 2 soil and land use soil of the study area is mostly sandy in texture and its depth varies from 30 cm to 1 m soil organic carbon soc is usually low c dap 2015 which is the main cause for less water holding capacity of the soils hence frequency and amount of irrigation remain relatively high in comparison to that in other parts of the region of the total geographical area 1211 17 ha about 672 5 ha 55 5 land is under cultivation forest and gauchar lands occupy 250 7 ha 20 7 and 62 1 ha 5 1 lands respectively gauchar lands are the commonly accessible area that is kept for open animal grazing a small drain carrying wastewater crosses the area from west to east in southern part and land area near the drain is categorized as non cultivable land fig 2 residential land or settlement is extended over an area of 15 ha 5 9 2 3 cropping patterns and growing seasons entire year can be divided into three distinct periods depending upon the crop growing seasons i kharif june september ii rabi october february and iii summer march may in kharif season mainly groundnut cotton castor green gram pigeon pea and maize are grown in the area while in rabi season wheat mustard cumin coriander and psyllium husk isabgol are grown the prominent cropping system of the area is castor cotton groundnut in summer season mostly groundnut and fodder crops lucern and pearl millet are grown two intercropping systems of castor with groundnut and pigeon pea with green gram are also found in the area pomegranate mango and date palm are the major orchard crops grown in the area flood irrigations are provided to almost all the crops except drip irrigated orchard crops long dry spells are common even in rainy season and thus crops need to be irrigated during rainy season also 2 4 surface water and groundwater resources in the study area rainwater harvesting for subsequent utilization is not practiced due to scanty rainfall amount and less rainy days thus surface water resources are meager and agricultural and domestic water requirements for humans as well as livestock are completely met from groundwater resources groundwater for drinking purpose is extracted through two government tubewells that are maintained by gram panchayat a gram panchayat represents the village level government body of elected members and is responsible for all administrative decisions taken for welfare of local people groundwater levels depict a wide variation in the study area ranging from 18 3 m below land surface in southeast portion to 115 8 m below land surface in southwest and western portions fig 1 depth of tubewells vary from 68 6 to 182 9 m average 134 9 m below ground level submersible pumps of 15 60 hp are used for groundwater pumping although a diesel operated turbine pump extracts the shallow groundwater in the area 3 indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs a unique system of extracting groundwater and storing it in surface reservoirs for subsequent utilization to provide irrigation under gravity flow is prevailing for the past more than 50 years over a major part of gujarat india in this system subsurface water lifted through electric operated tubewells is stored as surface water which is then fed to crops surface storage reservoirs are made of earthen masonry with brick and stone and reinforced cement concrete rcc there exists no well defined criterion for deciding reservoir size including length width depth and number of outlets although local beneficiaries choose reservoir dimensions depending upon pump capacity tubewell depth well discharge and irrigated area based on their traditional knowledge acquired over the generations four types of groundwater storage cum application mechanisms are prevalent in the area fig 3 which are i groundwater drafted through a pump is directly applied for irrigating crops ii groundwater extracted through a pump is stored in a surface reservoir iii groundwater pumped through more than one pump is stored in a surface reservoir and iv groundwater lifted through multiple pumps is stored in more than one surface reservoir that remain interconnected this type of indigenous system is evolved over the years by local beneficiaries themselves and is considered advantageous over direct tubewell irrigation in tackling multifold problems associated with irregular and restricted supply of electric power three phase electric power is made available for running groundwater extraction pumps on alternate day and night with frequent sudden cuts without prior intimation to farmers for carrying out maintenance works to rectify technical faults in electricity distribution system tubewell irrigation during night times covers significantly less areas in comparison to that covered by irrigation from surface reservoirs executed during day times in border check basin and furrow methods of irrigation daytime irrigation manages irrigation water efficiently with relatively less water losses due to absence of over irrigation in tubewell irrigation interruption in water supply due to sudden cutoff of electricity reduces coverage of irrigated area because certain amount of water is lost in advancing waterfront up to previously approached point this reduces the water application efficiency considerably especially when irrigating 100 150 m long border strips in contrast continuous irrigation supplies from surface reservoirs improves application efficiency under border groundnut lucern etc furrow castor cotton pigeon pea etc and check basin orchard crops methods which still prevail in arid areas relatively less soc and the poor water holding capacity of soil in more than 80 area of arid gujarat kumar and machiwal 2018 requires a continuous supply of irrigation water to ensure uniform water application which is difficult under tubewell irrigation due to uncertain availability of electric power however surface reservoirs having potential of constant irrigation supply save large quantum of water and time in general irrigation water from the surface reservoir is supplied when the reservoir is filled to its storage capacity however some reservoirs take more than one day in being completely filled due to its large storage capacity hence irrigation is provided simultaneously when the reservoir is filled from tubewell water and approaches its maximum storage capacity as farmers desire to use single minute of available limited electric supply it is further seen that discharge of wells in this arid region has been reducing substantially over the years due to fast depleting groundwater levels the groundwater level has reached up to 120 m depth from surface at many places thus irrigating sandy soil with low discharge tubewells consumes more water and time as compared to that irrigated by controlled discharge through surface reservoirs moreover tubewell irrigation in areas where groundwater levels are deeper more than 150 m depth supplies poor quality water of yellowish color with presence of salts ferrous bicarbonate water soluble iron and other impurities on the other hand such groundwater is exposed to oxygen when stored in surface reservoirs and the soluble iron converts into insoluble iron ferric state that deposits at bottom and sides of the reservoirs making the irrigation supplies free from iron kumar and machiwal 2018 the advantages and disadvantages of above four mechanisms of groundwater storage cum application for irrigation are summarized in table 1 4 materials and methods 4 1 field survey and data collection a detailed survey of the study area was carried out in the years 2015 16 and 2016 17 to understand the system of surface storage of groundwater for irrigation adopted by the beneficiaries and to acquire the information about existing groundwater utilization pattern in 2015 16 for crop production the procedure of survey involved direct measurements field observations holding focused group discussions fgds and interaction meetings with resource persons i e head of the village called as sarpanch and farmers of the village cadastral map of the area collected from the revenue department nakhatrana gujarat was geo referenced in geographic information system gis using arcgis with the help of google earth image boundary of the study area was delineated correctly recording location coordinates i e longitude and latitude of the known locations using global positioning system gps near the boundary and further confirmed by the farmers furthermore all the existing production wells 44 in numbers were located in gis platform using their location coordinates land use land cover lulc pattern of the area was drawn on hardcopy of google earth image february 2016 according to the knowledge of local farmers which was later verified using the gps data for selected locations under each lulc class during field visits discharge of all 44 tubewells was measured precisely through volumetric method where the average time taken in thrice fillings of a container of known volume from well water was recorded in addition a complete well inventory was obtained through fgds to gather information about initial depth of tubewell depth of pump from land surface current groundwater depth pump horsepower and extent of well casing and well screens moreover information about crops grown i e crop type and acreage duration of irrigation for different crops time taken in emptying a reservoir irrigation interval for different crops and crop durations were acquired through fgds also irrigation method adopted in command area of different tubewells was seen during field visits and area irrigated in a day and daily irrigation timings were also noted during the interactions with farmers 4 2 determining irrigation capacity of storage reservoirs and irrigation tubewells irrigation capacity is defined as the crop area that can be irrigated by the available reservoir water supplies per unit of time during a single irrigation under gravity flow the concept of irrigation capacity for groundwater irrigation directly from tubewell is discussed by bhadra et al 2016a in this study the average water discharge from the storage reservoir under gravity flow conditions is calculated from the following equation 1 q ri v t t e n o where q ri is the average water discharge for irrigation supply from the ith storage reservoir m3 h 1 v t is the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir m3 t e is the time required in emptying the reservoir under gravity flow h and n o is available number of outlets from the reservoir value of v t was computed from the reservoir dimensions i e length width and depth in case of rectangular shaped reservoir and diameter and depth in case of circular reservoirs which were measured during the field investigations and value of t e was collected for all the storage reservoirs during the fgds then the crop wise irrigation capacity of every storage reservoir was calculated using the expression given below 2 i r i j a c i j p i i j t r i j where i r i j is the irrigation capacity of the ith storage reservoir for jth crop m2 h 1 a c i j is the area of jth crop irrigated through ith reservoir m2 p i i j is irrigation period days of jth crop under the command of ith reservoir and t r i j is the operational time of the ith storage reservoir h day 1 for jth crop the information of command area irrigation period and operational time for different crops irrigated through individual storage reservoirs in the year 2015 16 was collected during field survey fgds and interactions with individual farmers similarly crop wise irrigation capacity i wj in m2 h 1 of the individual 44 tubewells used for irrigation is estimated using the following expression 3 i wj i 1 n j 1 m i r i j q wt q ri where q wt m3 h 1 is the discharge of irrigation tubewell m is number of crops under a storage reservoir and n is number of the storage reservoirs in a tubewell command 4 3 estimating groundwater draft for irrigation 4 3 1 based on storage reservoir data the average depth of water d i j applied to the jth crop in each irrigation is computed based on the irrigation capacity of the ith reservoir for that crop i r i j and average discharge of the reservoir q ri as shown below 4 d i j q ri i r i j water from tubewells to storage reservoirs is transported through underground pipelines in the study area also the storage reservoirs are located within the irrigated fields and irrigation water is directly applied to the fields hence negligible conveyance losses occur in water transmission from tubewell to reservoir furthermore using the information of crop period p c i j in days and irrigation interval i i i j number of irrigations i n i j applied to jth crop under ith storage reservoir are computed as follows 5 i n i j p c i j i i i j total volume of irrigation water v i i j in m3 required for jth crop irrigated through ith reservoir is computed from the following equation 6 v i i j d i j i n i j a c i j 4 3 2 based on well inventory the well inventory data is used to calculate the groundwater draft of 44 individual tubewells used for providing irrigation using the following expression 7 v wt q wt d t h w where v wt is seasonal annual groundwater draft of the tubewell m3 q wt is discharge of the irrigation tubewell m3 h 1 d t is duration of tubewell operation days during a season or year and h w is daily pump operational hours h day 1 tubewell pumps mostly run for average 8 h daily depending on availability of electric supply in the area many farmers use an automated on off electrical switch for operating the tubewell pumps 4 4 quantifying impact of crop acreage on groundwater draft from tubewells 4 4 1 developing regression model in order to see the impact of total crop acreage on the amount of groundwater draft in a year scatter plot is plotted between the total irrigated area and total volume of irrigation water supplied through every storage reservoir in a year the separate scatter plots are plotted for masonry and earthen storage reservoirs the annual total crop acreage is computed by adding areas under different crops grown in a season s under command of a tubewell storage reservoir similarly annual gross groundwater draft is computed by summing up irrigation water amounts applied to different crops over a season s within command area of a tubewell reservoir in a year relationship between the total annual crop acreage and total annual groundwater draft in the area is explored by fitting a second order polynomial regression model to the observed plot for two different kinds of reservoirs the fitted polynomial regression model explains the relationship between the gross irrigated area under storage reservoirs and the total irrigation water applied over three seasons namely kharif rabi and summer the distinct storage reservoirs have a variable amount of irrigation water application due to variations in crop acreages their types and periods the equation of the best fit polynomial regression model is represented as 8 v it v c 1 a it 2 v c 2 a it v m where v it is total annual groundwater draft of a tubewell used for applying irrigation m3 a it is total annual cropped area irrigated over all three seasons through a tubewell m2 v c1 and v c2 are the coefficients of the best fit trend line and v m is the coefficient that indicates the minimum amount of irrigation water required for incorporating evaporation seepage and other management losses from the storage reservoirs m3 magnitude of the water losses from storage reservoir reveals how efficiently groundwater stored in surface water reservoirs is utilized for irrigation 4 4 2 validation of developed model accuracy of the polynomial regression model developed to express relationship between crop acreage and amount of irrigation water is validated by computing correlation coefficient furthermore the amount of irrigation water is re estimated using the developed polynomial regression model by using values of the total irrigated area for the year 2015 16 additional losses from storage reservoirs are incorporated with the measured groundwater irrigation drafts for obtaining the amount of total irrigation water supplied from the tubewells the developed model is further validated by comparing observed and estimated irrigation water amounts by employing four statistical goodness of fit criteria such as coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean error me and relative error re these statistical criteria have been used for validation of mathematical models in hydrological studies e g coppala et al 2005 huo et al 2010 bhadra et al 2016a and their detailed mathematical expressions are available in the literature 4 5 evaluating water losses from storage reservoirs surface reservoirs are effective means of compensating with lower discharge rates and other problems of tubewell irrigation and maintaining a continuous supply of irrigation water however groundwater stored in surface reservoirs is subjected to evaporation and seepage losses depending upon the type of reservoir construction in cement masonry reservoirs seepage loss will not occur and water will be lost only through evaporation whereas both seepage and evaporation losses will occur from earthen reservoirs surface area of storage reservoirs is considerably less than irrigated area and hence the stored water is usually applied to irrigate the fields after the reservoir is filled up to its full storage capacity thus the storage reservoirs are considered to have the water during entire crop duration over two to three seasons and therefore evaporation and seepage losses occur the average depth of water lost through seepage and or evaporation in a year l w m from the storages reservoirs during the entire crop periods is estimated from the following equation 9 l w v w v i a t where a t is the surface area of water storage reservoir m2 which is the average of top and bottom areas in case of trapezoidal shaped reservoir 5 results and discussion 5 1 discharge statistics of tubewells and surface reservoirs during field survey in 2015 16 it was observed that depth of groundwater levels varied from 18 3 to 115 8 m with an average of 83 1 m below ground level in the study area the groundwater depths are found increasing from east to west direction in the area fig 1 most of the high discharge production wells yielding good quality irrigation water are located in the western part of area where forest and gauchar lands are present figs 1 and 2 however agricultural land is mainly situated in the eastern part of the area with less density of wells availability of the poor quality groundwater in the eastern part is the main reason that agricultural lands are irrigated from groundwater extracted from lands outside the agricultural lands where groundwater levels are relatively deeper a large part of the forest lands comes under the common property rights and therefore local farmers are permitted to have lands on lease for a fixed duration to extract groundwater for irrigation purpose thus large quantities of groundwater are extracted from the western side open forest and gauchar lands for filling the storage reservoirs for irrigating the fields subsequently box whisker plots of tubewell depth and discharge pump depth and horsepower hp and groundwater depth are plotted and the same are shown in fig 4 tubewell discharge of 44 wells varies from 8 5 to 72 m3 h 1 with an average value of 44 8 m3 h 1 it is apparent from fig 4 that the pump is installed at a median depth of 94 5 m in a tubewell having median depth of 134 9 m where the groundwater level is situated at median depth of 84 4 m below the ground level 5 2 discharge power relationship results of regression analysis indicating relationship between tubewell discharge and pump hp through a second order polynomial curve accuracy of the fitted curve is adjudged by the goodness of fit criterion i e correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 whose values r 0 90 and r2 0 81 suggest a very strong correlation between well discharge and pump hp correlation based performance criteria are reported to have a biasness and hence the accuracy of second order polynomial function is further evaluated using error based criteria i e root mean square error rmse value of rmse for comparing measured and polynomial function predicted well discharge is computed as 1 6 m3 h 1 which confirms the prediction capability of the model it is seen that pumps of 30 35 and 40 hp are frequently used for lifting groundwater in the area variation in tubewell discharge for 30 35 and 40 hp pumps is examined by coefficient of variation cv whose values for well discharge from 30 35 and 40 hp pumps are obtained as 19 39 and 20 respectively thus it is revealed that variation in well discharge from 35 hp pumps is almost double to that from 30 and 40 hp pumps the average well discharge from 30 35 and 40 hp pumps is computed as 43 6 36 5 and 47 8 m3 h 1 respectively spatial distribution of pump hp and corresponding well discharge data is presented in fig 5 it is seen that pump hp is relatively less in the eastern part where land elevations are low and groundwater levels are shallow well discharge is also less for the less hp pumps lifting shallow groundwater levels in comparison to that of the high hp pumps extracting deeper groundwater in high elevation areas towards western part this result clearly indicate that the deeper aquifer underlying the western hilly terrain is largely exploited for supplying good quality irrigation water than the poor quality water available in shallow aquifer on the eastern portion of the area the extracted groundwater resources are managed by storing in more masonry more than half of total reservoirs than earthen reservoirs storage capacity of the reservoirs varies from 63 to 2402 m3 average 761 8 m3 and rate of the water delivery ranges from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 with an average of 65 9 m3 h 1 the rate of water delivery from reservoirs is markedly higher than discharge of tubewells fig 6 in 40 of total 44 cases only four tubewells fitted with high capacity pumps have discharge higher than water delivery rate of storage reservoirs for an efficiently designed surface reservoir water delivery rate should be more than tubewell discharge it is revealed that either size or dimensions of reservoir or number of outlets is not adequate in four number of cases as the reservoir is designed based on only indigenous knowledge gained by the local beneficiaries and lacks scientific knowledge hence indigenous traditional knowledge needs to be amalgamated with scientific and technical knowledge for planning and optimal design of the surface reservoirs depending upon the tubewell discharge irrigated area type of crops and cropping pattern among others overall the water delivery rate of the reservoirs is 37 4 higher than the tubewell discharge this finding proves the efficacy of the indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs to regulate the discharge and supplying irrigation water through gravity in sandy loam soils of arid regions 5 3 comparing irrigation capacities of reservoirs and tubewells surface reservoirs supply stored groundwater for irrigation directly to agricultural fields and thus water application rate in fields remain the similar to water delivery rate of reservoirs bar charts of crop wise irrigation capacities of tubewells and reservoirs are drawn for comparison and the same are depicted in fig 7 it is revealed that irrigation capacity of reservoirs ranging from 421 7 to 5398 1 m2 h 1 is higher than that of tubewells ranging from 294 7 to 4318 5 m2 h 1 for all the crops under flood irrigation since tubewell discharge varying from 17 0 to 71 2 m3 h 1 is less than water delivery rate of reservoirs varying from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 and storage reservoirs provide continuous supply of irrigation water on an average it is estimated that surface reservoirs requires 3 4 h lesser time than tubewells in irrigating 1 ha land for a given irrigation depth this indicates a 46 saving in time when a field is irrigated through reservoirs in place of tubewells it is further estimated that the average irrigation capacity of reservoirs is 50 higher than that of tubewells with 37 4 increased delivery rate than well discharge this finding verifies that the indigenous system of storing subsurface water in surface reservoirs for irrigation is effective in saving time involved in irrigating fields under the present conditions of low discharge of tubewells in sandy loam soil of arid region furthermore the average irrigation capacity of reservoirs is found minimum 421 7 m2 h 1 for maize and maximum 2313 5 m2 h 1 for pigeon pea fig 7 considering all crops the overall average irrigation capacity of surface reservoirs is estimated at 1370 1 m2 h 1 whereas the average irrigation capacity of tubewells is estimated at 915 0 m2 h 1 it is seen that irrigation capacity of the reservoirs remain more or less similar for a few crops such as i cotton and castor 1253 1 and 1234 1 m2 h 1 ii corriander psyllium husk and fodder 1535 1 1518 2 and 1532 1 m2 h 1 iii kharif and summer groundnut 1132 01 and 1156 7 m2 h 1 however overall variation in irrigation capacity based on reservoir is higher cv 35 in comparison to tubewell cv 28 which indicates knowledge and awareness among farmers for applying different quantities of water to different crops according to their water requirements and soil conditions as irrigation method remains the same for most of the crops in addition different field management practices including type of irrigation method flood irrigation methods such as border furrow and check basin and micro irrigation method such as drip length width and slope range of border strip covered in single irrigation and other minor manual practices adopted for handling the irrigation water may also be responsible at some extent for variation in irrigation capacity it is further observed from fig 7 that differences between irrigation capacities of reservoirs and tubewells are big for pigeon pea 1151 7 m2 h 1 cumin 1007 7 m2 h 1 green gram 855 3 m2 h 1 and coriander 700 8 m2 h 1 which are mainly due to low discharge of tubewells 32 22 71 20 m3 h 1 and high water delivery rate of reservoirs 53 70 93 45 m3 h 1 besides it is experienced that handling continuous supply of irrigation water from storage reservoir is much easier than managing interrupted supply of groundwater from tubewells under electricity cuts slower rate of water flow in case of direct tubewell irrigation may also cause water losses through deep percolation 5 4 irrigation for different crops irrigation methods and seasons the existing practice for irrigating most of the field crops in the study area is flood irrigation with water supplied from surface reservoirs however drip irrigated castor and cotton crops watered from reservoir supplies through another small size pump installed in the reservoir were also seen at some places during field survey in addition all orchard crops including pomegranate mango date palm and a vegetable crop tomato are also seen drip irrigated total quantities of irrigation water applied to different crops were estimated using crop statistics and irrigation information acquired during field visits and estimation process is explained in table 2 it is seen that amount of reservoir supplied water volumes to irrigate different crops increases mainly due to increasing irrigated areas single irrigation depths applied to different crops by flood and drip methods are shown in fig 8 it is learnt that single irrigation depth in orchard crops depends on the age of orchard which is found as the minimum of 0 31 cm for 2 month old orchard of date palm the average irrigation depth for pomegranate 0 5 1 year old and mango 2 year old is 0 72 cm and 1 16 cm respectively the average irrigation depth for flood irrigated field crops varied from 4 0 cm for pigeon pea to 6 4 cm for wheat it is seen from fig 8 that depth of water applied in a single irrigation is relatively less ranging from 4 0 to 4 7 in case of pigeon pea cumin green gram and coriander which may likely be a factor for increased irrigation capacity of the reservoirs as is discussed in the previous section the irrigation water in pigeon pea crop is applied through furrow irrigation method where about half of the area between two consecutive furrows is kept dry which resulted in less irrigation depth total annual irrigation depth varied from 36 9 cm for cumin to 226 7 cm for fodder crops in the study area a cumulative average of annual irrigation depth is estimated at 128 9 cm for all crops grown over 350 7 ha during 2015 16 it is seen from table 2 that the computed values of annual irrigation depths are quite high for almost all the crops in the area which is likely due to hot arid climate sandy loam soil having low water holding capacity and high evaporation and percolation losses application of large number of irrigations was apparently seen during field visits and the same was further confirmed during fgds with farmers on an average it was revealed that a total of 27 33 19 and 17 no of irrigations is applied to flood irrigated castor cotton maize and wheat respectively and 120 180 and 300 no of irrigations to drip irrigated castor tomato and date palm respectively water depth in drip irrigated cotton 90 9 cm is found 44 less than that in furrow irrigated cotton 163 1 cm in case of castor 111 7 cm of water applied through drip irrigation saved 7 4 of water applied through flood irrigation 120 6 cm likewise furrow irrigated castor with average irrigation depth of 140 14 cm is 26 more effective in saving water than furrow irrigated cotton having 177 02 cm irrigation depth it is primarily caused due to more running length of furrows per unit area for cotton in comparison to castor as spacing of furrows is more in case of castor kharif groundnut requiring 90 8 cm of irrigation water is found 37 4 water effective than summer groundnut consuming 124 8 cm of water due to less irrigation frequency and water depth in case of the former growing season of kharif groundnut coincides with rainy season in the area and hence part of plant water needs is fulfilled from the rainwater it is experienced that 473 6 mm of rainfall was received during rainy season of 2015 whereas only 5 4 mm of rainfall occurred during summer season in the area 5 5 groundwater draft estimated by empirical polynomial regression model a wide variation is found in amount of site specific irrigation water supplied from different reservoirs and duty of surface reservoirs varies from 2 6 to 26 3 ha cumec 1 the maximum reservoir duty is achieved under a complex system of five tubewells that are connected to two surface reservoirs it is observed that amount of irrigation application increases with increase in the gross irrigated area gia it is considered the proportionate application of irrigation water for the corresponding gia covered during kharif rabi and summer seasons respectively an empirical second order polynomial model expressing relationship between gia and irrigated water volumes is established using data of 21 masonry and 19 earthen storage reservoirs for 2015 16 through regression analysis and the same is shown in fig 9a and b the value of minimum water lost is found as 4646 6 and 20 137 4 m3 through masonry and earthen storage reservoirs respectively in the area irrespective of gia these results indicate that combined component of water lost through seepage and evaporation in earthen storage reservoirs is more than four times higher than losses through evaporation in masonry reservoirs 5 6 accuracy of model predicted groundwater draft the developed empirical model is used to predict groundwater draft extracted for supplying irrigation water at 40 sites bar charts depicting a comparison between the estimated and model predicted values of groundwater draft at 40 sites is shown in fig 10 overall a difference of 38 547 m3 of water exists in estimated 4 222 855 m3 and model predicted 4 184 308 m3 values of groundwater draft at all sites this indicates a total deviation of 0 9 between estimated and predicted values of groundwater draft which is reasonably fair and this verifies the adequacy of the developed model values of rmse 28 473 7 m3 me 963 7 m3 and re 5 1 further validates the model capability in predicting groundwater draft satisfactorily estimates of the average water depth in a unit irrigated area for 40 sites vary from 39 2 to 231 3 cm ha 1 with an average depth of 134 4 cm ha 1 it is also observed that about 60 of farmers in the area utilize the irrigation water with less than the average depth 5 7 amount of water lost from reservoirs value of annual gross groundwater draft from tubewell irrigation is estimated at 4 560 972 6 m3 for a total area of 350 7 ha and the average annual unit draft is calculated as 13 005 3 m3 ha 1 on the other hand amount of irrigation water applied over the same area through surface reservoirs considering all crops is estimated at 4 520 788 1 m3 annually thus a difference of 40 184 5 m3 of water between amount of groundwater draft and amount of applied irrigation water indicates annual loss of water through seepage and evaporation from the cumulative surface area of 18 420 8 m2 for all 46 surface reservoirs constructed in the study area the amount of water lost annually through the reservoirs accounts for only 0 9 of the total irrigation water supplied from the reservoirs which is not substantial it is further attempted to estimate water losses separately from earthen and masonry reservoirs and estimation of annual water losses for earthen and masonry reservoirs is illustrated in table 3 the results suggest that water lost annually from earthen reservoirs due to seepage and evaporation consist of 2 77 m yr 1 per unit of reservoir area whereas it is only 1 22 m yr 1 per unit of reservoir area in case of masonry reservoirs owing to only evaporation the overall depth of water lost through all reservoirs is computed as 2 18 m yr 1 irrespective of earthen or masonry construction in general amount of water lost through seepage remains higher than that lost through evaporation the total storage capacity of earthen and masonry storage reservoirs is measured as 17 432 11 and 17 220 71 m3 respectively thus the water lost per unit of storage capacity is also higher in case of earthen reservoirs however as a whole a major portion of reservoir water is lost through combined effect of seepage and evaporation from earthen storage reservoirs in the study area as masonry reservoirs are having no seepage loss but excessive evaporation due to arid climate it is felt that there is a need to check evaporation loss from the reservoirs by adopting suitable measures such as different types of cost effective covers made of locally available materials especially from the agricultural wastes it is revealed from the above discussion that the indigenous system of storing groundwater in surface reservoirs and apply irrigation through gravity flow regulates water delivery rate and saves time involved in irrigation application as per the need of crops and soil conditions of a particular field therefore loss of minor water quantities may be acceptable looking at the amplitude of advantages that are obtained by storing groundwater in surface reservoirs for providing irrigation through gravity flow 6 conclusions this study evaluates efficacy of an indigenous system evolved over the generations by regional farmers of gujarat india to deal with problems of mismanagement of groundwater irrigation through electric operated tubewells under interrupted electric power supply furthermore a methodology is suggested to precisely estimate micro level or village level groundwater draft for irrigated agriculture through a crop specific model it is observed that depth of the submersible electrical pumps installed in tubewells for groundwater extraction for irrigation varied from 30 5 to 121 9 m average 93 6 m from the ground level in the study area whereas tubewell depth ranged from 45 7 to 198 1 m from the ground level with tubewell discharge varying between 4 5 and 72 m3 h 1 average 41 5 m3 h 1 the best fitted relationship between tubewell discharge and pump horsepower hp is represented by a second order polynomial model with reasonable values of correlation coefficient 0 90 coefficient of determination 0 80 and root mean square error rmse 1 6 m3 h 1 it is further observed that the good quality groundwater from a deeper aquifer existing in the western portion is more exploited for irrigation purpose using high hp pumps yielding better discharge than the shallow aquifer situated in the eastern portion it is found that earthen masonry and reinforced cement concrete reservoirs with 63 2402 m3 average 761 8 m3 of storage capacity exist in the area that deliver water at a rate ranging from 22 6 to 99 8 m3 h 1 average 65 9 m3 h 1 the mean rate of water delivery for irrigation supplies from reservoir stored groundwater is revealed to be 37 4 higher than that from direct tubewell irrigation which justifies the efficacy of the indigenous system of storing groundwater into surface reservoirs to regulate the discharge appropriately before supplying it through gravity flow for irrigation having no dependency on electric power availability storage reservoirs with 50 more average irrigation capacity than direct tubewell irrigation saves 3 4 h 46 time in irrigating 1 ha land for a given irrigation depth which further validates potency of the storage reservoirs over the tubewell irrigation in the area the average irrigation depth under flood irrigation computed for reservoir irrigation is found to be minimum 4 04 cm for pigeon pea and maximum 6 41 cm for wheat about 2 10 m depth of water is always lost in flood irrigated 1 ha land and then 1 02 m of irrigation depth is needed for every unit increase of irrigated area which emphasizes the need of adopting micro irrigation methods such as sprinkler and drip methods in arid climate of the study area the developed second order polynomial regression model for groundwater draft and crop acreage is adequately validated from 0 9 deviation between observed and model predicted values of groundwater draft whose capability is further verified from satisfactory values of rmse as 28 473 7 m3 mean error as 963 7 m3 and relative error as 5 1 overall water balance modeling of reservoirs indicated that 0 9 of the total groundwater draft is lost through the storage reservoirs in the form of evaporation and seepage also the water lost through earthen seepage and evaporation losses and masonry evaporation loss only reservoirs is estimated separately as 2 77 and 1 22 m per unit of reservoir area it is apparently seen that the water losses from the storage reservoirs are not remarkable and hence the indigenous system may be efficiently used for managing groundwater based irrigation supplies in the arid region of gujarat under interrupted electrical power supply hence the indigenous system is simple cost effective and easy to implement over other solutions of managing and regulating electric supply it is suggested that the second order polynomial regression model developed to estimate groundwater draft from storage reservoirs masonry and earthen can be used as a tool for efficiently managing groundwater resources not only in the study area but also in other arid regions of the world where the groundwater extraction rate is much higher than the recharge rate moreover the indigenous system discussed in this study may be effectively used in other drylands of the world under the conditions of interrupted and intermittent electric power supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9659,soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with slow release urea application are important measures for agricultural yield enhancement however slow release urea may cause a yield reduction due to insufficient fertility in early crop growth we considered whether the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system using different mulch colors could offset this disadvantage an experiment was conducted using a randomized split plot design with three soil preparation and mulching practices as the main plot treatments in combination with three different urea applications as sub plot treatments the three soil preparation and mulching practices were flat cropping without mulch f the rfp system with white plastic mulch over the ridge w and the rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge b the three urea applications were no urea n0 slow release urea ns and ordinary urea nu the results showed that compared to f the rfp system especially b could increase the use of precipitation and reduce soil water depletion which ultimately increased the water productivity wp of winter wheat in addition the nitrogen use efficiency of ns was further improved under the rfp system while there was essentially no difference between the two different urea types under f in summary b could take full advantage of ns to coordinate the relationship between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight maximizing the wp nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield between 2016 and 2019 the wp and grain yield of b ns increased by 79 2 107 0 and 75 7 87 0

grain yield 1 introduction natural precipitation is the main water recharge for semi humid and drought prone areas but the uneven intra annual precipitation in these regions in china july september precipitation accounts for about 65 0 of the annual precipitation does not match the water requirements of winter wheat at all growth stages li et al 2020 inadequate water supply has become a bottleneck limiting agricultural development resulting in low and erratic grain yields wu et al 2019 soil preparation and mulching practices can effectively preserve soil moisture and have become important ways to increase grain yield wang et al 2016 one of the most important practices is the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system mo et al 2017 the system effectively collects rainwater and retains soil moisture by covering ridges with plastic mulch and planting in furrows gan et al 2013 ren et al 2008 reported that compared with conventional flat cropping the summer maize grain yield and water productivity wp of the rfp system increased by 11 2 82 8 and 9 5 77 4 respectively the effectiveness of different colored plastic mulches also varies white or clear plastic mulch absorbs little solar radiation but transmits 85 95 which raises soil temperature but does not limit weed growth anikwe et al 2007 jia et al 2017 the low light transmission of black plastic mulch has a significant weed control effect ricotta and masiunas 1991 however most of the solar energy absorbed by the black plastic mulch is lost to the atmosphere through radiation and forced convection reducing the radiant heat gain by the soil anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2018 black plastic mulch effectively reduces the consumption of water and fertilizer by weeds and inhibits the ineffective evaporation of water between the surface soil and the atmosphere thereby achieving the purpose of improving grain yield and wp qin et al 2014 2018 zhao et al 2014 currently the rfp system is widely used in the production of maize qin et al 2018 li et al 2020 ren et al 2008 while its use for winter wheat has not been sufficiently studied especially in terms of the impact of the color of the plastic mulch in addition to soil moisture the nitrogen level in the soil also directly affects grain yield liu et al 2015 after the application of ordinary urea a large amount of available nitrogen will quickly accumulate in the soil which may leach and volatilize in a relatively short time and cannot be fully absorbed and utilized by crops yin et al 2018 to ensure the grain yield there is a widespread phenomenon of excessive ordinary urea input which causes a serious waste of resources and causes a series of environmental problems such as arable land degradation groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions guo et al 2021 slow release urea is now used to meet the needs of social development and ecological agriculture slow release urea can be gradually released into the soil to ensure a stable and long lasting fertilization effect zhao et al 2017 a slow release is largely compatible with the way in which crops absorb fertilizer providing a better outcome than the application of quick acting urea ni et al 2010 yin et al 2017 reported that in semi arid areas slow release urea can be applied as a base fertilizer in a single application and is a promising crop treatment compared to the conventional split application of urea however slow release urea releases less nitrogen initially which may result in slow crop growth and a low grain yield grant et al 2012 waddell et al 1999 the effect of slow release urea should be studied in the context of crop varieties and climatic conditions and jointly with soil preparation and mulching practices soil moisture and nitrogen are interdependent management factors and cannot be evaluated as independent factors hu et al 2010 rational soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with urea application can fully exploit their mutual effects studies have shown that mulch can improve nitrogen use efficiency and an appropriate application of urea can also improve wp guo et al 2019 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 two specific questions have arisen from the previous research in this area 1 what are the effects of different mulch colors on the grain yield wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in semi humid and drought prone areas 2 can the rfp system and plastic mulch colors be used to alter the soil moisture distribution thereby optimizing the coupling effect with slow release urea and avoiding the disadvantage of the insufficient fertility of slow release urea in the early stage of winter wheat growth the aim of this study was to determine the optimal combination of soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with different urea applications to ultimately achieve the goals of streamlining fertilization efficient use of water and nitrogen and increasing grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site from october 2016 to june 2019 an experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of the ministry of education 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 0 m a s l northwest a f university yangling 712100 shaanxi province china the annual average sunshine duration in the test area is 2164 0 h and the groundwater depth is greater than 8 0 m the annual mean air temperature is 12 9 c the precipitation is 550 0 600 0 mm mostly between july and september and the pan evaporation is 1500 0 mm gu et al 2018a fang et al 2021 the soil texture is a medium loam alfisol in u s taxonomy with a dry bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 field capacity gravimetric of 24 0 permanent wilting point gravimetric of 8 5 ph

plot design with three soil preparation and mulching practices fig 1 as the main plot treatments and three different urea applications as sub plot treatments the three soil preparation and mulching practices were flat cropping without mulch f the rfp system with white plastic mulch over the ridge w and the rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge b the three urea applications were no urea n0 slow release urea ns and ordinary urea nu a total of nine treatments labeled f n0 f ns f nu w n0 w ns w nu b n0 b ns and b nu were repeated three times each the experimental plots were aligned north south with each plot being 6 0 m long and 5 0 m wide ordinary urea or slow release urea sulfur coated urea of 180 0 kg n ha 1 calcium superphosphate of 20 0 kg p ha 1 and potassium sulfate of 50 0 kg k ha 1 were applied before sowing and no topdressing fertilizers were applied thereafter the planting system in the area of the experiment was a winter wheat and summer maize rotation no fertilizers were applied when summer maize was planted and residual mulch was removed when winter wheat was planted to overcome any potential for the previous crop to affect the experimental treatment untreated guard rows with a width of 1 0 m were planted around the entire experimental area to avoid edge effects hand weeding was carried out once in each plot during the stem elongation stage and pesticides and germicides were sprayed once in each plot during the inflorescence emergence stage there was no irrigation during the whole winter wheat growth period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3

water storage dynamics before sowing after harvesting and during the growth period zadoks growth scale of winter wheat a portable auger was used to take samples every 10 0 cm at each measuring point total sampling depth was 200 0 cm and the soil water content was calculated using the oven dry weight method samples were dried at 105 0 c gu et al 2017 2019 the measuring point was between two adjacent rows of winter wheat in the middle of each plot in the plots of the rfp systems soil samples were taken from the center of the ridge and the middle of the furrow and then the average value of the ridge and furrow samples was taken as the soil moisture content of the plot the total soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cm soil profile was calculated using the formula below hu et al 2019 gu

its components sampling was conducted in the middle of each plot to measure the grain yield after the ripening of winter wheat due to the different soil preparation and mulching practices four adjacent rows of winter wheat were taken in flat cropping plots and the sampling row length was 2 0 m in the plots of the rfp systems four rows of winter wheat were taken between two adjacent ridges and the sampling row length was also 2 0 m the effective spikes per unit area ear length grains per spike and 1000 grain weight within the sampling range 0 6 2 0 m were determined and finally the grain yield grain water content at 14 0 kg ha 1 of each treatment was calculated according to the effective planting area of each plot 2 3 4 evapotranspiration and wp the soil water balance equation

was performed using origin 2021 graphs were drawn using auto cad 2007 photoshop 2020 and origin 2021 3 results 3 1 weather conditions as shown in fig 2 the maximum average temperatures 13 2 8 0 c in march 2017 were very different from those in march 2018 18 7 11 6 c and march 2019 17 5 10 8 c while the temperature trends of the remaining months remained essentially constant in all three years from 2016 2019 the total precipitation for the whole growth period was 385 4 212 0 and 204 1 mm respectively the precipitation during the growth periods of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 was primarily distributed in the early stage october and the late stage march june with the total precipitation received during the concentrated precipitation in the late stage being 303 0 and 168 1 mm respectively the precipitation during the growth period of 2018 2019 was less than in the previous two years and was mainly distributed in the late period april june when the total precipitation was 150 1 mm 3 2 soil water storage dynamics the sws of each treatment was 489 0 505 6 509 8 511 0 and 483 7 486 6 mm on january 12 2017 tillering october 12 2017 before sowing and october 14 2018 before sowing respectively which were the highest values during their respective growth periods taking january 12 2017 january 8 2018 and january 16 2019 fig 3 as examples the sws of the rfp system was always slightly higher than that of the f treatment from october to january of the following year seeding elongation tillering but the difference was not significant p 0 05 the difference between different treatments was significant p 0 05 from february to june tillering ripening during tillering ripening in 2016 2019 for different soil preparation and mulching practices the sws of b was 13 5 21 1 and 28 7 41 1 mm higher than that of w and f respectively for different urea applications the sws of n0 was 11 4 19 6 and 15 0 37 6 mm higher than that of nu and ns respectively taking april 5 2017 may 7 2018 and may 9 2019 as examples the sws for each treatment was 307 6 370 2 300 6 368 3 and 287 5 360 0 mm respectively which were the lowest values in their respective growth periods the sws of b n0 was higher than that of f ns by 62 6 66 8 and 72 5 mm on the three dates mentioned above respectively which represented the greatest difference among the nine treatments 3 3 grain yield and its components the analysis in table 1 shows that the interaction of soil preparation and mulching practices with urea applications had a highly significant effect on grain yield p 0 01 during the three years of 2016 2019 b ns consistently had the highest spike length grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield while f n0 consistently had the lowest grain yield and its components the spike length grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield of b ns were increased by 16 4 50 0 26 6 30 3 18 0 36 4 and 75 7 87 0 respectively compared to f n0 p 0 05 in 2018 2019 the growing stage with the lowest total precipitation b ns had the most significant grain yield increase p 0 01 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 w ns had the highest effective spikes per unit area with 16 1 and 36 5 p 0 05 improvements over f n0 respectively in 2018 2019 w nu had the highest effective spikes per unit area which was 18 0 p 0 05 higher than f n0 in the f treatment two urea types were applied ns and nu and their grain yields and components were not significantly different 3 4 evapotranspiration and wp in 2016 2019 the total precipitation during the winter wheat growing period decreased year by year and etc act displayed a decreasing trend with the decrease in precipitation table 2 with significant differences p 0 01 in each indicator between treatments and years because there was no irrigation during the winter wheat growing period the etc act of the crop was mainly composed of p and δw during the three years the highest etc act δw and δw etc act were observed for the f ns treatment while the etc act δw and δw etc act of b n0 b ns and b nu were relatively low compared to the three b treatments i e b n0 b ns and b nu the etc act δw and δw etc act of f ns increased by 9 5 24 9 60 6 92 4 and 42 5 70 9 respectively however the p etc act was completely the opposite with b n0 b ns and b nu improving by 9 5 24 8 compared to f ns during the three years b ns had the highest wp while f n0 f ns and f nu had relatively low wp the wp of b ns increased by 51 4 107 0 compared to the three f treatments i e f n0 f ns and f nu 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency as shown in the analysis of table 3 the different soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with the different urea applications and their interaction effects had highly significant effects p 0 01 on nitrogen use efficiency the nae npe nre and npfp were higher in ns than in nu over the three years with increases of 27 5 49 0 8 2 14 6 16 6 31 1 and 5 6 8 6 respectively the b treatment maximized the nitrogen use efficiency of ns the nae npe nre and npfp of b ns from 2016 to 2019 were 12 1 8 0 kg kg 1 39 1 42 4 kg kg 1 30 9 35 2 and 47 2 54 6 kg kg 1 respectively which were 116 1 123 3 28 5 34 8 66 1 71 9 and 44 1 53 2 higher than f nu which had the lowest nitrogen use efficiency respectively 3 6 correlations between variables as shown in fig 4 wp nae npe nre and npfp were all significantly correlated with grain yield positive correlation coefficient 0 63 1 0 from 2016 to 2019 water and nitrogen had a significant coupling effect with all four nitrogen use efficiencies increasing significantly with increasing wp positive correlation coefficient 0 67 0 97 according to the results of the correlation matrix analysis between soil water storage and crop water use sws1 was significantly correlated with sws2 positive correlation coefficient 0 52 0 69 i e the soil water status of germination tillering directly influenced the soil water status of stem elongation ripening it was found that etc act was significantly correlated with wp in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 negative correlation coefficient 0 50 0 61 and therefore taking effective measures e g applying the rfp system to reduce etc act would significantly improve their wp 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage dynamics evapotranspiration and wp the rfp system decreased etc act but improved sws and wp especially with treatment b which was consistent with the results of previous studies gao et al 2019 ren et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 the etc act is mainly composed of p and δw and the rfp system significantly increased p etc act and decreased δw etc act specifically precipitation was the primary factor influencing the soil moisture status during crop growth qin et al 2018 and the rfp system increased soil moisture input via the rain collection effect of the furrows and improved the use of precipitation yin et al 2019 although the rfp system promoted crop growth and increased plant transpiration ineffective soil evaporation could be further reduced by covering the ridges with plastic mulch thus reducing δw fu et al 2021 li et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 the pronounced weed control effect of black plastic mulch can reduce soil water consumption by weeds compared to white plastic mulch anikwe et al 2007 ricotta and masiunas 1991 further reducing δw and increasing sws and wp the conclusions of some researchers regarding the etc act differed from the above discussion q liu et al 2016 showed that treatments with black or white plastic mulch increased etc act compared to controls without mulch but the differences between treatments were not significant fang et al 2021 showed that the etc act of the mulching treatment was significantly lower than the etc act of the flat cropping in the period of 2013 2015 while the etc act of the mulching treatment was significantly greater than the etc act of the flat cropping during 2015 2016 the reason for the different results may be related to the precipitation during the growing period of the crop when the precipitation was relatively high mulching treatments could effectively utilize the precipitation thus reducing δw and resulting in a lower etc act in contrast when the precipitation was relatively low mulching treatments could utilize deeper soil water which increased δw resulting in a higher etc act fang et al 2021 bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 low wp can be found even under good soil preparation and mulching practices which can be due to low nutrient supplies especially nitrogen li et al 2015 studies have shown that a 10 0 40 0 reduction in the application rate of slow release urea can produce essentially the same yield as a normal urea application yin et al 2017 2018 under certain conditions applying slow release urea is therefore equivalent to increasing the amount of ordinary urea under the same nitrogen application zheng et al 2016 soil water consumption increased with the increase in nitrogen application within a certain range of nitrogen application gu et al 2018b li et al 2015 we found that n0 had the lowest etc act and wp and the highest sws in the same soil preparation and mulching practice while ns had the opposite slow release urea will ensure a nitrogen supply during the growth period of a crop yin et al 2017 coordinate the nutrient uptake and distribution in all organs of a crop guo et al 2017 promote nutritional and reproductive growth and ultimately improve the etc act and wp 4 2 grain yield and its components the three main factors that determine the grain yield of winter wheat are the effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight osman and mahmoud 1981 effective spikes per unit area is the factor that has the earliest impact on yield composition j zhao et al 2020 showed that mulching increased the effective spikes per unit area compared to no mulching this is because plastic mulch can effectively increase the topsoil temperature in the early stages of crop growth white plastic mulch has better transparency and can capture more solar heat than black plastic mulch increase the available soil moisture accelerate crop emergence and development promote tillering and root development and enhance nutrient and water uptake dong et al 2014 q liu et al 2016 in the rfp system water consumption from germination to tillering in winter wheat is lower relative to the other growth stages and is influenced by soil temperature to a greater extent the higher soil temperature in w than in b promoted tillering more effectively during the germination to tillering growth stages the number of tillers in each treatment reached a peak when stem elongation began mahmoud and osman 1981 due to the transfer of nutrients and growth centers weak tillers gradually stopped growing and died because of insufficient nutrition white 2007 the supply of urea plays an important role in the normal growth of tillers and increases the effective spikes per unit area gautam et al 2017 qiao et al 2011 it should be noted that in the f treatment there was no significant difference in the effective spikes per unit area between nu and ns according to the plastic mulch studies referred to above this is because the tiller capacity of f was significantly lower than that of the rfp system and the competition for resource utilization between tillers was lower although the fertilizer efficiency in the early stage of ns was lower than in nu it could still meet the normal growth of tillers resulting in there being little difference in the effective spikes per unit area between the two urea types however in the rfp system the competition for resource utilization between tillers became greater resulting in amplified differences between ns and nu when there was relatively more precipitation in the early stage of winter wheat growth the rfp system could make up for the shortcomings of insufficient fertility in the early stage of slow release urea grant et al 2012 waddell et al 1999 to ensure the normal growth of tillers in w ns and a high spike rate was obtained in contrast when there was relatively little precipitation in the early stage of winter wheat growth w nu had a higher spike rate because ordinary urea could be rapidly dissolved thus ensuring fertility in the early stage yin et al 2017 q liu et al 2016 found a significant coupling effect between the use of black mulch and application of slow release urea on maize yield which significantly increased grain yield the b ns treatment also provided the maximum grain yield in winter wheat in our experiment which was due to the excellent coordination between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight j zhao et al 2020 showed that fewer tillers would result in fewer effective spikes per unit area reducing grain yield while too many tillers would reduce wp increase competition for resource use and induce collapse also reducing grain yield in our experiment although the effective spikes per unit area of w were higher than those of b this could lead to more competitive resource utilization the growth process of winter wheat is a process of material production via the photosynthesis of green leaves gregory et al 1981 organic matter formed by photosynthesis accounts for about 95 0 of the total dry matter accumulated by plant growth while mineral elements account for only about 5 0 therefore the amount of organic matter formed by photosynthesis directly determines the grain yield b zhao et al 2020 winter wheat photosynthesis is especially dependent on soil moisture conditions fertilizer supply and leaf functions ali et al 2018 keys et al 1977 zhang et al 2017 studies have shown that plastic mulch increases the reflectivity of solar radiation and the resistance of air to water vapor exchange while reducing water loss from the soil thereby increasing leaf area and improving the photosynthetic capacity of crops hu et al 2020 nitrogen is the major limiting factor for crop growth and development in the same soil preparation and mulching practice li et al 2013a ji et al 2007 showed that slow release urea can increase photosynthesis rates and ultimately increase the grain yield of rice zvomuya et al 2003 showed that the application of slow release urea increased the potato yield by 12 0 19 0 compared to the application of regular urea although the fertility of ns was lower than that of nu in the early stage the growth of winter wheat under the ns treatment could catch up or even surpass that of nu due to the continuous supply of nitrogen in the later stage which was consistent with the findings of kim et al 2017 4 3 nitrogen use efficiency overfertilization and low fertilizer utilization are common in rain fed agricultural areas chen et al 2014 the rate of nitrogen release from ordinary urea is faster than the rate of nitrogen uptake by crops and there is an imbalance between nitrogen supply and demand which is the main reason for low nitrogen use efficiency nosengo 2003 many studies have found that the application of slow release urea could be effective in increasing nitrogen use efficiency díez et al 1994 q liu et al 2016 song et al 2014 rational soil preparation and mulching practices may also improve nitrogen use efficiency for example covering agricultural fields with plastic mulch can reduce soil erosion and nitrogen leaching while increasing fertilizer use efficiency by improving soil moisture conditions to promote nitrogen uptake and utilization by plants guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 in contrast in a study of grain yield wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat li et al 2016 showed that compared with flat cropping a ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching increased the grain yield and wp of winter wheat but the nitrogen fertilizer productivity nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen harvest index did not change significantly our experiment combined the advantages of the rfp system and slow release urea in improving nitrogen use efficiency showing a significant coupling effect especially with the b ns treatment winter wheat grew vigorously and had a strong ability to absorb water and fertilizer after the stem elongation period began grava and raisanen 1978 liang et al 2019 in addition to directly limiting crop growth water deficiency could also indirectly inhibit crop growth by reducing the effectiveness of soil nutrients the soil preparation and mulching practices of the b treatment maximized soil moisture through the rain collection effect of the rfp system and the characteristics of black plastic mulch which improved the effectiveness of soil nitrogen and promoted the uptake of nitrogen by winter wheat roots liu et al 2015 at the same time ns enabled the crop to receive nitrogen from the fertilizer over a long period of time by slowly releasing the nitrogen from the coated fertilizer all of which facilitated smooth crop reproductive growth and significantly increased nitrogen accumulation in plants and grains at ripening improving the nitrogen use efficiency sun et al 2019 geng et al 2015 ye et al 2013 5 conclusions the b ns rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge in combination with slow release urea maximized the coupling effect of the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system and slow release urea ns to a certain extent this compensated for the fertility deficiency in the early stage of ns synergistically improved the wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat and coordinated the relationship between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight leading to the most obvious grain yield increase among the various treatments in contrast the ns treatment did not lead to any significant differences compared with the ordinary urea nu treatment in flat cropping without mulch f while ns also increased economic inputs in

9659,soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with slow release urea application are important measures for agricultural yield enhancement however slow release urea may cause a yield reduction due to insufficient fertility in early crop growth we considered whether the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system using different mulch colors could offset this disadvantage an experiment was conducted using a randomized split plot design with three soil preparation and mulching practices as the main plot treatments in combination with three different urea applications as sub plot treatments the three soil preparation and mulching practices were flat cropping without mulch f the rfp system with white plastic mulch over the ridge w and the rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge b the three urea applications were no urea n0 slow release urea ns and ordinary urea nu the results showed that compared to f the rfp system especially b could increase the use of precipitation and reduce soil water depletion which ultimately increased the water productivity wp of winter wheat in addition the nitrogen use efficiency of ns was further improved under the rfp system while there was essentially no difference between the two different urea types under f in summary b could take full advantage of ns to coordinate the relationship between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight maximizing the wp nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield between 2016 and 2019 the wp and grain yield of b ns increased by 79 2 107 0 and 75 7 87 0

grain yield 1 introduction natural precipitation is the main water recharge for semi humid and drought prone areas but the uneven intra annual precipitation in these regions in china july september precipitation accounts for about 65 0 of the annual precipitation does not match the water requirements of winter wheat at all growth stages li et al 2020 inadequate water supply has become a bottleneck limiting agricultural development resulting in low and erratic grain yields wu et al 2019 soil preparation and mulching practices can effectively preserve soil moisture and have become important ways to increase grain yield wang et al 2016 one of the most important practices is the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system mo et al 2017 the system effectively collects rainwater and retains soil moisture by covering ridges with plastic mulch and planting in furrows gan et al 2013 ren et al 2008 reported that compared with conventional flat cropping the summer maize grain yield and water productivity wp of the rfp system increased by 11 2 82 8 and 9 5 77 4 respectively the effectiveness of different colored plastic mulches also varies white or clear plastic mulch absorbs little solar radiation but transmits 85 95 which raises soil temperature but does not limit weed growth anikwe et al 2007 jia et al 2017 the low light transmission of black plastic mulch has a significant weed control effect ricotta and masiunas 1991 however most of the solar energy absorbed by the black plastic mulch is lost to the atmosphere through radiation and forced convection reducing the radiant heat gain by the soil anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2018 black plastic mulch effectively reduces the consumption of water and fertilizer by weeds and inhibits the ineffective evaporation of water between the surface soil and the atmosphere thereby achieving the purpose of improving grain yield and wp qin et al 2014 2018 zhao et al 2014 currently the rfp system is widely used in the production of maize qin et al 2018 li et al 2020 ren et al 2008 while its use for winter wheat has not been sufficiently studied especially in terms of the impact of the color of the plastic mulch in addition to soil moisture the nitrogen level in the soil also directly affects grain yield liu et al 2015 after the application of ordinary urea a large amount of available nitrogen will quickly accumulate in the soil which may leach and volatilize in a relatively short time and cannot be fully absorbed and utilized by crops yin et al 2018 to ensure the grain yield there is a widespread phenomenon of excessive ordinary urea input which causes a serious waste of resources and causes a series of environmental problems such as arable land degradation groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions guo et al 2021 slow release urea is now used to meet the needs of social development and ecological agriculture slow release urea can be gradually released into the soil to ensure a stable and long lasting fertilization effect zhao et al 2017 a slow release is largely compatible with the way in which crops absorb fertilizer providing a better outcome than the application of quick acting urea ni et al 2010 yin et al 2017 reported that in semi arid areas slow release urea can be applied as a base fertilizer in a single application and is a promising crop treatment compared to the conventional split application of urea however slow release urea releases less nitrogen initially which may result in slow crop growth and a low grain yield grant et al 2012 waddell et al 1999 the effect of slow release urea should be studied in the context of crop varieties and climatic conditions and jointly with soil preparation and mulching practices soil moisture and nitrogen are interdependent management factors and cannot be evaluated as independent factors hu et al 2010 rational soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with urea application can fully exploit their mutual effects studies have shown that mulch can improve nitrogen use efficiency and an appropriate application of urea can also improve wp guo et al 2019 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 two specific questions have arisen from the previous research in this area 1 what are the effects of different mulch colors on the grain yield wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat in semi humid and drought prone areas 2 can the rfp system and plastic mulch colors be used to alter the soil moisture distribution thereby optimizing the coupling effect with slow release urea and avoiding the disadvantage of the insufficient fertility of slow release urea in the early stage of winter wheat growth the aim of this study was to determine the optimal combination of soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with different urea applications to ultimately achieve the goals of streamlining fertilization efficient use of water and nitrogen and increasing grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site from october 2016 to june 2019 an experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of the ministry of education 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 0 m a s l northwest a f university yangling 712100 shaanxi province china the annual average sunshine duration in the test area is 2164 0 h and the groundwater depth is greater than 8 0 m the annual mean air temperature is 12 9 c the precipitation is 550 0 600 0 mm mostly between july and september and the pan evaporation is 1500 0 mm gu et al 2018a fang et al 2021 the soil texture is a medium loam alfisol in u s taxonomy with a dry bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 field capacity gravimetric of 24 0 permanent wilting point gravimetric of 8 5 ph

kg 1 in the upper 0 30 0 cm soil profile 2 2 experimental design and field management the winter wheat variety was xiaoyan 22 with a sowing rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 the experiment was a randomized split plot design with three soil preparation and mulching practices fig 1 as the main plot treatments and three different urea applications as sub plot treatments the three soil preparation and mulching practices were flat cropping without mulch f the rfp system with white plastic mulch over the ridge w and the rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge b the three urea applications were no urea n0 slow release urea ns and ordinary urea nu a total of nine treatments labeled f n0 f ns f nu w n0 w ns w nu b n0 b ns and b nu were repeated three times each the experimental plots were aligned north south with each plot being 6 0 m long and 5 0 m wide ordinary urea or slow release urea sulfur coated urea of 180 0 kg n ha 1 calcium superphosphate of 20 0 kg p ha 1 and potassium sulfate of 50 0 kg k ha 1 were applied before sowing and no topdressing fertilizers were applied thereafter the planting system in the area of the experiment was a winter wheat and summer maize rotation no fertilizers were applied when summer maize was planted and residual mulch was removed when winter wheat was planted to overcome any potential for the previous crop to affect the experimental treatment untreated guard rows with a width of 1 0 m were planted around the entire experimental area to avoid edge effects hand weeding was carried out once in each plot during the stem elongation stage and pesticides and germicides were sprayed once in each plot during the inflorescence emergence stage there was no irrigation during the whole winter wheat growth period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 weather conditions the meteorological data for the whole winter wheat growth period in 2016 2019 was obtained from the yangling national general meteorological station in shaanxi province 2 3 2 soil water storage dynamics before sowing after harvesting and during the growth period zadoks growth scale of winter wheat a portable auger was used to take samples every 10 0 cm at each measuring point total sampling depth was 200 0 cm and the soil water content was calculated using the oven dry weight method samples were dried at 105 0 c gu et al 2017 2019 the measuring point was between two adjacent rows of winter wheat in the middle of each plot in the plots of the rfp systems soil samples were taken from the center of the ridge and the middle of the furrow and then the average value of the ridge and furrow samples was taken as the soil moisture content of the plot the total soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cm soil profile was calculated using the formula below hu et al 2019 gu

its components sampling was conducted in the middle of each plot to measure the grain yield after the ripening of winter wheat due to the different soil preparation and mulching practices four adjacent rows of winter wheat were taken in flat cropping plots and the sampling row length was 2 0 m in the plots of the rfp systems four rows of winter wheat were taken between two adjacent ridges and the sampling row length was also 2 0 m the effective spikes per unit area ear length grains per spike and 1000 grain weight within the sampling range 0 6 2 0 m were determined and finally the grain yield grain water content at 14 0 kg ha 1 of each treatment was calculated according to the effective planting area of each plot 2 3 4 evapotranspiration and wp the soil water balance equation

applications as the fixed factor a univariate anova was conducted with soil preparation and mulching practices urea applications and years as three fixed factors a pearson correlation matrix analysis was performed using origin 2021 graphs were drawn using auto cad 2007 photoshop 2020 and origin 2021 3 results 3 1 weather conditions as shown in fig 2 the maximum average temperatures 13 2 8 0 c in march 2017 were very different from those in march 2018 18 7 11 6 c and march 2019 17 5 10 8 c while the temperature trends of the remaining months remained essentially constant in all three years from 2016 2019 the total precipitation for the whole growth period was 385 4 212 0 and 204 1 mm respectively the precipitation during the growth periods of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 was primarily distributed in the early stage october and the late stage march june with the total precipitation received during the concentrated precipitation in the late stage being 303 0 and 168 1 mm respectively the precipitation during the growth period of 2018 2019 was less than in the previous two years and was mainly distributed in the late period april june when the total precipitation was 150 1 mm 3 2 soil water storage dynamics the sws of each treatment was 489 0 505 6 509 8 511 0 and 483 7 486 6 mm on january 12 2017 tillering october 12 2017 before sowing and october 14 2018 before sowing respectively which were the highest values during their respective growth periods taking january 12 2017 january 8 2018 and january 16 2019 fig 3 as examples the sws of the rfp system was always slightly higher than that of the f treatment from october to january of the following year seeding elongation tillering but the difference was not significant p 0 05 the difference between different treatments was significant p 0 05 from february to june tillering ripening during tillering ripening in 2016 2019 for different soil preparation and mulching practices the sws of b was 13 5 21 1 and 28 7 41 1 mm higher than that of w and f respectively for different urea applications the sws of n0 was 11 4 19 6 and 15 0 37 6 mm higher than that of nu and ns respectively taking april 5 2017 may 7 2018 and may 9 2019 as examples the sws for each treatment was 307 6 370 2 300 6 368 3 and 287 5 360 0 mm respectively which were the lowest values in their respective growth periods the sws of b n0 was higher than that of f ns by 62 6 66 8 and 72 5 mm on the three dates mentioned above respectively which represented the greatest difference among the nine treatments 3 3 grain yield and its components the analysis in table 1 shows that the interaction of soil preparation and mulching practices with urea applications had a highly significant effect on grain yield p 0 01 during the three years of 2016 2019 b ns consistently had the highest spike length grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield while f n0 consistently had the lowest grain yield and its components the spike length grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield of b ns were increased by 16 4 50 0 26 6 30 3 18 0 36 4 and 75 7 87 0 respectively compared to f n0 p 0 05 in 2018 2019 the growing stage with the lowest total precipitation b ns had the most significant grain yield increase p 0 01 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 w ns had the highest effective spikes per unit area with 16 1 and 36 5 p 0 05 improvements over f n0 respectively in 2018 2019 w nu had the highest effective spikes per unit area which was 18 0 p 0 05 higher than f n0 in the f treatment two urea types were applied ns and nu and their grain yields and components were not significantly different 3 4 evapotranspiration and wp in 2016 2019 the total precipitation during the winter wheat growing period decreased year by year and etc act displayed a decreasing trend with the decrease in precipitation table 2 with significant differences p 0 01 in each indicator between treatments and years because there was no irrigation during the winter wheat growing period the etc act of the crop was mainly composed of p and δw during the three years the highest etc act δw and δw etc act were observed for the f ns treatment while the etc act δw and δw etc act of b n0 b ns and b nu were relatively low compared to the three b treatments i e b n0 b ns and b nu the etc act δw and δw etc act of f ns increased by 9 5 24 9 60 6 92 4 and 42 5 70 9 respectively however the p etc act was completely the opposite with b n0 b ns and b nu improving by 9 5 24 8 compared to f ns during the three years b ns had the highest wp while f n0 f ns and f nu had relatively low wp the wp of b ns increased by 51 4 107 0 compared to the three f treatments i e f n0 f ns and f nu 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency as shown in the analysis of table 3 the different soil preparation and mulching practices in combination with the different urea applications and their interaction effects had highly significant effects p 0 01 on nitrogen use efficiency the nae npe nre and npfp were higher in ns than in nu over the three years with increases of 27 5 49 0 8 2 14 6 16 6 31 1 and 5 6 8 6 respectively the b treatment maximized the nitrogen use efficiency of ns the nae npe nre and npfp of b ns from 2016 to 2019 were 12 1 8 0 kg kg 1 39 1 42 4 kg kg 1 30 9 35 2 and 47 2 54 6 kg kg 1 respectively which were 116 1 123 3 28 5 34 8 66 1 71 9 and 44 1 53 2 higher than f nu which had the lowest nitrogen use efficiency respectively 3 6 correlations between variables as shown in fig 4 wp nae npe nre and npfp were all significantly correlated with grain yield positive correlation coefficient 0 63 1 0 from 2016 to 2019 water and nitrogen had a significant coupling effect with all four nitrogen use efficiencies increasing significantly with increasing wp positive correlation coefficient 0 67 0 97 according to the results of the correlation matrix analysis between soil water storage and crop water use sws1 was significantly correlated with sws2 positive correlation coefficient 0 52 0 69 i e the soil water status of germination tillering directly influenced the soil water status of stem elongation ripening it was found that etc act was significantly correlated with wp in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 negative correlation coefficient 0 50 0 61 and therefore taking effective measures e g applying the rfp system to reduce etc act would significantly improve their wp 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage dynamics evapotranspiration and wp the rfp system decreased etc act but improved sws and wp especially with treatment b which was consistent with the results of previous studies gao et al 2019 ren et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 the etc act is mainly composed of p and δw and the rfp system significantly increased p etc act and decreased δw etc act specifically precipitation was the primary factor influencing the soil moisture status during crop growth qin et al 2018 and the rfp system increased soil moisture input via the rain collection effect of the furrows and improved the use of precipitation yin et al 2019 although the rfp system promoted crop growth and increased plant transpiration ineffective soil evaporation could be further reduced by covering the ridges with plastic mulch thus reducing δw fu et al 2021 li et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 the pronounced weed control effect of black plastic mulch can reduce soil water consumption by weeds compared to white plastic mulch anikwe et al 2007 ricotta and masiunas 1991 further reducing δw and increasing sws and wp the conclusions of some researchers regarding the etc act differed from the above discussion q liu et al 2016 showed that treatments with black or white plastic mulch increased etc act compared to controls without mulch but the differences between treatments were not significant fang et al 2021 showed that the etc act of the mulching treatment was significantly lower than the etc act of the flat cropping in the period of 2013 2015 while the etc act of the mulching treatment was significantly greater than the etc act of the flat cropping during 2015 2016 the reason for the different results may be related to the precipitation during the growing period of the crop when the precipitation was relatively high mulching treatments could effectively utilize the precipitation thus reducing δw and resulting in a lower etc act in contrast when the precipitation was relatively low mulching treatments could utilize deeper soil water which increased δw resulting in a higher etc act fang et al 2021 bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 low wp can be found even under good soil preparation and mulching practices which can be due to low nutrient supplies especially nitrogen li et al 2015 studies have shown that a 10 0 40 0 reduction in the application rate of slow release urea can produce essentially the same yield as a normal urea application yin et al 2017 2018 under certain conditions applying slow release urea is therefore equivalent to increasing the amount of ordinary urea under the same nitrogen application zheng et al 2016 soil water consumption increased with the increase in nitrogen application within a certain range of nitrogen application gu et al 2018b li et al 2015 we found that n0 had the lowest etc act and wp and the highest sws in the same soil preparation and mulching practice while ns had the opposite slow release urea will ensure a nitrogen supply during the growth period of a crop yin et al 2017 coordinate the nutrient uptake and distribution in all organs of a crop guo et al 2017 promote nutritional and reproductive growth and ultimately improve the etc act and wp 4 2 grain yield and its components the three main factors that determine the grain yield of winter wheat are the effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight osman and mahmoud 1981 effective spikes per unit area is the factor that has the earliest impact on yield composition j zhao et al 2020 showed that mulching increased the effective spikes per unit area compared to no mulching this is because plastic mulch can effectively increase the topsoil temperature in the early stages of crop growth white plastic mulch has better transparency and can capture more solar heat than black plastic mulch increase the available soil moisture accelerate crop emergence and development promote tillering and root development and enhance nutrient and water uptake dong et al 2014 q liu et al 2016 in the rfp system water consumption from germination to tillering in winter wheat is lower relative to the other growth stages and is influenced by soil temperature to a greater extent the higher soil temperature in w than in b promoted tillering more effectively during the germination to tillering growth stages the number of tillers in each treatment reached a peak when stem elongation began mahmoud and osman 1981 due to the transfer of nutrients and growth centers weak tillers gradually stopped growing and died because of insufficient nutrition white 2007 the supply of urea plays an important role in the normal growth of tillers and increases the effective spikes per unit area gautam et al 2017 qiao et al 2011 it should be noted that in the f treatment there was no significant difference in the effective spikes per unit area between nu and ns according to the plastic mulch studies referred to above this is because the tiller capacity of f was significantly lower than that of the rfp system and the competition for resource utilization between tillers was lower although the fertilizer efficiency in the early stage of ns was lower than in nu it could still meet the normal growth of tillers resulting in there being little difference in the effective spikes per unit area between the two urea types however in the rfp system the competition for resource utilization between tillers became greater resulting in amplified differences between ns and nu when there was relatively more precipitation in the early stage of winter wheat growth the rfp system could make up for the shortcomings of insufficient fertility in the early stage of slow release urea grant et al 2012 waddell et al 1999 to ensure the normal growth of tillers in w ns and a high spike rate was obtained in contrast when there was relatively little precipitation in the early stage of winter wheat growth w nu had a higher spike rate because ordinary urea could be rapidly dissolved thus ensuring fertility in the early stage yin et al 2017 q liu et al 2016 found a significant coupling effect between the use of black mulch and application of slow release urea on maize yield which significantly increased grain yield the b ns treatment also provided the maximum grain yield in winter wheat in our experiment which was due to the excellent coordination between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight j zhao et al 2020 showed that fewer tillers would result in fewer effective spikes per unit area reducing grain yield while too many tillers would reduce wp increase competition for resource use and induce collapse also reducing grain yield in our experiment although the effective spikes per unit area of w were higher than those of b this could lead to more competitive resource utilization the growth process of winter wheat is a process of material production via the photosynthesis of green leaves gregory et al 1981 organic matter formed by photosynthesis accounts for about 95 0 of the total dry matter accumulated by plant growth while mineral elements account for only about 5 0 therefore the amount of organic matter formed by photosynthesis directly determines the grain yield b zhao et al 2020 winter wheat photosynthesis is especially dependent on soil moisture conditions fertilizer supply and leaf functions ali et al 2018 keys et al 1977 zhang et al 2017 studies have shown that plastic mulch increases the reflectivity of solar radiation and the resistance of air to water vapor exchange while reducing water loss from the soil thereby increasing leaf area and improving the photosynthetic capacity of crops hu et al 2020 nitrogen is the major limiting factor for crop growth and development in the same soil preparation and mulching practice li et al 2013a ji et al 2007 showed that slow release urea can increase photosynthesis rates and ultimately increase the grain yield of rice zvomuya et al 2003 showed that the application of slow release urea increased the potato yield by 12 0 19 0 compared to the application of regular urea although the fertility of ns was lower than that of nu in the early stage the growth of winter wheat under the ns treatment could catch up or even surpass that of nu due to the continuous supply of nitrogen in the later stage which was consistent with the findings of kim et al 2017 4 3 nitrogen use efficiency overfertilization and low fertilizer utilization are common in rain fed agricultural areas chen et al 2014 the rate of nitrogen release from ordinary urea is faster than the rate of nitrogen uptake by crops and there is an imbalance between nitrogen supply and demand which is the main reason for low nitrogen use efficiency nosengo 2003 many studies have found that the application of slow release urea could be effective in increasing nitrogen use efficiency díez et al 1994 q liu et al 2016 song et al 2014 rational soil preparation and mulching practices may also improve nitrogen use efficiency for example covering agricultural fields with plastic mulch can reduce soil erosion and nitrogen leaching while increasing fertilizer use efficiency by improving soil moisture conditions to promote nitrogen uptake and utilization by plants guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 in contrast in a study of grain yield wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat li et al 2016 showed that compared with flat cropping a ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching increased the grain yield and wp of winter wheat but the nitrogen fertilizer productivity nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen harvest index did not change significantly our experiment combined the advantages of the rfp system and slow release urea in improving nitrogen use efficiency showing a significant coupling effect especially with the b ns treatment winter wheat grew vigorously and had a strong ability to absorb water and fertilizer after the stem elongation period began grava and raisanen 1978 liang et al 2019 in addition to directly limiting crop growth water deficiency could also indirectly inhibit crop growth by reducing the effectiveness of soil nutrients the soil preparation and mulching practices of the b treatment maximized soil moisture through the rain collection effect of the rfp system and the characteristics of black plastic mulch which improved the effectiveness of soil nitrogen and promoted the uptake of nitrogen by winter wheat roots liu et al 2015 at the same time ns enabled the crop to receive nitrogen from the fertilizer over a long period of time by slowly releasing the nitrogen from the coated fertilizer all of which facilitated smooth crop reproductive growth and significantly increased nitrogen accumulation in plants and grains at ripening improving the nitrogen use efficiency sun et al 2019 geng et al 2015 ye et al 2013 5 conclusions the b ns rfp system with black plastic mulch over the ridge in combination with slow release urea maximized the coupling effect of the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfp system and slow release urea ns to a certain extent this compensated for the fertility deficiency in the early stage of ns synergistically improved the wp and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat and coordinated the relationship between effective spikes per unit area grains per spike and 1000 grain weight leading to the most obvious grain yield increase among the various treatments in contrast the ns treatment did not lead to any significant differences compared with the ordinary urea nu treatment in flat cropping without mulch f while ns also increased economic inputs in conclusion b ns can be considered a more stable measure for increasing cereal grain yield in semi humid and drought prone areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
