19815,a comparative analysis of five different structures of sulfate reduction sr models for anaerobic digestion ad was conducted to evaluate their accuracy to provide model developers and users with better information to decide on the optimum degree of complexity the models evaluated differ in terms of the number type of sulfate reducing bacterial activities considered based on the electron donors used a systematic calibration of the evaluated models against a large set of experimental data was also conducted using a very recent parameter calibration method results indicate that a simple model incorporating both acetate utilizing and hydrogen utilizing sulfate reducing bacterial activities the mah model achieves a good balance between performance and complexity in terms of prediction

for the treatment of waste and wastewater ad is a microbial catalyzed process involving the breakdown and fermentation of organic matter in absence of oxygen ad is a very efficient technology that has been successfully implemented at large scale to utilize a wide variety of substrates mainly for waste treatment and or biomethane generation for energy recovery in the case of sulfate containing wastes wastewaters ad in presence of such wastes could be beneficial or problematic depending on the application under anaerobic conditions the presence of sulfates and organic matter will lead to the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria barrera et al 2013 in the sulfate reduction sr microbial process sulfate is used as the terminal electron acceptor resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulfide h2s as the main product sulfate reducing bacteria srb can utilize a wide variety of substrates as electron donors like h2 ethanol formate lactate pyruvate succinate short and long chain fatty acids and some aromatic compounds muyzer and stams 2008 since several of these substrates are intermediates in the ad process competition takes place between srb and other microbial groups in an anaerobic digester at the acidogenic acetogenic and methanogenic levels fedorovich et al 2003 on one hand ad of sulfate containing wastes can provide a number of benefits applications drury 2000 knobel and lewis 2002 muyzer and stams 2008 van den brand et al 2015 including the additional sulfide alkalinity to the ad process that helps in ph neutralization heavy metals removal as metal sulfide precipitates and enhanced pathogens removal on the other hand ad of sulfate contaminated wastes is problematic as the h2s generated is malodorous corrosive to equipment materials highly toxic to humans and animals and inhibitory to the ad microbial population including srb themselves barrera et al 2013 for bioenergy recovery purposes sr in the anaerobic digester is of great concern as it results in lower methane yields and poor biogas quality due to the presence of the corrosive h2s the biogas in this case thereby requires pre treatment before processing in energy conversion systems barrera et al 2013 muyzer and stams 2008 for a feasible implementation of ad under sr conditions a prior understanding of the process dynamics is essential modelling is nowadays an essential tool that can help in analyzing such systems conducting feasibility studies and efficiently implementing the process to achieve this it is essential for the models to have the adequate level of complexity that could provide a useful representation of the system at an affordable effort several models have been developed to describe sr processes in ad systems reported in a number of studies barrera et al 2015 d acunto et al 2011 fedorovich et al 2003 fomichev and vavilin 1997 frunzo et al 2012 harerimana et al 2013 kalyuzhnyi et al 1998 kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1997 1998 knobel and lewis 2002 lin 2001 poinapen and ekama 2010a 2010b ristow and hansford 2001 martin ruel et al 2002 van wageningen et al 2006 vavilin et al 1995 in these studies either through standalone models or by incorporating sr in existing ad models the sr process description typically entails microbial kinetics for srb groups generally via dual term monod kinetics inhibition due to the unionized form of h2s ionic speciation of sulfate and h2s and liquid to gas mass transfer of h2s different types of srb activities can co exist depending on the substrates being consumed there have been a variety of approaches among the sr modelling studies with respect to the substrates considered for srb growth table 1 as a result differences are observed among the modelling studies for the number and type of srb activities considered table 1 one of the obvious reasons for observing such differences is the influent composition or concentration used during experimental validation studies however except for a few studies such as kalyuzhnyi et al 1998 and poinapen and ekama 2010b in most of the existing studies on sr modelling hardly any justification has been provided on the selected number type of srb activities incorporated in the models looking at table 1 it is observed that acetate utilizing and hydrogen utilizing srbs asrb and hsrb respectively have been the most commonly incorporated srb activities this appears as adequate considering that acetate and hydrogen are the final intermediates before methanogenesis and that under stable ad operation fermentation reactions are rapid and any volatile fatty acid intermediates would quickly be converted to acetate and hydrogen besides other final intermediates therefore asrb and hsrb activities would typically occur in such scenario with regard to the selection of the most adequate number type of srb activities in an sr model a review paper by batstone 2006 suggested that at low influent sulfate levels hsrb would be the dominant activity and should be the only sr activity considered at high influent sulfate levels however volatile fatty acid consuming srb activities could be significant and may therefore require their incorporation in the models as well batstone 2006 however these suggestions were supported only with a theoretical analysis but not validated with experimental data hence the challenge remains during model development when deciding on the optimum number of srb activities to consider as trade off exists between level of accuracy and complexity of the model structure affected by incorporation of one or more srb activities this work hence aims at evaluating candidate sr model structures of different complexities to assess the most adequate level of model complexity that achieves reliable model prediction in ad with sr the different sr models analyzed differ from each other in terms of the type number of srb activities considered according to the electron donors they consume following full parameter calibration the predictions of each model are compared with one another as well as against a case study experimental data set from literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 model extensions to adm1 evaluated for sulfate reduction models of different complexities for the sr description have been implemented in order to assess their predictive capabilities against one another the basic structure of the models consists of the standard anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 developed by batstone et al 2002 to which sr model extensions of different complexities are incorporated in terms of the number and type of srb activities corresponding to the type of electron donors consumed considered the equations for the sr process model extensions have been adopted from the sr extended adm1 developed by barrera et al 2015 to describe a case study of anaerobic digestion of cane molasses vinasse with high cod and high sulfate feed the model equations related to sulfate reduction processes are provided in appendix a full details on the model equations can be found in barrera et al 2015 five models are evaluated in this study with complexities ranging from 4 down to only 1 srb activity as shown in table 2 the stoichiometry of sr catabolic reactions as incorporated in the models is shown in table 3 2 2 parameter estimation and calibration in general the adm1 model extension with sr involves a large biokinetic parameter set including for each microbial activity incorporated in the models table 2 biomass yields y biomass decay constants maximum specific uptake rates q e d m a x half saturation constants k s and inhibition constants k i reference parameter values for the conventional ad sub processes hydrolysis fermentation and methanogenesis were directly adopted from batstone et al 2002 with no modification with regard to the sr related biokinetic parameters particularly y q e d m a x k s for electron acceptor as well as the free h2s inhibition constants for srb as well as fermenters and methanogens a specific comprehensive parameter estimation and calibration methodology recently developed by ahmed and rodríguez 2017 was used that consists of two main parts the first part estimates a specific set of biokinetic parameters using mechanistic correlations such that the number of parameters left to be calibrated via optimization are significantly reduced the mechanistic correlations are based on thermodynamics and used primarily to estimate microbial growth yields heijnen 1999 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 mccarty 2007 as well as maximum specific uptake rates heijnen 1999 mccarty 1971 k s values for electron acceptor were estimated using steady state mass balance based concentration values in the second part the remaining parameters are calibrated with available experimental data according to a sensitivity based hierarchical and sequential single parameter optimization shsspo procedure as described in ahmed and rodríguez 2017 this shsspo calibration procedure decreases uncertainty and parameter identification problems typically faced during multi dimensional optimizations as it defines the sequence of single parameter optimizations based on a quantitative assessment of sensitivities and degree of interdependence of the parameters with each other across the selected process outputs the overall parameter estimation and calibration methodology was successfully applied and assessed by ahmed and rodríguez 2017 for an ad modelling with sr case moreover the shsspo method was demonstrated to yield superior performance than other existing multivariable optimization approaches in terms of total prediction error and computing time the process outputs considered for parameter calibration by shsspo optimizations are total sulfate s s o 4 hydrogen sulphide s h 2 s butyrate s b u propionate s p r o and acetate s a c effluent concentrations as well as the methane molar gas flow n c h 4 after full calibration the model predictions were compared with one another against the experimental data set of barrera et al 2014 complete details on the implemented calibration method can be found in ahmed and rodríguez 2017 all simulations and calibration were conducted using matlab 2015b a significant number of the sr biokinetic parameters could be estimated using correlations alone leaving the h2s inhibition parameters as the only ones requiring calibration for srb decay constants the values were assumed to be same as the adm1 reported values for all other microbial groups the k s values for electron donors utilized by corresponding srb groups were set equal accordingly to the constants for butyrate oxidation propionate oxidation aceticlastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis reported in adm1 this consideration is based on the premise that the affinity for a given electron donor may be similar amongst the srb and fermenters methanogens that consume this same electron donor 2 3 model simulation case scenario and conditions an experimental system and data set from literature was used as a case scenario in order to evaluate the different complexity models table 2 the five models were calibrated and simulated against data by barrera et al 2014 where the experimental system consisted of a 3 5 l upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digester uasb treating cod and sulfate rich sugar cane vinasse feed in the experiment by barrera et al 2014 a mesophilic reactor 35 c with 47 4 gvss l inoculum was operated at a constant hydraulic retention time 4 86 days and tested under different influent sulfate to influent cod ratios over time 0 05 0 2 kgso4 2 kgcod the organic and sulfate loading rates olr and slr respectively applied throughout the duration of the experiment are shown in fig 1 a full details on the experimental system can be found in barrera et al 2014 the characterization of the vinasse feed into adm1 sr model compatible inputs was conducted following the approach described in barrera et al 2015 in the experimental study of barrera et al 2014 the acidic vinasse feed was neutralized by using the uasb reactor recycle stream as the buffer for accurate ph calculation knowledge of the additional buffering quantity and characteristics would be necessary but this information was not available hence the dynamic ph profile reported fig 1b was provided as model input instead of prediction via model as the information was insufficient otherwise this is acceptable since ph is a widely available measurement whose prediction on the other hand is difficult in absence of a detailed characterization of the medium the solids retention time srt of the experimental system of barrera et al 2014 was not reported and therefore a constant srt value had to be assumed the initial values of the state variables liquid concentrations biomass concentrations and partial pressures of gas species required to solve the dynamic model equations were set equal to the experimental effluent variables at the initial times the initial biomass concentrations were estimated based on the reported methanogenic and sulfidogenic activities of the inoculum in the study of barrera et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibrated parameter sets for sr models of different complexity the biokinetic parameter calibration procedure of ahmed and rodríguez 2017 as briefly described in section 2 2 was applied to the five ad with sr models under evaluation to fit the experimental data of the case study as described in section 2 3 many of the biokinetic parameters could be estimated by mechanistic correlations and the values obtained common for all models evaluated are presented in table 4 only the free h2s inhibition constants required direct calibration via optimization to the experimental data following the shsspo method the optimum parameter values obtained are presented in table 5 for each of the ad with sr models evaluated and these calibrated parameters together with those in table 4 correspond to the best fit of each of the models to the experimental data table 5 also provides a comparison of the calibrated parameters with the values reported in several literature sources for ad with sr models it is worth noting that interpretation of values across literature must be done considering the different inhibition functions reported by different authors literature hardly provides specific justification on the use of a particular inhibition function as these are generally empirical 3 2 complexity and prediction error in ad models with sr upon complete calibration of the different complexity ad with sr models the errors for each model as normalized sum of squared errors sses between model predictions and experimental data were calculated across the complete simulation period the results are shown in fig 2 in which the total errors by summation of all the individual normalized sses for each process output are indicated amongst the five model structures evaluated the model considering only h2 utilizing srb hsrb mh can be considered inadequate for all applications as it fails in describing the system with total errors an order of magnitude larger than that of any of the other four models the models considering four three and two srb activities mall mpah and mah respectively obtain the least total errors while the total error for the model using only acetate utilizing srb asrb appears significantly higher than the more complex models these results indicate that the utilization of single srb activity particularly the case of incorporating hsrb alone is inadequate and sr activities based on at least two electron donors are required for acceptable process description these results are in agreement with those by batstone 2006 who demonstrated through a theoretical steady state profile of h2s gas composition vs influent sulfate to cod ratio how the use of only hydrogen based srb activity in the model led to larger prediction deviations relative to the cases when additional srb activities are used in particular the deviations reported were larger as the influent ratios increased beyond 0 05 gso4 gcod the influent ratios for the experimental system of barrera et al 2014 used in the current study were higher than 0 05 gso4 gcod during most of the experiment a detailed comparison of the performance of all models under evaluation against the experimental data is shown in fig 3 dynamic model predictions of each model for the outputs of interest are presented together with the experimental data by barrera et al 2014 the mh model clearly fails at predicting all the outputs of interest sulfate removal in particular as expected from the total sse errors in fig 2 and is of no use in case of all the other models mall mpah mah and ma the prediction of sulfur species fig 3e h is comparable overall this can also be attributed to the similar free h2s inhibition constants calibrated for the srb activities across the tested models table 5 when comparing model predictions of effluent acetate concentration against experimental values fig 3c neither of the models shows a good prediction the sses for acetate for the mall mpah mah and ma are similar fig 2 this indicates that getting a good fit for acetate with free h2s inhibition constants alone would not be sufficient and the reason for discrepancy is most likely due to the use of benchmark adm1 parameters that might not be optimal for the current experiment the relatively simpler mah model competes reasonably well with the more complex models mall mpah when comparing with experimental data the simplest ma model falls short mainly on the propionate prediction performance fig 3b and consequently has higher total errors when compared to the more complex ones fig 2 overall the comparable performance of the mah relative to more complex models figs 2 3 supports the consideration of asrb and hsrb as the main activities driving the sulfate reduction process hence for the current case scenario implementing sr model with incorporation of asrb and hsrb alone provides a good compromise on the sufficient level of model structure complexity however there can be scenarios in which additional quantitative analysis might be needed cases in which influent sulfate cod ratios differ significantly from the range of values considered in this study may require for the types number of srb activities to be reconsidered also cases exhibiting significant accumulation of other vfas e g butyrate propionate etc may require more srb activities to be incorporated in the sr model e g mpah mall although the results in this work indicate the most adequate model complexity was mah even with propionate accumulation occurring the relative impact of sr on vfa prediction depends on the sulfate cod ratio therefore both elements sulfate cod ratio and vfa accumulation should be taken into consideration when deciding on the best model complexity 4 conclusion a set of recommended optimum parameters for five candidate sr model extensions of different complexity to the adm1 has been obtained after a parameter calibration against an experimental highly dynamic data set of ad treatment of sulfate rich influent the simulations indicate that an adm1 model extension for sr considering only hydrogen as electron donor is not applicable in any case while considering only acetate provides also a poor prediction modelling sr with consideration of both acetate and hydrogen as the two electron donors for srb appears as a good compromise option this is based on not only a good model prediction capacity but also on the marginal improvements obtained when considering more complex models with three and four namely hydrogen acetate propionate and butyrate electron donors all together based on these results modelling sr in ad considering only hydrogen and acetate as electron donors for srb activities is recommended by default the incorporation of additional srb activities in the model appears as justified only under scenarios in which influent sulfate cod ratio differs significantly from the ranges of this study and or if significant vfas accumulation takes place in these cases additional quantitative evaluations may be required to establish the most appropriate level of complexity

influent sulfate to influent cod ratios over time 0 05 0 2 kgso4 2 kgcod the organic and sulfate loading rates olr and slr respectively applied throughout the duration of the experiment are shown in fig 1 a full details on the experimental system can be found in barrera et al 2014 the characterization of the vinasse feed into adm1 sr model compatible inputs was conducted following the approach described in barrera et al 2015 in the experimental study of barrera et al 2014 the acidic vinasse feed was neutralized by using the uasb reactor recycle stream as the buffer for accurate ph calculation knowledge of the additional buffering quantity and characteristics would be necessary but this information was not available hence the dynamic ph profile reported fig 1b was provided as model input instead of prediction via model as the information was insufficient otherwise this is acceptable since ph is a widely available measurement whose prediction on the other hand is difficult in absence of a detailed characterization of the medium the solids retention time srt of the experimental system of barrera et al 2014 was not reported and therefore a constant srt value had to be assumed the initial values of the state variables liquid concentrations biomass concentrations and partial pressures of gas species required to solve the dynamic model equations were set equal to the experimental effluent variables at the initial times the initial biomass concentrations were estimated based on the reported methanogenic and sulfidogenic activities of the inoculum in the study of barrera et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibrated parameter sets for sr models of different complexity the biokinetic parameter calibration procedure of ahmed and rodríguez 2017 as briefly described in section 2 2 was applied to the five ad with sr models under evaluation to fit the experimental data of the case study as described in section 2 3 many of the biokinetic parameters could be estimated by mechanistic correlations and the values obtained common for all models evaluated are presented in table 4 only the free h2s inhibition constants required direct calibration via optimization to the experimental data following the shsspo method the optimum parameter values obtained are presented in table 5 for each of the ad with sr models evaluated and these calibrated parameters together with those in table 4 correspond to the best fit of each of the models to the experimental data table 5 also provides a comparison of the calibrated parameters with the values reported in several literature sources for ad with sr models it is worth noting that interpretation of values across literature must be done considering the different inhibition functions reported by different authors literature hardly provides specific justification on the use of a particular inhibition function as these are generally empirical 3 2 complexity and prediction error in ad models with sr upon complete calibration of the different complexity ad with sr models the errors for each model as normalized sum of squared errors sses between model predictions and experimental data were calculated across the complete simulation period the results are shown in fig 2 in which the total errors by summation of all the individual normalized sses for each process output are indicated amongst the five model structures evaluated the model considering only h2 utilizing srb hsrb mh can be considered inadequate for all applications as it fails in describing the system with total errors an order of magnitude larger than that of any of the other four models the models considering four three and two srb activities mall mpah and mah respectively obtain the least total errors while the total error for the model using only acetate utilizing srb asrb appears significantly higher than the more complex models these results indicate that the utilization of single srb activity particularly the case of incorporating hsrb alone is inadequate and sr activities based on at least two electron donors are required for acceptable process description these results are in agreement with those by batstone 2006 who demonstrated through a theoretical steady state profile of h2s gas composition vs influent sulfate to cod ratio how the use of only hydrogen based srb activity in the model led to larger prediction deviations relative to the cases when additional srb activities are used in particular the deviations reported were larger as the influent ratios increased beyond 0 05 gso4 gcod the influent ratios for the experimental system of barrera et al 2014 used in the current study were higher than 0 05 gso4 gcod during most of the experiment a detailed comparison of the performance of all models under evaluation against the experimental data is shown in fig 3 dynamic model predictions of each model for the outputs of interest are presented together with the experimental data by barrera et al 2014 the mh model clearly fails at predicting all the outputs of interest sulfate removal in particular as expected from the total sse errors in fig 2 and is of no use in case of all the other models mall mpah mah and ma the prediction of sulfur species fig 3e h is comparable overall this can also be attributed to the similar free h2s inhibition constants calibrated for the srb activities across the tested models table 5 when comparing model predictions of effluent acetate concentration against experimental values fig 3c neither of the models shows a good prediction the sses for acetate for the mall mpah mah and ma are similar fig 2 this indicates that getting a good fit for acetate with free h2s inhibition constants alone would not be sufficient and the reason for discrepancy is most likely due to the use of benchmark adm1 parameters that might not be optimal for the current experiment the relatively simpler mah model competes reasonably well with the more complex models mall mpah when comparing with experimental data the simplest ma model falls short mainly on the propionate prediction performance fig 3b and consequently has higher total errors when compared to the more complex ones fig 2 overall the comparable performance of the mah relative to more complex models figs 2 3 supports the consideration of asrb and hsrb as the main activities driving the sulfate reduction process hence for the current case scenario implementing sr model with incorporation of asrb and hsrb alone provides a good compromise on the sufficient level of model structure complexity however there can be scenarios in which additional quantitative analysis might be needed cases in which influent sulfate cod ratios differ significantly from the range of values considered in this study may require for the types number of srb activities to be reconsidered also cases exhibiting significant accumulation of other vfas e g butyrate propionate etc may require more srb activities to be incorporated in the sr model e g mpah mall although the results in this work indicate the most adequate model complexity was mah even with propionate accumulation occurring the relative impact of sr on vfa prediction depends on the sulfate cod ratio therefore both elements sulfate cod ratio and vfa accumulation should be taken into consideration when deciding on the best model complexity 4 conclusion a set of recommended optimum parameters for five candidate sr model extensions of different complexity to the adm1 has been obtained after a parameter calibration against an experimental highly dynamic data set of ad treatment of sulfate rich influent the simulations indicate that an adm1 model extension for sr considering only hydrogen as electron donor is not applicable in any case while considering only acetate provides also a poor prediction modelling sr with consideration of both acetate and hydrogen as the two electron donors for srb appears as a good compromise option this is based on not only a good model prediction capacity but also on the marginal improvements obtained when considering more complex models with three and four namely hydrogen acetate propionate and butyrate electron donors all together based on these results modelling sr in ad considering only hydrogen and acetate as electron donors for srb activities is recommended by default the incorporation of additional srb activities in the model appears as justified only under scenarios in which influent sulfate cod ratio differs significantly from the ranges of this study and or if significant vfas accumulation takes place in these cases additional quantitative evaluations may be required to establish the most appropriate level of complexity

19816,chromium cr isotope fractionation analysis is a promising tool for monitoring cr vi reduction in natural aqueous systems in addition large amounts of ch4 in natural aqueous sediments are oxidized to co2 through methanotrophs thereby mitigating emissions to the atmosphere however the investigations on the cr vi reduction process with methanotrophs and the associated cr isotope fractionation patterns are scarce in this study we have shown that cr vi reduction can occur in the presence of ch4 as the sole electron donor in a hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr after direct bacteria enrichment from sediment samples products of the methane oxidation by the methanotrophs are used by microbes to reduce cr vi as shown by the progressive increase in δ 53cr with time in the ch4 feed reactor the isotope fractionation factor ε of 2 62 0 20 was obtained from the application of the rayleigh distillation model the results of cr isotope fractionation analysis also explained the decrease of cr vi concentration in the n2 feed reactor where the δ 53cr values remained steady in the first two weeks but significantly increased in the last two weeks indicating that physical adsorption and subsequent cr vi reduction occurred this study extended the application of cr isotope fractionation showing the suitability of this method for clarifying different cr vi removal processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords cr vi reduction chromium isotope fractionation methane oxidation hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr process analysis 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi is widely used in various industrial processes including dyeing tannery and electroplating blowes 2002 the discharge of these industrial effluents can cause anthropogenic contamination with cr of soils groundwater and surface water fruchter 2002 reportedly cr vi is nearly 10 100 times more toxic than cr iii katz and salem 1993 in nature cr iii is present in insoluble forms adsorbed on solid surfaces or bound in the microbial biomass james and bartlett 1983 whereas mainly soluble and mobile forms of cr vi are available in the environment xia et al 2000 thus the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is an effective method for remediation of cr contamination chromium isotope fractionation analysis is a valuable tool for the assessment of the extent of cr vi reduction in polluted aquifers berna et al 2010 economou eliopoulos et al 2014 novak et al 2014 qin and wang 2017 most physical processes including physical sorption volatilization and diffusion do not cause significant fractionation of cr isotopes ellis et al 2004 but cr vi reduction is often associated with an isotope fractionation during the reduction of cr vi lighter isotopes preferentially react and are enriched in the product while heavier isotopes are enriched in the remaining reactant ellis et al 2002 the reduction process can be microbially mediated or can proceed inorganically in the presence of dissolved fe ii fe ii minerals h2s no2 dissolved organic carbon doc or other reductive agents han et al 2010 novak et al 2014 it is noteworthy that the magnitude of cr fractionation can be expressed by the isotope fractionation factor ε and can be determined in laboratory experiments considerable variability of the isotope fractionation factor has been found in previous studies on microbial cr vi reduction basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 importantly lactate acetate and formate have been predominantly used as electron donors in previous studies however the association between the levels of oxidation of methane ch4 which is the simplest organic compound in natural aqueous sediments and microbial cr vi reduction has not yet been completely elucidated ch4 is an important greenhouse gas with a greenhouse effect per mol that is approximately 25 times more powerful than that of co2 rodhe 1990 sediments in natural wetlands rivers and lakes are the main reservoirs of methane in the environment in the anaerobic layer of sediments organic matter is used by methanogens to produce ch4 kits et al 2015 along with diffusing upward from deep sites of sediments large amounts of ch4 disappear due to anaerobic oxidation of methane aom process in the anoxic layer cui et al 2015 subsequently aerobic oxidation of methane occurs at oxic anoxic interfaces where ch4 and o2 are available he et al 2015 as a result ch4 is oxidized anaerobically or aerobically to co2 and reducing the emission of ch4 to the atmosphere therefore methane oxidation plays an important role in mitigating the greenhouse effect the microbial redox processes involving methane are usually slow in natural environments beal et al 2009 haroon et al 2013 which hinders our efforts to understand the mechanisms of methane oxidation processes gas diffusion membranes in the hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr offer a solution for the efficient utilization of methane with this approach ch4 can diffuse through the membrane walls and be directly delivered to the ch4 oxidizing microbes increasing their methane oxidation activity ding et al 2017 shi et al 2013 therefore the use of this method allows investigations of some slow methane oxidation processes cr vi reduction was recently reported to be associated with methane oxidation al hasin et al 2010 lai et al 2016 lu et al 2016 but the cr isotope fractionation process during this process has never been studied physical processes which reduce the amount of available cr vi can mask the processes responsible for biological and chemical cr vi reduction cr isotope fractionation can be an effective method for the distinction of different cr vi removal processes moreover cr isotope analysis provides a potential method for the determination of the extent of cr vi reduction by measuring the shift in the value of the 53cr 52cr ratio in the product during the reaction process previous studies of cr isotope fractionation in the flow through reactors were focused on abiotic cr vi reduction jamieson hanes et al 2012 2014 whereas the cr isotope fractionation process involved in biological processes has been rarely reported on the other hand cr isotope fractionation during microbial cr vi reduction only has been studied under pure culture conditions in serum bottles basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 nevertheless the extent of cr isotope fractionation in mixed communities in the flow through reactors are still unclear moreover laboratories working on cr isotope fractionation usually focus on a single process such as cr adsorption reduction or oxidation ellis et al 2004 kitchen et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 wang et al 2015 in this study we used lake sediments as inoculum and enriched them with methane in an hfmbr system then we investigated the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation during the cr vi removal under ch4 and n2 feed conditions our aims were 1 to enrich the cr vi reducing microorganisms with methane as the sole electron donor and 2 to identify and quantify cr vi reduction in complex reactor systems using cr isotope analysis to the best of our knowledge this is the first account of the study of cr isotope fractionation in a methane based hfmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration two identical hfmbrs fig 1 were set up for the study the reactors were modified by using a one end sealed hollow fiber degassing membrane module puresea spring beijing china propene polymer with a size of the pores of 0 05 0 1 μm was utilized as a membrane material the total volume of each reactor was 380 ml including 60 ml of hollow fiber materials thus the working volume of each reactor system was 320 ml the interior of the hollow fibers was connected to a feed gas ch4 or n2 cylinder through the open pore on the bottom of the reactor and the pressure was kept at 0 01 mpa a ph probe was attached to the membrane module to monitor ph changes an external pump javtop fujian china was used to recirculate the liquid at 300 ml min 2 2 startup and sequential batch operation surface sediment from chaohu lake n31 6893 e117 3899 was collected and used as inoculum before use the sediment was washed three times with the mineral medium and the detailed compositions of the mineral medium were presented in the supporting information a mixture of 30 ml of the washed sediment and 290 ml of mineral medium was injected into each reactor the temperature in the reactors was maintained at 35 2 c by a water bath the ph was controlled and maintained at 7 5 0 3 by addition of 1m hcl naoh a concentrated solution of potassium dichromate 30 mg cr ml was added into the reactors to reach an initial cr vi concentration of around 10 mg cr l after cr vi was exhausted or the reactors were operated for 1 2 months the used mineral medium in the reactor was entirely replaced with fresh mineral medium resulting a hydraulic retention time of 5 38 days in ch4 feed reactor and 9 57 days in n2 feed reactor before replacing the media the circulation was stopped and the reactor was stood overnight to avoid the microorganisms washing out trace amounts of oxygen leaked into the reactors from outside air instead of aeration resulting in invariably detectable dissolved o2 in the liquid 2 3 chemical analyses a sample of 1 ml of the liquid was collected and filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane the concentration of cr vi was determined by the diphenyl carbazide method with a uv vis spectrophotometer model sp 752 shanghai spectrum instrument co ltd shanghai pr china association and association 1998 before sampling dissolved o2 was measured with a dissolved oxygen probe hach model hq30d loveland usa in the reactor and the concentrations were 0 05 mg l 2 4 cr isotope analysis cr purification was performed in the clean laboratory 1000 grade at the cas key laboratory of crust mantle materials and environments school of earth and space sciences university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china chemical separation of cr was achieved by a two step chromatography procedure which has been detailed by han et al 2012 after purification cr isotope analyses were conducted using a neptune plus multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany polyatomic interferences such as those of 40ar14n or 40ar16o were resolved using the middle to high mass resolution mode the double spike allows the correction of the instrumental mass bias and the mass dependent isotope fractionation during cr purification a detailed description of the cr isotope measurement was reported by shen et al 2015 data were expressed using the δ notation in per mil units relative to the national institute of standards and technology nist standard reference material srm 979 1 δ 53 cr c 53 r c 52 r sample c 53 r c 52 r srm 979 1 1000 the long term precision was 0 06 2sd for δ 53cr of the spiked scp solution internal laboratory standard scp science on canada the isotope fractionation factor α was used to express the extent of fractionation between the product and the reactant which was defined as 2 α r p r o d u c t r r e a c t where r product and r reactant represent the isotope ratio of the product and the reactant respectively in a rayleigh model the δ 53cr values and the fraction of reduced cr vi can be related by the following equation 3 δ t δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 where δ 0 and δ t are the δ 53cr value of cr vi sample at the beginning and at given time intervals of the experiments respectively f is the fraction of cr vi reduction for convenience the α values are converted to units of per mil through the following equation 4 ε α 1 1000 2 5 biofilm morphology and characterization after over 500

institute beijing china following the protocols described by lu et al 2016 3 results 3 1 cr vi removal in the ch4 n2 feed reactors the rate of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors during long term operations are shown in fig 2 as can be seen from day 1 to day 40 of the experiments there were no obvious differences between the rates of cr vi removal in the two reactors the initial concentration of cr vi decreased by about 95 from its baseline value approximately 10 mg of cr l in both reactors after around 10 days in either the ch4 or n2 feed reactor the removal rate of cr vi in the ch4 feed reactor was stable from day 40 to day 102 further in the following 38 days from day 102 to day 140 a dramatic decline in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value approximately 10 mg cr l was observed on day 140 the entire liquid phase in the ch4 feed reactor was withdrawn and replaced with fresh mineral medium which promoted the restoration of the cr vi removal rate from day 140 to day 238 it took 8 10 days to cause a fall in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value of approximate 10 mg cr l from day 239 to day 456 the cr vi removal rate gradually declined and 15 30 days were needed to achieve a decrease in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value of approximately 10 mg cr l distinctly different from the situation in the ch4 feed reactor the cr vi removal rate in the n2 feed reactor continuously declined from day 40 to day 456 and for 30 days the cr vi concentration dropped by about 10 from the initial value of approximate 10 mg cr l in the latter stage of reaction 3 2 behavior of cr isotope in the ch4 n2 feed reactors to verify the differences between the processes of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactor from day 389 to day 424 day the samples in both reactors were subjected to cr isotope analysis by mc icp ms as can be seen in fig 2 95 of the cr vi was removed in the ch4 feed reactor from day 389 to day 424 whereas only 15 of the cr vi was removed in the n2 feed reactor the δ 53cr values obtained during these 35 days in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors are presented in fig 3 on day 389 the initial δ 53cr values were within the uncertainty in the two reactors 0 23 0 06 in the ch4 feed reactor and 0 14 0 06 in the n2 feed reactor in the ch4 feed reactor the reduction of cr vi caused an increase in δ 53cr values to 6 05 0 06 for 89 cr vi removal on day 424 by contrast in the n2 feed reactor no detectable fractionation of cr isotopes was observed for 10 cr vi removal from day 389 to day 403 and δ 53cr slightly increased to 0 55 0 06 for 5 cr vi removal from day 403 to day 424 the value of the cr isotope composition vs that of the fraction of cr vi reduction in the samples in both the ch4 and n2 feed reactors are shown in fig 4 and table s1 the calculated ε value of five samples for the period from day 389 to day 424 in the ch4 feed reactor was 2 62 0 20 furthermore we established that the ε value of three samples determined in the n2 feed reactor for the period from day 403 to day 424 was 5 9 2 9 3 3 contribution of ch4 towards cr vi reduction to further confirm the contribution of ch4 towards cr vi reduction in the ch4 feed reactor n2 was temporarily supplied from day 457 to day 479 fig 5 the rate of cr vi removal sharply declined during this period and the concentration only decreased by 4 3 in 22 days however the concentration decreased by 68 3 for the same time interval before this aforementioned period after ch4 supply was recovered the cr vi removal rate returned to its former level and was stable from day 483 to day 509 3 4 surface characteristics of the membrane and the fate of cr in the two reactors the morphological features of the fiber membrane surface after a period of incubation with microbes and cr vi of more than 500 days are illustrated in fig 6 as can be seen clearly visible biofilms with dark green precipitation accumulated around the fiber membranes fig 6a in the ch4 feed reactor microscopic investigations showed that precipitation of solids existed in microbial cells fig 6b and there were obvious cr signals in the edx spectra fig 6c in contrast the fiber membranes in the n2 feed reactor retained their original characteristics and were with relatively clean and smooth surfaces fig 6d further the microscopic investigations of sem eds showed clearly the formation of a biofilm with weak cr signals fig 6e and f the xps results of the biofilms attached to the file membrane in the ch4 feed reactor as well as the standard compounds for cr iii and cr vi are presented in fig s1 the obtained spectra indicated that cr iii was the main species of cr in the sample 3 5 microbial community structure in the two reactors in view of the difference in cr vi removal capacity between ch4 and n2 feed reactors the microbial community structures were investigated in both reactors and in the inoculum the observed number of species remained approximately the same as the sequences number reached 20 000 fig s2 which demonstrated that the sequencing depth was sufficient for precise analysis besides with the increase in sequencing depth the observed number of species in the ch4 feed reactor significantly decreased and was lower than the respective number in the n2 feed reactor and inoculum this finding verified also by the changes of the predominant microbes suggests that the microbial community structure in the ch4 feed reactor was more constant the main microbial representatives as determined by their relative 16s rrna gene abundance in the inoculum biofilms in n2 and ch4 feed reactors at the class level can be seen in fig s3 in the ch4 feed reactor the predominant classes were betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and saprospirae with relative abundances of 26 6 47 4 and 21 1 respectively the representatives of these three classes accounted for about 95 1 of all microbes established in the ch4 feed reactor but accounted for only around 24 0 of those in the inoculum and 15 8 of the ones available in the n2 feed reactor fig 7 illustrates the possible methane oxidation and cr vi reduction related microorganisms determined by their relative 16s rrna gene abundances in the inoculum and the n2 and ch4 feed reactor biofilms in the ch4 feed reactor the predominant cr vi reduction related microorganisms were of the genera agrobacterium meiothermus and acidovorax they dominated with 0 2 0 4 and 10 9 respectively of the whole microbial community however cr vi reduction related microorganisms were seldom detected in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor and their sum accounted for 0 1 and 0 4 correspondingly of their respective microbial community the predominant methane oxidation related microorganisms in the ch4 feed reactor were the genera methylibium methylosinus and methylotenera which dominated with 2 0 5 and 0 5 respectively of the whole microbial community representatives of genera methylibium and methylotenera were not detected in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor the representatives of genus of methylosinus accounted for 0 2 of the whole microbial community in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor 4 discussion 4 1 cr vi removal pathway in the ch4 n2 feed reactors in the first 40 days the patterns of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors were similar after that cr vi removal pathways presented in the two reactors gradually showed diversity according to the magnitude of cr vi removal when the supplies of ch4 and n2 were alternated it showed that the presence of ch4 was necessary for the reduction of cr vi fig 5 the original factors such as adsorption capacity reductive agents and organic pool present in the sediment fueled the initial biological or abiotic removal of cr vi han et al 2010 novak et al 2014 but as these got exhausted in the n2 feed reactor the rates of cr vi removal decreased in contrast substrates formed from the microbial transformation of ch4 in the ch4 feed reactor acted as a source of electrons for the cr vi reduction however in the n2 feed reactor there was constant removal of small amounts of cr vi during the whole period as shown in fig 2 cr isotope analysis was applied from day 389 424 to confirm the differences in cr vi removal between the ch4 and the n2 feed reactors the differences in cr isotope fractionation between the ch4 and n2 feed reactors indicated that cr was removed through different pathways in the ch4 feed reactor the enriched heavy cr isotopes in the remaining cr vi indicated preferential reduction of lighter isotopes of chromium this result illustrates that cr vi reduction was the most considerable in the ch4 feed reactor in comparison to any of the other ways for cr vi removal in this study we established that cr isotope fractionation followed a rayleigh distillation model in the ch4 feed reactor with the ε value of 2 62 0 20 the intrinsic cr isotope fractionation is caused by cro bond cleavage the cr fractionation factor measured previously by sikora et al 2008 was within the range of 4 to 4 5 at low donor concentrations 3 3 100 μm of lactate this observed isotope fractionation factor was the largest in the published data so far for microbial cr vi reduction therefore the magnitude of intrinsic kinetic isotope fractionation was at least 4 5 qin and wang 2017 sikora et al 2008 and the ε value in the ch4 feed reactor indicated that the magnitude of isotope fractionation was masked compared to the intrinsic isotope fractionation mass transfer limitation was probably responsible for the masking effect the mass transfer process in microbial cr vi reduction involve steps preceding the cro bond cleavage such as diffusion uptake of cr vi through the membrane transport of cr vi to the reactive sites of enzymes if such preceding processes become rate limiting the intrinsic cr isotope fractionation is masked as a result basu et al 2014 reported cr isotope fractionation factors for cr vi reduction by a metabolically diverse group of bacteria three of four bacteria induced overlapping isotopic fractionation ε 3 for g sulfurreducens p stutzeri dcp ps1 and d vulgaris these magnitudes of isotope fractionations were similar to the ε value we observed in the ch4 feed reactor indicating different bacteria species with diverse metabolic pathways may not change the extent of isotope fractionations han et al 2012 reported the ε value under aerobic conditions was 2 by pseudomonas stutzeri strain rch2 this ε value was similar to the ε value we obtained in the ch4 feed reactor where the aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were also detected however the ε value was 0 4 during cr vi reduction by pseudomonas stutzeri strain rch2 under anaerobic conditions this illustrates that the extent of cr isotope fractionation may be varied under different redox conditions in the n2 feed reactor the δ 53cr values were identical within analytical uncertainty from day 389 to day 403 of the cr vi removal process these results indicated that cr isotope fractionation was negligible associated with the decrease of cr vi concentration the lack of cr isotope fractionation probably implied the occurrence of physical adsorption instead of cr vi reduction ellis et al 2004 in the last half range of the cr vi removal process in the n2 feed reactor significantly increased δ 53cr values were obtained zink et al 2010 found that at ph values of 7 no cr isotope exchange was detected for weeks between soluble cr vi and cr iii therefore the cr isotope exchange between cr vi and cr iii in the last two weeks could be ruled out thus we concluded that the increase of δ 53cr values probably indicated the occurrence of cr vi reduction we consider three possible mechanisms for cr vi reduction firstly the sediment and mineral medium might be able to cause cr vi reduction however no detectable fractionation of cr isotopes in the first two weeks was observed indicating cr vi reduction by sediment and mineral medium could be ruled out secondly the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microbes had the ability to reduce cr vi harish et al 2012 janaki et al 2014 eps might accumulate as the n2 feed reactor progressed and cr vi reduction gradually occurred thirdly the dissolved organic matter produced by decomposition of dead microbial cells was used as a substrate by cr vi reducing bacteria such as those belonging to genera acidovorax and agrobacterium which were detected in the reactor cr vi reducing bacteria could use the dissolved organic matter as electron donor and reduce cr vi immediately but there was no cr vi reduction in the first half range of cr vi removal process thus microbial cr vi reduction process via cell lysis likely did not occur therefore cr vi removal in the n2 reactor in the last half range might be mainly caused by eps the fractionation factor in the last half range of cr vi removal process was 5 9 2 9 the uncertainties in ε value in the n2 feed reactor were relatively higher indicating that the isotope fractionation curves in the last half range of cr vi removal could not be closely fitted to the rayleigh distillation model it was probably because the decrease in cr vi concentration at this stage was due to both adsorption and reduction processes besides the ε value in the n2 feed reactor at this stage was probably larger than that in the ch4 feed reactor because of the comparable intrinsic isotope fractionation these results suggest that the masking effect caused by the mass transfer process in the n2 feed reactor was weaker than that in the ch4 feed reactor as mentioned before the cr isotope fractionation in the n2 feed reactor in the last half of the process may indicate the occurrence of eps reduction if this is true the isotopically non sensitive steps preceding the cro cleavage may be the diffusion process which is less complicated when compared to the mass transfer process during microbial cr vi reduction in the ch4 reactor in previous studies of carbon isotope fractionation birkigt et al 2015 nijenhuis et al 2005 it had been proposed that the observed isotope fractionation factor was larger during chemical reduction than during microbial reduction 4 2 assessment of the extent of cr vi reduction the cr isotope system is a potentially powerful tool for assessing and monitoring the reduction of cr vi in this work we assessed for the first time the applicability of cr isotope analysis to monitor the degree of cr vi reduction during the cr vi reducing related ch4 oxidation process we also studied for the first time cr isotope fractionation in microbial bioreactors a methodological environment that is more complicated than the ones used in previous studies where usually serum bottles were utilized this study expanded the application of cr isotope analysis furthering our understanding of carbon and chromium cycles besides a difference in cr isotope fractionation during the ch4 and n2 feed systems was observed showing that cr isotope analysis has the potential for distinguishing these two cr vi removal processes 4 3 association between cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation although ch4 and cr vi co exist in natural water sediments bartlett 1991 martens and klump 1980 so far little attention has been paid to their interactions previously the occurrence of methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction was verified only by the use of an enriched culture anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with perchlorate nitrate reduction and a pure strain methylococcus capsulatus al hasin et al 2010 lai et al 2016 lu et al 2016 in this study we confirmed the correlation between ch4 oxidation and cr vi reduction using lake sediments as the inoculum after a long period of enrichment most of the methane oxidation related microorganisms predominantly belonging to genera methylibium methylosinus and methylotenera are reported to have the ability to consume methane as the only source of carbon and to produce methanol lactate and acetate chistoserdova and lidstrom 2014 hwang et al 2015 kane et al 2007 agrobacterium was reported to have a high cr vi reducing potential nguema et al 2014 on the other hand meiothermus which is capable of cr vi reduction was found to dominate in a methane based reactor lai et al 2016 in addition isolated acidovorax strains have been shown to reduce cr vi to cr iii dimitroula et al 2015 in our study we established that the microbial community responsible for the bio reduction of cr vi using ch4 as an electron donor was similar to that reported by lai et al 2016 specifically methylosinus and meiothermus strains were involved in ch4 oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively it is probable that ch4 was oxidized by methane oxidizing bacteria resulting in the formation of organic metabolites that were used by the cr vi reducing microbes even though long term enrichment was applied only approximately 10 mg cr l of cr vi was removed in about 20 days in the ch4 feed reactor at the last stage these results indicate that the cr vi reduction caused by methane oxidation is a slow process in natural sediments which might be due to the low proportion of cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation related microflora in the sediment less than 4 of the total microflora after over 450 days of enrichment the total proportion of cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation related microflora was never more than 15 in the ch4 feed reactor other microbes may have competed with the cr vi reducing microbes for the organic metabolites produced by the ch4 oxidation microbes in addition the continuously accumulating green cr iii species may have inhibited the activities of the microbes resulting in a low cr vi removal rate caldwell et al 2008 5 conclusions in this study lake sediments were enriched in a hfmbr to investigate the potential relationship between cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation cr isotope fractionation analysis was used to analysis the cr vi removal process after about 500 days enrichment the outcomes were cr vi reduction was confirmed to be associated with ch4 oxidation based on a synergy ch4 was oxidized by methanotrophs which might lead to the production of organic metabolites that could be utilized as electron donors by the cr vi reducing microbes based on the cr isotope fractionation analysis the different cr vi removal processes between the ch4 and n2 feed reactors were identified cr vi removal processes containing physical adsorption and subsequent cr vi reduction were distinguished in the n2 feed reactor cr isotope fractionation followed a rayleigh distillation model and the ε value of 2 62 0 20 was

19816,chromium cr isotope fractionation analysis is a promising tool for monitoring cr vi reduction in natural aqueous systems in addition large amounts of ch4 in natural aqueous sediments are oxidized to co2 through methanotrophs thereby mitigating emissions to the atmosphere however the investigations on the cr vi reduction process with methanotrophs and the associated cr isotope fractionation patterns are scarce in this study we have shown that cr vi reduction can occur in the presence of ch4 as the sole electron donor in a hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr after direct bacteria enrichment from sediment samples products of the methane oxidation by the methanotrophs are used by microbes to reduce cr vi as shown by the progressive increase in δ 53cr with time in the ch4 feed reactor the isotope fractionation factor ε of 2 62 0 20 was obtained from the application of the rayleigh distillation model the results of cr isotope fractionation analysis also explained the decrease of cr vi concentration in the n2 feed reactor where the δ 53cr values remained steady in the first two weeks but significantly increased in the last two weeks indicating that physical adsorption and subsequent cr vi reduction occurred this study extended the application of cr isotope fractionation showing the suitability of this method for clarifying different cr vi removal processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords cr vi reduction chromium isotope fractionation methane oxidation hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr process analysis 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi is widely used in various industrial processes including dyeing tannery and electroplating blowes 2002 the discharge of these industrial effluents can cause anthropogenic contamination with cr of soils groundwater and surface water fruchter 2002 reportedly cr vi is nearly 10 100 times more toxic than cr iii katz and salem 1993 in nature cr iii is present in insoluble forms adsorbed on solid surfaces or bound in the microbial biomass james and bartlett 1983 whereas mainly soluble and mobile forms of cr vi are available in the environment xia et al 2000 thus the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is an effective method for remediation of cr contamination chromium isotope fractionation analysis is a valuable tool for the assessment of the extent of cr vi reduction in polluted aquifers berna et al 2010 economou eliopoulos et al 2014 novak et al 2014 qin and wang 2017 most physical processes including physical sorption volatilization and diffusion do not cause significant fractionation of cr isotopes ellis et al 2004 but cr vi reduction is often associated with an isotope fractionation during the reduction of cr vi lighter isotopes preferentially react and are enriched in the product while heavier isotopes are enriched in the remaining reactant ellis et al 2002 the reduction process can be microbially mediated or can proceed inorganically in the presence of dissolved fe ii fe ii minerals h2s no2 dissolved organic carbon doc or other reductive agents han et al 2010 novak et al 2014 it is noteworthy that the magnitude of cr fractionation can be expressed by the isotope fractionation factor ε and can be determined in laboratory experiments considerable variability of the isotope fractionation factor has been found in previous studies on microbial cr vi reduction basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 importantly lactate acetate and formate have been predominantly used as electron donors in previous studies however the association between the levels of oxidation of methane ch4 which is the simplest organic compound in natural aqueous sediments and microbial cr vi reduction has not yet been completely elucidated ch4 is an important greenhouse gas with a greenhouse effect per mol that is approximately 25 times more powerful than that of co2 rodhe 1990 sediments in natural wetlands rivers and lakes are the main reservoirs of methane in the environment in the anaerobic layer of sediments organic matter is used by methanogens to produce ch4 kits et al 2015 along with diffusing upward from deep sites of sediments large amounts of ch4 disappear due to anaerobic oxidation of methane aom process in the anoxic layer cui et al 2015 subsequently aerobic oxidation of methane occurs at oxic anoxic interfaces where ch4 and o2 are available he et al 2015 as a result ch4 is oxidized anaerobically or aerobically to co2 and reducing the emission of ch4 to the atmosphere therefore methane oxidation plays an important role in mitigating the greenhouse effect the microbial redox processes involving methane are usually slow in natural environments beal et al 2009 haroon et al 2013 which hinders our efforts to understand the mechanisms of methane oxidation processes gas diffusion membranes in the hollow fiber membrane reactor hfmbr offer a solution for the efficient utilization of methane with this approach ch4 can diffuse through the membrane walls and be directly delivered to the ch4 oxidizing microbes increasing their methane oxidation activity ding et al 2017 shi et al 2013 therefore the use of this method allows investigations of some slow methane oxidation processes cr vi reduction was recently reported to be associated with methane oxidation al hasin et al 2010 lai et al 2016 lu et al 2016 but the cr isotope fractionation process during this process has never been studied physical processes which reduce the amount of available cr vi can mask the processes responsible for biological and chemical cr vi reduction cr isotope fractionation can be an effective method for the distinction of different cr vi removal processes moreover cr isotope analysis provides a potential method for the determination of the extent of cr vi reduction by measuring the shift in the value of the 53cr 52cr ratio in the product during the reaction process previous studies of cr isotope fractionation in the flow through reactors were focused on abiotic cr vi reduction jamieson hanes et al 2012 2014 whereas the cr isotope fractionation process involved in biological processes has been rarely reported on the other hand cr isotope fractionation during microbial cr vi reduction only has been studied under pure culture conditions in serum bottles basu et al 2014 han et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 nevertheless the extent of cr isotope fractionation in mixed communities in the flow through reactors are still unclear moreover laboratories working on cr isotope fractionation usually focus on a single process such as cr adsorption reduction or oxidation ellis et al 2004 kitchen et al 2012 sikora et al 2008 wang et al 2015 in this study we used lake sediments as inoculum and enriched them with methane in an hfmbr system then we investigated the magnitude of cr isotope fractionation during the cr vi removal under ch4 and n2 feed conditions our aims were 1 to enrich the cr vi reducing microorganisms with methane as the sole electron donor and 2 to identify and quantify cr vi reduction in complex reactor systems using cr isotope analysis to the best of our knowledge this is the first account of the study of cr isotope fractionation in a methane based hfmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration two identical hfmbrs fig 1 were set up for the study the reactors were modified by using a one end sealed hollow fiber degassing membrane module puresea spring beijing china propene polymer with a size of the pores of 0 05 0 1 μm was utilized as a membrane material the total volume of each reactor was 380 ml including 60 ml of hollow fiber materials thus the working volume of each reactor system was 320 ml the interior of the hollow fibers was connected to a feed gas ch4 or n2 cylinder through the open pore on the bottom of the reactor and the pressure was kept at 0 01 mpa a ph probe was attached to the membrane module to monitor ph changes an external pump javtop fujian china was used to recirculate the liquid at 300 ml min 2 2 startup and sequential batch operation surface sediment from chaohu lake n31 6893 e117 3899 was collected and used as inoculum before use the sediment was washed three times with the mineral medium and the detailed compositions of the mineral medium were presented in the supporting information a mixture of 30 ml of the washed sediment and 290 ml of mineral medium was injected into each reactor the temperature in the reactors was maintained at 35 2 c by a water bath the ph was controlled and maintained at 7 5 0 3 by addition of 1m hcl naoh a concentrated solution of potassium dichromate 30 mg cr ml was added into the reactors to reach an initial cr vi concentration of around 10 mg cr l after cr vi was exhausted or the reactors were operated for 1 2 months the used mineral medium in the reactor was entirely replaced with fresh mineral medium resulting a hydraulic retention time of 5 38 days in ch4 feed reactor and 9 57 days in n2 feed reactor before replacing the media the circulation was stopped and the reactor was stood overnight to avoid the microorganisms washing out trace amounts of oxygen leaked into the reactors from outside air instead of aeration resulting in invariably detectable dissolved o2 in the liquid 2 3 chemical analyses a sample of 1 ml of the liquid was collected and filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane the concentration of cr vi was determined by the diphenyl carbazide method with a uv vis spectrophotometer model sp 752 shanghai spectrum instrument co ltd shanghai pr china association and association 1998 before sampling dissolved o2 was measured with a dissolved oxygen probe hach model hq30d loveland usa in the reactor and the concentrations were 0 05 mg l 2 4 cr isotope analysis cr purification was performed in the clean laboratory 1000 grade at the cas key laboratory of crust mantle materials and environments school of earth and space sciences university of science and technology of china hefei anhui china chemical separation of cr was achieved by a two step chromatography procedure which has been detailed by han et al 2012 after purification cr isotope analyses were conducted using a neptune plus multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany polyatomic interferences such as those of 40ar14n or 40ar16o were resolved using the middle to high mass resolution mode the double spike allows the correction of the instrumental mass bias and the mass dependent isotope fractionation during cr purification a detailed description of the cr isotope measurement was reported by shen et al 2015 data were expressed using the δ notation in per mil units relative to the national institute of standards and technology nist standard reference material srm 979 1 δ 53 cr c 53 r c 52 r sample c 53 r c 52 r srm 979 1 1000 the long term precision was 0 06 2sd for δ 53cr of the spiked scp solution internal laboratory standard scp science on canada the isotope fractionation factor α was used to express the extent of fractionation between the product and the reactant which was defined as 2 α r p r o d u c t r r e a c t where r product and r reactant represent the isotope ratio of the product and the reactant respectively in a rayleigh model the δ 53cr values and the fraction of reduced cr vi can be related by the following equation 3 δ t δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 where δ 0 and δ t are the δ 53cr value of cr vi sample at the beginning and at given time intervals of the experiments respectively f is the fraction of cr vi reduction for convenience the α values are converted to units of per mil through the following equation 4 ε α 1 1000 2 5 biofilm morphology and characterization after over 500 days of operation the fiber members were removed from the reactors the biofilms were fixed with 5 glutaraldehyde overnight for scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray eds analyses the details of the procedure were previously described by li et al 2016 the valence state of the cr attached to the biofilm was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a thermo escalab

institute beijing china following the protocols described by lu et al 2016 3 results 3 1 cr vi removal in the ch4 n2 feed reactors the rate of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors during long term operations are shown in fig 2 as can be seen from day 1 to day 40 of the experiments there were no obvious differences between the rates of cr vi removal in the two reactors the initial concentration of cr vi decreased by about 95 from its baseline value approximately 10 mg of cr l in both reactors after around 10 days in either the ch4 or n2 feed reactor the removal rate of cr vi in the ch4 feed reactor was stable from day 40 to day 102 further in the following 38 days from day 102 to day 140 a dramatic decline in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value approximately 10 mg cr l was observed on day 140 the entire liquid phase in the ch4 feed reactor was withdrawn and replaced with fresh mineral medium which promoted the restoration of the cr vi removal rate from day 140 to day 238 it took 8 10 days to cause a fall in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value of approximate 10 mg cr l from day 239 to day 456 the cr vi removal rate gradually declined and 15 30 days were needed to achieve a decrease in cr vi concentration of about 95 from the initial value of approximately 10 mg cr l distinctly different from the situation in the ch4 feed reactor the cr vi removal rate in the n2 feed reactor continuously declined from day 40 to day 456 and for 30 days the cr vi concentration dropped by about 10 from the initial value of approximate 10 mg cr l in the latter stage of reaction 3 2 behavior of cr isotope in the ch4 n2 feed reactors to verify the differences between the processes of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactor from day 389 to day 424 day the samples in both reactors were subjected to cr isotope analysis by mc icp ms as can be seen in fig 2 95 of the cr vi was removed in the ch4 feed reactor from day 389 to day 424 whereas only 15 of the cr vi was removed in the n2 feed reactor the δ 53cr values obtained during these 35 days in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors are presented in fig 3 on day 389 the initial δ 53cr values were within the uncertainty in the two reactors 0 23 0 06 in the ch4 feed reactor and 0 14 0 06 in the n2 feed reactor in the ch4 feed reactor the reduction of cr vi caused an increase in δ 53cr values to 6 05 0 06 for 89 cr vi removal on day 424 by contrast in the n2 feed reactor no detectable fractionation of cr isotopes was observed for 10 cr vi removal from day 389 to day 403 and δ 53cr slightly increased to 0 55 0 06 for 5 cr vi removal from day 403 to day 424 the value of the cr isotope composition vs that of the fraction of cr vi reduction in the samples in both the ch4 and n2 feed reactors are shown in fig 4 and table s1 the calculated ε value of five samples for the period from day 389 to day 424 in the ch4 feed reactor was 2 62 0 20 furthermore we established that the ε value of three samples determined in the n2 feed reactor for the period from day 403 to day 424 was 5 9 2 9 3 3 contribution of ch4 towards cr vi reduction to further confirm the contribution of ch4 towards cr vi reduction in the ch4 feed reactor n2 was temporarily supplied from day 457 to day 479 fig 5 the rate of cr vi removal sharply declined during this period and the concentration only decreased by 4 3 in 22 days however the concentration decreased by 68 3 for the same time interval before this aforementioned period after ch4 supply was recovered the cr vi removal rate returned to its former level and was stable from day 483 to day 509 3 4 surface characteristics of the membrane and the fate of cr in the two reactors the morphological features of the fiber membrane surface after a period of incubation with microbes and cr vi of more than 500 days are illustrated in fig 6 as can be seen clearly visible biofilms with dark green precipitation accumulated around the fiber membranes fig 6a in the ch4 feed reactor microscopic investigations showed that precipitation of solids existed in microbial cells fig 6b and there were obvious cr signals in the edx spectra fig 6c in contrast the fiber membranes in the n2 feed reactor retained their original characteristics and were with relatively clean and smooth surfaces fig 6d further the microscopic investigations of sem eds showed clearly the formation of a biofilm with weak cr signals fig 6e and f the xps results of the biofilms attached to the file membrane in the ch4 feed reactor as well as the standard compounds for cr iii and cr vi are presented in fig s1 the obtained spectra indicated that cr iii was the main species of cr in the sample 3 5 microbial community structure in the two reactors in view of the difference in cr vi removal capacity between ch4 and n2 feed reactors the microbial community structures were investigated in both reactors and in the inoculum the observed number of species remained approximately the same as the sequences number reached 20 000 fig s2 which demonstrated that the sequencing depth was sufficient for precise analysis besides with the increase in sequencing depth the observed number of species in the ch4 feed reactor significantly decreased and was lower than the respective number in the n2 feed reactor and inoculum this finding verified also by the changes of the predominant microbes suggests that the microbial community structure in the ch4 feed reactor was more constant the main microbial representatives as determined by their relative 16s rrna gene abundance in the inoculum biofilms in n2 and ch4 feed reactors at the class level can be seen in fig s3 in the ch4 feed reactor the predominant classes were betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and saprospirae with relative abundances of 26 6 47 4 and 21 1 respectively the representatives of these three classes accounted for about 95 1 of all microbes established in the ch4 feed reactor but accounted for only around 24 0 of those in the inoculum and 15 8 of the ones available in the n2 feed reactor fig 7 illustrates the possible methane oxidation and cr vi reduction related microorganisms determined by their relative 16s rrna gene abundances in the inoculum and the n2 and ch4 feed reactor biofilms in the ch4 feed reactor the predominant cr vi reduction related microorganisms were of the genera agrobacterium meiothermus and acidovorax they dominated with 0 2 0 4 and 10 9 respectively of the whole microbial community however cr vi reduction related microorganisms were seldom detected in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor and their sum accounted for 0 1 and 0 4 correspondingly of their respective microbial community the predominant methane oxidation related microorganisms in the ch4 feed reactor were the genera methylibium methylosinus and methylotenera which dominated with 2 0 5 and 0 5 respectively of the whole microbial community representatives of genera methylibium and methylotenera were not detected in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor the representatives of genus of methylosinus accounted for 0 2 of the whole microbial community in the inoculum and the n2 feed reactor 4 discussion 4 1 cr vi removal pathway in the ch4 n2 feed reactors in the first 40 days the patterns of cr vi removal in the ch4 and n2 feed reactors were similar after that cr vi removal pathways presented in the two reactors gradually showed diversity according to the magnitude of cr vi removal when the supplies of ch4 and n2 were alternated it showed that the presence of ch4 was necessary for the reduction of cr vi fig 5 the original factors such as adsorption capacity reductive agents and organic pool present in the sediment fueled the initial biological or abiotic removal of cr vi han et al 2010 novak et al 2014 but as these got exhausted in the n2 feed reactor the rates of cr vi removal decreased in contrast substrates formed from the microbial transformation of ch4 in the ch4 feed reactor acted as a source of electrons for the cr vi reduction however in the n2 feed reactor there was constant removal of small amounts of cr vi during the whole period as shown in fig 2 cr isotope analysis was applied from day 389 424 to confirm the differences in cr vi removal between the ch4 and the n2 feed reactors the differences in cr isotope fractionation between the ch4 and n2 feed reactors indicated that cr was removed through different pathways in the ch4 feed reactor the enriched heavy cr isotopes in the remaining cr vi indicated preferential reduction of lighter isotopes of chromium this result illustrates that cr vi reduction was the most considerable in the ch4 feed reactor in comparison to any of the other ways for cr vi removal in this study we established that cr isotope fractionation followed a rayleigh distillation model in the ch4 feed reactor with the ε value of 2 62 0 20 the intrinsic cr isotope fractionation is caused by cro bond cleavage the cr fractionation factor measured previously by sikora et al 2008 was within the range of 4 to 4 5 at low donor concentrations 3 3 100 μm of lactate this observed isotope fractionation factor was the largest in the published data so far for microbial cr vi reduction therefore the magnitude of intrinsic kinetic isotope fractionation was at least 4 5 qin and wang 2017 sikora et al 2008 and the ε value in the ch4 feed reactor indicated that the magnitude of isotope fractionation was masked compared to the intrinsic isotope fractionation mass transfer limitation was probably responsible for the masking effect the mass transfer process in microbial cr vi reduction involve steps preceding the cro bond cleavage such as diffusion uptake of cr vi through the membrane transport of cr vi to the reactive sites of enzymes if such preceding processes become rate limiting the intrinsic cr isotope fractionation is masked as a result basu et al 2014 reported cr isotope fractionation factors for cr vi reduction by a metabolically diverse group of bacteria three of four bacteria induced overlapping isotopic fractionation ε 3 for g sulfurreducens p stutzeri dcp ps1 and d vulgaris these magnitudes of isotope fractionations were similar to the ε value we observed in the ch4 feed reactor indicating different bacteria species with diverse metabolic pathways may not change the extent of isotope fractionations han et al 2012 reported the ε value under aerobic conditions was 2 by pseudomonas stutzeri strain rch2 this ε value was similar to the ε value we obtained in the ch4 feed reactor where the aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were also detected however the ε value was 0 4 during cr vi reduction by pseudomonas stutzeri strain rch2 under anaerobic conditions this illustrates that the extent of cr isotope fractionation may be varied under different redox conditions in the n2 feed reactor the δ 53cr values were identical within analytical uncertainty from day 389 to day 403 of the cr vi removal process these results indicated that cr isotope fractionation was negligible associated with the decrease of cr vi concentration the lack of cr isotope fractionation probably implied the occurrence of physical adsorption instead of cr vi reduction ellis et al 2004 in the last half range of the cr vi removal process in the n2 feed reactor significantly increased δ 53cr values were obtained zink et al 2010 found that at ph values of 7 no cr isotope exchange was detected for weeks between soluble cr vi and cr iii therefore the cr isotope exchange between cr vi and cr iii in the last two weeks could be ruled out thus we concluded that the increase of δ 53cr values probably indicated the occurrence of cr vi reduction we consider three possible mechanisms for cr vi reduction firstly the sediment and mineral medium might be able to cause cr vi reduction however no detectable fractionation of cr isotopes in the first two weeks was observed indicating cr vi reduction by sediment and mineral medium could be ruled out secondly the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microbes had the ability to reduce cr vi harish et al 2012 janaki et al 2014 eps might accumulate as the n2 feed reactor progressed and cr vi reduction gradually occurred thirdly the dissolved organic matter produced by decomposition of dead microbial cells was used as a substrate by cr vi reducing bacteria such as those belonging to genera acidovorax and agrobacterium which were detected in the reactor cr vi reducing bacteria could use the dissolved organic matter as electron donor and reduce cr vi immediately but there was no cr vi reduction in the first half range of cr vi removal process thus microbial cr vi reduction process via cell lysis likely did not occur therefore cr vi removal in the n2 reactor in the last half range might be mainly caused by eps the fractionation factor in the last half range of cr vi removal process was 5 9 2 9 the uncertainties in ε value in the n2 feed reactor were relatively higher indicating that the isotope fractionation curves in the last half range of cr vi removal could not be closely fitted to the rayleigh distillation model it was probably because the decrease in cr vi concentration at this stage was due to both adsorption and reduction processes besides the ε value in the n2 feed reactor at this stage was probably larger than that in the ch4 feed reactor because of the comparable intrinsic isotope fractionation these results suggest that the masking effect caused by the mass transfer process in the n2 feed reactor was weaker than that in the ch4 feed reactor as mentioned before the cr isotope fractionation in the n2 feed reactor in the last half of the process may indicate the occurrence of eps reduction if this is true the isotopically non sensitive steps preceding the cro cleavage may be the diffusion process which is less complicated when compared to the mass transfer process during microbial cr vi reduction in the ch4 reactor in previous studies of carbon isotope fractionation birkigt et al 2015 nijenhuis et al 2005 it had been proposed that the observed isotope fractionation factor was larger during chemical reduction than during microbial reduction 4 2 assessment of the extent of cr vi reduction the cr isotope system is a potentially powerful tool for assessing and monitoring the reduction of cr vi in this work we assessed for the first time the applicability of cr isotope analysis to monitor the degree of cr vi reduction during the cr vi reducing related ch4 oxidation process we also studied for the first time cr isotope fractionation in microbial bioreactors a methodological environment that is more complicated than the ones used in previous studies where usually serum bottles were utilized this study expanded the application of cr isotope analysis furthering our understanding of carbon and chromium cycles besides a difference in cr isotope fractionation during the ch4 and n2 feed systems was observed showing that cr isotope analysis has the potential for distinguishing these two cr vi removal processes 4 3 association between cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation although ch4 and cr vi co exist in natural water sediments bartlett 1991 martens and klump 1980 so far little attention has been paid to their interactions previously the occurrence of methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction was verified only by the use of an enriched culture anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with perchlorate nitrate reduction and a pure strain methylococcus capsulatus al hasin et al 2010 lai et al 2016 lu et al 2016 in this study we confirmed the correlation between ch4 oxidation and cr vi reduction using lake sediments as the inoculum after a long period of enrichment most of the methane oxidation related microorganisms predominantly belonging to genera methylibium methylosinus and methylotenera are reported to have the ability to consume methane as the only source of carbon and to produce methanol lactate and acetate chistoserdova and lidstrom 2014 hwang et al 2015 kane et al 2007 agrobacterium was reported to have a high cr vi reducing potential nguema et al 2014 on the other hand meiothermus which is capable of cr vi reduction was found to dominate in a methane based reactor lai et al 2016 in addition isolated acidovorax strains have been shown to reduce cr vi to cr iii dimitroula et al 2015 in our study we established that the microbial community responsible for the bio reduction of cr vi using ch4 as an electron donor was similar to that reported by lai et al 2016 specifically methylosinus and meiothermus strains were involved in ch4 oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively it is probable that ch4 was oxidized by methane oxidizing bacteria resulting in the formation of organic metabolites that were used by the cr vi reducing microbes even though long term enrichment was applied only approximately 10 mg cr l of cr vi was removed in about 20 days in the ch4 feed reactor at the last stage these results indicate that the cr vi reduction caused by methane oxidation is a slow process in natural sediments which might be due to the low proportion of cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation related microflora in the sediment less than 4 of the total microflora after over 450 days of enrichment the total proportion of cr vi reduction and ch4 oxidation related microflora was never more than 15 in the ch4 feed reactor other microbes may have competed with the cr vi reducing microbes for the organic metabolites produced by the ch4 oxidation microbes in addition the continuously accumulating green cr iii species may have inhibited the

19817,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of pyridine the conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability in this study an electricity assisted anaerobic system was developed in order to enhance biodegradation of pyridine from wastewater the results showed that the performance and stability of the anaerobic reactor was remarkably improved for pyridine biodegradation with the applied direct current of 0 3 ma where the efficiencies of pyridine and total organic carbon removal as well as nh4 n formation were as high as 100 0 96 1 1 2 and 60 1 2 1 respectively the compact biofilm due to electrical stimulation as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode might promote pyridine bio mineralization in the anaerobic reactor moreover the species related to pyridine biodegradation desulfovibrio dokdonella hydrogenophaga and paracoccus were enriched in the anodic biofilm which would be another reason for better reactor performance this study demonstrated that electrical stimulation would be a potential alternative for the enhancement of pyridine removal from wastewater in anaerobic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords pyridine anaerobic biodegradation electrical stimulation microbial community 1 introduction pyridine a typical representative of n heterocyclic compounds is commonly found in wastewater discharged from the pharmaceutical paint rubber insecticide and petroleum industries among others zhang et al 2009 pyridine has adverse impacts on human health and environmental quality due to its toxic and teratogenic nature mudliar et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 hence there is an urgent need to develop effective and economically feasible methods to remove pyridine from wastewater various technologies have been developed for the removal of pyridine from wastewater physicochemical methods such as physical adsorption mohan et al 2004 photo catalytic oxidation zhang et al 2014 and microwave oxidation zalat and elsayed 2013 have different disadvantages including chemical recycling high costs and high energy consumption biological methods for pyridine degradation which are both environmentally friendly and cost effective wen et al 2013 should be able to overcome the various deficiencies of physicochemical methods pyridine biodegradation under aerobic conditions has been extensively reported in previous studies bai et al 2009 lin et al 2010 liu et al 2015b but this process not only requires significant aeration expenses but also could result in the nauseating odor therefore pyridine biodegradation under anaerobic conditions has attracted increasing interest in recent years shen et al 2015 unfortunately due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of pyridine the conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability as a consequence it is an imperative but also a challenging task to seek an improved operational scheme to achieve effective pyridine degradation under anaerobic conditions recently the electricity stimulated anaerobic system for the reinforced transformation of several persistent organic pollutants such as nitrobenzene azo dyes and chloramphenicol has been demonstrated wang et al 2011 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2013 in such an approach an electrode system is usually adopted instead of chemicals as a cathodic electron donor or an anodic electron sink yu et al 2016 compared with conventional anaerobic system itself it has been proved that the electricity assisted anaerobic process could effectively stimulate microbial metabolism including growth and activity and enhance the biodegradation efficiency of microorganisms depending on the direct current applied li et al 2010 ailijiang et al 2016 moreover electrical stimulation has been shown to have a direct effect on microbial community evolution leading to adaptation to unique environments and the development of specific functions zhang et al 2012 for example analysis of microbial communities indicated that bacteria species used for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic biodegradation were enriched when a direct current was applied ailijiang et al 2016 it was also observed that phenol removal efficiency increased by 33 when a direct current was applied on a biofilm reactor with propylene packing as carrier li et al 2006 the present study aimed at investigating the feasibility of electrical stimulation for enhanced biodegradation of pyridine in anaerobic systems an electricity assisted anaerobic system was developed and continuously operated for 170 days the specific objectives of this study included 1 to investigate the effects of various key factors on the reactor performance 2 to explore the characteristics and interplay of the micro environment in the bioanode using microelectrode measurements and 3 to elucidate the variation of microbial community in the anaerobic system with electrical stimulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor inocula and substrate a tubular anaerobic reactor was constructed from acrylic plastic with dimensions of 8 cm diameter 10 cm width its effective volume was 500 ml a pair of graphite felts gf φ 6 cm electrode distance 3 cm chemshine carbon co china was packed into the anaerobic reactor to form an electric biological reactor as shown in fig s1 of supporting information si an ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she was inserted into the system for potential measurement the electrodes were connected to a regulated dc power source ps 302d 2 shenzhen zhaoxin electronic co ltd china the current was controlled through titanium wires the output voltage of the electricity assisted anaerobic system was recorded with a digital multimeter vc9807at victor china anaerobic reactor was inoculated with 0 2 l of sludge taken from a 3 4 l lab scale bioreactor treating pyridine containing wastewater the initial concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids was 4 5 g l 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater was as follows phosphate buffer 7 mmol l 1 ph 7 0 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 0 05 g l 1 and trace element solution sl 4 1 ml l 1 according to a previous study shen et al 2009 the synthetic wastewater was continuously fed into the bottom of anaerobic reactor with peristaltic pumps and it passed through the anode and then the cathode zones pyridine was dosed into anaerobic reactor as the sole carbon source at the desired concentrations pyridine with analytical grade purity 99 9 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china the temperature of anaerobic reactor was kept at 35 2 c in a water bath 2 2 reactor operation the experimental period was divided into five phases and the experimental conditions of each phase are summarized in table s1 of si all of experiments were conducted with a continuous mode in the anaerobic reactor in phase i of the start up period the anaerobic reactor was inoculated and continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg l 1 pyridine resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 72 h the circuit was open and thus the anaerobic reactor was considered as a control system once pyridine was completely degraded in the reactor its influent concentration was gradually increased to 300 mg l 1 in order to evaluate reactor performance at high pyridine loading rates when reactor performance reached to a steady state judged from stable pyridine and total organic carbon toc removal as well as nh4 n formation the circuit was closed and the current was gradually increased to 0 3 ma with continuously feeding synthetic wastewater containing 300 mg l 1 pyridine into the anaerobic reactor resulting in the biofilm formation on the anode and cathode in the following 18 days in phase ii the effect of influent pyridine concentration in a range of 300 600 mg l 1 on reactor performance was investigated in terms of pyridine removal and nh4 n formation with a controlled current of 0 3 ma and hrt of 72 h the anaerobic reactor was run for at least 6 days at each pyridine concentration to reach a stable performance the control experiments were also conducted in an abiotic electrolysis system at hrt of 72 h with influent pyridine concentration of 300 mg l 1 and the applied direct current of 0 3 ma in phase iii the impact of the applied current in a range of 0 0 4 ma on pyridine removal were evaluated with influent pyridine concentration at 500 mg l 1 within the following 30 days in phase iv the role of hrt on pyridine oxidation were evaluated at an applied current of 0 3 ma in phase v the applied current and hrt were maintained at 0 3 ma and 36 h respectively and the influence of acetate dosage was evaluated in the range of 0 15 8 mm 2 3 analytic methods before the analysis water samples taken from the reactor were immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane pyridine was identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography lc 20 shimadzu japan with an authentic standard the mobile phase was water methanol 3 7 v v flowing at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the column temperature was 35 c the injection volume for all samples was 10 μl an inerstil ods sp c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm column shimadzu japan was used for reversed phase separation and the detection was spectrophotometric at 254 nm nh4 n was analyzed according to the chinese national environmental protection agency nepa standard methods 1997 toc concentration of the samples was measured using a toc analyzer vario toc elementar germany acetate concentration was determined through an ion chromatograph ics 2100 dionex uk using an ion pac as11 hc 4 mm 250 mm column and a suppressed conductivity detector scanning electron microscopy sem observation and electrochemical monitoring were carried out according to ho et al 2009 and shen et al 2012 both oxygen concentration and ph value profiles in the anodic biofilm were measured using a microelectrode automation system pa2000 unisense denmark pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were determined according to shen et al 2015 and ammonia formation efficiency fenh4 n was calculated from the following equation fe nh 4 n c n h 4 n c p y r i d i n e 100 where cnh4 n is the effluent nh4 n concentration mm cpyridine is the influent pyridine concentration mm average and standard deviation was calculated using excel additionally to evaluate whether the significant differences existed in the different treatments one way analysis of variance anova test was conducted using the spss software version 19 0 spss inc usa a p value less than 0 05 was considered as statistically significant five samples were collected at the different phases of the experiment respectively labeled as s0 the initial inoculum s1 and s2 collected from the anode and cathode before current stimulation and s3 and s4 collected from the anode and cathode at the end of the long run experiment after current stimulation after being washed with phosphate buffered saline ph 7 0 the genomic dna of each sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit mp bio medicals

amplification of the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was performed using primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the pcr products were sequenced by an illumina miseq sequencing platform according to standard protocols dna library building and data analysis were performed in accordance to jiang et al 2016b and liang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up procedure for the first 37 d during the start up period pyridine removal efficiency was above 95 at the end of first 17 d with influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the anaerobic reactor without current supply fig 1 however it was only approximately 60 when pyridine concentration was increased to 300 mg l 1 suggesting negative impact of high pyridine concentration on its degradation under anaerobic conditions after providing small current lower than 0 3 ma at 38 d the anode potential increased from 244 4 5 to 150 9 5 mv while the cathode potential decreased from 360 5 5 mv to 800 15 mv interestingly both pyridine removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies remarkably increased from 61 1 to 39 3 at 37 d without current to 98 3 and 60 7 at 55 d with current respectively the pyridine removal efficiency was only 2 3 1 0 in the pure electrolysis system suggesting that the degradation of pyridine through electrolytic process with a small current was almost negligible the nh4 n formation was a key evidence for pyridine ring cleavage since previous studies suggested that nitrogen in the pyridine ring was often transformed into nh4 n during pyridine biodegradation bai et al 2008 2009 qiao and wang 2010 nevertheless the measured nh4 n was only 60 of the nitrogen in the pyridine which may be due to that a large portion of nh4 n from pyridine degradation was used for biomass synthesis zhang et al 2009 moreover more than 95 of toc was removed after current supply while only about 57 of toc was removed under anaerobic conditions indicating almost complete pyridine mineralization under anaerobic conditions with current stimulation previous studies have shown that electrochemical stimulation can accelerate the degradation of organic contaminants by providing electrodes as anodic electron acceptors or cathodic electron donors chun et al 2013 for example electrochemical stimulation could enhance the biodegradation and mineralization of roxarsone to inorganic arsenic facilitating the arsenic removal through the physicochemical treatment of wastewater shi et al 2014 it is noteworthy that the transformation of electrons by microbes was essential for the roxarsone degradation during the electrochemical stimulation process in our case the anode in the anaerobic system plays a key role for pyridine degradation because pyridine is resistant to microbial reductive degradation but succumbs to oxidative degradation in the anode more readily in addition the electrodes could provide continuous and fine stimulation to microbes in situ when treating pyridine contaminant chun et al 2013 3 2 effects of key operation parameters 3 2 1 influent pyridine concentration as indicated in fig 2 a the reactor kept a good removal performance with influent pyridine concentration in the range of 300 500 mg l 1 where almost 100 of pyridine and 95 of the toc p 0 05 were removed and about 60 nh4 n p 0 05 was produced suggesting the change in terms of reactor performance was not significantly however when influent pyridine concentration was increased to 600 mg l 1 the pyridine removal efficiency reduced remarkably from 100 0 to 89 3 1 4 p 0 009 and moreover the nh4 n formation efficiency decreased by 10 p 0 012 similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies mathur et al 2008 bai et al 2008 which could be attributed to higher recalcitrance and toxicity at higher pyridine concentrations it should be pointed out that the pyridine concentration in raw industrial wastewater is generally in the range of 20 500 mg l 1 shen et al 2015 the maximum pyridine removal rate in the electricity stimulated anaerobic system was well above 2 28 mol m 3 d 1 which is higher than those of conventional anoxic or anaerobic systems for example the pyridine removal rate under the anoxic conditions in the presence of the electron acceptor i e no3 was 0 76 mol m 3 d 1 shen et al 2015 the pyridine removal rate in the acclimated activated sludge under anoxic condition was 1 26 mol m 3 d 1 li et al 2001 in an anaerobic system incubated with a denitrifying bacterium the pyridine removal rate was only 1 25 mol m 3 d 1 rhee et al 1997 these results clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of electricity stimulated anaerobic system for pyridine removal from wastewater therefore electricity assisted anaerobic system would have a promising potential for effective pyridine removal from real wastewater 3 2 2 applied current in phase iii the influence of applied current on reactor performance was assessed by setting its value from 0 to 0 4 ma as shown in fig s2 without current supply the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation were 66 2 1 8 64 4 0 8 and 39 6 2 3 respectively which are higher than those observed during start up period of the system a possible explanation for this observation is that an appropriate direct current can stimulate microbial activity and prompt biofilm formation liu et al 2015a with the increase of applied current from 0 to 0 3 ma the anode potential increased from 244 4 5 to 150 9 5 mv the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation consequently increased to 100 0 p 0 003 96 1 1 2 p 0 003 and 60 1 2 1 p 0 01 respectively fig 2b this observation further suggested that an anaerobic system with electrical stimulation could promote pyridine degradation nevertheless the further increase of applied current to 0 4 ma had a significantly negative impact on reactor performance the anode potential sharply increased to 250 30 mv suggesting that the electrochemically active microorganisms on the anode might be severely suppressed under such conditions shen et al 2014 consequently the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation remarkably reduced to 90 2 1 7 p 0 001 88 9 1 8 p 0 001 and 54 0 1 0 p 0 002 respectively the above results strongly demonstrated that the reactor performance could be enhanced when imposing a suitable current into the anaerobic system this was supported by our previous study shen et al 2014 which also found that higher current had a positive effect on the degradation of refractory pollutant in a bioelectrochemical system while a negative influence for overhigh current therefore the applied current should be appropriately selected for the optimized acclimation of microorganisms in the anaerobic system 3 2 3 hrt hrt is an important parameter that regulates the performance of the anaerobic system the system s efficiency decreases and its construction costs increase if the hrt is too long in phase iv system performance was evaluated at five different hrts with a constant applied current of 0 3 ma as indicated in fig 2c the system showed a stable performance in terms of pyridine and toc removal when hrt was varied in the range of 48 72 h with the decrease of hrt from 72 to 48 h pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were reduced slightly from 100 0 to 95 2 1 4 to 98 1 1 0 p 0 142 and 92 4 2 1 p 0 417 respectively suggesting the change in terms of reactor performance was not significantly the nh4 n formation efficiency remained higher than 58 in the system p 0 581 however with the decrease of hrt to 36 h the efficiencies of pyridine and toc removal were substantially reduced to 86 3 2 3 p 0 004 and 79 8 0 8 p 0 005 respectively additionally the nh4 n formation efficiency reduced to 49 3 2 5 p 0 029 this result was inconsistent with previous observations that the intermediate nh4 n was completely consumed within 36 h in the microbial fuel cell zhang et al 2009 this observation can be attributed to pyridine working as the substrate in the anaerobic system and having a negative influence on the growth and survival of microorganisms further decrease of hrt from 36 to 24 h caused a significant deterioration of reactor performance in terms of pyridine degradation p 0 006 and toc removal p 0 002 as well as nh4 n formation p 0 021 with the decrease of hrt the declining performance of the anaerobic reactor might have been due to that shorter hrt with higher pyridine loading rate could seriously inhibit anode respiring bacteria for acetate oxidation cui et al 2012 previous studies have indicated that microorganism activity could be severely inhibited under high pyridine loadings zhang et al 2009 shen et al 2015 3 2 4 acetate dosage the supplementation of the anaerobic reactor with co substrates such as acetate is important because it enables microorganisms to adapt to toxic pyridine in addition to maintaining their physiologic integrity andrade et al 2017 as shown in fig 2d when acetate concentration was increased from 0 to 9 6 mm the efficiencies of pyridine degradation and toc removal experienced a slight increase from 85 6 1 7 and 82 1 2 0 to 89 5 1 3 p 0 285 and 85 2 0 9 p 0 312 respectively in the electricity assisted anaerobic system this might be attributable to the increase of microbial populations with the acetate metabolism zhang et al 2009 however as acetate dosage was increased from 9 6 to 16 mm the pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were remarkably reduced to 75 2 1 6 p 0 009 and 74 1 1 6 p 0 012 respectively in the system the deterioration of reactor performance at high acetate dosages suggested that a high acetate dosage did not be beneficial to degradation of pyridine this might be attributed to the fact that acetate had a stronger competition effect on pyridine degradation pant et al 2010 meanwhile the acetate removal efficiency remained at approximately 100 throughout the testing period indicating that excessive acetate could be completely consumed in the anaerobic system the formation efficiency of nh4 n was also influenced by acetate dosage the nh4 n formation efficiency was as high as 56 2 2 2 without acetate addition but it decreased to 15 0 1 4 p 0 04 when acetate concentration was 16 mm a possible explanation for such response could be the positive effect of acetate on the microorganism growth accompanied by an increased consumption of nh4 n the above results clearly reveal that maintaining the appropriate acetate dosage could enhance pyridine degradation in the anaerobic reactor with current stimulation this is a very useful observation since easily biodegraded organics such as glucose acetate and others besides for pyridine are usually presented in the real wastewater zhang et al 2009 3 3 characterization of bioelectrode morphology and micro environment 3 3 1 morphology of bioelectrodes the biofilm on the electrode plays an important role in the physical contact between electrogenic bacteria and the electrode or other electronic communications using electron transfer the morphologies of biofilm on the bioanode and biocathode were characterized using sem as shown in fig 3 a the uncultured gf had a large number of micro monofilaments interlaced together with smooth and clean surface the interconnected structure of the gf may facilitate electron transport and provide abundant space for the growth of microorganisms liu et al 2015a zhen et al 2016 after approximately one month operation the surface of the gf was covered with sparse and scattered biofilm fig 3b and c suggesting the successful formation of biofilm on the gf compared to open circuit conditions the biofilms on anode and cathode presented a compact rigid and clustered appearance after electrical stimulation fig 3d and e the biofilm consisting of micrococcus and rod shaped bacteria which covered the cathode was thinner some bacteria grew as chains liu et al 2015a also observed the electrical stimulating effect on cell growth when the cultivating voltage was between 1 0 and 2 5 v it is noteworthy that the biofilm with a multi layer structure was formed on the bioanode while an uneven structure biofilm was observed on the biocathode a possible explanation may be that the pyridine wastewater first passed through the anode zone and then through the cathode zone therefore the degradation of pyridine might concentrate in the anode chamber zhang et al 2009 and hu et al 2011 also indicated that pyridine tended to be biodegrade in the anode chamber of bioelectrochemical system moreover from the point of view of microbial ecology microorganisms enclosed in a biofilm have better resistance to toxic substances and environmental fluctuations due to their relatively stable environment liu et al 2014 in addition the biofilm functions as a protective barrier against chemicals for the bacteria inside the thicker biofilm on the anode improves biomass retention especially for the slow growing species thus a more balanced microbial community can be established which favors efficient treatment of complex pyridine wastewater 3 3 2 micro environment of the bioanode the role of the anode in the anaerobic system not only acts as an alternatively terminal electron acceptor but also oxygen production place resulting in the variation of the micro environment around the anode the tests on oxygen concentration and ph variations in the bioanode were performed using microelectrode measurements as shown in fig 4 oxygen concentration was always under 0 05 mg l 1 in the bulk solution suggesting a strictly anaerobic condition in the reactor oxygen concentration increased quickly from 0 03 to 0 23 mg l 1 when the depth of bioanode went from 0 to 1500 μm the oxygen profiles indicated that inside the bioanode i e near anode surface oxygen was produced creating a more anoxic condition in the anode zone as indicated by cheng et al 2015 introducing oxygen to the anode can benefit the degradation of recalcitrant organics the appropriate amount of oxygen would stimulate bacterial growth or help the expansion of the substrate utilization range it should be noted however that oxygen concentration quickly decreased from 0 23 to 0 15 mg l 1 when the depth of bioanode went from 1500 to 2000 μm it was speculated that the decline in oxygen concentration was due to the metabolic consumption by aerobic and facultative bacteria within the biofilm wang et al 2013 the trend of the ph value profiles was similar to that of the oxygen concentration the bulk solution ph was stable at 7 35 7 51 due to the phosphate buffer in the synthetic wastewater however the ph value increased from 7 36 on the bioanode surface to 7 81 at a depth of 1600 μm which could result from nh4 n release during pyridine bio mineralization when the depth of the bioanode reached to 2000 μm the ph value went back to 7 35 which might result from two reasons first as oxygen was produced in the anode a portion of protons generated around the anode at the same time second it was assumed that alkaline ammonia was removed through the biological ammonia removal process leading to the decrease of ph kim et al 2016 this process might also consume oxygen in the bioanode which is assumed to another reason for the decline of oxygen concentration at the depth of 1500 2000 μm 3 4 analysis of microbial community structure illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was employed to analyze the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities in the system as shown in table s2 a total amount of 35381 s0 28578 s1 35147 s2 33946 s3 and 33847 s4 effective sequence tags were obtained through primer and barcodes matching with raw reads and a series of filtering processes the otu numbers of s3 and s4 487 and 497 were much lower than those of s1 and s2 554 and 609 corresponding to lower chao1 values ace values and shannon indexes these results showed that electrical stimulation might reduce the diversity and abundance of microbial community indicating that the metabolism a bacterial community sensitive to electrical stimulation might be inhibited in addition the otu numbers of s1 and s3 554 and 487 were much lower than those of s2 and s4 609 and 497 corresponding to lower chao1 values ace values and shannon indexes suggesting less diversity of the microbial community in the anode of the electricity assisted anaerobic system this may be attributed to that pyridine with a higher concentration first contacted with the bioanode resulting in less bacterial diversity on the anode biofilm due to the toxicity of the pyridine this result was consistent with the thicker biofilms previously observed on the anode as shown in fig 5 a the community structure analysis at the phylum level showed that acidobacteria chloroflexi euryarchaeota nitrospirae and planctomycetes dominated these samples bacteroidetes 36 62 and 36 00 and verrucomicrobia 14 35 and 13 63 dominated in the biofilm of s1 and s2 while in the biofilm of s3 and s4 chlorobi 23 95 and 18 79 and proteobacteria 41 76 and 48 34 were the dominant bacterial phyla a comparative analysis found that the abundance of bacteroidetes the dominant bacterium in the biofilm s0 before the electrical stimulation dropped to 8 65 s3 and 7 24 s4 respectively verrucomicrobia displayed a similar tendency these results indicated that the growth of bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia was inhibited by the applied current moreover the relative abundances of chlorobi and proteobacteria were higher than those in s1 and s2 indicating that electrical stimulation selectively enriched specific species the 16 most abundant genera in each sample were selected for further analysis of the bacterial communities at the genus level as shown in fig 5b four genera were abundant in s1 and s2 including dechloromonas 4 76 and 8 96 methyloversatilis 16 43 and 16 98 paludibacter 9 24 and 7 78 and phaeospirillum 18 44 and 17 54 however they rarely appeared or could not even be detected in the samples of s3 and s4 dechloromonas has been reported to be capable of degrading aromatic hydrocarbons bacosa and inoue 2015 methyloversatilis had been identified in high salinity wastewater for the degradation of ammonia wang et al 2016 paludibacter might play an important role in pyridine biodegradation and denitrification in anoxic conditions shen et al 2015 the role of phaeospirillum in the bioelectrochemical system remains unknown as of the time of writing it was assumed that the metabolisms of the four genera might be inhibited by electrical stimulation in addition in s3 and s4 the abundance of desulfovibrio 4 50 and 5 66 dokdonella 15 43 and 14 64 hydrogenophaga 9 45 and 7 54 and paracoccus 11 36 and 10 33 was higher than that in s1 and s2 desulfovibrio is a bacterium that typically grows anaerobically and is known to be principally responsible for the reductive transformation of oxidative contaminant remediation yong and zhong 2010 dokdonella is known for its ability to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons bacosa and inoue 2015 the possibility of converting volatile fatty acids into aromatic hydrocarbons by hydrogenophaga has also been reported by use of pure or mixed bacterial cultures venkateswar et al 2016 according to a previous report bai et al 2008 paracoccus a denitrifying bacterium is also an excellent pyridine degrader the above results indicated that the applied current might be favorable for the enrichment of these pyridine degrading bacteria species intriguingly there were no remarkable differences in bacteria species among the microbial community structures between the bioanode and the biocathode during the same period which was similar with our previous study jiang et al 2016a however the differences in specie abundances for some specific species were found in the study the abundances of bdellovibrio and dokdonella 7 32 and 15 43 in s3 were slightly higher than those 6 33 and 14 64 in s4 both bdellovibrio and dokdonella are usually found in aerobic biological systems quan et al 2012 lee et al 2013 thus it was speculated that the fine distinctions in bacteria abundance was due to the generation of oxygen on the anode as a consequence a great improvement in pyridine removal was achieved in the electricity assisted anaerobic system through a syntrophic interaction by the anodic consortium 3 5 implications of this work overall the applied current would be beneficial for pyridine degradation in the anaerobic system a similar action has been also reported that electrochemical stimulation could enhance the biodegradation and mineralization of roxarsone to inorganic arsenic shi et al 2014 when applying a direct current the compact biofilms were formed on the anode which would be better resistance to toxic pyridine and environmental fluctuations liu et al 2014 this result may reveal that the electric biological system could be more tolerant when suffering a high pyridine load moreover the electrochemical stimulation as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode might be favorable for the enrichment of some pyridine degrading bacteria species and denitrifying bacteria ones therefore the biodegradation and mineralization of pyridine were remarkably enhanced through a syntrophic interaction by the anodic consortium pyridine ring might be cleaved between the n and c 2 atoms and subsequently deaminated to glutaric dialdehyde followed by successive oxidation to glutarate semialdehyde hu et al 2011 resulting in the formation of succinic acid and formic acid as the end products unfortunately the specific identification of intermediates during pyridine degradation was unsuccessful in present study which needs a further investigation economic feasibility is an important issue for bringing the technology from lab scale to large scale practical application both simple configuration and low operating cost are crucial for the successful application of the electricity assisted anaerobic reactor at large scale butti et al 2016 the main challenges for commercializing a scalable electricity assisted anaerobic reactor include development of effective and low cost electrode materials and decreasing energy consumption in the present study the electric biological reactor was developed by coupling of a pair of graphite felts into the anaerobic reactor the simple configuration was convenient for the upgradation of the existing anaerobic systems in addition the use of cheaper materials viz carbon granules carbon fiber brushes and graphite felts would further reduce the capital costs mohanakrishna et al 2012 based on the price of graphite felts provided online additional material cost for the upgradation of anaerobic system was less than 250 m 3 which makes it suitable for the large scale practical applications on the other hand the maximum pyridine removal rate was above 3 6 mol m 3 d 1 in the proposed system when pyridine concentration was 500 mg l 1 and hrt was 36 h however the maximum pyridine removal rate was only 0 4 mol m 3 d 1 in the control anaerobic system when pyridine concentration was 100 mg l 1 and hrt was 72 h the pyridine biodegradation performance of the anaerobic reactor was remarkably improved with the applied direct current of 0 3 ma meanwhile the estimated energy consumption was below 0 0046 kwh mol 1 pyridine in this system but it was about 96 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine in the pure electrochemical systems according to our previous work li et al 2016 suggesting a significant reduction of the operational costs this finding demonstrates that the electricity stimulated anaerobic system has the great potential to be a cost effective technology for the efficient treatment of high strength pyridine wastewater 4 conclusions stable and enhanced bio mineralization of pyridine was

19817,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of pyridine the conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability in this study an electricity assisted anaerobic system was developed in order to enhance biodegradation of pyridine from wastewater the results showed that the performance and stability of the anaerobic reactor was remarkably improved for pyridine biodegradation with the applied direct current of 0 3 ma where the efficiencies of pyridine and total organic carbon removal as well as nh4 n formation were as high as 100 0 96 1 1 2 and 60 1 2 1 respectively the compact biofilm due to electrical stimulation as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode might promote pyridine bio mineralization in the anaerobic reactor moreover the species related to pyridine biodegradation desulfovibrio dokdonella hydrogenophaga and paracoccus were enriched in the anodic biofilm which would be another reason for better reactor performance this study demonstrated that electrical stimulation would be a potential alternative for the enhancement of pyridine removal from wastewater in anaerobic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords pyridine anaerobic biodegradation electrical stimulation microbial community 1 introduction pyridine a typical representative of n heterocyclic compounds is commonly found in wastewater discharged from the pharmaceutical paint rubber insecticide and petroleum industries among others zhang et al 2009 pyridine has adverse impacts on human health and environmental quality due to its toxic and teratogenic nature mudliar et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 hence there is an urgent need to develop effective and economically feasible methods to remove pyridine from wastewater various technologies have been developed for the removal of pyridine from wastewater physicochemical methods such as physical adsorption mohan et al 2004 photo catalytic oxidation zhang et al 2014 and microwave oxidation zalat and elsayed 2013 have different disadvantages including chemical recycling high costs and high energy consumption biological methods for pyridine degradation which are both environmentally friendly and cost effective wen et al 2013 should be able to overcome the various deficiencies of physicochemical methods pyridine biodegradation under aerobic conditions has been extensively reported in previous studies bai et al 2009 lin et al 2010 liu et al 2015b but this process not only requires significant aeration expenses but also could result in the nauseating odor therefore pyridine biodegradation under anaerobic conditions has attracted increasing interest in recent years shen et al 2015 unfortunately due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of pyridine the conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability as a consequence it is an imperative but also a challenging task to seek an improved operational scheme to achieve effective pyridine degradation under anaerobic conditions recently the electricity stimulated anaerobic system for the reinforced transformation of several persistent organic pollutants such as nitrobenzene azo dyes and chloramphenicol has been demonstrated wang et al 2011 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2013 in such an approach an electrode system is usually adopted instead of chemicals as a cathodic electron donor or an anodic electron sink yu et al 2016 compared with conventional anaerobic system itself it has been proved that the electricity assisted anaerobic process could effectively stimulate microbial metabolism including growth and activity and enhance the biodegradation efficiency of microorganisms depending on the direct current applied li et al 2010 ailijiang et al 2016 moreover electrical stimulation has been shown to have a direct effect on microbial community evolution leading to adaptation to unique environments and the development of specific functions zhang et al 2012 for example analysis of microbial communities indicated that bacteria species used for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic biodegradation were enriched when a direct current was applied ailijiang et al 2016 it was also observed that phenol removal efficiency increased by 33 when a direct current was applied on a biofilm reactor with propylene packing as carrier li et al 2006 the present study aimed at investigating the feasibility of electrical stimulation for enhanced biodegradation of pyridine in anaerobic systems an electricity assisted anaerobic system was developed and continuously operated for 170 days the specific objectives of this study included 1 to investigate the effects of various key factors on the reactor performance 2 to explore the characteristics and interplay of the micro environment in the bioanode using microelectrode measurements and 3 to elucidate the variation of microbial community in the anaerobic system with electrical stimulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor inocula and substrate a tubular anaerobic reactor was constructed from acrylic plastic with dimensions of 8 cm diameter 10 cm width its effective volume was 500 ml a pair of graphite felts gf φ 6 cm electrode distance 3 cm chemshine carbon co china was packed into the anaerobic reactor to form an electric biological reactor as shown in fig s1 of supporting information si an ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she was inserted into the system for potential measurement the electrodes were connected to a regulated dc power source ps 302d 2 shenzhen zhaoxin electronic co ltd china the current was controlled through titanium wires the output voltage of the electricity assisted anaerobic system was recorded with a digital multimeter vc9807at victor china anaerobic reactor was inoculated with 0 2 l of sludge taken from a 3 4 l lab scale bioreactor treating pyridine containing wastewater the initial concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids was 4 5 g l 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater was as follows phosphate buffer 7 mmol l 1 ph 7 0 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 0 05 g l 1 and trace element solution sl 4 1 ml l 1 according to a previous study shen et al 2009 the synthetic wastewater was continuously fed into the bottom of anaerobic reactor with peristaltic pumps and it passed through the anode and then the cathode zones pyridine was dosed into anaerobic reactor as the sole carbon source at the desired concentrations pyridine with analytical grade purity 99 9 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china the temperature of anaerobic reactor was kept at 35 2 c in a water bath 2 2 reactor operation the experimental period was divided into five phases and the experimental conditions of each phase are summarized in table s1 of si all of experiments were conducted with a continuous mode in the anaerobic reactor in phase i of the start up period the anaerobic reactor was inoculated and continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg l 1 pyridine resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 72 h the circuit was open and thus the anaerobic reactor was considered as a control system once pyridine was completely degraded in the reactor its influent concentration was gradually increased to 300 mg l 1 in order to evaluate reactor performance at high pyridine loading rates when reactor performance reached to a steady state judged from stable pyridine and total organic carbon toc removal as well as nh4 n formation the circuit was closed and the current was gradually increased to 0 3 ma with continuously feeding synthetic wastewater containing 300 mg l 1 pyridine into the anaerobic reactor resulting in the biofilm formation on the anode and cathode in the following 18 days in phase ii the effect of influent pyridine concentration in a range of 300 600 mg l 1 on reactor performance was investigated in terms of pyridine removal and nh4 n formation with a controlled current of 0 3 ma and hrt of 72 h the anaerobic reactor was run for at least 6 days at each pyridine concentration to reach a stable performance the control experiments were also conducted in an abiotic electrolysis system at hrt of 72 h with influent pyridine concentration of 300 mg l 1 and the applied direct current of 0 3 ma in phase iii the impact of the applied current in a range of 0 0 4 ma on pyridine removal were evaluated with influent pyridine concentration at 500 mg l 1 within the following 30 days in phase iv the role of hrt on pyridine oxidation were evaluated at an applied current of 0 3 ma in phase v the applied current and hrt were maintained at 0 3 ma and 36 h respectively and the influence of acetate dosage was evaluated in the range of 0 15 8 mm 2 3 analytic methods before the analysis water samples taken from the reactor were immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane pyridine was identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography lc 20 shimadzu japan with an authentic standard the mobile phase was water methanol 3 7 v v flowing at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the column temperature was 35 c the injection volume for all samples was 10 μl an inerstil ods sp c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm column shimadzu japan was used for reversed phase separation and the detection was spectrophotometric at 254 nm nh4 n was analyzed according to the chinese national environmental protection agency nepa standard methods 1997 toc concentration of the samples was measured using a toc

detector scanning electron microscopy sem observation and electrochemical monitoring were carried out according to ho et al 2009 and shen et al 2012 both oxygen concentration and ph value profiles in the anodic biofilm were measured using a microelectrode automation system pa2000 unisense denmark pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were determined according to shen et al 2015 and ammonia formation efficiency fenh4 n was calculated from the following equation fe nh 4 n c n h 4 n c p y r i d i n e 100 where cnh4 n is the effluent nh4 n concentration mm cpyridine is the influent pyridine concentration mm average and standard deviation was calculated using excel additionally to evaluate whether the significant differences existed in the different treatments one way analysis of variance anova test was conducted using the spss software version 19 0 spss inc usa a p value less than 0 05 was considered as statistically significant five samples were collected at the different phases of the experiment respectively labeled as s0 the initial inoculum s1 and s2 collected from the anode and cathode before current stimulation and s3 and s4 collected from the anode and cathode at the end of the long run experiment after current stimulation after being washed with phosphate buffered saline ph 7 0 the genomic dna of each sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit mp bio medicals

amplification of the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was performed using primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the pcr products were sequenced by an illumina miseq sequencing platform according to standard protocols dna library building and data analysis were performed in accordance to jiang et al 2016b and liang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up procedure for the first 37 d during the start up period pyridine removal efficiency was above 95 at the end of first 17 d with influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the anaerobic reactor without current supply fig 1 however it was only approximately 60 when pyridine concentration was increased to 300 mg l 1 suggesting negative impact of high pyridine concentration on its degradation under anaerobic conditions after providing small current lower than 0 3 ma at 38 d the anode potential increased from 244 4 5 to 150 9 5 mv while the cathode potential decreased from 360 5 5 mv to 800 15 mv interestingly both pyridine removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies remarkably increased from 61 1 to 39 3 at 37 d without current to 98 3 and 60 7 at 55 d with current respectively the pyridine removal efficiency was only 2 3 1 0 in the pure electrolysis system suggesting that the degradation of pyridine through electrolytic process with a small current was almost negligible the nh4 n formation was a key evidence for pyridine ring cleavage since previous studies suggested that nitrogen in the pyridine ring was often transformed into nh4 n during pyridine biodegradation bai et al 2008 2009 qiao and wang 2010 nevertheless the measured nh4 n was only 60 of the nitrogen in the pyridine which may be due to that a large portion of nh4 n from pyridine degradation was used for biomass synthesis zhang et al 2009 moreover more than 95 of toc was removed after current supply while only about 57 of toc was removed under anaerobic conditions indicating almost complete pyridine mineralization under anaerobic conditions with current stimulation previous studies have shown that electrochemical stimulation can accelerate the degradation of organic contaminants by providing electrodes as anodic electron acceptors or cathodic electron donors chun et al 2013 for example electrochemical stimulation could enhance the biodegradation and mineralization of roxarsone to inorganic arsenic facilitating the arsenic removal through the physicochemical treatment of wastewater shi et al 2014 it is noteworthy that the transformation of electrons by microbes was essential for the roxarsone degradation during the electrochemical stimulation process in our case the anode in the anaerobic system plays a key role for pyridine degradation because pyridine is resistant to microbial reductive degradation but succumbs to oxidative degradation in the anode more readily in addition the electrodes could provide continuous and fine stimulation to microbes in situ when treating pyridine contaminant chun et al 2013 3 2 effects of key operation parameters 3 2 1 influent pyridine concentration as indicated in fig 2 a the reactor kept a good removal performance with influent pyridine concentration in the range of 300 500 mg l 1 where almost 100 of pyridine and 95 of the toc p 0 05 were removed and about 60 nh4 n p 0 05 was produced suggesting the change in terms of reactor performance was not significantly however when influent pyridine concentration was increased to 600 mg l 1 the pyridine removal efficiency reduced remarkably from 100 0 to 89 3 1 4 p 0 009 and moreover the nh4 n formation efficiency decreased by 10 p 0 012 similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies mathur et al 2008 bai et al 2008 which could be attributed to higher recalcitrance and toxicity at higher pyridine concentrations it should be pointed out that the pyridine concentration in raw industrial wastewater is generally in the range of 20 500 mg l 1 shen et al 2015 the maximum pyridine removal rate in the electricity stimulated anaerobic system was well above 2 28 mol m 3 d 1 which is higher than those of conventional anoxic or anaerobic systems for example the pyridine removal rate under the anoxic conditions in the presence of the electron acceptor i e no3 was 0 76 mol m 3 d 1 shen et al 2015 the pyridine removal rate in the acclimated activated sludge under anoxic condition was 1 26 mol m 3 d 1 li et al 2001 in an anaerobic system incubated with a denitrifying bacterium the pyridine removal rate was only 1 25 mol m 3 d 1 rhee et al 1997 these results clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of electricity stimulated anaerobic system for pyridine removal from wastewater therefore electricity assisted anaerobic system would have a promising potential for effective pyridine removal from real wastewater 3 2 2 applied current in phase iii the influence of applied current on reactor performance was assessed by setting its value from 0 to 0 4 ma as shown in fig s2 without current supply the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation were 66 2 1 8 64 4 0 8 and 39 6 2 3 respectively which are higher than those observed during start up period of the system a possible explanation for this observation is that an appropriate direct current can stimulate microbial activity and prompt biofilm formation liu et al 2015a with the increase of applied current from 0 to 0 3 ma the anode potential increased from 244 4 5 to 150 9 5 mv the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation consequently increased to 100 0 p 0 003 96 1 1 2 p 0 003 and 60 1 2 1 p 0 01 respectively fig 2b this observation further suggested that an anaerobic system with electrical stimulation could promote pyridine degradation nevertheless the further increase of applied current to 0 4 ma had a significantly negative impact on reactor performance the anode potential sharply increased to 250 30 mv suggesting that the electrochemically active microorganisms on the anode might be severely suppressed under such conditions shen et al 2014 consequently the efficiencies of pyridine toc removal and nh4 n formation remarkably reduced to 90 2 1 7 p 0 001 88 9 1 8 p 0 001 and 54 0 1 0 p 0 002 respectively the above results strongly demonstrated that the reactor performance could be enhanced when imposing a suitable current into the anaerobic system this was supported by our previous study shen et al 2014 which also found that higher current had a positive effect on the degradation of refractory pollutant in a bioelectrochemical system while a negative influence for overhigh current therefore the applied current should be appropriately selected for the optimized acclimation of microorganisms in the anaerobic system 3 2 3 hrt hrt is an important parameter that regulates the performance of the anaerobic system the system s efficiency decreases and its construction costs increase if the hrt is too long in phase iv system performance was evaluated at five different hrts with a constant applied current of 0 3 ma as indicated in fig 2c the system showed a stable performance in terms of pyridine and toc removal when hrt was varied in the range of 48 72 h with the decrease of hrt from 72 to 48 h pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were reduced slightly from 100 0 to 95 2 1 4 to 98 1 1 0 p 0 142 and 92 4 2 1 p 0 417 respectively suggesting the change in terms of reactor performance was not significantly the nh4 n formation efficiency remained higher than 58 in the system p 0 581 however with the decrease of hrt to 36 h the efficiencies of pyridine and toc removal were substantially reduced to 86 3 2 3 p 0 004 and 79 8 0 8 p 0 005 respectively additionally the nh4 n formation efficiency reduced to 49 3 2 5 p 0 029 this result was inconsistent with previous observations that the intermediate nh4 n was completely consumed within 36 h in the microbial fuel cell zhang et al 2009 this observation can be attributed to pyridine working as the substrate in the anaerobic system and having a negative influence on the growth and survival of microorganisms further decrease of hrt from 36 to 24 h caused a significant deterioration of reactor performance in terms of pyridine degradation p 0 006 and toc removal p 0 002 as well as nh4 n formation p 0 021 with the decrease of hrt the declining performance of the anaerobic reactor might have been due to that shorter hrt with higher pyridine loading rate could seriously inhibit anode respiring bacteria for acetate oxidation cui et al 2012 previous studies have indicated that microorganism activity could be severely inhibited under high pyridine loadings zhang et al 2009 shen et al 2015 3 2 4 acetate dosage the supplementation of the anaerobic reactor with co substrates such as acetate is important because it enables microorganisms to adapt to toxic pyridine in addition to maintaining their physiologic integrity andrade et al 2017 as shown in fig 2d when acetate concentration was increased from 0 to 9 6 mm the efficiencies of pyridine degradation and toc removal experienced a slight increase from 85 6 1 7 and 82 1 2 0 to 89 5 1 3 p 0 285 and 85 2 0 9 p 0 312 respectively in the electricity assisted anaerobic system this might be attributable to the increase of microbial populations with the acetate metabolism zhang et al 2009 however as acetate dosage was increased from 9 6 to 16 mm the pyridine and toc removal efficiencies were remarkably reduced to 75 2 1 6 p 0 009 and 74 1 1 6 p 0 012 respectively in the system the deterioration of reactor performance at high acetate dosages suggested that a high acetate dosage did not be beneficial to degradation of pyridine this might be attributed to the fact that acetate had a stronger competition effect on pyridine degradation pant et al 2010 meanwhile the acetate removal efficiency remained at approximately 100 throughout the testing period indicating that excessive acetate could be completely consumed in the anaerobic system the formation efficiency of nh4 n was also influenced by acetate dosage the nh4 n formation efficiency was as high as 56 2 2 2 without acetate addition but it decreased to 15 0 1 4 p 0 04 when acetate concentration was 16 mm a possible explanation for such response could be the positive effect of acetate on the microorganism growth accompanied by an increased consumption of nh4 n the above results clearly reveal that maintaining the appropriate acetate dosage could enhance pyridine degradation in the anaerobic reactor with current stimulation this is a very useful observation since easily biodegraded organics such as glucose acetate and others besides for pyridine are usually presented in the real wastewater zhang et al 2009 3 3 characterization of bioelectrode morphology and micro environment 3 3 1 morphology of bioelectrodes the biofilm on the electrode plays an important role in the physical contact between electrogenic bacteria and the electrode or other electronic communications using electron transfer the morphologies of biofilm on the bioanode and biocathode were characterized using sem as shown in fig 3 a the uncultured gf had a large number of micro monofilaments interlaced together with smooth and clean surface the interconnected structure of the gf may facilitate electron transport and provide abundant space for the growth of microorganisms liu et al 2015a zhen et al 2016 after approximately one month operation the surface of the gf was covered with sparse and scattered biofilm fig 3b and c suggesting the successful formation of biofilm on the gf compared to open circuit conditions the biofilms on anode and cathode presented a compact rigid and clustered appearance after electrical stimulation fig 3d and e the biofilm consisting of micrococcus and rod shaped bacteria which covered the cathode was thinner some bacteria grew as chains liu et al 2015a also observed the electrical stimulating effect on cell growth when the cultivating voltage was between 1 0 and 2 5 v it is noteworthy that the biofilm with a multi layer structure was formed on the bioanode while an uneven structure biofilm was observed on the biocathode a possible explanation may be that the pyridine wastewater first passed through the anode zone and then through the cathode zone therefore the degradation of pyridine might concentrate in the anode chamber zhang et al 2009 and hu et al 2011 also indicated that pyridine tended to be biodegrade in the anode chamber of bioelectrochemical system moreover from the point of view of microbial ecology microorganisms enclosed in a biofilm have better resistance to toxic substances and environmental fluctuations due to their relatively stable environment liu et al 2014 in addition the biofilm functions as a protective barrier against chemicals for the bacteria inside the thicker biofilm on the anode improves biomass retention especially for the slow growing species thus a more balanced microbial community can be established which favors efficient treatment of complex pyridine wastewater 3 3 2 micro environment of the bioanode the role of the anode in the anaerobic system not only acts as an alternatively terminal electron acceptor but also oxygen production place resulting in the variation of the micro environment around the anode the tests on oxygen concentration and ph variations in the bioanode were performed using microelectrode measurements as shown in fig 4 oxygen concentration was always under 0 05 mg l 1 in the bulk solution suggesting a strictly anaerobic condition in the reactor oxygen concentration increased quickly from 0 03 to 0 23 mg l 1 when the depth of bioanode went from 0 to 1500 μm the oxygen profiles indicated that inside the bioanode i e near anode surface oxygen was produced creating a more anoxic condition in the anode zone as indicated by cheng et al 2015 introducing oxygen to the anode can benefit the degradation of recalcitrant organics the appropriate amount of oxygen would stimulate bacterial growth or help the expansion of the substrate utilization range it should be noted however that oxygen concentration quickly decreased from 0 23 to 0 15 mg l 1 when the depth of bioanode went from 1500 to 2000 μm it was speculated that the decline in oxygen concentration was due to the metabolic consumption by aerobic and facultative bacteria within the biofilm wang et al 2013 the trend of the ph value profiles was similar to that of the oxygen concentration the bulk solution ph was stable at 7 35 7 51 due to the phosphate buffer in the synthetic wastewater however the ph value increased from 7 36 on the bioanode surface to 7 81 at a depth of 1600 μm which could result from nh4 n release during pyridine bio mineralization when the depth of the bioanode reached to 2000 μm the ph value went back to 7 35 which might result from two reasons first as oxygen was produced in the anode a portion of protons generated around the anode at the same time second it was assumed that alkaline ammonia was removed through the biological ammonia removal process leading to the decrease of ph kim et al 2016 this process might also consume oxygen in the bioanode which is assumed to another reason for the decline of oxygen concentration at the depth of 1500 2000 μm 3 4 analysis of microbial community structure illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was employed to analyze the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities in the system as shown in table s2 a total amount of 35381 s0 28578 s1 35147 s2 33946 s3 and 33847 s4 effective sequence tags were obtained through primer and barcodes matching with raw reads and a series of filtering processes the otu numbers of s3 and s4 487 and 497 were much lower than those of s1 and s2 554 and 609 corresponding to lower chao1 values ace values and shannon indexes these results showed that electrical stimulation might reduce the diversity and abundance of microbial community indicating that the metabolism a bacterial community sensitive to electrical stimulation might be inhibited in addition the otu numbers of s1 and s3 554 and 487 were much lower than those of s2 and s4 609 and 497 corresponding to lower chao1 values ace values and shannon indexes suggesting less diversity of the microbial community in the anode of the electricity assisted anaerobic system this may be attributed to that pyridine with a higher concentration first contacted with the bioanode resulting in less bacterial diversity on the anode biofilm due to the toxicity of the pyridine this result was consistent with the thicker biofilms previously observed on the anode as shown in fig 5 a the community structure analysis at the phylum level showed that acidobacteria chloroflexi euryarchaeota nitrospirae and planctomycetes dominated these samples bacteroidetes 36 62 and 36 00 and verrucomicrobia 14 35 and 13 63 dominated in the biofilm of s1 and s2 while in the biofilm of s3 and s4 chlorobi 23 95 and 18 79 and proteobacteria 41 76 and 48 34 were the dominant bacterial phyla a comparative analysis found that the abundance of bacteroidetes the dominant bacterium in the biofilm s0 before the electrical stimulation dropped to 8 65 s3 and 7 24 s4 respectively verrucomicrobia displayed a similar tendency these results indicated that the growth of bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia was inhibited by the applied current moreover the relative abundances of chlorobi and proteobacteria were higher than those in s1 and s2 indicating that electrical stimulation selectively enriched specific species the 16 most abundant genera in each sample were selected for further analysis of the bacterial communities at the genus level as shown in fig 5b four genera were abundant in s1 and s2 including dechloromonas 4 76 and 8 96 methyloversatilis 16 43 and 16 98 paludibacter 9 24 and 7 78 and phaeospirillum 18 44 and 17 54 however they rarely appeared or could not even be detected in the samples of s3 and s4 dechloromonas has been reported to be capable of degrading aromatic hydrocarbons bacosa and inoue 2015 methyloversatilis had been identified in high salinity wastewater for the degradation of ammonia wang et al 2016 paludibacter might play an important role in pyridine biodegradation and denitrification in anoxic conditions shen et al 2015 the role of phaeospirillum in the bioelectrochemical system remains unknown as of the time of writing it was assumed that the metabolisms of the four genera might be inhibited by electrical stimulation in addition in s3 and s4 the abundance of desulfovibrio 4 50 and 5 66 dokdonella 15 43 and 14 64 hydrogenophaga 9 45 and 7 54 and paracoccus 11 36 and 10 33 was higher than that in s1 and s2 desulfovibrio is a bacterium that typically grows anaerobically and is known to be principally responsible for the reductive transformation of oxidative contaminant remediation yong and zhong 2010 dokdonella is known for its ability to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons bacosa and inoue 2015 the possibility of converting volatile fatty acids into aromatic hydrocarbons by hydrogenophaga has also been reported by use of pure or mixed bacterial cultures venkateswar et al 2016 according to a previous report bai et al 2008 paracoccus a denitrifying bacterium is also an excellent pyridine degrader the above results indicated that the applied current might be favorable for the enrichment of these pyridine degrading bacteria species intriguingly there were no remarkable differences in bacteria species among the microbial community structures between the bioanode and the biocathode during the same period which was similar with our previous study jiang et al 2016a however the differences in specie abundances for some specific species were found in the study the abundances of bdellovibrio and dokdonella 7 32 and 15 43 in s3 were slightly higher than those 6 33 and 14 64 in s4 both bdellovibrio and dokdonella are usually found in aerobic biological systems quan et al 2012 lee et al 2013 thus it was speculated that the fine distinctions in bacteria abundance was due to the generation of oxygen on the anode as a consequence a great improvement in pyridine removal was achieved in the electricity assisted anaerobic system through a syntrophic interaction by the anodic consortium 3 5 implications of this work overall the applied current would be beneficial for pyridine degradation in the anaerobic system a similar action has been also reported that electrochemical stimulation could enhance the biodegradation and mineralization of roxarsone to inorganic arsenic shi et al 2014 when applying a direct current the compact biofilms were formed on the anode which would be better resistance to toxic pyridine and environmental fluctuations liu et al 2014 this result may reveal that the electric biological system could be more tolerant when suffering a high pyridine load moreover the electrochemical stimulation as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode might be favorable for the enrichment of some pyridine degrading bacteria species and denitrifying bacteria ones therefore the biodegradation and mineralization of pyridine were remarkably enhanced through a syntrophic interaction by the anodic consortium pyridine ring might be cleaved between the n and c 2 atoms and subsequently deaminated to glutaric dialdehyde followed by successive oxidation to glutarate semialdehyde hu et al 2011 resulting in the formation of succinic acid and formic acid as the end products unfortunately the specific identification of intermediates during pyridine degradation was unsuccessful in present study which needs a further investigation economic feasibility is an important issue for bringing the technology from lab scale to large scale practical application both simple configuration and low operating cost are crucial for the successful application of the electricity assisted anaerobic reactor at large scale butti et al 2016 the main challenges for commercializing a scalable electricity assisted anaerobic reactor include development of effective and low cost electrode materials and decreasing energy consumption in the present study the electric biological reactor was developed by coupling of a pair of graphite felts into the anaerobic reactor the simple configuration was convenient for the upgradation of the existing anaerobic systems in addition the use of cheaper materials viz carbon granules carbon fiber brushes and graphite felts would further reduce the capital costs mohanakrishna et al 2012 based on the price of graphite felts provided online additional material cost for the upgradation of anaerobic system was less than 250 m 3 which makes it suitable for the large scale practical applications on the other hand the maximum pyridine removal rate was above 3 6 mol m 3 d 1 in the proposed system when pyridine concentration was 500 mg l 1 and hrt was 36 h however the maximum pyridine removal rate was only 0 4 mol m 3 d 1 in the control anaerobic system when pyridine concentration was 100 mg l 1 and hrt was 72 h the pyridine biodegradation performance of the anaerobic reactor was remarkably improved with the applied direct current of 0 3 ma meanwhile the estimated energy consumption was below 0 0046 kwh mol 1 pyridine in this system but it was about 96 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine in the pure electrochemical systems according to our previous work li et al 2016 suggesting a significant reduction of the operational costs this finding demonstrates that the electricity stimulated anaerobic system has the great potential to be a cost effective technology for the efficient treatment of high strength pyridine wastewater 4 conclusions stable and enhanced bio mineralization of pyridine was achieved in the anaerobic reactor with current stimulation in this study the ability to resist environmental stress such as a high pyridine concentration a short hrt and a low acetate dosage was strengthened for anaerobic reactor when providing current due to the electrical stimulation the formed compact biofilm as well as the microaerobic environment in the bioanode promoted the degradation of pyridine moreover functional species related to pyridine biodegradation were also enriched with current supply in the anaerobic system which may be one of major reasons for the improved performance this study demonstrated that electricity assisted anaerobic reactor would be a promising alternative for efficient treatment of pyridine containing wastewater acknowledgments this research is financed

19818,the kinetics of fluoride sorption by calcite in the presence of metal ions co mn cd and ba have been investigated and modelled using the intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order pso and the hill 4 and hill 5 kinetic models model comparison using the akaike information criterion aic the schwarz bayseian information criterion bic and the bayes factor allows direct comparison of model results irrespective of the number of model parameters information criterion results indicate very strong evidence that the hill 5 model was the best fitting model for all observed data due to its ability to fit sigmoidal data with confidence contour analysis showing the model parameters were well constrained by the data kinetic results were used to determine the thickness of a calcite permeable reactive barrier required to achieve up to 99 9 fluoride removal at a groundwater flow of 0 1 m day 1 fluoride removal half life t 0 5 values were found to increase in the order ba stonedust a 99 pure natural calcite cd co mn a barrier width of 0 97 0 02 m was found to be required for the fluoride calcite stonedust only system when using no factor of safety whilst in the presence of mn and co the width increased to 2 76 0 28 and 19 83 0 37 m respectively in comparison the pso model predicted a required barrier thickness of 46 0 62 6 50 3 m respectively for the fluoride calcite mn and co systems under the same conditions graphical abstract image keywords permeable reactive barrier defluoridation metals kinetics hill model pseudo second order 1 introduction fluoride in drinking water within the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 who 2011 is regarded as being beneficial for bones and teeth while an excessive intake will result in dental or skeletal problems fan et al 2003 with many parts of the world reliant on groundwater for daily life fluoride contamination of these resources is a serious problem fan et al 2003 nigussie et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fluoride contamination can be caused by natural geological processes or anthropogenic activity such as coal fired power stations beryllium extraction brick and iron processing aluminum smelting etc turner et al 2005b for example the hydro aluminum smelter at kurri kurri nsw australia has rendered the nearby groundwater contaminated with fluoride as high as 2000 mg l 1 due to the historical disposal of spent pot lining spl a hazardous by product of the industry sleap et al 2013 metals such as manganese cobalt cadmium barium etc have also been shown to be leached from spl waste ghazizade and safari 2010 in recent years abundant and low cost minerals such as calcite have received considerable attention as a potential medium to remove fluoride from groundwater fan et al 2003 reardon and wang 2000 turner et al 2005b 2008 in addition calcite has also been shown to be able to adsorb metal ions including cadmium zinc barium nickel cobalt kitano et al 1976 reeder 1996 zachara et al 1988 and nutrients including phosphorus gbolo et al 2015 o connor et al 2005 with these reactions being ph dependent xu et al 1996 found that the interaction of metal ions on calcite involves 1 ion exchange with ca2 on surface 2 the formation of surface complexes with caoh and co3h groups 3 recrystallization 4 precipitation as a carbonate or hydroxyl carbonate 5 co precipitation with calcite carbonate and 6 diffusion into the solid ion exchange and co precipitation are highly dependent on the size of the adsorbing ions tunusoglu et al 2007 reported that since the ionic radius of ba 1 36 å is bigger than that of ca 0 99 å the contribution of ion exchange and co precipitation to ba removal is not significant the application of calcite for the in situ treatment of fluoride has received no attention since turner et al 2008 proposed the use of calcite as a permeable reactive barrier prb for the treatment of fluoride from spl contaminated groundwater a prb is an in situ treatment zone which consists of a reactive material capable of removing or degrading the specific target contaminant s as the groundwater moves through it under the natural hydraulic gradient present in the aquifer system turner et al 2008 one of the most important aspects of prb design is knowledge of the residence time required to achieve the desired contaminant removal limit painter 2004 which in turn can be found from kinetic studies that identify the rate determining stage of a reaction fan et al 2003 found that the process of fluoride removal by calcite could be better described by pseudo second order kinetics meaning the process is controlled by chemisorption cd sorption by calcite is thought to be described with a reversible first order kinetic model according to the work of ahmed et al 2008 with the rate determining step dependent identified as the energy required to overcome the bond between co3 2 and ca2 to date numerous studies have been published on the sorption of trace metals onto calcite comans and middelburg 1987 cowan et al 1990 elzinga et al 2006 farley et al 1985 however no study of the effect of metal ions on fluoride removal kinetics by calcite has been reported as the kinetics of geochemical reactions determine the required permeable reactive barrier prb thickness roehl et al 2005 and given the potential adverse impacts metals can have on a calcite prb it is of importance to understand their impact on the kinetics of the fluoride remediation process this study uses four kinetic models i e the intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order kinetics and the newly described hill 4 and hill 5 models turner et al 2015 to determine the influence of individual metal ions co mn cd and ba on the kinetics of fluoride removal by a calcite prb to account for the different number of parameters between models each analyses were subsequently compared on the basis of the akaike information criterion aic and the schwarz bayseian information criterion bic according to turner et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 calcite the calcite used in the present study was a product called stonedust which was obtained from the moore creek sulcor limestone member located near tamworth nsw australia and sieved into particle size fraction of 150 μm this particle size was chosen due to its rapid dissolution reaction and superior fluoride removal compared to larger sized fractions sleap et al 2011b approximately 13 32 g of calcite was pre weighed to keep a constant solid liquid ratio of 33 3 g l 1 analysis of stonedust was done using xrf and multipoint kr brunauer emmett teller bet surface area techniques the results showed that the sample was 99 pure calcite and 1 mgo optical grade iceland spar calcite 99 9 purity down under minerals victoria australia was crushed in an agate mill and sieved to 150 μm as per the work of turner et al 2005b iceland spar experiments were used to compare the removal of fluoride by that of the stonedust calcite 2 2 synthetic solutions a fluoride stock solution 105 3 mmol l 1 or 2000 mg l 1 was prepared using anhydrous potassium fluoride kf sigma aldrich and spiked with an aliquot of the spectroscopic metal standard sigma aldrich such that a final metal concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 was obtained when diluted with deionized di water produced by a millipore milli q 185 water deionizer 18 2 mω cm 1 test solutions were prepared from the respective metal fluoride stock solution by a 1 10 dilution to give a final concentration of 10 5 mmol l 1 200 mg l 1 of fluoride ion and 0 01 mmol l 1 of metal ion an arbitrary consistent metal concentration of approximately 0 01 mmol l 1 was used as an initial worst case test scenario analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms with detection limits of 0 01 mg l 1 for co mn cd and ba based on the procedure of instrument detection limit idl method detection level mdl and practical quantitation limit pql showed that the initial concentration of all metals in the final metal fluoride solution was 0 101 0 017 mmol l 1 all initial test solutions had a ph of 6 61 0 04 actual initial concentration was determined by ion chromatography using an ics 5000 ion chromatograph thermo fisher with a 1 3 μm fluoride limit of detection based on iso 5725 2 3 kinetic tests the free drift methodology was selected in the current kinetic experiments as this method is most useful for studying the systems near equilibrium plummer et al 1978 electronic overhead stirrers jeio tech msp 3 were used to provide the required constant stirring rate of 200 rpm ph and fluoride concentrations were measured using orion ph 9165bn and fluoride 9609bn electrodes orion pacific australia calibrations of ph electrodes were undertaken using ph 4 7 and 10 nist buffers until a slope between 92 and 102 was achieved fluoride electrodes were calibrated using kf standard solutions spanning the range 0 105 3 mmol l 1 or 2000 mg l 1 until a slope of 54 2 mv decade 1 was attained exact concentrations of fluoride calibration standards were obtained by ion chromatography ic and the calibration curves for the fluoride ise were determined all experiments were conducted in a constant laboratory temperature of 20 0 2 c the electrodes were connected to an 8 channel datalogger to record ph and fluoride concentration at selected time intervals in addition experiments using 200 mg l 1 fluoride only no metals under the same conditions were used to assess the effect of temperature on the rate of fluoride removal by calcite at the beginning of the test 400 ml of solution containing 10 5 mmol l 1 200 mg l 1 fluoride and either 0 or 0 01 mmol l 1 metal ions was poured into five 500 ml beakers respectively ph and fluoride electrodes were inserted and stirring initiated after 3 min pre weighed sieved calcite 150 μm 33 3 g l 1 was then quickly added to each beaker experiments allowed to run for 3 days to ensure system equilibration at the start and the end of each experiment samples were taken for anion f cl s o 4 2 and p o 4 3 and cation ca 2 na k mg 2 analysis via ion chromatography samples were analysed by icpms for metal concentration ph and fluoride ion selective electrode ise were recalibrated to determine any drift in the calibration over time no discernable change in calibration was detected at any time the percentage of fluoride removal can be expressed as follows lü et al 2010 1 r c o c e c o 100 where c o is the initial fluoride concentration mg l 1 c e is the equilibrium fluoride concentration mg l 1 r is the removal efficiency the fluoride removal was also calculated on a mg g 1 basis 2 r e c o c e m where c o and c e are as defined above r e is the amount of removed fluoride per mass of calcite mg g 1 m is the solid liquid ratio used in the study 33 3 g l 1 2 4 geochemical modelling it is of benefit to know that if there are sufficient free aqueous metal ions available in the solution as the metal speciation may vary with ph values for this purpose the geochemical program phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the distribution of aqueous metal and fluoride species in the current study the wateq4f database was selected to model the experimental data to ensure all the required species were included model ph was altered via the addition of hno3 since hno3 does not interfere with metal speciation no complexation or fluoride concentration at ph 5 2 as a result of the geochemical modelling predicted fluoride removal and concentrations of each metal speciation versus ph could be obtained 2 5 kinetic modelling the data obtained from the experiments were fitted to the selected models namely pseudo second order kinetics pso intra particle diffusion ipd and hill models the pseudo second order pso kinetics model ho and mckay 1998 is given by 3 t q t 1 k p s o q e 2 t q e where q t mg g 1 is the amount of fluoride removal at time t q e mg g 1 is the sorption capacity at equilibrium k pso is pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the pso instantaneous sorption rate h pso mg g 1 min 1 ho and mckay 1998 is defined by 4 h p s o k p s o q e 2 the intra particle diffusion ipd kinetics model of weber and morris 1964 is given by 5 q t k i t 0 5 c i where c i refers to the boundary layer thickness and k i is intra particle diffusion rate constant if the plot q t vs t 0 5 is multi linear then the adsorption process is influenced by more than one step which means intra particle diffusion is the not only factor that will affect the adsorption process zhang et al 2011 the hill equation hill 1910 and variants thereof goutelle et al 2008 have been reported widely in the area of pharmacology physiology enzymology biochemistry etc however it is only very recently turner et al 2015 that the hill model has been successfully used in geochemistry the four parameter hill hill 4 model turner et al 2015 is given by 6 q t d a d 1 t k h i l l 4 n where d mg g 1 is the minimum amount of fluoride removed as t 0 a mg g 1 is the maximum removal capacity t is time k hill4 min is the time where 50 of the observed removal a d 2 occurs i e half life time and n is the hill parameter unitless which describes the steepness sigmoidicity of the curve the turner rate constant t hill4 g mg 1 min 1 which is dimensionally equivalent to k pso the pso rate constant is 7 t h i l l 4 1 k h i l l 4 a d and the hill instantaneous sorption rate h hill4 mg g 1 min 1 equivalent to h pso the pso instantaneous sorption rate is defined as 8 h h i l l 4 a d k h i l l 4 the five parameter hill hill 5 model can be described as turner et al 2015 9 q t d a d 1 t k h i l l 5 n e as can be seen from eqs 6 and 9 the hill 4 and 5 models that the latter eq 9 includes the parameter e which allows for modelling asymmetry in geochemical kinetic reactions incorporating the asymmetry factor the hill 5 reaction half life is given by turner et al 2015 10 t 0 5 k h i l l 5 2 1 e 1 1 n by setting e 1 in eqs 9 and 10 the hill 5 equation eq 9 becomes equivalent to hill 4 eq 6 and half life time t 0 5 k hill4 which implies that hill 4 model is a simplified version of hill 5 model i e they are nested models motulsky and christopoulos 2004 similarly the pso model is a simplified version of the hill 4 model by setting n 1 d 0 a q e since the pso model is a nested or simpler version of the hill models hill 4 hill 5 it follows that successful application of the hill model implies that surface chemisorption plays an important role in the system under study zhang et al 2011 eqs 11 and 12 define the turner rate constant t hill5 and initial sorption rate h hill5 for the hill 5 model 11 t h i l l 5 1 t 0 5 a d 12 h h i l l 5 t h i l l 5 a 2 2 6 model fitting evaluation in order to identify the most suitable model the correlation coefficient r2 aic akaike information criterion and bic schwarz bayesian information criterion were used for model selection turner et al 2015 the r2 is efficient in evaluating the goodness of fit of each model to the data however it is not a good method for comparing the fits between models with differing numbers of parameters the aic and bic incorporate both the goodness of fit r2 and the number of model parameters enabling a relative measurements of the goodness of fit between models the aic is defined as akaike 1974 13 a i c n ln r s s n 2 p 1 where n is the number of data points rss represents the sum of squared residuals and p is the number of model parameters the bic can be described as schwarz 1978 14 b i c n ln r s s n p 1 l n n the difference between aic and bic is that the latter includes an extra penalty term for the number of data points this makes the bic more conservative and guarantees the selection of a simpler model as the best model as the number of data points tends to infinity foubert et al 2002 wagenmakers and farrell 2004 the advantages and disadvantages of these two information criterions can be found in the previous work conducted by burnham and anderson 2002 wagenmakers 2007 normally a lower more negative aic bic value indicates the more suitable model but it is still difficult to give an exact interpretation for the results to make the selection of the best model easier information criterion weights w i ic eq 15 and or evidence ratios er eq 16 motulsky and christopoulos 2004 result in a single number which simply reflects how much better one model fits the data over another are used 15 w i i c exp 0 5 δ i i c k 1 k exp 0 5 δ k i c 16 e r 1 e 0 5 δ i i c where ic is the information criterion aic or bic δ i i c equals to the difference in the information criterion between the ith model and the best candidate model i e δ i i c i c i i c min moreover the bayes factor kass 1993 kass and raftery 1995 calculations can also be utilized with the bic as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one model over another jeffreys 1939 by inspection it is also equivalent to the evidence ratio and or inverse of the relative criterion weights turner et al 2015 17 2 ln b j k b i c k b i c j where b jk stands for the bayes factor for of model j versus model k when 1 b jk 3 there is evidence for model k being the more suitable model but the evidence is not worth a mention when 3 b jk 20 the evidence is positive when 20 b jk 150 the evidence is strong when b jk 150 the evidence is very strong kass and raftery 1995 to compare the fitting of alternative mathematical models knowledge of the error structure to confirm the assumptions of error independency normality and constancy of variance is necessary askelöf et al 1976 when the error distribution of the system is not known the uncertainty in the values of the model parameters along with more realistic confidence intervals cis can be obtained from the application of monte carlo computations mishra et al 2011 motulsky and ransnas 1987 however due to the large number of data points available in each experiment the error structure is not likely to affect modelling conclusions in this study however monte carlo computations 1 000 for the model identified as the best fitting model were done for each experiment to generate the 95 confidence intervals graphpad prism 6 04 2014 was used to produce the monte carlo simulations in addition the question as to whether the set of fitted parameters are unique and well constrained by the data is addressed by applying the method of johnson et al 2009a b to develop a confidence contour analysis this is done by plotting the dependence of the sum square error on each pair of constrained parameters while all remaining parameters are unconstrained to during the least squares fitting process a well constrained model is defined by a finite number or ideally a unique set of solutions for the model parameters for a given data set the covariance matrix graphpad prism 6 04 reports the normalized covariance for each pair of fitted parameters if the dependency of any single parameter is high then the covariance with at least one other parameter will also be high therefore the covariance matrix allows potentially poorly constrained parameters to be identified the normalised covariance ranges from 1 to 1 with 0 indicating the parameter pair are completely independent and 1 or 1 indicating the parameter pair are completely redundant dependency values up to 0 95 are not uncommon and are not necessarily a sign that a parameter is redundant however 0 99 may suggest one or more parameters may be redundant prism 2015 in this study any pair of parameters with a covariance value 0 98 was analysed by generating a confidence contour plot for those parameters to determine if these parameters were in fact poorly constrained 3 results and discussion 3 1 phreeqc modelling the distribution of metal speciation over the ph range 2 11 without the presence of calcite was obtained via geochemical phreeqc modelling results indicate that there are more than 96 7 of free ba remaining in the solution at equilibrium over the ph range studied while approximately 29 3 of co 16 7 of cd and 20 of mn are removed mainly through the complexation with oh it is worth noting that only very small amount of fluoride 0 2 is lost via metal complexation based on the degree of speciation the remaining free concentrations of metal ions can be calculated for example after complexation 70 7 of free co remain in the solution at equilibrium reducing the available co from 0 115 mmol l 1 to 0 081 mmol l 1 similarly for the system with mn the free concentration is decreased to 0 091 mmol l 1 3 2 calcite surface area surface area analysis of the 150 μm stonedust by kr bet revealed a surface area of 0 277 0 005 m2 g 1 assuming a 1 1 ion to surface site reaction and a surface site density of 1 ca atom per 20 å2 stipp 1999 then there are 2 3 μmol g 1 of surface sites consequently in these experiments using 33 3 g l 1 calcite there are a possible 75 9 μmol ca sites or only enough adsorption sites for 0 08 of the initial fluoride load however for the metal ions at an initial concentration 0 115 mmol l 1 there is enough metal to form approximately 1 5 monolayers i e only 65 of the initial metals have access to a surface site allowing a potentially significant impact on the reaction kinetics 3 3 kinetics fig 1 a and b respectively shows the overall kinetic results of fluoride removal for each experiment alongside the ph evolution curves kinetic analysis of the fluoride experimental data was done based on intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order pso hill 4 and hill 5 models and the results of the fitting can be seen in fig 2 a f table 1 shows the model selection criterion values r2 aic and bic for the four kinetic models all models appear to describe the experimental data very well with good r2 values mostly r2 0 9 however the r2 value cannot be used to compare models with different number of parameters whereas the aic bic values can with a more negative information criterion value indicating a more favorable model by simple visual inspection of fig 2 the hill 5 model shows the best fit to all experiments application of the aic bic theory table 2 shows that in all six experiments both the hill 5 and 4 models ranked first and second respectively among the models tested having the lowest most negative aic bic values fitting of data to the pso model indicates that surface chemisorption plays an important role in the reaction kinetics zhang et al 2011 since the pso model is a nested or simpler version of the hill models it follows that application of the hill models also indicates that chemisorption dominates the reaction kinetics a less ambiguous way of interpreting the aic bic values is through the calculation of information criterion weights eq 15 and evidence ratios eq 16 for example the co experiment evidence ratios table 2 indicates that based on the aic the hill 5 model is 9 25 1029 and 1 39 1028 times more favourable than the next best fitting model hill 4 based on the aic and bic calculations respectively in addition assessment of model fits based on the bayes factor eq 17 in every case resulted in a bayes factor bf 150 table 1 indicating that there is very strong evidence that the hill 5 model is the best fitting model in all cases kass and raftery 1995 the parameters of each fitted model shown in fig 2 are presented in tables 3 and 4 with table 5 showing 95 confidence intervals ci generated from 1000 monte carlo computations for the best fitting model analysis of the simulations showed that in all cases the observed data fall within the 95 cis of the hill 5 model supporting the assumptions of error independency normality and constancy of variance this is not surprising as the error structure is not likely to affect modeling conclusions to any large extent given the number of data points 7800 in each experiment to determine if the parameters are well constrained by the data a confidence contour analysis was performed on all pair wise parameters identified as having a high covariance 3 4 confidence contour analysis analysis of the covariance matrix for each model fit showed that for all pair wise parameter combinations the covariance was 0 96 experiments with iceland spar indicated the highest covariance 0 999 between hill 5 parameters n and e which shows that these parameters were potentially redundant to determine if the best fits for iceland spar table 4 were well constrained by the data a confidence contour analysis was undertaken by constraining the values of n and e these parameters were systematically varied around the area of best fit at each n e pair the model was fitted by allowing all other remaining parameters to vary and converge to the best fit the normalised reduced sum of squares rss norm was determined for each fit by dividing the best fit rss min by the rss x y calculated at each subsequent fit of n e pairs 18 r s s norm r s s min r s s x y to explore a larger space over which the parameters can vary the selected values of n and e spanned an interval greater than that of the predicted 95 confidence intervals table 5 the two dimensional confidence contour plot for iceland spar fig 3 shows that the parameters are in fact well constrained with the 95 confidence contour very close to that predicted from the monte carlo analysis table 5 supporting the fact that the monte carlo resampling technique can be a reliable method of determining how well model parameters are constrained by the data johnson et al 2009b 3 5 effect of metal ions on fluoride removal kinetics according to somasundaran and agar 1967 the phpzc point of zero charge of calcite is in the range 8 9 5 table 6 shows that the initial phs of all samples are 6 6 indicating that anion e g fluoride removal is favored since the ph phpzc due to the positively charged calcite surface fig 1 shows the fluoride removal kinetics and the corresponding ph evolution curves as calcite dissolves the ph of the system increases quickly changing the calcite surface from positive to negative this decreases fluoride adsorption and increases metal adsorption and precipitation normally metal removal starts with a fast adsorption eq 19 followed by a slow co precipitation recrystallization or incorporation into the calcite lattice davis et al 1987 lakshtanov and stipp 2007 zachara et al 1988 with the adsorption of metal ions being ionic radius rmetal dependent 19 ca surface m aq 2 m surface ca aq 2 where m represents metals co mn cd and ba zachara et al 1988 metals with larger ionic radii such as ba rmetal rca table 7 are likely to be weakly adsorbed by calcite while those with smaller rmetal co mn cd etc will be more strongly adsorbed zachara et al 1991 therefore calcite metal selectivity theoretically follows the order cd mn co ba according to the ionic radius given in table 7 if only adsorption is considered however metal ions form complexes in the bulk solution and undergo desorption reactions with cd and mn having limited sorption reversibility while co has been found to be readily desorb from calcite zachara et al 1991 moreover other reactions such as solid lattice incorporation co precipitation and recrystallization will take place during and after adsorption comans and middelburg 1987 davis et al 1987 stipp et al 1992 zachara et al 1991 the effect of metal ions on fluoride removal figs 1 2 can be expressed in three ways either a variation in the amount of fluoride removed at equilibrium the fluoride removal rate as given by the instantaneous sorption rate h or the half life t 0 5 of the reaction the two types of calcite stonedust and iceland spar used as the control experiments no metal shows that there is no significant difference in the equilibrium fluoride removal when using the different types of calcite for the best fitting hill5 model the defluoridation amount for the blank stonedust no metal was found to be 3 83 mg g 1 while that for iceland spar no metal was 3 87 mg g 1 the addition of cd resulted in no change 0 04 mg g 1 in equilibrium fluoride removal compared to that of the blanks the presence of ba and mn increased fluoride removal by 0 12 and 0 2 mg g 1 respectively above the upper 95 ci of the blanks table 5 with co found to suppress fluoride removal by 0 2 0 3 mg g below the lower ci s of the calcite using the upper and lower 95 ci s to compare the range of instantaneous sorption parameters h hill5 table 5 it can be seen that iceland spar experienced the most rapid fluoride removal 7 6 0 2 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 followed by the blank stonedust ba and cd experiments all these have experienced approximately the same removal rate 6 0 0 3 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 experiments using mn 5 0 0 2 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 and co 4 8 0 4 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 had the lowest h hill5 values and were therefore the slowest this is also reflected in the half life t 0 5 values tables 4 and 5 which increased in the order iceland spar ba stonedust cd co mn with mn and co in comparison to the stonedust blank requiring more than 120 min to remove half their respective predicted fluoride removal mn in the presence of calcite undergoes irreversible chemisorption causing a strong inhibition of the dissolution process paquette and reeder 1995 vinson et al 2007 zachara et al 1991 using 2 μm mn calcite dissolution was almost completely inhibited due to the strong affinity of mn for carbonate ions in both solution and solid surface vinson et al 2007 proposed that the formation of surface complexes reduced the number of calcite reactive sites thereby inhibiting calcite dissolution however the initial inhibition appears to be overcome as the observed f removal at equilibrium is as much as 0 2 mg g 1 more than the corresponding blank experiment this may be attributed to the small mn radius allowing exchange of ca in the calcite lattice combined with the formation of positive surface sites co3 mnδ van cappellen et al 1993 according to freij et al 2004 in the presence of co calcite dissolution rate decreases with time as adsorption of co occurs at step edges and kinks where calcium dissolution normally occurs the fastest turner et al 2005a fig 1 shows that in the presence of co the initial fluoride removal curve keeps pace with the other experiments after 1000 min a marked decrease in the rate of fluoride removal occurs indicating a slowing in the rate of calcite dissolution as supported by freij et al 2004 in addition greer et al 2004 reported that co precipitated on the calcite surface even when the solution was undersaturated with respect to coco3 consequently it is also possible that co precipitation reduces the transport controlled dissolution of calcite and hence reduces the rate and extent of fluoride removal as observed in fig 1 the presence of cd in the system presented in this study did not appear to affect the fluoride removal kinetics with neither the equilibrium fluoride removal the instantaneous sorption parameter nor the half life significantly different from that observed in the blank calcite experiments it has been shown davis et al 1987 zachara et al 1991 that in the presence of calcite at ph 8 0 mixed at 30 rpm cd is rapidly removed from solution in the first few 5 minutes of exposure with uptake likely occurring at discrete sites on the calcite surface data from fig 1b indicates that the system does not exceed ph 8 0 at 200 rpm for a period of 6 5 min indicating that cd adsorption had sufficient time to occur without any influence from precipitation from the bulk solution overall cd does not appear to significantly affect fluoride removal by calcite far from equilibrium however it is interesting to note that over the first 50 min fluoride removal is completely inhibited in the presence of cd with the ph evolution exhibiting a much slower rise compared to all other experiments fig 4 this reflects the high affinity of cd for calcite which subsequently inhibits calcite dissolution the fact that cd was not found to affect the system closer to equilibrium was attributed to the fact that cd is similar in size to ca therefore it quickly 60 min diffused deeper into the calcite lattice stipp 1999 causing an equal flux of ca out of the lattice as there was only enough cd present for 1 5 monolayers of cd adsorption section 3 2 eventually fresh calcite layers were exposed resulting in continued dissolution and fluoride removal as observed after 50 min consequently far from equilibrium we observed inhibition to fluoride removal for the first 50 min fig 4a derived from fig 1b shows the evolution of system ph over the first 20 min of reaction prior to the addition of calcite all initial t 0 min solution ph values were 6 61 0 04 upon the addition of calcite immediately after t 0 min both stonedust and iceland spar showed an extremely rapid increase in ph reaching 10 0 in 1 min this rapid increase in ph is due to the consumption of initial dissolved co2 during the calcite dissolution reaction sleap et al 2013 the presence of ba in solution does not interfere with calcite dissolution as the ph increases in step with the control samples peaking at ph 10 in 1 min in addition the half life and instantaneous sorption values are also approximately the same as those of the blank stonedust no metal experiment indicating that ba does not affect calcite dissolution and therefore fluoride is removed as caf2 this is supported by zachara et al 1991 and tunusoglu et al 2007 who reported that ba did not undergo any significant sorption by calcite most likely due to the inability of the calcite lattice to accommodate ba ions at calcium sites because of ionic radii differences and consequently the contribution to ba removal by ion exchange and co precipitation sorption mechanisms is not significant interestingly the rate of change in solution ph and the observed ph maxima increases in the order of cd mn co ba calcite which is in the same order as the calcite metal selectivity as reported by zachara et al 1991 since slow ph increase is also indicative of inhibited calcite dissolution compared to the blank control samples we can conclude that far from equilibrium fluoride removal is affected by the presence of mn co and cd however as equilibrium is almost attained only mn and co appear to affect fluoride removal by calcite 3 6 permeable reactive barrier prb design a number of variables including groundwater temperature dissolved carbon dioxide as well as aquifer heterogeneity will all affect the design of a calcite prb sleap et al 2011a showed that the rate of fluoride removal by calcite decreases with decreasing temperature and that any initial amount of dissolved co2 aq is rapidly consumed resulting in the rate of reaction being dependent on how fast co2 is replenished sleap et al 2011b fig 5 shows the effect of temperature on the removal of fluoride 200 mg l 1 by calcite at an atmospheric co2 concentration of 10 3 5 atm a temperature decrease of 5 and 10 c from 20 c increases the reaction half life and therefore the residence time by a factor of 2 and 3 75 respectively and consequently groundwater temperature should be factored into the prb design the heterogeneity of an aquifer inherently affects the performance of prbs due to the variability in hydraulic gradient and aquifer permeability hemsi and shackelford 2006 hemsi and shackelford 2006 define probabilistic safety factors sfs for prb design as scaling factors by which a prb thickness can be multiplied in order to account for uncertainty of more realistic scenarios such as aquifer heterogeneity a sf commonly used is of the order of 2 with values as high as 10 reported in aquifers with higher levels of heterogeneity in aquifer permeability hemsi and shackelford 2006 the thickness of a prb and the prevailing hydraulic gradient are the two main factors that govern the residence time of a contaminant within the prb roehl et al 2005 consequently the design of a prb can be defined by the geochemical reaction half life and the equation as given by roehl et al 2005 20 b v t r s f where b is the reactive barrier thickness m v is the groundwater flow velocity m day 1 t r is the contaminant residence time day and sf is safety factor given that the actual flow velocity through the barrier can be significantly underestimated due to the formation of preferential flow paths using the model parameters of the best fitting hill5 model table 4 in conjunction with the solver function in ms excel the residence time t r of each fluoride metal contaminant solution was determined at 99 9 of the respective equilibrium fluoride removal eq 20 was then used to determine the required prb thickness at a nominal groundwater velocity of 0 1 m day 1 model parameter sensitivity analysis was also done using the upper and lower bound 95 ci s table 5 to determine the effect on the predicted prb thickness fig 6 shows the calculated prb thickness required for each experiment as expected the required prb thickness increases with a higher demand for fluoride removal for the control blank using sf 1 the predicted barrier thickness was found to be 0 97 0 02 m for 99 9 fluoride removal the required width for the calcite metals fluoride system must be increased by 38 for cd to 1 34 0 02 m 87 for ba to 1 81 0 05 m 185 for mn to 2 76 0 28 m and 1944 19 83 0 37 m for co in comparison the use of the pso model predicts a required barrier thickness of 67 37 m in the presence of co increasing the sf will of course directly increase the calculated prb thickness as per eq 20 consequently prb installation requires comprehensive in situ characterization to determine aquifer heterogeneity and hence the impact on its final design hemsi and shackelford 2006 4 conclusion modelling of the kinetic data showed that far from equilibrium the presence of metal ions mn cd and co did affect the calcite dissolution reaction closer to equilibrium only mn and co were found to affect the system since the sorption capacities instantaneous sorption coefficients and half lives of mn and co samples were significantly different from the 95 ci of the corresponding control sample overall the fluoride sorption rate was found to increase in the order of ba cd blank mn co application of the derived kinetic parameters showed that a barrier of 0 97 m was determined to be required to achieve up to 99 9 fluoride removal in a fluoride calcite raw only system in the presence of mn and co the required thicknesses for a calcite permeable reactive barrier were found to be to 2 76 0 28 m and 19 83 0 37 m respectively at a groundwater flow of 0 1 m day 1 in comparison the pso model predicted a required barrier thickness of 66 53 m respectively under the same conditions acknowledgement this research was funded by the australian research council arc linkage program lp100200488 in conjunction with hydro aluminium kurri kurri nsw australia and was done in the university of newcastle australia 
19818,the kinetics of fluoride sorption by calcite in the presence of metal ions co mn cd and ba have been investigated and modelled using the intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order pso and the hill 4 and hill 5 kinetic models model comparison using the akaike information criterion aic the schwarz bayseian information criterion bic and the bayes factor allows direct comparison of model results irrespective of the number of model parameters information criterion results indicate very strong evidence that the hill 5 model was the best fitting model for all observed data due to its ability to fit sigmoidal data with confidence contour analysis showing the model parameters were well constrained by the data kinetic results were used to determine the thickness of a calcite permeable reactive barrier required to achieve up to 99 9 fluoride removal at a groundwater flow of 0 1 m day 1 fluoride removal half life t 0 5 values were found to increase in the order ba stonedust a 99 pure natural calcite cd co mn a barrier width of 0 97 0 02 m was found to be required for the fluoride calcite stonedust only system when using no factor of safety whilst in the presence of mn and co the width increased to 2 76 0 28 and 19 83 0 37 m respectively in comparison the pso model predicted a required barrier thickness of 46 0 62 6 50 3 m respectively for the fluoride calcite mn and co systems under the same conditions graphical abstract image keywords permeable reactive barrier defluoridation metals kinetics hill model pseudo second order 1 introduction fluoride in drinking water within the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 who 2011 is regarded as being beneficial for bones and teeth while an excessive intake will result in dental or skeletal problems fan et al 2003 with many parts of the world reliant on groundwater for daily life fluoride contamination of these resources is a serious problem fan et al 2003 nigussie et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 fluoride contamination can be caused by natural geological processes or anthropogenic activity such as coal fired power stations beryllium extraction brick and iron processing aluminum smelting etc turner et al 2005b for example the hydro aluminum smelter at kurri kurri nsw australia has rendered the nearby groundwater contaminated with fluoride as high as 2000 mg l 1 due to the historical disposal of spent pot lining spl a hazardous by product of the industry sleap et al 2013 metals such as manganese cobalt cadmium barium etc have also been shown to be leached from spl waste ghazizade and safari 2010 in recent years abundant and low cost minerals such as calcite have received considerable attention as a potential medium to remove fluoride from groundwater fan et al 2003 reardon and wang 2000 turner et al 2005b 2008 in addition calcite has also been shown to be able to adsorb metal ions including cadmium zinc barium nickel cobalt kitano et al 1976 reeder 1996 zachara et al 1988 and nutrients including phosphorus gbolo et al 2015 o connor et al 2005 with these reactions being ph dependent xu et al 1996 found that the interaction of metal ions on calcite involves 1 ion exchange with ca2 on surface 2 the formation of surface complexes with caoh and co3h groups 3 recrystallization 4 precipitation as a carbonate or hydroxyl carbonate 5 co precipitation with calcite carbonate and 6 diffusion into the solid ion exchange and co precipitation are highly dependent on the size of the adsorbing ions tunusoglu et al 2007 reported that since the ionic radius of ba 1 36 å is bigger than that of ca 0 99 å the contribution of ion exchange and co precipitation to ba removal is not significant the application of calcite for the in situ treatment of fluoride has received no attention since turner et al 2008 proposed the use of calcite as a permeable reactive barrier prb for the treatment of fluoride from spl contaminated groundwater a prb is an in situ treatment zone which consists of a reactive material capable of removing or degrading the specific target contaminant s as the groundwater moves through it under the natural hydraulic gradient present in the aquifer system turner et al 2008 one of the most important aspects of prb design is knowledge of the residence time required to achieve the desired contaminant removal limit painter 2004 which in turn can be found from kinetic studies that identify the rate determining stage of a reaction fan et al 2003 found that the process of fluoride removal by calcite could be better described by pseudo second order kinetics meaning the process is controlled by chemisorption cd sorption by calcite is thought to be described with a reversible first order kinetic model according to the work of ahmed et al 2008 with the rate determining step dependent identified as the energy required to overcome the bond between co3 2 and ca2 to date numerous studies have been published on the sorption of trace metals onto calcite comans and middelburg 1987 cowan et al 1990 elzinga et al 2006 farley et al 1985 however no study of the effect of metal ions on fluoride removal kinetics by calcite has been reported as the kinetics of geochemical reactions determine the required permeable reactive barrier prb thickness roehl et al 2005 and given the potential adverse impacts metals can have on a calcite prb it is of importance to understand their impact on the kinetics of the fluoride remediation process this study uses four kinetic models i e the intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order kinetics and the newly described hill 4 and hill 5 models turner et al 2015 to determine the influence of individual metal ions co mn cd and ba on the kinetics of fluoride removal by a calcite prb to account for the different number of parameters between models each analyses were subsequently compared on the basis of the akaike information criterion aic and the schwarz bayseian information criterion bic according to turner et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 calcite the calcite used in the present study was a product called stonedust which was obtained from the moore creek sulcor limestone member located near tamworth nsw australia and sieved into particle size fraction of 150 μm this particle size was chosen due to its rapid dissolution reaction and superior fluoride removal compared to larger sized fractions sleap et al 2011b approximately 13 32 g of calcite was pre weighed to keep a constant solid liquid ratio of 33 3 g l 1 analysis of stonedust was done using xrf and multipoint kr brunauer emmett teller bet surface area techniques the results showed that the sample was 99 pure calcite and 1 mgo optical grade iceland spar calcite 99 9 purity down under minerals victoria australia was crushed in an agate mill and sieved to 150 μm as per the work of turner et al 2005b iceland spar experiments were used to compare the removal of fluoride by that of the stonedust calcite 2 2 synthetic solutions a fluoride stock solution 105 3 mmol l 1 or 2000 mg l 1 was prepared using anhydrous potassium fluoride kf sigma aldrich and spiked with an aliquot of the spectroscopic metal standard sigma aldrich such that a final metal concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 was obtained when diluted with deionized di water produced by a millipore milli q 185 water deionizer 18 2 mω cm 1 test solutions were prepared from the respective metal fluoride stock solution by a 1 10 dilution to give a final concentration of 10 5 mmol l 1 200 mg l 1 of fluoride ion and 0 01 mmol l 1 of metal ion an arbitrary consistent metal concentration of approximately 0 01 mmol l 1 was used as an initial worst case test scenario analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms with detection limits of 0 01 mg l 1 for co mn cd and ba based on the procedure of instrument detection limit idl method detection level mdl and practical quantitation limit pql showed that the initial concentration of all metals in the final metal fluoride solution was 0 101 0 017 mmol l 1 all initial test solutions had a ph of 6 61 0 04 actual initial concentration was determined by ion chromatography using an ics 5000 ion chromatograph thermo fisher with a 1 3 μm fluoride limit of detection based on iso 5725 2 3 kinetic tests the free drift methodology was selected in the current kinetic experiments as this method is most useful for studying the systems near equilibrium plummer et al 1978 electronic overhead stirrers jeio tech msp 3 were used to provide the required constant stirring rate of 200 rpm ph and fluoride concentrations were measured using orion ph 9165bn and fluoride 9609bn electrodes orion pacific australia calibrations of ph electrodes were undertaken using ph 4 7 and 10 nist buffers until a slope between 92 and 102 was achieved fluoride electrodes were calibrated using kf standard solutions spanning the range 0 105 3 mmol l 1 or 2000 mg l 1 until a slope of 54 2 mv decade 1 was attained exact concentrations of fluoride calibration standards were obtained by ion chromatography ic and the calibration curves for the fluoride ise were determined all experiments were conducted in a constant laboratory temperature of 20 0 2 c the electrodes were connected to an 8 channel datalogger to record ph and fluoride concentration at selected time intervals in addition experiments using 200 mg l 1 fluoride only no metals under the same conditions were used to assess the effect of temperature on the rate of fluoride removal by calcite at the beginning of the test 400 ml of solution containing 10 5 mmol l 1 200 mg l 1 fluoride and either 0 or 0 01 mmol l 1 metal ions was poured into five 500 ml beakers respectively ph and fluoride electrodes were inserted and stirring initiated after 3 min pre weighed sieved calcite 150 μm 33 3 g l 1 was then quickly added to each beaker experiments allowed to run for 3 days to ensure system equilibration at the start and the end of each experiment samples were taken for anion f cl s o 4 2 and p o 4 3 and cation ca 2 na k mg 2 analysis via ion chromatography samples were analysed by icpms for metal concentration ph and fluoride ion selective electrode ise were recalibrated to determine any drift in the calibration over time no discernable change in calibration was detected at any time the percentage of fluoride removal can be expressed as follows lü et al 2010 1 r c o c e c o 100 where c o is the initial fluoride concentration mg l 1 c e is the equilibrium fluoride concentration mg l 1 r is the removal efficiency the fluoride removal was also calculated on a mg g 1 basis 2 r e c o c e m where c o and c e are as defined above r e is the amount of removed fluoride per mass of calcite mg g 1 m is the solid liquid ratio used in the study 33 3 g l 1 2 4 geochemical modelling it is of benefit to know that if there are sufficient free aqueous metal ions available in the solution as the metal speciation may vary with ph values for this purpose the geochemical program phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the distribution of aqueous metal and fluoride species in the current study the wateq4f database was selected to model the experimental data to ensure all the required species were included model ph was altered via the addition of hno3 since hno3 does not interfere with metal speciation no complexation or fluoride concentration at ph 5 2 as a result of the geochemical modelling predicted fluoride removal and concentrations of each metal speciation versus ph could be obtained 2 5 kinetic modelling the data obtained from the experiments were fitted to the selected models namely pseudo second order kinetics pso intra particle diffusion ipd and hill models the pseudo second order pso kinetics model ho and mckay 1998 is given by 3 t q t 1 k p s o q e 2 t q e where q t mg g 1 is the amount of fluoride removal at time t q e mg g 1 is the sorption capacity at equilibrium k pso is pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the pso instantaneous sorption rate h pso mg g 1 min 1 ho and mckay 1998 is defined by 4 h p s o k p s o q e 2 the intra particle diffusion ipd kinetics model of weber and morris 1964 is given by 5 q t k i t 0 5 c i where c i refers to the boundary layer thickness and k i is intra particle diffusion rate constant if the plot q t vs t 0 5 is multi linear then the adsorption process is influenced by more than one step which means intra particle diffusion is the not only factor that will affect the adsorption process zhang et al 2011 the hill equation hill 1910 and variants thereof goutelle et al 2008 have been reported widely in the area of pharmacology physiology enzymology biochemistry etc however it is only very recently turner et al 2015 that the hill model has been successfully used in geochemistry the four parameter hill hill 4 model turner et al 2015 is given by 6 q t d a d 1 t k h i l l 4 n where d mg g 1 is the minimum amount of fluoride removed as t 0 a mg g 1 is the maximum removal capacity t is time k hill4 min is the time where 50 of the observed removal a d 2 occurs i e half life time and n is the hill parameter unitless which describes the steepness sigmoidicity of the curve the turner rate constant t hill4 g mg 1 min 1 which is dimensionally equivalent to k pso the pso rate constant is 7 t h i l l 4 1 k h i l l 4 a d and the hill instantaneous sorption rate h hill4 mg g 1 min 1 equivalent to h pso the pso instantaneous sorption rate is defined as 8 h h i l l 4 a d k h i l l 4 the five parameter hill hill 5 model can be described as turner et al 2015 9 q t d a d 1 t k h i l l 5 n e as can be seen from eqs 6 and 9 the hill 4 and 5 models that the latter eq 9 includes the parameter e which allows for modelling asymmetry in geochemical kinetic reactions incorporating the asymmetry factor the hill 5 reaction half life is given by turner et al 2015 10 t 0 5 k h i l l 5 2 1 e 1 1 n by setting e 1 in eqs 9 and 10 the hill 5 equation eq 9 becomes equivalent to hill 4 eq 6 and half life time t 0 5 k hill4 which implies that hill 4 model is a simplified version of hill 5 model i e they are nested models motulsky and christopoulos 2004 similarly the pso model is a simplified version of the hill 4 model by setting n 1 d 0 a q e since the pso model is a nested or simpler version of the hill models hill 4 hill 5 it follows that successful application of the hill model implies that surface chemisorption plays an important role in the system under study zhang et al 2011 eqs 11 and 12 define the turner rate constant t hill5 and initial sorption rate h hill5 for the hill 5 model 11 t h i l l 5 1 t 0 5 a d 12 h h i l l 5 t h i l l 5 a 2 2 6 model fitting evaluation in order to identify the most suitable model the correlation coefficient r2 aic akaike information criterion and bic schwarz bayesian information criterion were used for model selection turner et al 2015 the r2 is efficient in evaluating the goodness of fit of each model to the data however it is not a good method for comparing the fits between models with differing numbers of parameters the aic and bic incorporate both the goodness of fit r2 and the number of model parameters enabling a relative measurements of the goodness of fit between models the aic is defined as akaike 1974 13 a i c n ln r s s n 2 p 1 where n is the number of data points rss represents the sum of squared residuals and p is the number of model parameters the bic can be described as schwarz 1978 14 b i c n ln r s s n p 1 l n n the difference between aic and bic is that the latter includes an extra penalty term for the number of data points this makes the bic more conservative and guarantees the selection of a simpler model as the best model as the number of data points tends to infinity foubert et al 2002 wagenmakers and farrell 2004 the advantages and disadvantages of these two information criterions can be found in the previous work conducted by burnham and anderson 2002 wagenmakers 2007 normally a lower more negative aic bic value indicates the more suitable model but it is still difficult to give an exact interpretation for the results to make the selection of the best model easier information criterion weights w i ic eq 15 and or evidence ratios er eq 16 motulsky and christopoulos 2004 result in a single number which simply reflects how much better one model fits the data over another are used 15 w i i c exp 0 5 δ i i c k 1 k exp 0 5 δ k i c 16 e r 1 e 0 5 δ i i c where ic is the information criterion aic or bic δ i i c equals to the difference in the information criterion between the ith model and the best candidate model i e δ i i c i c i i c min moreover the bayes factor kass 1993 kass and raftery 1995 calculations can also be utilized with the bic as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one model over another jeffreys 1939 by inspection it is also equivalent to the evidence ratio and or inverse of the relative criterion weights turner et al 2015 17 2 ln b j k b i c k b i c j where b jk stands for the bayes factor for of model j versus model k when 1 b jk 3 there is evidence for model k being the more suitable model but the evidence is not worth a mention when 3 b jk 20 the evidence is positive when 20 b jk 150 the evidence is strong when b jk 150 the evidence is very strong kass and raftery 1995 to compare the fitting of alternative mathematical models knowledge of the error structure to confirm the assumptions of error independency normality and constancy of variance is necessary askelöf et al 1976 when the error distribution of the system is not known the uncertainty in the values of the model parameters along with more realistic confidence intervals cis can be obtained from the application of monte carlo computations mishra et al 2011 motulsky and ransnas 1987 however due to the large number of data points available in each experiment the error structure is not likely to affect modelling conclusions in this study however monte carlo computations 1 000 for the model identified as the best fitting model were done for each experiment to generate the 95 confidence intervals graphpad prism 6 04 2014 was used to produce the monte carlo simulations in addition the question as to whether the set of fitted parameters are unique and well constrained by the data is addressed by applying the method of johnson et al 2009a b to develop a confidence contour analysis this is done by plotting the dependence of the sum square error on each pair of constrained parameters while all remaining parameters are unconstrained to during the least squares fitting process a well constrained model is defined by a finite number or ideally a unique set of solutions for the model parameters for a given data set the covariance matrix graphpad prism 6 04 reports the normalized covariance for each pair of fitted parameters if the dependency of any single parameter is high then the covariance with at least one other parameter will also be high therefore the covariance matrix allows potentially poorly constrained parameters to be identified the normalised covariance ranges from 1 to 1 with 0 indicating the parameter pair are completely independent and 1 or 1 indicating the parameter pair are completely redundant dependency values up to 0 95 are not uncommon and are not necessarily a sign that a parameter is redundant however 0 99 may suggest one or more parameters may be redundant prism 2015 in this study any pair of parameters with a covariance value 0 98 was analysed by generating a confidence contour plot for those parameters to determine if these parameters were in fact poorly constrained 3 results and discussion 3 1 phreeqc modelling the distribution of metal speciation over the ph range 2 11 without the presence of calcite was obtained via geochemical phreeqc modelling results indicate that there are more than 96 7 of free ba remaining in the solution at equilibrium over the ph range studied while approximately 29 3 of co 16 7 of cd and 20 of mn are removed mainly through the complexation with oh it is worth noting that only very small amount of fluoride 0 2 is lost via metal complexation based on the degree of speciation the remaining free concentrations of metal ions can be calculated for example after complexation 70 7 of free co remain in the solution at equilibrium reducing the available co from 0 115 mmol l 1 to 0 081 mmol l 1 similarly for the system with mn the free concentration is decreased to 0 091 mmol l 1 3 2 calcite surface area surface area analysis of the 150 μm stonedust by kr bet revealed a surface area of 0 277 0 005 m2 g 1 assuming a 1 1 ion to surface site reaction and a surface site density of 1 ca atom per 20 å2 stipp 1999 then there are 2 3 μmol g 1 of surface sites consequently in these experiments using 33 3 g l 1 calcite there are a possible 75 9 μmol ca sites or only enough adsorption sites for 0 08 of the initial fluoride load however for the metal ions at an initial concentration 0 115 mmol l 1 there is enough metal to form approximately 1 5 monolayers i e only 65 of the initial metals have access to a surface site allowing a potentially significant impact on the reaction kinetics 3 3 kinetics fig 1 a and b respectively shows the overall kinetic results of fluoride removal for each experiment alongside the ph evolution curves kinetic analysis of the fluoride experimental data was done based on intra particle diffusion ipd pseudo second order pso hill 4 and hill 5 models and the results of the fitting can be seen in fig 2 a f table 1 shows the model selection criterion values r2 aic and bic for the four kinetic models all models appear to describe the experimental data very well with good r2 values mostly r2 0 9 however the r2 value cannot be used to compare models with different number of parameters whereas the aic bic values can with a more negative information criterion value indicating a more favorable model by simple visual inspection of fig 2 the hill 5 model shows the best fit to all experiments application of the aic bic theory table 2 shows that in all six experiments both the hill 5 and 4 models ranked first and second respectively among the models tested having the lowest most negative aic bic values fitting of data to the pso model indicates that surface chemisorption plays an important role in the reaction kinetics zhang et al 2011 since the pso model is a nested or simpler version of the hill models it follows that application of the hill models also indicates that chemisorption dominates the reaction kinetics a less ambiguous way of interpreting the aic bic values is through the calculation of information criterion weights eq 15 and evidence ratios eq 16 for example the co experiment evidence ratios table 2 indicates that based on the aic the hill 5 model is 9 25 1029 and 1 39 1028 times more favourable than the next best fitting model hill 4 based on the aic and bic calculations respectively in addition assessment of model fits based on the bayes factor eq 17 in every case resulted in a bayes factor bf 150 table 1 indicating that there is very strong evidence that the hill 5 model is the best fitting model in all cases kass and raftery 1995 the parameters of each fitted model shown in fig 2 are presented in tables 3 and 4 with table 5 showing 95 confidence intervals ci generated from 1000 monte carlo computations for the best fitting model analysis of the simulations showed that in all cases the observed data fall within the 95 cis of the hill 5 model supporting the assumptions of error independency normality and constancy of variance this is not surprising as the error structure is not likely to affect modeling conclusions to any large extent given the number of data points 7800 in each experiment to determine if the parameters are well constrained by the data a confidence contour analysis was performed on all pair wise parameters identified as having a high covariance 3 4 confidence contour analysis analysis of the covariance matrix for each model fit showed that for all pair wise parameter combinations the covariance was 0 96 experiments with iceland spar indicated the highest covariance 0 999 between hill 5 parameters n and e which shows that these parameters were potentially redundant to determine if the best fits for iceland spar table 4 were well constrained by the data a confidence contour analysis was undertaken by constraining the values of n and e these parameters were systematically varied around the area of best fit at each n e pair the model was fitted by allowing all other remaining parameters to vary and converge to the best fit the normalised reduced sum of squares rss norm was determined for each fit by dividing the best fit rss min by the rss x y calculated at each subsequent fit of n e pairs 18 r s s norm r s s min r s s x y to explore a larger space over which the parameters can vary the selected values of n and e spanned an interval greater than that of the predicted 95 confidence intervals table 5 the two dimensional confidence contour plot for iceland spar fig 3 shows that the parameters are in fact well constrained with the 95 confidence contour very close to that predicted from the monte carlo analysis table 5 supporting the fact that the monte carlo resampling technique can be a reliable method of determining how well model parameters are constrained by the data johnson et al 2009b 3 5 effect of metal ions on fluoride removal kinetics according to somasundaran and agar 1967 the phpzc point of zero charge of calcite is in the range 8 9 5 table 6 shows that the initial phs of all samples are 6 6 indicating that anion e g fluoride removal is favored since the ph phpzc due to the positively charged calcite surface fig 1 shows the fluoride removal kinetics and the corresponding ph evolution curves as calcite dissolves the ph of the system increases quickly changing the calcite surface from positive to negative this decreases fluoride adsorption and increases metal adsorption and precipitation normally metal removal starts with a fast adsorption eq 19 followed by a slow co precipitation recrystallization or incorporation into the calcite lattice davis et al 1987 lakshtanov and stipp 2007 zachara et al 1988 with the adsorption of metal ions being ionic radius rmetal dependent 19 ca surface m aq 2 m surface ca aq 2 where m represents metals co mn cd and ba zachara et al 1988 metals with larger ionic radii such as ba rmetal rca table 7 are likely to be weakly adsorbed by calcite while those with smaller rmetal co mn cd etc will be more strongly adsorbed zachara et al 1991 therefore calcite metal selectivity theoretically follows the order cd mn co ba according to the ionic radius given in table 7 if only adsorption is considered however metal ions form complexes in the bulk solution and undergo desorption reactions with cd and mn having limited sorption reversibility while co has been found to be readily desorb from calcite zachara et al 1991 moreover other reactions such as solid lattice incorporation co precipitation and recrystallization will take place during and after adsorption comans and middelburg 1987 davis et al 1987 stipp et al 1992 zachara et al 1991 the effect of metal ions on fluoride removal figs 1 2 can be expressed in three ways either a variation in the amount of fluoride removed at equilibrium the fluoride removal rate as given by the instantaneous sorption rate h or the half life t 0 5 of the reaction the two types of calcite stonedust and iceland spar used as the control experiments no metal shows that there is no significant difference in the equilibrium fluoride removal when using the different types of calcite for the best fitting hill5 model the defluoridation amount for the blank stonedust no metal was found to be 3 83 mg g 1 while that for iceland spar no metal was 3 87 mg g 1 the addition of cd resulted in no change 0 04 mg g 1 in equilibrium fluoride removal compared to that of the blanks the presence of ba and mn increased fluoride removal by 0 12 and 0 2 mg g 1 respectively above the upper 95 ci of the blanks table 5 with co found to suppress fluoride removal by 0 2 0 3 mg g below the lower ci s of the calcite using the upper and lower 95 ci s to compare the range of instantaneous sorption parameters h hill5 table 5 it can be seen that iceland spar experienced the most rapid fluoride removal 7 6 0 2 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 followed by the blank stonedust ba and cd experiments all these have experienced approximately the same removal rate 6 0 0 3 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 experiments using mn 5 0 0 2 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 and co 4 8 0 4 x 10 3 mg g 1 min 1 had the lowest h hill5 values and were therefore the slowest this is also reflected in the half life t 0 5 values tables 4 and 5 which increased in the order iceland spar ba stonedust cd co mn with mn and co in comparison to the stonedust blank requiring more than 120 min to remove half their respective predicted fluoride removal mn in the presence of calcite undergoes irreversible chemisorption causing a strong inhibition of the dissolution process paquette and reeder 1995 vinson et al 2007 zachara et al 1991 using 2 μm mn calcite dissolution was almost completely inhibited due to the strong affinity of mn for carbonate ions in both solution and solid surface vinson et al 2007 proposed that the formation of surface complexes reduced the number of calcite reactive sites thereby inhibiting calcite dissolution however the initial inhibition appears to be overcome as the observed f removal at equilibrium is as much as 0 2 mg g 1 more than the corresponding blank experiment this may be attributed to the small mn radius allowing exchange of ca in the calcite lattice combined with the formation of positive surface sites co3 mnδ van cappellen et al 1993 according to freij et al 2004 in the presence of co calcite dissolution rate decreases with time as adsorption of co occurs at step edges and kinks where calcium dissolution normally occurs the fastest turner et al 2005a fig 1 shows that in the presence of co the initial fluoride removal curve keeps pace with the other experiments after 1000 min a marked decrease in the rate of fluoride removal occurs indicating a slowing in the rate of calcite dissolution as supported by freij et al 2004 in addition greer et al 2004 reported that co precipitated on the calcite surface even when the solution was undersaturated with respect to coco3 consequently it is also possible that co precipitation reduces the transport controlled dissolution of calcite and hence reduces the rate and extent of fluoride removal as observed in fig 1 the presence of cd in the system presented in this study did not appear to affect the fluoride removal kinetics with neither the equilibrium fluoride removal the instantaneous sorption parameter nor the half life significantly different from that observed in the blank calcite experiments it has been shown davis et al 1987 zachara et al 1991 that in the presence of calcite at ph 8 0 mixed at 30 rpm cd is rapidly removed from solution in the first few 5 minutes of exposure with uptake likely occurring at discrete sites on the calcite surface data from fig 1b indicates that the system does not exceed ph 8 0 at 200 rpm for a period of 6 5 min indicating that cd adsorption had sufficient time to occur without any influence from precipitation from the bulk solution overall cd does not appear to significantly affect fluoride removal by calcite far from equilibrium however it is interesting to note that over the first 50 min fluoride removal is completely inhibited in the presence of cd with the ph evolution exhibiting a much slower rise compared to all other experiments fig 4 this reflects the high affinity of cd for calcite which subsequently inhibits calcite dissolution the fact that cd was not found to affect the system closer to equilibrium was attributed to the fact that cd is similar in size to ca therefore it quickly 60 min diffused deeper into the calcite lattice stipp 1999 causing an equal flux of ca out of the lattice as there was only enough cd present for 1 5 monolayers of cd adsorption section 3 2 eventually fresh calcite layers were exposed resulting in continued dissolution and fluoride removal as observed after 50 min consequently far from equilibrium we observed inhibition to fluoride removal for the first 50 min fig 4a derived from fig 1b shows the evolution of system ph over the first 20 min of reaction prior to the addition of calcite all initial t 0 min solution ph values were 6 61 0 04 upon the addition of calcite immediately after t 0 min both stonedust and iceland spar showed an extremely rapid increase in ph reaching 10 0 in 1 min this rapid increase in ph is due to the consumption of initial dissolved co2 during the calcite dissolution reaction sleap et al 2013 the presence of ba in solution does not interfere with calcite dissolution as the ph increases in step with the control samples peaking at ph 10 in 1 min in addition the half life and instantaneous sorption values are also approximately the same as those of the blank stonedust no metal experiment indicating that ba does not affect calcite dissolution and therefore fluoride is removed as caf2 this is supported by zachara et al 1991 and tunusoglu et al 2007 who reported that ba did not undergo any significant sorption by calcite most likely due to the inability of the calcite lattice to accommodate ba ions at calcium sites because of ionic radii differences and consequently the contribution to ba removal by ion exchange and co precipitation sorption mechanisms is not significant interestingly the rate of change in solution ph and the observed ph maxima increases in the order of cd mn co ba calcite which is in the same order as the calcite metal selectivity as reported by zachara et al 1991 since slow ph increase is also indicative of inhibited calcite dissolution compared to the blank control samples we can conclude that far from equilibrium fluoride removal is affected by the presence of mn co and cd however as equilibrium is almost attained only mn and co appear to affect fluoride removal by calcite 3 6 permeable reactive barrier prb design a number of variables including groundwater temperature dissolved carbon dioxide as well as aquifer heterogeneity will all affect the design of a calcite prb sleap et al 2011a showed that the rate of fluoride removal by calcite decreases with decreasing temperature and that any initial amount of dissolved co2 aq is rapidly consumed resulting in the rate of reaction being dependent on how fast co2 is replenished sleap et al 2011b fig 5 shows the effect of temperature on the removal of fluoride 200 mg l 1 by calcite at an atmospheric co2 concentration of 10 3 5 atm a temperature decrease of 5 and 10 c from 20 c increases the reaction half life and therefore the residence time by a factor of 2 and 3 75 respectively and consequently groundwater temperature should be factored into the prb design the heterogeneity of an aquifer inherently affects the performance of prbs due to the variability in hydraulic gradient and aquifer permeability hemsi and shackelford 2006 hemsi and shackelford 2006 define probabilistic safety factors sfs for prb design as scaling factors by which a prb thickness can be multiplied in order to account for uncertainty of more realistic scenarios such as aquifer heterogeneity a sf commonly used is of the order of 2 with values as high as 10 reported in aquifers with higher levels of heterogeneity in aquifer permeability hemsi and shackelford 2006 the thickness of a prb and the prevailing hydraulic gradient are the two main factors that govern the residence time of a contaminant within the prb roehl et al 2005 consequently the design of a prb can be defined by the geochemical reaction half life and the equation as given by roehl et al 2005 20 b v t r s f where b is the reactive barrier thickness m v is the groundwater flow velocity m day 1 t r is the contaminant residence time day and sf is safety factor given that the actual flow velocity through the barrier can be significantly underestimated due to the formation of preferential flow paths using the model parameters of the best fitting hill5 model table 4 in conjunction with the solver function in ms excel the residence time t r of each fluoride metal contaminant solution was determined at 99 9 of the respective equilibrium fluoride removal eq 20 was then used to determine the required prb thickness at a nominal groundwater velocity of 0 1 m day 1 model parameter sensitivity analysis was also done using the upper and lower bound 95 ci s table 5 to determine the effect on the predicted prb thickness fig 6 shows the calculated prb thickness required for each experiment as expected the required prb thickness increases with a higher demand for fluoride removal for the control blank using sf 1 the predicted barrier thickness was found to be 0 97 0 02 m for 99 9 fluoride removal the required width for the calcite metals fluoride system must be increased by 38 for cd to 1 34 0 02 m 87 for ba to 1 81 0 05 m 185 for mn to 2 76 0 28 m and 1944 19 83 0 37 m for co in comparison the use of the pso model predicts a required barrier thickness of 67 37 m in the presence of co increasing the sf will of course directly increase the calculated prb thickness as per eq 20 consequently prb installation requires comprehensive in situ characterization to determine aquifer heterogeneity and hence the impact on its final design hemsi and shackelford 2006 4 conclusion modelling of the kinetic data showed that far from equilibrium the presence of metal ions mn cd and co did affect the calcite dissolution reaction closer to equilibrium only mn and co were found to affect the system since the sorption capacities instantaneous sorption coefficients and half lives of mn and co samples were significantly different from the 95 ci of the corresponding control sample overall the fluoride sorption rate was found to increase in the order of ba cd blank mn co application of the derived kinetic parameters showed that a barrier of 0 97 m was determined to be required to achieve up to 99 9 fluoride removal in a fluoride calcite raw only system in the presence of mn and co the required thicknesses for a calcite permeable reactive barrier were found to be to 2 76 0 28 m and 19 83 0 37 m respectively at a groundwater flow of 0 1 m day 1 in comparison the pso model predicted a required barrier thickness of 66 53 m respectively under the same conditions acknowledgement this research was funded by the australian research council arc linkage program lp100200488 in conjunction with

19819,authigenic nanoparticles containing iron fe and phosphorus p have been identified at the anoxic oxic interface of various aquatic ecosystems forming upon the oxidation of reduced fe little is known about the prevalence of these authigenic nanoparticles in streams their impact on biogeochemical fluxes or the bioavailability of p associated with them in this paper we used transmission electron microscopy to document the presence of authigenic amorphous nanoparticles rich in fe and p in baseflow of streams in the southern piedmont region of the u s we used a simple centrifugation and ultrafiltration technique to separate authigenic nanoparticles from truly dissolved 1 kda and crystalline mineral coarse organic fractions in baseflow employing three different quality control methods to verify a successful separation x ray diffraction electron microscopy and stoichiometry of fe and aluminum this allowed us to quantify the amount of fe and p in three different fractions of baseflow truly dissolved authigenic nanoparticles and crystalline mineral coarse organic particles for the rural and urban stream in our study on average authigenic nanoparticles in baseflow transport 66 of fe with baseflow concentrations ranging from 80 μg l to 650 μg l authigenic nanoparticles also transport an average of 38 of reactive p depending upon seasonality and time elapsed since the last storm event keywords authigenic colloids nanoparticles particle size distribution particulate phosphorus 1 introduction in many watersheds baseflow conditions are the predominant hydrologic condition punctuated occasionally by stormflow particulate phosphorus pp can comprise the majority of baseflow p loading in many watersheds not impacted by wastewater and is often associated with particulate iron fe since p is the limiting nutrient in many aquatic ecosystems small increases decreases in baseflow p loading can cause a large biotic response taylor et al 2014 iron can restrict the availability of p to organisms via abiotic binding mechanisms therefore it is important to understand the sources and transport of both fe and p in aquatic ecosystems at baseflow the particulate fraction of p and fe is typically defined using an operational 0 45 μm filtration cutoff however pp and particulate fe tend to be understudied and underestimated in waters due to some fe and p containing nanoparticles which pass through standard 0 45 μm filters and are therefore counted as dissolved hens and merckx 2002 richardson and reddy 2013 naturally occurring authigenic amorphous nanoparticles containing fe and p have been identified at the oxic anoxic boundary of numerous aquatic ecosystems including lacustrine sediments buffle et al 1989 lienemann et al 1999 streams atteia et al 1998 groundwater hartland et al 2015 and estuaries gunnars et al 2002 these particles are thought to result from exfiltration of groundwater rich in reduced fe baken et al 2013 which is oxidized either abiotically grift et al 2014 or biotically emerson 2015 ferrous fe2 oxidation in the presence of other dissolved constituents such as calcium phosphate and silicate results in amorphous nanoparticles with p fe ratios dependent upon respective solute concentrations of these elements châtellier et al 2013 senn et al 2015 grift et al 2016 studies have shown that limiting stoichiometric p fe molar ratios in these amorphous hydroxyphosphates can range from 1 2 up to 1 1 thibault et al 2009 baken et al 2016 these particles are further stabilized by interactions with dissolved organic matter gaffney et al 2008 bollyn et al 2016 which can result in slow aggregation of fe oxides in streams on the order of days to weeks laxen and michael chandler 1983 the small size and slow aggregation of these particles means that once formed they could easily be transported the length of a river during baseflow and therefore could impact the biogeochemistry of downstream lakes reservoirs estuaries as well fe containing crystalline mineral particles in contrast generally originate on the uplands floodplain or streambank and are delivered to a stream via overland flow or interflow baseflow through the soil matrix their p fe ratios are generally driven by either sorption on the surface of the particle or incorporation into the crystalline matrix of the mineral particle itself theoretically p fe can be as high as 1 2 for sorption assuming all sorption sites are equal and in situations with very high phosphate concentrations golterman 1995 but studies have shown that in reality sorption sites are not equal and therefore in natural systems the p fe ratio will be much lower than 1 2 miltenburg and golterman 1998 baken et al 2016 several studies to date have used transmission electron microscopy tem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and electron diffraction saed to identify amorphous fe p particles leppard et al 1989 while this is a nice tool for quantifying the size chemistry and mineralogy of individual nanoparticles tem does not generally scale up well to characterize the properties of grab samples unless hundreds of samples are analyzed which can be very expensive and time consuming in this regard tem should be considered a complement to wet chemistry techniques not a replacement for it other studies have ignored crystallinity and have instead focused on separating p containing colloids into different size fractions using classical filtration hartland et al 2015 or field flow fractionation fff baalousha et al 2006 however isolating colloidal fractions based on filtration has been shown to be problematic due to clogging of filters which tends to underestimate the colloidal fraction morrison and benoit 2001 zirkler et al 2012 and while fff is a nice tool for size separation and subsequent analysis of the size fractions via icp ms in and of itself it is not an effective technique for confirming whether particles in different bins are crystalline particles or amorphous colloids or some mixture thereof x ray absorption spectroscopy has been used in a few studies which have not addressed p but have instead focused on partitioning fe colloids between authigenic free oxides and clay particles baken et al 2013 regelink et al 2014 to learn more about the role of authigenic particles in biogeochemical cycling and nutrient fluxes techniques are needed to easily yet effectively separate them from the remaining particles and solutes in grab samples in order to analyze either the particles in solution or on filtration membranes or to set up microcosm bioavailability experiments for these reasons we used a combination approach of particle by particle analyses to verify the presence of amorphous particles along with elemental analysis of grab samples following centrifugal separation and quality control in order to overcome these limitations of previous studies validating the separation of amorphous particles from crystalline particles using x ray diffraction xrd and electron microscopy is a novel approach and a primary objective of our study this study addresses the following research questions can authigenic amorphous nanoparticles containing fe and p be effectively separated from crystalline mineral particles and coarse organic matter based on differences in particle size and density in stream baseflow can xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and or the stoichiometry of fe al be used as quality controls to ensure that amorphous nanoparticles were successfully separated from crystalline particles what percentage of baseflow p and fe is transported via authigenic nanoparticles 2 materials and methods 2 1 separation via size and density difference of amorphous particles gravitational settling is a relatively straightforward way to separate particles via their size and density stokes law stokes 1851 states that the settling velocity of a particle in fluid at a given gravitational force and viscosity is a function of its density along with its diameter squared while the density of amorphous fe p nanoparticles in water is difficult to directly measure and furthermore may be variable due to size dependency hiemstra and zhao 2016 studies suggest that these particles have a lower density than crystalline mineral particles due to much of the amorphous particle being comprised of pore spaces filled with water moreover amorphous particles tend to be quite small in lotic aquatic systems with sizes in streams generally ranging from a few nanometers up to 100 nm depending upon factors affecting aggregation in the watersheds in our region of the southern piedmont the vast majority of amorphous particles have a hydrodynamic diameter less than 30 nm on the other hand crystalline mineral particles in baseflow tend to be larger though not much data exists on detailed particle size distributions of mineral particles in baseflow our data from the southern piedmont suggest that the vast majority of crystalline mineral particles tend to be larger than 100 nm 100 nm is also above the minimum size of suspended particles of mica and kaolinite in the amazon river reported by gibbs 1977 and above that given by grim 1953 for clay particles of kaolinite and illite although they both note that some montmorillonite particles can be smaller than 100 nm xrd data show that baseflow particles in our watershed primarily consist of quartz montmorillonite illite and kaolinite which have densities ranging from 2 5 to 2 8 g cm3 our watershed at baseflow also contains numerous species of diatoms most of which have a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 5 μm fig s1 because crystalline mineral particles and diatoms are generally much larger than the amorphous particles in our watershed the crystalline particles are also denser particle settling is a good option for isolating the amorphous mineral particles this allows various analyses to be conducted on the unfiltered water sample along with the sample containing the amorphous particles the difference between the two being associated with mineral particles and diatoms ultrafiltration can then be performed on the supernatant with the difference being attributable to amorphous particles we used pall macrosep 1 kda centrifugal filters in our experiment which are constructed of low binding polyethersulfone using a centrifuge to speed up the particle settling from that of quiescent gravity settling we can estimate the length of time needed to settle out certain size fractions of mineral particles and the fraction of amorphous particles that will be left behind however there are numerous circumstances which can either slow down or speed up settling of nanoparticles such as brownian motion scott et al 2005 non spherical particles hindered settling ham and homsy 1988 slip correction factor or aggregation to form larger particles smoluchowski 1917 these factors can be more or less an issue for a given water sample based on variables such as ph and conductivity therefore quality controls are needed to ensure that the crystalline particles are indeed removed upon centrifugation but that amorphous nanoparticles are not 2 2 potential quality controls for separation verification one of the most definitive quality controls to distinguish between crystalline and amorphous particles is xrd on both the centrifuge supernatant and the plug of particles at the bottom of the test tubes if enough sample is centrifuged then there will be ample particles to detect an xrd signal from the crystalline minerals after centrifugation the supernatant can be filtered through a membrane filter with very small pores to catch the nanoparticles clay particles on a membrane filter show a preferential orientation for their 001 and 002 planes and so even in small quantities they are sensitive to detection via xrd moore and reynolds 1997 if the crystalline mineral particles are successfully removed via centrifugation then the supernatant should show no diffraction peaks yet the particle plug removed via centrifuge should show strong peaks for the minerals typically present in a given watershed fig s2 sem images can then be used as an additional quality control determining the presence absence of 25 nm particles is well within the range of most sem instruments the morphology of particles can be used to distinguish between crystalline mineral particles and amorphous particles as crystalline pedogenic particles tend to have distinct morphologies fig s3 in most watersheds a third potential quality control is the analysis of al and fe in the grab sample compared to the centrifuge filtrate al is the third most common element in the earth s crust and many of the most prevalent mineral particles contain quite high levels of al e g feldspars and aluminosilicate clays in contrast amorphous fe p particles generally only have trace amounts of al furthermore the solubility of al in most circumneutral natural waters is extremely low jones et al 1974 truly dissolved al concentrations in streamwater are typically less than 2 μg l in our watersheds which implies that most of the detectable al in the supernatant can be attributed to mineral particles therefore if xrd and sem analyses suggest that crystalline particles have been removed via centrifuging then the al content of the supernatant should also be very low compared to the raw sample yet the fe concentration should be relatively high we used ultrafiltration with a 1 kda filter 30 min centrifugation at 3 000g to calculate the truly dissolved al and fe concentrations 2 3 study area our study site is the falls lake watershed within the north carolina piedmont near raleigh durham the u s piedmont is a highly weathered landform between the coastal plain and the appalachian mountains from new jersey south to alabama soils in the piedmont tend to be deep with groundwater residence times as long as 20 years rose and fullagar 2005 in highly weathered landscapes such as the piedmont fe tends to be conserved in soils and sediments due to its poor solubility megonigal et al 2004 more information on the piedmont and the falls lake watershed can be found in the supplemental information public data shows that fe concentrations in baseflow tend to be high throughout most areas of the u s piedmont suggesting exfiltration of groundwater rich in fe2 occurs throughout the year fe stained seeps are common throughout the region providing additional evidence for oxidation of fe upon exfiltration of groundwater fig s4 2 4 sample collection and analysis triplicate grab samples were collected monthly at baseflow conditions total suspended sediment tss 10 mg l from october 2016 to july 2017 for both an urban and rural stream in the north carolina piedmont we measured fe and p in the unfiltered samples the centrifuged supernatant 90 min at 4000g and the truly dissolved 1 kda ultrafiltration portions of the samples the crystalline amount was determined as the unfiltered minus the centrifuged supernatant and the amorphous was determined as the centrifuged supernatant minus the truly dissolved molybdate reactive p was measured via murphy riley 1962 using a 5 cm flow path to maximize spectrophotometer sensitivity iron was analyzed via flame atomic absorption aa on a perkinelmer 5100 spectrophotometer and for values less than 75 μg l was analyzed via graphite furnace aa on a perkinelmer 5100 zl furnace aluminum was analyzed via graphite furnace aa on a perkinelmer 5100 zl furnace we did not digest unfiltered samples due to the fact that the standard method for analyzing 0 45 μm filtrate does not digest before analysis despite the fact that the bulk of fe and al in the filtrate is comprised of colloids nanoparticles since we were comparing the unfiltered fe and al to that of the supernatant and of the truly dissolved fraction we did not want to bias our results by digesting one fraction and not digesting another furthermore studies have shown that colloids are in large part quantified despite not being digested kennedy et al 1974 horowitz et al 1996 to test xrd as a quality control method we filled 40 centrifuge tubes with 50 ml each of baseflow from a piedmont stream for a total of 2 l after centrifuging at 4 000g for 90 min we then slowly decanted approximately 40 ml of supernatant from each tube being careful not to disturb the small sediment plug at the bottom of the tube we reserved triplicate samples of supernatant totaling 100 ml for fe al and p analysis and filtered the remaining 1 5 l through a 0 02 μm anopore anodisc filter model 6809 5002 via vacuum filtration the remaining 10 ml in each tube containing the settled particles were given a quick stir to get them into solution and then were filtered through a separate 0 02 μm filter each filter was then analyzed via xrd with a panalytical xpert pro mrd hr instrument using cu k alpha radiation at 45 kv and 40 ma a scan range of 3 70 2 theta steps of 0 05 and a dwell time of 1 s per step highscore plus software was used for xrd peak identification and d spacing calculations after xrd we took a piece of each filter for analysis via sem samples were prepared by sputter coating with gold nanoparticles sem imaging was performed with a fei xl30 sem feg instrument samples were prepared for tem by depositing one drop of baseflow on a 200 mesh tem grid tem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and selected area electron diffraction saed was performed

filter operated at 300 kv particle size was measured via gatan digital micrograph software using tem images 2 5 public data publicly available data was downloaded from the united states geologic survey usgs database at https waterdata usgs gov nwis 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle by particle analysis fig 1 shows the types of particles typically found in baseflow for a rural stream in the southern piedmont by counting particles on tem grids we estimate that one drop of nc piedmont baseflow typically contains millions of nanoparticle aggregates particle by particle analysis shows that amorphous nanoparticles in our watershed have drastically different stoichiometry than do crystalline aluminosilicates figs 2 and 3 this makes the case for using stoichiometry of wet chemistry as a quality control to verify the separation of crystalline mineral particles from amorphous nanoparticles high resolution tem hrtem images of amorphous particles show no long range crystallinity and some particles appear to be comprised of numerous fe rich clusters of a few nanometers each fig 4 this is in line with previous research which suggests that authigenic fe p nanoparticles have high porosity and little crystallinity haadf suggests a three dimensional particle shape with little structure and eels spectra are very similar to poorly ordered ferrihydrite found in other natural systems gloter et al 2004 with fe predominantly in 3 oxidation state fig 5 particle by particle analysis shows that the p fe ratio is still much lower than the upper stoichiometric limit for these amorphous particles fig s5 suggesting that upon oxidation there is excess fe2 compared to phosphate in addition the rural stream shows a much lower and less variable p fe ratio throughout the sampling period than found in the urban stream amorphous particles show a strong relationship between fe and si fig s6 suggesting that si plays a role in the structure of these amorphous particles consistent with other studies senn et al 2015 in contrast al is minimal in the amorphous particles but can be quite high in crystalline mineral particles in our watershed fig 6 we also identified some larger amorphous particles that could be the result of biotic oxidation fig 7 as they appear similar in size morphology and fe si stoichiometry to the extracellular sheaths of fe oxidizing bacteria reported in previous research suzuki et al 2011 2013 the chemical composition is similar to other amorphous particles in our sampling it is unclear from our study what percentage of amorphous particles might be a result of abiotic vs biotic oxidation 3 2 centrifugal separation and quality controls centrifugation has long been used to separate different sizes and densities of particles from solute scott et al 2005 and has been shown to be superior to standard filtration for accurately measuring different sizes densities of particulate matter buffle and leppard 1995 gimbert et al 2005 however to our knowledge ours is the first study to specifically isolate amorphous fe p particles in centrifugal supernatant and to incorporate rigorous quality controls to ensure that they were successfully separated from crystalline mineral particles fig 8 shows a photo of the filtered supernatant and the filtered particles at the bottom of each test tube following 90 min of centrifugation at 4000 g xrd of the centrifuged particles clearly show diffraction peaks corresponding to kaolinite illite and montmorillonite clays along with quartz yet the supernatant filter shows no peaks indicating effective separation of amorphous vs crystalline fractions sem also clearly shows the much larger mineral and organic particles which are separated out via centrifugation compared to the nanoparticles remaining in the filtrate fig 9 displays the al and fe data from our separation technique using a typical baseflow sample from a piedmont stream as expected an unfiltered sample has high al yet the centrifuge supernatant has very little on the other hand the majority of fe is in the supernatant fraction 3 3 authigenic nanoparticle fractions of fe and p applying this centrifugal separation technique to various baseflow samples in the southern piedmont throughout 2016 and 2017 shows that amorphous fe nanoparticles often comprise over 50 of fe flux in baseflow ranging from approximately 80 μg l to 650 μg l depending on the date of sampling fig 10 reactive p associated with amorphous nanoparticles on average comprises 38 of the total reactive p load while no separation method is 100 accurate depending upon the particle size distribution of the amorphous particles a fraction can be removed with the crystalline particles based on the stoichiometry of individual particles versus the grab sample we estimate that 90 of crystalline particles are removed while retaining 80 of amorphous particles we believe this simple centrifugation technique might be applicable to many watersheds with groundwater rich in reduced fe depending upon the particle size distributions of amorphous versus crystalline particles in a particular watershed this would allow scientists to learn more about the biogeochemical impacts of authigenic particles on aquatic ecosystems through the use of straightforward analytical techniques and or microcosm experiments on the isolated authigenic fraction 3 4 ecological implications due to the differing reactivity of amorphous versus crystalline particles along with potentially different p fe stoichiometry it is possible that these different types of particles have different p bioavailability to biota at baseflow very little research has been conducted regarding the bioavailability of authigenic nanoparticles e g baken et al 2014 compared to truly dissolved p fractions in addition to potential differences in bioavailability the ability to partition authigenic particles is valuable in regards to understanding the sources and hydrologic pathways of fe and p transport and the potential impacts of human activities such as agricultural drainage or urbanization for example it is possible that as tile drainage increases in some agricultural watersheds more p is delivered to streams as truly dissolved orthophosphate whereas if that same phosphate containing water had made it into groundwater it might be discharged into a stream incorporated into a nanoparticle with fe it is also possible that some bmp s may better target one type of p containing particle over the other or that fe p authigenic particles might be purposefully created as pulse shunt sinks for phosphate in lotic ecosystems i e rentz et al 2009 or in wastewater treatment qu et al 2013 due to the known reactivity of amorphous fe authigenic particles could also potentially play a role in the biogeochemistry of receiving waters for example delivered in a steady supply and at relatively high concentrations during baseflow these particles could potentially play a large role in the coupled fe p cycle of downstream lakes and reservoirs by replenishing the iron curtain and preventing porewater phosphate release i e chambers and odum 1990 field data from the downstream reservoir in our study watershed has shown minimal phosphate release from the iron rich benthic sediments lin and li 2011 in support of the iron curtain mechanism conversely it is also possible that once deposited in reservoir or estuarine sediment these amorphous particles which lack a crystal structure and are therefore less stable than more crystalline forms of fe might be more prone to release attached p under reduced conditions mortimer 1942 or in the presence of alkaline phosphatase secreted by biota francko and heath 1979 4 conclusions our simple centrifugation method based on the general principles of stokes law effectively separates amorphous particles from crystalline particles quality controls of xrd sem and al fe wet chemistry verify that crystalline mineral particles and coarse organic particles are indeed removed leaving behind the amorphous mineral particles this allows us to estimate the fe and p associated with amorphous particles at baseflow approximately 66 of fe and 38 of reactive p giving insight into hydrological pathways and biogeochemical cycling of these elements the geographic extent of high fe ultisols and oxisols approximately 20 of world s soils along with other regions with groundwater rich in fe2 due to reducing conditions suggests that authigenic fe p particles are likely present in many streams throughout the world and are an important part of the p cycle downstream future research should focus on understanding the bioavailability of authigenic fe p particles at baseflow along with the potential impact of amorphous

methods to verify a successful separation x ray diffraction electron microscopy and stoichiometry of fe and aluminum this allowed us to quantify the amount of fe and p in three different fractions of baseflow truly dissolved authigenic nanoparticles and crystalline mineral coarse organic particles for the rural and urban stream in our study on average authigenic nanoparticles in baseflow transport 66 of fe with baseflow concentrations ranging from 80 μg l to 650 μg l authigenic nanoparticles also transport an average of 38 of reactive p depending upon seasonality and time elapsed since the last storm event keywords authigenic colloids nanoparticles particle size distribution particulate phosphorus 1 introduction in many watersheds baseflow conditions are the predominant hydrologic condition punctuated occasionally by stormflow particulate phosphorus pp can comprise the majority of baseflow p loading in many watersheds not impacted by wastewater and is often associated with particulate iron fe since p is the limiting nutrient in many aquatic ecosystems small increases decreases in baseflow p loading can cause a large biotic response taylor et al 2014 iron can restrict the availability of p to organisms via abiotic binding mechanisms therefore it is important to understand the sources and transport of both fe and p in aquatic ecosystems at baseflow the particulate fraction of p and fe is typically defined using an operational 0 45 μm filtration cutoff however pp and particulate fe tend to be understudied and underestimated in waters due to some fe and p containing nanoparticles which pass through standard 0 45 μm filters and are therefore counted as dissolved hens and merckx 2002 richardson and reddy 2013 naturally occurring authigenic amorphous nanoparticles containing fe and p have been identified at the oxic anoxic boundary of numerous aquatic ecosystems including lacustrine sediments buffle et al 1989 lienemann et al 1999 streams atteia et al 1998 groundwater hartland et al 2015 and estuaries gunnars et al 2002 these particles are thought to result from exfiltration of groundwater rich in reduced fe baken et al 2013 which is oxidized either abiotically grift et al 2014 or biotically emerson 2015 ferrous fe2 oxidation in the presence of other dissolved constituents such as calcium phosphate and silicate results in amorphous nanoparticles with p fe ratios dependent upon respective solute concentrations of these elements châtellier et al 2013 senn et al 2015 grift et al 2016 studies have shown that limiting stoichiometric p fe molar ratios in these amorphous hydroxyphosphates can range from 1 2 up to 1 1 thibault et al 2009 baken et al 2016 these particles are further stabilized by interactions with dissolved organic matter gaffney et al 2008 bollyn et al 2016 which can result in slow aggregation of fe oxides in streams on the order of days to weeks laxen and michael chandler 1983 the small size and slow aggregation of these particles means that once formed they could easily be transported the length of a river during baseflow and therefore could impact the biogeochemistry of downstream lakes reservoirs estuaries as well fe containing crystalline mineral particles in contrast generally originate on the uplands floodplain or streambank and are delivered to a stream via overland flow or interflow baseflow through the soil matrix their p fe ratios are generally driven by either sorption on the surface of the particle or incorporation into the crystalline matrix of the mineral particle itself theoretically p fe can be as high as 1 2 for sorption assuming all sorption sites are equal and in situations with very high phosphate concentrations golterman 1995 but studies have shown that in reality sorption sites are not equal and therefore in natural systems the p fe ratio will be much lower than 1 2 miltenburg and golterman 1998 baken et al 2016 several studies to date have used transmission electron microscopy tem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and electron diffraction saed to identify amorphous fe p particles leppard et al 1989 while this is a nice tool for quantifying the size chemistry and mineralogy of individual nanoparticles tem does not generally scale up well to characterize the properties of grab samples unless hundreds of samples are analyzed which can be very expensive and time consuming in this regard tem should be considered a complement to wet chemistry techniques not a replacement for it other studies have ignored crystallinity and have instead focused on separating p containing colloids into different size fractions using classical filtration hartland et al 2015 or field flow fractionation fff baalousha et al 2006 however isolating colloidal fractions based on filtration has been shown to be problematic due to clogging of filters which tends to underestimate the colloidal fraction morrison and benoit 2001 zirkler et al 2012 and while fff is a nice tool for size separation and subsequent analysis of the size fractions via icp ms in and of itself it is not an effective technique for confirming whether particles in different bins are crystalline particles or amorphous colloids or some mixture thereof x ray absorption spectroscopy has been used in a few studies which have not addressed p but have instead focused on partitioning fe colloids between authigenic free oxides and clay particles baken et al 2013 regelink et al 2014 to learn more about the role of authigenic particles in biogeochemical cycling and nutrient fluxes techniques are needed to easily yet effectively separate them from the remaining particles and solutes in grab samples in order to analyze either the particles in solution or on filtration membranes or to set up microcosm bioavailability experiments for these reasons we used a combination approach of particle by particle analyses to verify the presence of amorphous particles along with elemental analysis of grab samples following centrifugal separation and quality control in order to overcome these limitations of previous studies validating the separation of amorphous particles from crystalline particles using x ray diffraction xrd and electron microscopy is a novel approach and a primary objective of our study this study addresses the following research questions can authigenic amorphous nanoparticles containing fe and p be effectively separated from crystalline mineral particles and coarse organic matter based on differences in particle size and density in stream baseflow can xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and or the stoichiometry of fe al be used as quality controls to ensure that amorphous nanoparticles were successfully separated from crystalline particles what percentage of baseflow p and fe is transported via authigenic nanoparticles 2 materials and methods 2 1 separation via size and density difference of amorphous particles gravitational settling is a relatively straightforward way to separate particles via their size and density stokes law stokes 1851 states that the settling velocity of a particle in fluid at a given gravitational force and viscosity is a function of its density along with its diameter squared while the density of amorphous fe p nanoparticles in water is difficult to directly measure and furthermore may be variable due to size dependency hiemstra and zhao 2016 studies suggest that these particles have a lower density than crystalline mineral particles due to much of the amorphous particle being comprised of pore spaces filled with water moreover amorphous particles tend to be quite small in lotic aquatic systems with sizes in streams generally ranging from a few nanometers up to 100 nm depending upon factors affecting aggregation in the watersheds in our region of the southern piedmont the vast majority of amorphous particles have a hydrodynamic diameter less than 30 nm on the other hand crystalline mineral particles in baseflow tend to be larger though not much data exists on detailed particle size distributions of mineral particles in baseflow our data from the southern piedmont suggest that the vast majority of crystalline mineral particles tend to be larger than 100 nm 100 nm is also above the minimum size of suspended particles of mica and kaolinite in the amazon river reported by gibbs 1977 and above that given by grim 1953 for clay particles of kaolinite and illite although they both note that some montmorillonite particles can be smaller than 100 nm xrd data show that baseflow particles in our watershed primarily consist of quartz montmorillonite illite and kaolinite which have densities ranging from 2 5 to 2 8 g cm3 our watershed at baseflow also contains numerous species of diatoms most of which have a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 5 μm fig s1 because crystalline mineral particles and diatoms are generally much larger than the amorphous particles in our watershed the crystalline particles are also denser particle settling is a good option for isolating the amorphous mineral particles this allows various analyses to be conducted on the unfiltered water sample along with the sample containing the amorphous particles the difference between the two being associated with mineral particles and diatoms ultrafiltration can then be performed on the supernatant with the difference being attributable to amorphous particles we used pall macrosep 1 kda centrifugal filters in our experiment which are constructed of low binding polyethersulfone using a centrifuge to speed up the particle settling from that of quiescent gravity settling we can estimate the length of time needed to settle out certain size fractions of mineral particles and the fraction of amorphous particles that will be left behind however there are numerous circumstances which can either slow down or speed up settling of nanoparticles such as brownian motion scott et al 2005 non spherical particles hindered settling ham and homsy 1988 slip correction factor or aggregation to form larger particles smoluchowski 1917 these factors can be more or less an issue for a given water sample based on variables such as ph and conductivity therefore quality controls are needed to ensure that the crystalline particles are indeed removed upon centrifugation but that amorphous nanoparticles are not 2 2 potential quality controls for separation verification one of the most definitive quality controls to distinguish between crystalline and amorphous particles is xrd on both the centrifuge supernatant and the plug of particles at the bottom of the test tubes if enough sample is centrifuged then there will be ample particles to detect an xrd signal from the crystalline minerals after centrifugation the supernatant can be filtered through a membrane filter with very small pores to catch the nanoparticles clay particles on a membrane filter show a preferential orientation for their 001 and 002 planes and so even in small quantities they are sensitive to detection via xrd moore and reynolds 1997 if the crystalline mineral particles are successfully removed via centrifugation then the supernatant should show no diffraction peaks yet the particle plug removed via centrifuge should show strong peaks for the minerals typically present in a given watershed fig s2 sem images can then be used as an additional quality control determining the presence absence of 25 nm particles is well within the range of most sem instruments the morphology of particles can be used to distinguish between crystalline mineral particles and amorphous particles as crystalline pedogenic particles tend to have distinct morphologies fig s3 in most watersheds a third potential quality control is the analysis of al and fe in the grab sample compared to the centrifuge filtrate al is the third most common element in the earth s crust and many of the most prevalent mineral particles contain quite high levels of al e g feldspars and aluminosilicate clays in contrast amorphous fe p particles generally only have trace amounts of al furthermore the solubility of al in most circumneutral natural waters is extremely low jones et al 1974 truly dissolved al concentrations in streamwater are typically less than 2 μg l in our watersheds which implies that most of the detectable al in the supernatant can be attributed to mineral particles therefore if xrd and sem analyses suggest that crystalline particles have been removed via centrifuging then the al content of the supernatant should also be very low compared to the raw sample yet the fe concentration should be relatively high we used ultrafiltration with a 1 kda filter 30 min centrifugation at 3 000g to calculate the truly dissolved al and fe concentrations 2 3 study area our study site is the falls lake watershed within the north carolina piedmont near raleigh durham the u s piedmont is a highly weathered landform between the coastal plain and the appalachian mountains from new jersey south to alabama soils in the piedmont tend to be deep with groundwater residence times as long as 20 years rose and fullagar 2005 in highly weathered landscapes such as the piedmont fe tends to be conserved in soils and sediments due to its poor solubility megonigal et al 2004 more information on the piedmont and the falls lake watershed can be found in the supplemental information public data shows that fe concentrations in baseflow tend to be high throughout most areas of the u s piedmont suggesting exfiltration of groundwater rich in fe2 occurs throughout the year fe stained seeps are common throughout the region providing additional evidence for oxidation of fe upon exfiltration of groundwater fig s4 2 4 sample collection and analysis triplicate grab samples were collected monthly at baseflow conditions total suspended sediment tss 10 mg l from october 2016 to july 2017 for both an urban and rural stream in the north carolina piedmont we measured fe and p in the unfiltered samples the centrifuged supernatant 90 min at 4000g and the truly dissolved 1 kda ultrafiltration portions of the samples the crystalline amount was determined as the unfiltered minus the centrifuged supernatant and the amorphous was determined as the centrifuged supernatant minus the truly dissolved molybdate reactive p was measured via murphy riley 1962 using a 5 cm flow path to maximize spectrophotometer sensitivity iron was analyzed via flame atomic absorption aa on a perkinelmer 5100 spectrophotometer and for values less than 75 μg l was analyzed via graphite furnace aa on a perkinelmer 5100 zl furnace aluminum was analyzed via graphite furnace aa on a perkinelmer 5100 zl furnace we did not digest unfiltered samples due to the fact that the standard method for analyzing 0 45 μm filtrate does not digest before analysis despite the fact that the bulk of fe and al in the filtrate is comprised of colloids nanoparticles since we were comparing the unfiltered fe and al to that of the supernatant and of the truly dissolved fraction we did not want to bias our results by digesting one fraction and not digesting another furthermore studies have shown that colloids are in large part quantified despite not being digested kennedy et al 1974 horowitz et al 1996 to test xrd as a quality control method we filled 40 centrifuge tubes with 50 ml each of baseflow from a piedmont stream for a total of 2 l after centrifuging at 4 000g for 90 min we then slowly decanted approximately 40 ml of supernatant from each tube being careful not to disturb the small sediment plug at the bottom of the tube we reserved triplicate samples of supernatant totaling 100 ml for fe al and p analysis and filtered the remaining 1 5 l through a 0 02 μm anopore anodisc filter model 6809 5002 via vacuum filtration the remaining 10 ml in each tube containing the settled particles were given a quick stir to get them into solution and then were filtered through a separate 0 02 μm filter each filter was then analyzed via xrd with a panalytical xpert pro mrd hr instrument using cu k alpha radiation at 45 kv and 40 ma a scan range of 3 70 2 theta steps of 0 05 and a dwell time of 1 s per step highscore plus software was used for xrd peak identification and d spacing calculations after xrd we took a piece of each filter for analysis via sem samples were prepared by sputter coating with gold nanoparticles sem imaging was performed with a fei xl30 sem feg instrument samples were prepared for tem by depositing one drop of baseflow on a 200 mesh tem grid tem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and selected area electron diffraction saed was performed with a jeol 2100 instrument at 200 kv high angle annular dark field haadf imaging and electron energy loss spectrometry eels were performed on a fei titan 300 with a gatan model 863 tridiem gif energy filter operated at 300 kv particle size was measured via gatan digital micrograph software using tem images 2 5 public data publicly available data was downloaded from the united states geologic survey usgs database at https waterdata usgs gov nwis 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle by particle analysis fig 1 shows the types of particles typically found in baseflow for a rural stream in the southern piedmont by counting particles on tem grids we estimate that one drop of nc piedmont baseflow typically contains millions of nanoparticle aggregates particle by particle analysis shows that amorphous nanoparticles in our watershed have drastically different stoichiometry than do crystalline aluminosilicates figs 2 and 3 this makes the case for using stoichiometry of wet chemistry as a quality control to verify the separation of crystalline mineral particles from amorphous nanoparticles high resolution tem hrtem images of amorphous particles show no long range crystallinity and some particles appear to be comprised of numerous fe rich clusters of a few nanometers each fig 4 this is in line with previous research which suggests that authigenic fe p nanoparticles have high porosity and little crystallinity haadf suggests a three dimensional particle shape with little structure and eels spectra are very similar to poorly ordered ferrihydrite found in other natural systems gloter et al 2004 with fe predominantly in 3 oxidation state fig 5 particle by particle analysis shows that the p fe ratio is still much lower than the upper stoichiometric limit for these amorphous particles fig s5 suggesting that upon oxidation there is excess fe2 compared to phosphate in addition the rural stream shows a much lower and less variable p fe ratio throughout the sampling period than found in the urban stream amorphous particles show a strong relationship between fe and si fig s6 suggesting that si plays a role in the structure of these amorphous particles consistent with other studies senn et al 2015 in contrast al is minimal in the amorphous particles but can be quite high in crystalline mineral particles in our watershed fig 6 we also identified some larger amorphous particles that could be the result of biotic oxidation fig 7 as they appear similar in size morphology and fe si stoichiometry to the extracellular sheaths of fe oxidizing bacteria reported in previous research suzuki et al 2011 2013 the chemical composition is similar to other amorphous particles in our sampling it is unclear from our study what percentage of amorphous particles might be a result of abiotic vs biotic oxidation 3 2 centrifugal separation and quality controls centrifugation has long been used to separate different sizes and densities of particles from solute scott et al 2005 and has been shown to be superior to standard filtration for accurately measuring different sizes densities of particulate matter buffle and leppard 1995 gimbert et al 2005 however to our knowledge ours is the first study to specifically isolate amorphous fe p particles in centrifugal supernatant and to incorporate rigorous quality controls to ensure that they were successfully separated from crystalline mineral particles fig 8 shows a photo of the filtered supernatant and the filtered particles at the bottom of each test tube following 90 min of centrifugation at 4000 g xrd of the centrifuged particles clearly show diffraction peaks corresponding to kaolinite illite and montmorillonite clays along with quartz yet the supernatant filter shows no peaks indicating effective separation of amorphous vs crystalline fractions sem also clearly shows the much larger mineral and organic particles which are separated out via centrifugation compared to the nanoparticles remaining in the filtrate fig 9 displays the al and fe data from our separation technique using a typical baseflow sample from a piedmont stream as expected an unfiltered sample has high al yet the centrifuge supernatant has very little on the other hand the majority of fe is in the supernatant fraction 3 3 authigenic nanoparticle fractions of fe and p applying this centrifugal separation technique to various baseflow samples in the southern piedmont throughout 2016 and 2017 shows that amorphous fe nanoparticles often comprise over 50 of fe flux in baseflow ranging from approximately 80 μg l to 650 μg l depending on the date of sampling fig 10 reactive p associated with amorphous nanoparticles on average comprises 38 of the total reactive p load while no separation method is 100 accurate depending upon the particle size distribution of the amorphous particles a fraction can be removed with the crystalline particles based on the stoichiometry of individual particles versus the grab sample we estimate that 90 of crystalline particles are removed while retaining 80 of amorphous particles we believe this simple centrifugation technique might be applicable to many watersheds with groundwater rich in reduced fe depending upon the particle size distributions of amorphous versus crystalline particles in a particular watershed this would allow scientists to learn more about the biogeochemical impacts of authigenic particles on aquatic ecosystems through the use of straightforward analytical techniques and or microcosm experiments on the isolated authigenic fraction 3 4 ecological implications due to the differing reactivity of amorphous versus crystalline particles along with potentially different p fe stoichiometry it is possible that these different types of particles have different p bioavailability to biota at baseflow very little research has been conducted regarding the bioavailability of authigenic nanoparticles e g baken et al 2014 compared to truly dissolved p fractions in addition to potential differences in bioavailability the ability to partition authigenic particles is valuable in regards to understanding the sources and hydrologic pathways of fe and p transport and the potential impacts of human activities such as agricultural drainage or urbanization for example it is possible that as tile drainage increases in some agricultural watersheds more p is delivered to streams as truly dissolved orthophosphate whereas if that same phosphate containing water had made it into groundwater it might be discharged into a stream incorporated into a nanoparticle with fe it is also possible that some bmp s may better target one type of p containing particle over the other or that fe p authigenic particles might be purposefully created as pulse shunt sinks for phosphate in lotic ecosystems i e rentz et al 2009 or in wastewater treatment qu et al 2013 due to the known reactivity of amorphous fe authigenic particles could also potentially play a role in the biogeochemistry of receiving waters for example delivered in a steady supply and at relatively high concentrations during baseflow these particles could potentially play a large role in the coupled fe p cycle of downstream lakes and reservoirs by replenishing the iron curtain and preventing porewater phosphate release i e chambers and odum 1990 field data from the downstream reservoir in our study watershed has shown minimal phosphate release from the iron rich benthic sediments lin and li 2011 in support of the iron curtain mechanism conversely it is also possible that once deposited in reservoir or estuarine sediment these amorphous particles which lack a crystal structure and are therefore less stable than more crystalline forms of fe might be more prone to release attached p under reduced conditions mortimer 1942 or in the presence of alkaline phosphatase secreted by biota francko and heath 1979 4 conclusions our simple centrifugation method based on the general principles of stokes law effectively separates amorphous particles from crystalline particles quality controls of xrd sem and al fe wet chemistry verify that crystalline mineral particles and coarse organic particles are indeed removed leaving behind the amorphous mineral particles this allows us to estimate the fe and p associated with amorphous particles at baseflow approximately 66 of fe and 38 of reactive p giving insight into hydrological pathways and biogeochemical cycling of these elements the geographic extent of high fe ultisols and oxisols approximately 20 of world s soils along with other regions with groundwater rich in fe2 due to reducing conditions suggests that authigenic fe p particles are likely present in many streams throughout the world and are an important part of the p cycle downstream future research should focus on understanding the bioavailability of authigenic fe p particles at baseflow along with the potential impact of amorphous
