1260,implementing sustainable groundwater resources management in coastal areas is challenging due to the negative impacts of anthropogenic stressors and various interactions between groundwater and surface water this study focuses on nitrate contamination and transport via groundwater surface water exchange in a mediterranean coastal area guerbes senhadja region algeria that is heavily affected by anthropogenic activities a multi tracer approach integrating hydrogeochemical and isotopic tracers δ2hh2o δ18oh2o 3h δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 is combined with a bayesian isotope mixing model mixsiar to i elucidate the nitrate sources and their apportionments in water systems and ii describe potential interactions between groundwater and surface water results from nitrate isotopic composition and the mixsiar model show that nitrate concentrations mainly originate from sewage and manure sources nitrate derived from the sewage is attributed to urban and rural wastewater discharge whereas nitrate derived from the manure is related to animal manure used to fertilise agricultural areas high apportionments of nitrate based atmospheric precipitation are identified in groundwater and surface water a finding that is specific to this study the multi origin stresses combined with evidence of interactions between surface water and groundwater contribute to negatively impacting large parts of the study coastal area the outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to sustainable management of coastal ecosystems by drawing more attention towards groundwater use and protection furthermore this study may improve scientists ability to predict the behavior of anthropogenically impacted coastal ecosystems and help decision makers elsewhere to prepare suitable environmental strategies for other coastal ecosystems currently undergoing an early stage of groundwater resources deterioration keywords nitrate isotope tracers aquifer groundwater surface water mixsiar data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction coastal areas commonly contain aquatic ecosystems that contribute to rich biodiversity as they provide habitat and food resources for wildlife and estuarine marine and terrestrial fauna camacho valdez et al 2013 clara et al 2018 newton et al 2018 these ecosystems include a variety of surface water systems swss e g swamps inlets marshes and lagoons that locally control the hydrological cycle by contributing to surface water retention rao et al 2015 velasco et al 2018 however large amounts of the surface water stored in coastal ecosystems can be supplied by groundwater which is why many are commonly classified as groundwater dependent ecosystems erostate et al 2020 menció et al 2017 stumpp et al 2014 the human population may depend directly on these coastal ecosystems for numerous activities including tourism agriculture fisheries and aquaculture exploitation clara et al 2018 lyra et al 2021 willaert 2014 therefore these ecosystems have direct economic value in addition to their intrinsic somewhat less easily quantified value of the ecosystem service functions that they provide many of these ecosystems are protected by legal regulations through national international conventions e g barcelona convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea to sustainably manage human activities at all scales however the uncontrolled human exploitation of coastal areas combined with other harmful practices such as industrial and domestic discharges result in groundwater resource deterioration that affects the ecosystem functions barhoumi et al 2014 david et al 2019 pittalis et al 2018 increased nutrient inputs enhanced by urban agricultural or industrial discharges affects groundwater quality and leads to anthropogenic eutrophication of swss such practices disturb the swss deteriorating and damaging the ecosystem functions and consequently reducing their intrinsic and economic benefits erostate et al 2022 garcía and muñoz vera 2015 the scientific community must collectively address such interdisciplinary problem hydrogeologists conceptualized surface water and groundwater flux as determinant factors that control the ecosystems erostate et al 2020 from this conceptualization environmental legislation has been enacted in many locations around the world that requires an integrated approach e g usgs national water quality assessment program leahy et al 1990 in which both surface water and groundwater are considered together when developing ecosystem management strategies however implementing efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management for coastal areas is challenging due to the impact of multi anthropogenic stressors combined with the various interactions between groundwater and surface water clara et al 2018 erostate et al 2022 2019 some known examples of mediterranean coastal systems experiencing intensive agricultural activities have caused serious deterioration of local groundwater resources boumaiza et al 2022 lyra et al 2021 rachid et al 2021 to establish efficient and sustainable combined management of groundwater and surface water resources in coastal ecosystems field based case studies are needed to this end impacted coastal areas provide an opportunity to research the challenges faced by many ecosystems around the world especially in regions with uncontrolled land use development coastal ecosystems occupy approximately 13 of the world s coastlines with a contribution estimated to 18 of the africa coastline barnes 1980 kjerfve 1994 in north africa coastal ecosystems are widely distributed from the atlantic ocean to the southeastern coastline of the mediterranean sea through morocco algeria tunisia libya and egypt el mahrad et al 2020 the present study provides results from a field based research program which was guided through an algerian coastal complex area where ecosystems are heavily affected by multiple anthropogenic activities to construct a comprehensive understanding on how these coastal ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic stresses algeria contains several coastal areas of international importance including the selected coastal mediterranean area of guerbes senhadja a 2011 recognized ramsar site emphasizing the international relevance of the selected study area the guerbes senhadja region contains several swss distributed over an area of complex geomorphology featuring a multitude of depressions and valleys sandy dunes rivers estuaries beaches and sea cliffs it is a significantly important site for tourism having high agricultural potential and rich biodiversity sheltering many plant and animal species babouri et al 2020 bouchaala et al 2017 samraoui and de belair 1997 however this site of important ecological and socioeconomic values is disturbed by several anthropogenic stressors including land clearing fires overgrazing sand pit exploitation uncontrolled growing urbanization unmanaged agricultural expansion combined with unsafe agricultural practices and excessive extraction of groundwater and surface water for irrigation and domestic purposes toubal et al 2014 all these anthropogenic stressors seriously impact the study area where several degrading signs have been observed such as the erosion of river banks and littoral sandy dunes destabilization silting up of fertile lands and water quality deterioration hedjal et al 2019 toubal et al 2014 despite the increased uncontrolled land use the total surface of the study area is still made up approximately of 80 of agricultural lands which are dominated by production of legumes in open agricultural fields the direct uncontrolled application of nitrogen based fertilizers to agricultural lands of the study area suggests that the identified harmful nitrate no3 concentrations in groundwater no3 up to 97 mg l can be attributed to contributions from unsafe agricultural practices hadj said 2007 however this conclusion has yet to be verified by advanced source tracking tools such as stable isotope analyses or statistical based interpretation rivers crossing the guerbes senhadja region receive urban and industrial wastewater discharges without pre treatment bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 this suggests that high no3 concentrations in groundwater could also be attributed to contribution from potential wastewater influx as wastewater and associated contaminants from urban industrial discharges could infiltrate into the aquifer or originate from interactions between groundwater and surface water mccance et al 2018 vystavna et al 2019 this paper presents a preliminary study aiming i to distinguish the main sources of groundwater quality deterioration within the coastal area of guerbes senhadja with focus on anthropogenic no3 contamination and ii to describe potential groundwater surface water interactions by investigating the potential relationship between surface water and groundwater at the investigated sampling site that contribute to transporting impacted water over the coastal aquifer a multi tracer approach is used that integrates major chemical elements stable water isotopes δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o stable nitrate isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 the radioactive isotope tritium 3h and a bayesian isotope mixing model mixsiar furthermore we argue that our approach may improve scientists ability to predict the hydrogeological behavior of anthropized complex coastal areas and will help groundwater managers from other regions to prepare suitable environmental plans for coastal ecosystems undergoing an early stage of groundwater resources deterioration 2 setting of study area 2 1 geographic location and hydrologic features the study area is the guerbes senhadja wetland located 25 km east of the city of skikda in northeastern algeria fig 1 the study area constitutes a large coastal valley separating the felfela senhadja mountains featuring an altitude varying from 330 m above sea level a s l djebel safia to 541 m a s l djebel el foul at the west and the chetaïbi mountains presenting an altitude reaching up to 510 m a s l at east further south the study area connects to a large flat valley constituting the plain of ben azouz whereas the northern boundary is the mediterranean sea over a shoreline of roughly 15 km the guerbes senhadja area is mainly crossed by the el kebir river flowing south to north from which two other rivers are tributary i e the maboune river in the southwest and the magroune river in southeast of the study area fig 1 the study site covers approximately 200 km2 on which there are some urban villages including ben azouz guerbes and zaouia villages next to other small rural communities such as ouled malek gaïd lakhdar ain nechema and dem el begrat the guerbes senhadja region is an alluvial system wherein half of the study area features slopes varying from 3 to 13 boussehaba 2010 this landscape physiography provides a multitude of depressions and valleys forming several swss locally called merdja or garâa featuring shallow water depths ranging from 0 5 to 3 m below ground surface bouchaala et al 2017 several other small swss 0 01 km2 exist within the study area most of them are the result of artificial digging by local farmers for providing surface water used for irrigating the agricultural lands the guerbes senhadja region is characterized by mediterranean climate conditions featuring two main distinct periods i a wet period occurring from october to april with monthly average temperature of 14 c and ii a dry period occurring from may to september with monthly average temperature of 26 c hedjal 2019 the study area captures an average annual rainfall precipitation amount of about 687 mm including 594 mm over the wet period october april whereas 93 mm are received during the dry period may september the mean annual actual evapotranspiration was estimated at 456 mm including 263 mm for the wet period and 193 mm corresponding to the dry period hedjal 2019 during the wet period the excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration leads to considerable aquifer recharge conversely the dry period features an evapotranspiration rate exceeding precipitation that accordingly leads to enhanced evaporation from both swss and groundwater tables 2 2 geology geomorphology and hydrogeological background the guerbes senhadja region belongs to the algerian coastal magmatic chain which is considered as part of the internal zones of the north africa alpine chain originating from tectonic activity in the occidental mediterranean basin associated with the collision of the african and european tectonic plates during the oligo miocene period auzende et al 1975 cohen 1980 letouzey and trémolières 1980 vila 1980 the study area corresponds to a neogene subsiding graben limited by two major fault systems which caused large kilometric scale landslides during the last alpine phase of the miocene this tectonic event placed the african plate and the european plate represented respectively by the edough complex to the east and the felfela basement to the west at the same latitude the geological context of these formations includes metamorphosed granitoid rocks fig 2 which are partly covered by a system of folded sedimentary rocks resulting from tectonic activity these folded sedimentary rocks are composed of cretaceous marls sandstones cretaceous flysch and oligo miocene sandstones numidian flysch joleaud 1936 llavsky and snopkova 1987 edough metamorphic rock complex was isolated from the felfela and stood with sufficient relief that it was an island when the sea invaded the region during the pliocene hilly 1962 however sedimentary inputs from the mainland progressively filled of the shallow basins located at the southern and eastern limits of the edough metamorphic rock complex the later subsequently became linked to the african continent since the early quaternary further the edough metamorphic rock complex shoreline has continued to evolve from south to north leading to the deposition of large accumulations of quaternary deposits within the subsiding graben of guerbes senhadja fig 2 during the late quaternary period predominant north western south eastern winds formed an 8000 ha region of sandy dunes over the guerbes senhadja region the effect of the winds decreased inland from the sea such that these sandy dune deposits are common and relatively thick along the coast and are much reduced inland these sandy dune deposits are also rich in impermeable clay lenses that probably reflect avulsions of the el kebir river on its north eastern side whereas the obstruction of the river bed combined with the gentle slope of terrain fostered the extension of the alluvial plain thereby creating a series of depressions during the evolution process samraoui and de belair 1997 together these events can explain the variable slopes within the study region that again range from 3 to 13 boussehaba 2010 hedjal et al 2018 the low surface water drainage over the study area combined with high groundwater discharge from the sandy dune deposits promote the accumulation of surface water that has resulted in the formation of several swss samraoui and de belair 1997 toubal et al 2014 the subsiding graben of the guerbes senhadja region is filled by plio quaternary granular lithogenic material corresponding to multiple origins including eolian and fluvio lacustrine deposits that explain the diversity in lithofacies regarding the information from boreholes drilled in the study area the guerbes senhadja region contains an upper unconfined aquifer varying from 50 to 140 m in thickness mainly composed of sandy material overlying clay deposits with a mean thickness of 5 m hedjal 2019 that constitutes the top of the deeper confined aquifer the latter has a thickness varying from 12 to 50 m and is composed of polygenic materials gravels and pebbles presumably resting on substratum formed by alternating sandstone and marl bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 the upper and deeper aquifers are directly connected in some locations of the study area where the clayey aquitard separating them is practically nonexistent hedjal 2019 chemical analyses of groundwater samples collected from the upper aquifer in 2013 bouleknafet and derradji 2017 and 2016 hedjal et al 2018 revealed sodium chloride and magnesium chloride water types 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analyses 3 1 1 sampling network and protocol the present study included both a surface water and groundwater sampling program which was performed on november 20 22 2021 here 10 groundwater samples were collected over the study area 14 surface water samples were collected from swss and the main rivers crossing the study area fig 3 one sample was collected from the mediterranean sea and one from rainfall it should be mentioned that the choice of the sampling sites is essentially based on their accessibility groundwater samples were collected from shallow private wells that were dug by the owners in the unconsolidated sediments these wells feature a diameter varying overall from 2 to 3 m and groundwater depth of 3 6 m below ground surface surface water samples were collected as grab samples directly from the streams during water sampling the physico chemical parameters temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds both for groundwater and surface water were measured in situ using a calibrated multiparameter probe hi 9829 hanna instruments the water collected for major anion and cation chemical analyses was filtered in situ through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters attached to 100 ml luer lock syringe samplers and subsequently pushed through the filters into two separate 40 ml amber glass bottles the bottles for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 by adding 2 3 drops of ultrapure nitric acid hno3 with the aim to prevent major cations precipitation or adsorption during storage water samples for δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o analyses were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles whereas filtered water for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 analyses were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles the water for 3h analysis was collected in 500 ml polyethylene bottles all sample bottles were completely filled with water without head space and bottles were equipped with caps containing teflon septa parafilm to prevent evaporation during fieldwork the water samples were temporarily stored in a portable cooler before being transferred to a refrigerator for storage at 4 c and further transported to the laboratories the samples collected for stable nitrate isotope analyses were stored frozen to avoid variations caused by biological processes until the isotopic analyses were performed in the laboratory all the water samples collected in this study 26 samples were analyzed for the major elements and δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o seventeen samples were analyzed for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 whereas seven samples were analyzed for 3h 3 1 2 chemical and isotope tracer analyses the chemical analysis was carried out in several laboratories the major chemical elements hco3 no3 cl k mg 2 nh4 na ca 2 and so4 2 were analyzed at the laboratory of the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france the major elements concentrations were measured using a dionex ics 1100 chromatograph thermo fischer scientific waltham usa except hco3 concentrations that were determined by volumetric titration to ph 4 5 using a digital titrator hach hach company loveland co u s a the results of major elements were validated by testing the ionic balance for which a absolute value of 5 was considered acceptable appelo and postma 2005 hounslow 1995 tritium was analyzed at the wessling laboratory at budapest hungary water samples for 3 h were degassed and stored in dedicated glass bulbs for the accumulation of the tritium decay product after a reconditioning period of one month 3 h content was analyzed by electrolytic enrichment followed by liquid scintillation counting spectrometry kaufman and libby 1954 thatcher et al 1977 the obtained 3 h activities were corrected for radioactive decay back to the time of the precipitation event and 3 h activities are expressed in tritium units tu with a precision of 0 5 tu 1 tu equals a radioactivity concentration of 0 118 bq l the analyses of stable water isotopes δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o were performed at the laboratory of the institute of soil physics and rural water management in vienna austria these water isotopic compositions were determined using a laser based isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i according to the analytical scheme recommended by the international atomic energy agency iaea penna et al 2010 nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were analyzed at the helmholtz center for environmental research in halle saale germany using the denitrifier method with bacteria strains of pseudomonas chlororaphis atcc 13985 equal to dsm 6698 according to the protocols recommended by casciotti et al 2002 and sigman et al 2001 here the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopic composition produced from no3 was measured by gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry using a delta v plus mass spectrometer and a gasbench ii from thermo scientific the isotope values expressed in δ were calculated using eq 1 where r sample and r standard are the sample s and the standard s ratios of the heavier to the lighter isotope i e 2 h 1 h 15 n 14 n or 18 o 16 o 1 δ r sample r standard r standard the δ2hh2o δ18oh2o and δ18ono3 values are reported relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow whereas the δ15nno3 values are reported relative to the nitrogen n2 in atmospheric air air the precision of the analytical instrument was generally better than 0 5 for δ2hh2o and 0 1 for δ18oh2o whereas the reproducibility for the δ15nno3 and the δ18ono3 measurements were 0 6 and 0 4 respectively 3 2 identifying nitrate sources and estimating their apportionments kendall s diagram kendall 1998 combining δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 isotopic compositions with specific zones corresponding to sources of no3 was used in the present study to identify the potential sources of no3 these sources include no3 based atmospheric precipitation ap no3 based fertilizers nof nh4 fertilizers nhf soil organic nitrogen son sewage and manure s m and no3 based desert deposits dd furthermore a bayesian stable isotope mixing model mixsiar model stock et al 2018 was used to estimate the contributions of the different no3 sources to each groundwater and surface water sample numerous studies have assessed the usefulness of the mixsiar model in apportioning the potential sources of no3 in water systems e g boumaiza et al 2022 cao et al 2021 he et al 2022 li et al 2022 torres martínez et al 2021 the mixsiar model requires the values of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 measured in water samples and the different end member isotopic values of the sources of no3 in this study the end member isotopic values of ap nof nhf son and s m were considered whereas no3 based desert deposits were excluded as the study area is located in the mediterranean region as the present study does not cover large number of water samples analyzed for nitrate isotopes n 17 the end member isotopic values of the different potential sources of no3 were adopted from torres martínez et al 2021 who investigated no3 contamination in an area with comparable no3 anthropogenic sources the δ15nno3 end member isotopic values are 0 11 1 69 for ap 0 07 2 85 for nof 1 24 1 44 for nhf 3 26 1 99 for son and 10 14 4 53 for

quality the analytical results of the chemical concentrations concerning the water samples collected over the study area are presented in table 1 groundwater from the study area is circumneutral with ph values varying from 6 3 to 7 7 without significant spatial variation groundwater displayed ec values ranging from 303 to 1178 μs cm with a median value of 619 μs cm the elevated ec values of 1178 μs cm well 16 1004 μs cm well 15 and 861 μs cm well 22 correspond respectively to the urbanized sectors of dem el begrat ben azouz and zaouia suggesting an active mineralization potentially derived from urban anthropogenic sources all groundwater samples revealed acceptable concentrations in so4 relative to the respective drinking water limit of 500 mg l that is recommended by the world health organization who 2017 also groundwater samples showed low concentrations of nh4 with values below a maximum of 0 5 mg l three groundwater samples 15 16 and 22 revealed mg concentrations exceeding a value of 30 mg l however the set of the collected groundwater samples have a median mg concentration of 11 32 mg l high concentrations were identified for the other major elements including hco3 max 433 mg l median 223 mg l cl max 151 mg l median 62 1 mg l na max 86 3 mg l median 51 4 mg l k max 26 8 mg l median 7 66 mg l and ca max 120 3 mg l median 51 4 mg l in groundwater no3 concentrations were detected with values ranging from 2 8 to 166 mg l nine groundwater samples revealed no3 concentration above the natural baseline threshold value of 5 mg l appelo and postma 2005 panno et al 2006 suggesting potential anthropogenic influence over the study area surface water samples revealed a median ph value of 7 1 excessive nh4 concentrations were observed for some surface water samples 13 22 3 mg l 14 16 3 mg l suggesting an anthropogenic influence the surface water samples show a cationic dominance of na median value of 132 mg l or ca median value of 75 5 mg l the other major cations are ranked as follow mg k nh4 with corresponding median values of 27 8 11 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively for anions cl exhibited the highest concentrations with median value of 249 mg l whereas the other major anions are ranked as follow regarding their concentrations hco3 so4 no3 with respective median values of 175 47 1 and 8 2 mg l nitrate concentrations from the collected surface waters ranged from 0 4 to 75 9 mg l 4 2 nitrate contamination 4 2 1 nitrate distribution over the study area fig 4 shows that groundwater featuring no3 concentrations above the who drinking water guideline no3 50 mg l correspond to rural communities of dem el bagrat 16 el guelb 19 marabout aïcha 20 and the village of zaouia 22 suggesting a potential urban influence groundwater samples 17 and 24 collected from private wells located in small villages revealed moderate concentrations in no3 30 mg l no3 50 mg l whereas those having no3 concentrations 30 mg l 15 18 21 and 23 correspond to the less urbanized sector nitrate concentrations are not continuously monitored over the study area but the maximum no3 concentration in groundwater up to 97 mg l detected in 2007 hadj said 2007 is lower than the maximum value of 166 mg l reported in the present study fig 4 shows that no3 50 mg l in surface waters occur in the southern part of the study area including one sample 13 collected from magroune sws two samples 5 and 14 from the upstream of el kebir river and one sample 10 from ain nechema sws which is connected to the el kebir river nitrate concentrations along the el kebir river decrease from 60 mg l to 14 mg l with flow downstream indicating either dilution or denitrification 4 2 2 sources and apportionment of nitrate in water systems groundwater have δ15nno3 values ranging from 1 1 to 14 2 with a median value of 4 9 and δ18ono3 values varying between 4 3 and 29 8 with a median value of 11 8 surface water samples have values ranging from 2 4 to 18 7 with a median value of 5 4 for δ15nno3 and from 3 to 35 3 with a median value of 6 1 for δ18ono3 table 1 result from kendall s diagram indicates that the study area is affected by multiple sources of no3 fig 5a groundwater samples fall within two main groups the first one contains groundwater samples plotting in the manure and sewage zone fig 5a including two groundwater samples 19 and 20 with nitrate isotopic compositions that plot in the overlapping area of manure and sewage with soil derived nitrogen the second group contains groundwater samples falling within no3 based atmospheric precipitation including one groundwater sample 21 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers similarly surface water samples fall in two groups identified for groundwater except surface water sample 13 that plots in the overlapping area of manure and sewage with nh4 fertilizers and 1 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers fig 5a the combined analysis of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 makes it possible to evaluate nitrate transformation processes in a water system subjected to microbial denitrification böttcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 specifically the denitrification process is commonly reflected by a positive 2 1 relationship between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 mengis et al 1999 singleton et al 2007 here the scattered distribution of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 fig 5a makes it difficult to distinguish between mixing of differently denitrified sources and actual denitrification the mixsiar model results figs 5b c suggest that sewage and manure s m are the main no3 sources both in groundwater 31 7 and surface water 29 6 a finding which is consistent with the above outcomes from kendall s diagram the other considered sources of no3 in groundwater are observed with the following ranking order son 20 1 ap 18 nof 15 5 nhf 14 7 fig 5b in surface water these sources are ranked as follow son 21 1 nof 17 8 ap 17 1 nhf 14 4 fig 5c 4 2 3 discussion on the sources of nitrate it is somewhat surprising that s m are identified as the main sources of no3 over the study area because previous studies e g hadj said 2007 assumed synthetic fertilizers as the main no3 source nitrate derived from sewage within the study area could be from two sources first no3 could be derived from inefficient private sanitation systems still used by rural residences that are unable to connect to the collective sanitation networks these inefficient private sanitation systems are commonly built with open bottom sewage storage through which wastewater can directly reach groundwater boumaiza et al 2021b 2020 2019 second no3 could be derived from wastewater discharge from sanitation networks as the el kebir river which crosses the study area receives wastewater discharges without pre treatment bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 likely these wastewater discharges explain the concentrations of no3 detected from surface water samples collected from the el kebir river nitrate derived from manure source within the study area are linked to animal manure that is applied as an organic fertilizer further investigations based on additional isotope tracers and or emerging compounds could help to distinguish sewage from animal waste source erostate et al 2019 lasagna and de luca 2017 using animal manure to fertilise crops in agricultural areas is a common practice in algeria because the use of industrial synthetic fertilizers has been prohibited by the algerian government since the 1990s chabour 2004 surface water samples 1 and 21 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers fig 5a could be accordingly assumed to have no3 based atmospheric precipitation source the accumulation of nhf son and nof in water systems of the study area agrees with land use which has been traditionally dominated by agricultural activities detecting no3 contributions derived from nhf son and nof in groundwater corresponds to what could be expected for the unconfined aquifer of the study area which is mainly dominated by sandy material with high permeability such material allows the infiltration of leached no3 based fertilizers which could occur via i direct rainwater infiltration and or during irrigation water return that subsequently facilitates the leaching of fertilizers added on the agricultural lands and or ii via potential no3 impacted surface water influx malki et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 although the majority of emitted anthropogenic nitrogen components can enter terrestrial and marine ecosystems via atmospheric nitrogen deposition galloway et al 2008 a potential no3 based atmospheric precipitation influence was neglected in previous studies undertaken in the study area bouleknafet and derradji 2017 hadj said 2007 hedjal et al 2018 toubal et al 2014 the present study identifies no3 based ap with a high apportionment both in groundwater 18 and surface water 17 1 this finding shows the particular features of the study area experiencing multi anthropogenic sources of no3 compared to other recent studies on algerian coastal areas that did not reveal no3 based atmospheric precipitation influence boumaiza et al 2022 2020 in the present study the ap apportionment in groundwater is higher than those of nof 15 5 and nhf 14 7 whereas in surface water it is higher than nhf 14 4 and showed comparable apportionment to that of nof 17 8 this finding illustrates the significant influence of atmospheric precipitation on the no3 concentrations and agrees with high no3 concentration measured in the collected rainwater sample 23 8 mg l sample 26 in table 1 while there is no on going monitoring of no3 concentration in rainwater within the study region the measured concentration of no3 in rainwater from this study is about eight times greater than that measured by erostate et al 2018 who studied a proximal western mediterranean coastal ecosystem the present study also reveals that ap apportionments in groundwater 18 and surface water 17 1 are relatively high compared to other agricultural areas where contributions from ap did not exceed 4 he et al 2022 li et al 2022 torres martínez et al 2021 recent environmental studies demonstrated the presence of atmospheric nitrogen from anthropogenic sources across regions neighbouring the study area mourdi 2011 nadhir 2019 however these studies did not distinguish the impact of atmospheric nitrogen on groundwater resources as demonstrated in the present study further specific local studies are recommended to investigate the potential sources of atmospheric nitrogen within the study area the kendall diagram fig 5a shows that surface water samples 1 2 and 6 and groundwater samples 15 18 and 21 that are impacted by no3 atmospheric precipitation are distributed relatively evenly over the entire study area fig 4 accordingly potential migration of no3 impacted water could occur via interactions between surface water and groundwater which justifies our second objective to identify these potential interactions within the study area the increase in nutrient inputs enhanced by urban agricultural or industrial discharges not only impact groundwater quality but can also upset the biodiversity equilibrium of ecosystems causing ecological damages that result in deterioration of ecosystem functions and consequently diminishing profitable benefits of these ecosystems erostate et al 2022 garcía and muñoz vera 2015 4 3 groundwater surface water origin and interactions 4 3 1 water origin and potential salinization processes the δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o compositions as well as 3 h activities for the samples drawn from groundwater and surface water from the study area are presented in table 1 the isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples range from 6 1 to 4 5 for δ18oh2o and from 33 to 23 8 for δ2hh2o these groundwater isotopic values are comparable to other north africa mediterranean coastal aquifers boumaiza et al 2022 2020 chafouq et al 2018 elmeknassi et al 2022 the surface water samples revealed isotopic compositions ranging from 5 7 to 5 3 for δ18oh2o and from 31 5 to 22 for δ2hh2o the mediterranean sea sample displays isotopic values corresponding to 0 46 for δ18oh2o and 1 7 for δ2hh2o in the present study the δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o values are interpreted according to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl celle 2000 in fig 6 groundwater samples cluster around the wmmwl suggesting that the groundwater has been recharged into the aquifer through direct infiltration of rainwater with minimal evaporation this corresponds to what could be expected for the unconfined aquifer of the study area composed of permeable sediments the groundwater d excess values ranging from 11 12 to 15 64 table 1 are indicative of modern recharge having typical isotopic compositions of recharge derived from mediterranean moisture sources celle jeanton et al 2001 gat and carmi 1970 the range of the calculated groundwater d excess can be explained by mixing processes involving local groundwater with other groundwater having different isotopic signatures tantawi et al 1998 the mixing process is evidenced also by isotopic enrichment directed towards the mediterranean sea isotopic signature blue point in fig 6 however this isotopic enrichment could constitute the result of infiltrated evaporative water like infiltrated rainwater affected by evaporation during precipitation events clark and fritz 1997 other studies in algeria have noted evaporative rainwater with comparable slope to that obtained in the present study mebrouk et al 2007 moulla and guendouz 1996 nonetheless as the groundwater samples fall above the gmwl mixing process is rather expected most surface water samples display heavier isotopic values compared to those of groundwater and deviate from the gmwl by following a distinct line fig 6 indicating a high isotopic fractionation effect the latter feature could be related to a high evaporation effect because i the evaporation line falls below the seawater mixing line and ii the d excess displays low values boumaiza et al 2021a gemitzi et al 2014 in fig 7 slight positive correlation is observed between surface water cl and δ18oh2o values r 2 0 6 suggesting an increase in salinity accompanying heavy isotope enrichment this positive relationship confirms the above effect of the evaporation process samples from el kebir river 4 5 and 14 display an isotopic enrichment towards the downstream direction of water flow with respective d excess values of 5 94 14 5 31 5 and 3 64 4 the water along the el kebir river is mostly controlled by the bekouche lakhdar dam implemented at an upstream level of the el kebir river which decreases the flow along the el kebir river leading to more surface water evaporation toubal et al 2014 this can explain why surface water samples 4 5 and 14 from the el kebir river show isotope evidence of evaporation however mixing is also probable particularly for sample 4 which plots along the seawater mixing line 4 3 2 dominant water type for groundwater and surface water the plot of the ten collected groundwater samples on the piper diagram fig 8a shows the dominance of two main water types four groundwater samples 15 18 21 and 22 are dominated by ca hco3 water type whereas the other samples 16 17 19 20 23 and 24 plot within the field of the cacl mixed water type wells 15 18 and 22 potentially correspond to a recharge area as they are characterized by a classic ca hco3 water type which is indicative of recent recharge hiscock 2009 well 21 is located downhill from the sandy dune deposits occupying the northeastern part of the study area the presence of ca hco3 water type at well 21 could also reflect recent recharge through the sandy dune deposits freshening of groundwater from wells 15 18 21 and 22 is supported by the gibbs s diagram fig 8c which shows that these samples form a distinct group that have been impacted by the freshening process the other six groundwater samples 16 17 19 20 23 and 24 which plot as cacl mixed water type on the piper diagram are distributed over the central part of the study area fig 9 with samples 16 23 and 24 located towards the east and the samples 17 19 and 20 situated towards the west of the study area the gibbs s diagram fig 8c suggests that samples 17 19 and 20 are predominantly undergoing a freshening process whereas samples 16 23 and 24 are undergoing mixing process it is possible that ca hco3 water type identified at wells 15 and 18 experienced some freshening control on groundwater at wells 17 19 and 20 resulting in the mixed water type described above the cl concentrations presented in table 1 show that highest cl and na concentrations occur in groundwater from well 16 cl 151 mg l na 86 3 mg l and well 23 cl 124 mg l na 70 9 mg l these two inland wells are located far from the mediterranean sea shoreline fig 3 conversely groundwater from well 21 neighbouring the mediterranean sea revealed low concentrations in cl 83 9 mg l and na 58 4 mg l these patterns of cl concentrations suggest that groundwater from wells 16 and 23 is enriched in cl and na from other potential sources rather than direct enrichment from the mediterranean sea the fact that groundwater from wells 15 22 and 24 plot below the equiline of 1 1 on fig 8d indicates slight dominance of na over cl calcium exchange from freshwater ca hco3 in composition with na sorbed on clays minerals is a common process along groundwater flow paths lee 1985 park et al 2009 toran and saunders 1999 the consequence of this cationic exchange process is an increase in na concentration in groundwater which is commonly observed in coastal aquifers appelo and postma 2005 however we cannot exclude the possible influence of an anthropogenic source of na e g urban wastewater as the samples 15 22 and 24 were collected from urbanized sectors of the study area the two surface water samples collected along upstream portions of the el kebir river 14 and ben azouz 5 correspond to the cacl mixed water type whereas the sample collected from the downstream of the el kebir river 4 corresponds to the nacl water type this observation suggests surface water evolution as water flows downstream also there is potential high mixing of surface water at sampling point 4 with the mediterranean sea as the el kebir river sample 4 is connected to the mediterranean sea we note that river water samples from the downstream portion of the el kebir river exhibit a similar signature to that of the mediterranean sea on the piper diagram fig 8b mixing of el kebir river waters with the mediterranean sea is also supported by the gibbs diagram fig 8c on which the downstream el kebir river water sample plots within a region suggestive of mixing with the mediterranean sea the piper diagram shows that surface water samples are dominated by saline waters of the nacl type as well as mixed water of the cacl type these two water types are also evidenced by the gibbs diagram fig 8c wherein the water surface samples having nacl water type 1 2 3 4 9 10 and 11 plot in advanced mixing stage compared to those having mixed cacl water type 5 6 7 8 12 13 and 14 that are grouped in early mixing stage 4 3 3 isotopic evidence of surface water groundwater interactions in fig 6 surface water sample 7 falls on the wmmwl suggesting less evaporation effect despite the fact that open surface water systems are commonly subjected to greater evaporation than groundwater dindane et al 2003 surface water sample 7 displayed a high d excess value of 14 4 and also plots on seawater mixing line these observations suggest that surface water is subject to mixing process which can also explain why sample 7 is classified as a cacl mixed water type according to the piper diagram the mixing process is also evidenced from the 3 h content here the surface water sample 7 revealed 3 h content of 1 7 0 2 tu indicating a reduced activity relative to the rainwater 3 h content having weighted mean of 3 8 tu erostate et al 2018 hence surface water sample 7 must have mixed with older water moreover surface water sample 7 exhibits an isotopic signature within the range of the groundwater samples fig 6 confirming that surface water from site 7 likely interacted with groundwater hence potential migration of the identified no3 impacted water at site 7 fig 4 could occur via the evidenced interactions between surface water and groundwater surface water sample 13 collected from the magroune sws has δ18oh2o 4 3 and δ2hh2o 23 6 values that fall outside the range exhibited by the groundwater samples fig 6 and plots on both the gmwl and the seawater mixing line these features suggest that sample 13 has experienced less evaporation while also undergoing possible mixing with saltwater which agrees with the piper diagram as sample 13 is classified as a cacl mixed water type it appears that excessive pumping of water from the magroune sws for irrigating the large neighbouring agricultural areas has exerted some control on the isotopic features when surface water is pumped from the magroune sws the extracted water appears to include a groundwater component because the isotopic signature of sample 13 is closer to that of the groundwater samples than to most of the surface water samples hence the magroune sws appears to be a groundwater dependent system containing less evaporated water due to the periodic pumping of its water the magroune sws revealed elevated no3 concentration 75 9 mg l which suggests influence from manure and sewage sources that are evidenced by isotope of nitrate hence mixing between the surface water and groundwater within the magroune sws combined with the dependence of this sws on groundwater suggest that nitrate in the magroune sws is from groundwater impacted by manure and sewage inputs the two surface water samples 6 δ18oh2o 3 5 δ2hh2o 19 8 and 12 δ18oh2o 3 6 δ2hh2o 22 5 collected respectively from the messoussa and el guelb swss display comparable isotopic signatures these two samples plot below the wmmwl and gmwl suggesting they were subject to evaporation process which is also supported by their low d excess values of 6 41 12 and 8 01 6 sample 6 plots on the seawater mixing line whereas sample 12 falls on the evaporation line indicative of more evaporation from the el guelb sws 12 compared to the messoussa sws 6 sample 6 revealed a 3 h content 2 3 0 2 tu that is lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu confirming that this surface water was subject to mixing processes with older groundwater these observations further support the notion that the messoussa sws 6 is a groundwater dependent system wherein its mixed cacl water type fig 9 results from groundwater surface water interactions fig 9 shows that groundwater flow towards sample 6 is from an upstream zone where water is less affected by no3 reason for which sample 6 revealed low no3 concentration 0 55 mg l which was distinguished to be with no3 based atmospheric precipitation origin surface water samples 8 and 9 were collected from the moussisi and zaouia swss respectively both located at the southeastern part of the study area these two samples fall on the evaporation line suggesting evaporation exerted some control on the surface water from both swss however sample 9 is more enriched in the heavy isotopes compared to sample 8 fig 6 leading to a d excess value for sample 9 20 79 substantially lower than that of sample 8 0 69 the zaouia sws 9 is an isolated sws this type of isolated sws is known to experience substantial evaporation kock et al 2019 leading to evapo concentrated water that explains the predominance of the nacl water type fig 8 the moussisi sws is also isolated but during flooding events becomes connected to the magroune river hence the moussisi sws drains excess water during these flooding events which likely explains why it is dominated by less evapo concentrated water of the cacl type in the sector neighbouring the moussisi and zaouia swss groundwater sample 22 revealed ca hco3 water type wherein mineralization likely reflects mixing between meteoric ca hco3 water type from the recharging area corresponding to well 22 featuring high groundwater level and urban wastewater enriched in cl it is possible that the cl concentrations measured in surface water samples 8 and 9 are partially derived from the mixing with groundwater with some of the cl content being concentrated by evaporation high no3 concentration was measured in groundwater from well 22 119 mg l this constitutes source of contamination that could be sprawled through the potential mixing process with groundwater the mixing of groundwater in the south part of the study area is also supported by groundwater sample 18 which exhibits a 3 h content of 2 7 0 3 tu that is lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu fig 6 shows that surface water samples 1 2 3 and 11 collected respectively from the hadj taher gerbes 1 gerbes 2 and gaïd lakhdar swss plot along the evaporation line with enriched isotopic compositions these surface water samples feature low d excess values ranging from 16 2 to 8 6 suggesting they are predominantly affected by evaporation processes however they are not excluded from simultaneous mixing process the water sample from the hadj taher sws for example shows evidence of strong evaporation fig 6 but it plots slightly off the evaporation line potentially due to mixing with saline water as salinity is among the factors controlling the slope of the evaporation line gonfiantini et al 2018 tremblay et al 2021 furthermore the samples 1 2 and 11 have 3 h contents lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu suggesting mixing with older waters this interpretation is also valid for the sample 10 collected from the ain nechema sws which has a 3 h content of 1 8 0 2 tu as the samples 1 2 3 10 and 11 correspond to isolated swss potential mixing with groundwater is expected hence these swss constitute groundwater dependent systems involving active interactions between surface and groundwater wherein potential migration of no3 impacted water from surface water to groundwater and vice versa is expected 5 conclusion the effect of uncontrolled development strategies over the mediterranean coastal study site of guerbes senhadja in algeria are reflected by elevated and harmful no3 concentrations in fact most of the detected no3 concentrations both in groundwater and surface water are above the who drinking water guideline or the natural baseline threshold multiple sources of no3 were distinguished wherein sewage and manure were observed to constitute the main sources of no3 in groundwater and surface water it is somewhat surprising that sewage and manure constitute the chief sources of no3 as previous studies suggested without using more conclusive isotopic tools the use of synthetic fertilizers as the primary source contributing to the local nitrate pool here no3 derived from manure sources is explained by the high amounts of additive animal manure used to fertilise the agricultural areas whereas no3 derived from sewage source is related to rural wastewater discharge the later can be sourced i from the private sanitation systems used by isolated residences that are unable to connect to the sanitation networks and ii from the sanitation networks draining into the rivers without pre treatment compared to other recent studies on algerian eastern coastal areas the present study highlights the particular high apportionment of no3 based atmospheric precipitation both in groundwater and surface water agreeing with the high no3 concentration detected in rainwater this new specific site finding not only shows the particular features of the study area experiencing multiple sources of no3 but also demonstrates the effectiveness of using isotopic tracers to investigate the sources of nitrate in coastal ecosystems potential no3 from atmospheric precipitation was totally ignored in previous hydrogeological studies undertaken in the study area however this study did not identify the potential sources of no3 in local precipitation further efforts are recommended to monitor the no3 concentration in rainwater within the study area and to investigate the relative sources of atmospheric nitrogen the present study revealed that no3 impacted groundwater surface water samples are distributed relatively evenly over the entire study area as the migration of no3 impacted water could occur via interactions between surface water and groundwater the present study highlights the identification of such interactions here the evidenced interactions between surface water and groundwater through using multi isotopic tracers suggest that surface water systems are dependent on groundwater and even groundwater within aquifer is dependent on surface water this identified behavior over the study site shows the complex hydrogeology of this system but provides helpful information to further local studies aiming to understand anthropogenic sprawl pathways within the entire guerbes senhadja ecosystem this potential research topic can be added to other researches focusing in developing environmental optimization strategies to achieve a sustainable management of the mediterranean coastal site of guerbes senhadja given the elevated no3 concentrations enhanced by multi anthropogenic sources author contributions the first

1260,implementing sustainable groundwater resources management in coastal areas is challenging due to the negative impacts of anthropogenic stressors and various interactions between groundwater and surface water this study focuses on nitrate contamination and transport via groundwater surface water exchange in a mediterranean coastal area guerbes senhadja region algeria that is heavily affected by anthropogenic activities a multi tracer approach integrating hydrogeochemical and isotopic tracers δ2hh2o δ18oh2o 3h δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 is combined with a bayesian isotope mixing model mixsiar to i elucidate the nitrate sources and their apportionments in water systems and ii describe potential interactions between groundwater and surface water results from nitrate isotopic composition and the mixsiar model show that nitrate concentrations mainly originate from sewage and manure sources nitrate derived from the sewage is attributed to urban and rural wastewater discharge whereas nitrate derived from the manure is related to animal manure used to fertilise agricultural areas high apportionments of nitrate based atmospheric precipitation are identified in groundwater and surface water a finding that is specific to this study the multi origin stresses combined with evidence of interactions between surface water and groundwater contribute to negatively impacting large parts of the study coastal area the outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to sustainable management of coastal ecosystems by drawing more attention towards groundwater use and protection furthermore this study may improve scientists ability to predict the behavior of anthropogenically impacted coastal ecosystems and help decision makers elsewhere to prepare suitable environmental strategies for other coastal ecosystems currently undergoing an early stage of groundwater resources deterioration keywords nitrate isotope tracers aquifer groundwater surface water mixsiar data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction coastal areas commonly contain aquatic ecosystems that contribute to rich biodiversity as they provide habitat and food resources for wildlife and estuarine marine and terrestrial fauna camacho valdez et al 2013 clara et al 2018 newton et al 2018 these ecosystems include a variety of surface water systems swss e g swamps inlets marshes and lagoons that locally control the hydrological cycle by contributing to surface water retention rao et al 2015 velasco et al 2018 however large amounts of the surface water stored in coastal ecosystems can be supplied by groundwater which is why many are commonly classified as groundwater dependent ecosystems erostate et al 2020 menció et al 2017 stumpp et al 2014 the human population may depend directly on these coastal ecosystems for numerous activities including tourism agriculture fisheries and aquaculture exploitation clara et al 2018 lyra et al 2021 willaert 2014 therefore these ecosystems have direct economic value in addition to their intrinsic somewhat less easily quantified value of the ecosystem service functions that they provide many of these ecosystems are protected by legal regulations through national international conventions e g barcelona convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea to sustainably manage human activities at all scales however the uncontrolled human exploitation of coastal areas combined with other harmful practices such as industrial and domestic discharges result in groundwater resource deterioration that affects the ecosystem functions barhoumi et al 2014 david et al 2019 pittalis et al 2018 increased nutrient inputs enhanced by urban agricultural or industrial discharges affects groundwater quality and leads to anthropogenic eutrophication of swss such practices disturb the swss deteriorating and damaging the ecosystem functions and consequently reducing their intrinsic and economic benefits erostate et al 2022 garcía and muñoz vera 2015 the scientific community must collectively address such interdisciplinary problem hydrogeologists conceptualized surface water and groundwater flux as determinant factors that control the ecosystems erostate et al 2020 from this conceptualization environmental legislation has been enacted in many locations around the world that requires an integrated approach e g usgs national water quality assessment program leahy et al 1990 in which both surface water and groundwater are considered together when developing ecosystem management strategies however implementing efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management for coastal areas is challenging due to the impact of multi anthropogenic stressors combined with the various interactions between groundwater and surface water clara et al 2018 erostate et al 2022 2019 some known examples of mediterranean coastal systems experiencing intensive agricultural activities have caused serious deterioration of local groundwater resources boumaiza et al 2022 lyra et al 2021 rachid et al 2021 to establish efficient and sustainable combined management of groundwater and surface water resources in coastal ecosystems field based case studies are needed to this end impacted coastal areas provide an opportunity to research the challenges faced by many ecosystems around the world especially in regions with uncontrolled land use development coastal ecosystems occupy approximately 13 of the world s coastlines with a contribution estimated to 18 of the africa coastline barnes 1980 kjerfve 1994 in north africa coastal ecosystems are widely distributed from the atlantic ocean to the southeastern coastline of the mediterranean sea through morocco algeria tunisia libya and egypt el mahrad et al 2020 the present study provides results from a field based research program which was guided through an algerian coastal complex area where ecosystems are heavily affected by multiple anthropogenic activities to construct a comprehensive understanding on how these coastal ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic stresses algeria contains several coastal areas of international importance including the selected coastal mediterranean area of guerbes senhadja a 2011 recognized ramsar site emphasizing the international relevance of the selected study area the guerbes senhadja region contains several swss distributed over an area of complex geomorphology featuring a multitude of depressions and valleys sandy dunes rivers estuaries beaches and sea cliffs it is a significantly important site for tourism having high agricultural potential and rich biodiversity sheltering many plant and animal species babouri et al 2020 bouchaala et al 2017 samraoui and de belair 1997 however this site of important ecological and socioeconomic values is disturbed by several anthropogenic stressors including land clearing fires overgrazing sand pit exploitation uncontrolled growing urbanization unmanaged agricultural expansion combined with unsafe agricultural practices and excessive extraction of groundwater and surface water for irrigation and domestic purposes toubal et al 2014 all these anthropogenic stressors seriously impact the study area where several degrading signs have been observed such as the erosion of river banks and littoral sandy dunes destabilization silting up of fertile lands and water quality deterioration hedjal et al 2019 toubal et al 2014 despite the increased uncontrolled land use the total surface of the study area is still made up approximately of 80 of agricultural lands which are dominated by production of legumes in open agricultural fields the direct uncontrolled application of nitrogen based fertilizers to agricultural lands of the study area suggests that the identified harmful nitrate no3 concentrations in groundwater no3 up to 97 mg l can be attributed to contributions from unsafe agricultural practices hadj said 2007 however this conclusion has yet to be verified by advanced source tracking tools such as stable isotope analyses or statistical based interpretation rivers crossing the guerbes senhadja region receive urban and industrial wastewater discharges without pre treatment bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 this suggests that high no3 concentrations in groundwater could also be attributed to contribution from potential wastewater influx as wastewater and associated contaminants from urban industrial discharges could infiltrate into the aquifer or originate from interactions between groundwater and surface water mccance et al 2018 vystavna et al 2019 this paper presents a preliminary study aiming i to distinguish the main sources of groundwater quality deterioration within the coastal area of guerbes senhadja with focus on anthropogenic no3 contamination and ii to describe potential groundwater surface water interactions by investigating the potential relationship between surface water and groundwater at the investigated sampling site that contribute to transporting impacted water over the coastal aquifer a multi tracer approach is used that integrates major chemical elements stable water isotopes δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o stable nitrate isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 the radioactive isotope tritium 3h and a bayesian isotope mixing model mixsiar furthermore we argue that our approach may improve scientists ability to predict the hydrogeological behavior of anthropized complex coastal areas and will help groundwater managers from other regions to prepare suitable environmental plans for coastal ecosystems undergoing an early stage of groundwater resources deterioration 2 setting of study area 2 1 geographic location and hydrologic features the study area is the guerbes senhadja wetland located 25 km east of the city of skikda in northeastern algeria fig 1 the study area constitutes a large coastal valley separating the felfela senhadja mountains featuring an altitude varying from 330 m above sea level a s l djebel safia to 541 m a s l djebel el foul at the west and the chetaïbi mountains presenting an altitude reaching up to 510 m a s l at east further south the study area connects to a large flat valley constituting the plain of ben azouz whereas the northern boundary is the mediterranean sea over a shoreline of roughly 15 km the guerbes senhadja area is mainly crossed by the el kebir river flowing south to north from which two other rivers are tributary i e the maboune river in the southwest and the magroune river in southeast of the study area fig 1 the study site covers approximately 200 km2 on which there are some urban villages including ben azouz guerbes and zaouia villages next to other small rural communities such as ouled malek gaïd lakhdar ain nechema and dem el begrat the guerbes senhadja region is an alluvial system wherein half of the study area features slopes varying from 3 to 13 boussehaba 2010 this landscape physiography provides a multitude of depressions and valleys forming several swss locally called merdja or garâa featuring shallow water depths ranging from 0 5 to 3 m below ground surface bouchaala et al 2017 several other small swss 0 01 km2 exist within the study area most of them are the result of artificial digging by local farmers for providing surface water used for irrigating the agricultural lands the guerbes senhadja region is characterized by mediterranean climate conditions featuring two main distinct periods i a wet period occurring from october to april with monthly average temperature of 14 c and ii a dry period occurring from may to september with monthly average temperature of 26 c hedjal 2019 the study area captures an average annual rainfall precipitation amount of about 687 mm including 594 mm over the wet period october april whereas 93 mm are received during the dry period may september the mean annual actual evapotranspiration was estimated at 456 mm including 263 mm for the wet period and 193 mm corresponding to the dry period hedjal 2019 during the wet period the excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration leads to considerable aquifer recharge conversely the dry period features an evapotranspiration rate exceeding precipitation that accordingly leads to enhanced evaporation from both swss and groundwater tables 2 2 geology geomorphology and hydrogeological background the guerbes senhadja region belongs to the algerian coastal magmatic chain which is considered as part of the internal zones of the north africa alpine chain originating from tectonic activity in the occidental mediterranean basin associated with the collision of the african and european tectonic plates during the oligo miocene period auzende et al 1975 cohen 1980 letouzey and trémolières 1980 vila 1980 the study area corresponds to a neogene subsiding graben limited by two major fault systems which caused large kilometric scale landslides during the last alpine phase of the miocene this tectonic event placed the african plate and the european plate represented respectively by the edough complex to the east and the felfela basement to the west at the same latitude the geological context of these formations includes metamorphosed granitoid rocks fig 2 which are partly covered by a system of folded sedimentary rocks resulting from tectonic activity these folded sedimentary rocks are composed of cretaceous marls sandstones cretaceous flysch and oligo miocene sandstones numidian flysch joleaud 1936 llavsky and snopkova 1987 edough metamorphic rock complex was isolated from the felfela and stood with sufficient relief that it was an island when the sea invaded the region during the pliocene hilly 1962 however sedimentary inputs from the mainland progressively filled of the shallow basins located at the southern and eastern limits of the edough metamorphic rock complex the later subsequently became linked to the african continent since the early quaternary further the edough metamorphic rock complex shoreline has continued to evolve from south to north leading to the deposition of large accumulations of quaternary deposits within the subsiding graben of guerbes senhadja fig 2 during the late quaternary period predominant north western south eastern winds formed an 8000 ha region of sandy dunes over the guerbes senhadja region the effect of the winds decreased inland from the sea such that these sandy dune deposits are common and relatively thick along the coast and are much reduced inland these sandy dune deposits are also rich in impermeable clay lenses that probably reflect avulsions of the el kebir river on its north eastern side whereas the obstruction of the river bed combined with the gentle slope of terrain fostered the extension of the alluvial plain thereby creating a series of depressions during the evolution process samraoui and de belair 1997 together these events can explain the variable slopes within the study region that again range from 3 to 13 boussehaba 2010 hedjal et al 2018 the low surface water drainage over the study area combined with high groundwater discharge from the sandy dune deposits promote the accumulation of surface water that has resulted in the formation of several swss samraoui and de belair 1997 toubal et al 2014 the subsiding graben of the guerbes senhadja region is filled by plio quaternary granular lithogenic material corresponding to multiple origins including eolian and fluvio lacustrine deposits that explain the diversity in lithofacies regarding the information from boreholes drilled in the study area the guerbes senhadja region contains an upper unconfined aquifer varying from 50 to 140 m in thickness mainly composed of sandy material overlying clay deposits with a mean thickness of 5 m hedjal 2019 that constitutes the top of the deeper confined aquifer the latter has a thickness varying from 12 to 50 m and is composed of polygenic materials gravels and pebbles presumably resting on substratum formed by alternating sandstone and marl bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 the upper and deeper aquifers are directly connected in some locations of the study area where the clayey aquitard separating them is practically nonexistent hedjal 2019 chemical analyses of groundwater samples collected from the upper aquifer in 2013 bouleknafet and derradji 2017 and 2016 hedjal et al 2018 revealed sodium chloride and magnesium chloride water types 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analyses 3 1 1 sampling network and protocol the present study included both a surface water and groundwater sampling program which was performed on november 20 22 2021 here 10 groundwater samples were collected over the study area 14 surface water samples were collected from swss and the main rivers crossing the study area fig 3 one sample was collected from the mediterranean sea and one from rainfall it should be mentioned that the choice of the sampling sites is essentially based on their accessibility groundwater samples were collected from shallow private wells that were dug by the owners in the unconsolidated sediments these wells feature a diameter varying overall from 2 to 3 m and groundwater depth of 3 6 m below ground surface surface water samples were collected as grab samples directly from the streams during water sampling the physico chemical parameters temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds both for groundwater and surface water were measured in situ using a calibrated multiparameter probe hi 9829 hanna instruments the water collected for major anion and cation chemical analyses was filtered in situ through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters attached to 100 ml luer lock syringe samplers and subsequently pushed through the filters into two separate 40 ml amber glass bottles the bottles for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 by adding 2 3 drops of ultrapure nitric acid hno3 with the aim to prevent major cations precipitation or adsorption during storage water samples for δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o analyses were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles whereas filtered water for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 analyses were collected in 50 ml polyethylene bottles the water for 3h analysis was collected in 500 ml polyethylene bottles all sample bottles were completely filled with water without head space and bottles were equipped with caps containing teflon septa parafilm to prevent evaporation during fieldwork the water samples were temporarily stored in a portable cooler before being transferred to a refrigerator for storage at 4 c and further transported to the laboratories the samples collected for stable nitrate isotope analyses were stored frozen to avoid variations caused by biological processes until the isotopic analyses were performed in the laboratory all the water samples collected in this study 26 samples were analyzed for the major elements and δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o seventeen samples were analyzed for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 whereas seven samples were analyzed for 3h 3 1 2 chemical and isotope tracer analyses the chemical analysis was carried out in several laboratories the major chemical elements hco3 no3 cl k mg 2 nh4 na ca 2 and so4 2 were analyzed at the laboratory of the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france the major elements concentrations were measured using a dionex ics 1100 chromatograph thermo fischer scientific waltham usa except hco3 concentrations that were determined by volumetric titration to ph 4 5 using a digital titrator hach hach company loveland co u s a the results of major elements were validated by testing the ionic balance for which a absolute value of 5 was considered acceptable appelo and postma 2005 hounslow 1995 tritium was analyzed at the wessling laboratory at budapest hungary water samples for 3 h were

performed at the laboratory of the institute of soil physics and rural water management in vienna austria these water isotopic compositions were determined using a laser based isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i according to the analytical scheme recommended by the international atomic energy agency iaea penna et al 2010 nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were analyzed at the helmholtz center for environmental research in halle saale germany using the denitrifier method with bacteria strains of pseudomonas chlororaphis atcc 13985 equal to dsm 6698 according to the protocols recommended by casciotti et al 2002 and sigman et al 2001 here the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopic composition produced from no3 was measured by gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry using a delta v plus mass spectrometer and a gasbench ii from thermo scientific the isotope values expressed in δ were calculated using eq 1 where r sample and r standard are the sample s and the standard s

diagram kendall 1998 combining δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 isotopic compositions with specific zones corresponding to sources of no3 was used in the present study to identify the potential sources of no3 these sources include no3 based atmospheric precipitation ap no3 based fertilizers nof nh4 fertilizers nhf soil organic nitrogen son sewage and manure s m and no3 based desert deposits dd furthermore a bayesian stable isotope mixing model mixsiar model stock et al 2018 was used to estimate the contributions of the different no3 sources to each groundwater and surface water sample numerous studies have assessed the usefulness of the mixsiar model in apportioning the potential sources of no3 in water systems e g boumaiza et al 2022 cao et al 2021 he et al 2022 li et al 2022 torres martínez et al 2021 the mixsiar model requires the values of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 measured in water samples and the different end member isotopic values of the sources of no3 in this study the end member isotopic values of ap nof nhf son and s m were considered whereas no3 based desert deposits were excluded as the study area is located in the mediterranean region as the present study does not cover large number of water samples analyzed for nitrate isotopes n 17 the end member isotopic values of the different potential sources of no3 were adopted from torres martínez et al 2021 who investigated no3 contamination in an area with comparable no3 anthropogenic sources the δ15nno3 end member isotopic values are 0 11 1 69 for ap 0 07 2 85 for nof 1 24 1 44 for nhf 3 26 1 99 for son and 10 14 4 53 for

quality the analytical results of the chemical concentrations concerning the water samples collected over the study area are presented in table 1 groundwater from the study area is circumneutral with ph values varying from 6 3 to 7 7 without significant spatial variation groundwater displayed ec values ranging from 303 to 1178 μs cm with a median value of 619 μs cm the elevated ec values of 1178 μs cm well 16 1004 μs cm well 15 and 861 μs cm well 22 correspond respectively to the urbanized sectors of dem el begrat ben azouz and zaouia suggesting an active mineralization potentially derived from urban anthropogenic sources all groundwater samples revealed acceptable concentrations in so4 relative to the respective drinking water limit of 500 mg l that is recommended by the world health organization who 2017 also groundwater samples showed low concentrations of nh4 with values below a maximum of 0 5 mg l three groundwater samples 15 16 and 22 revealed mg concentrations exceeding a value of 30 mg l however the set of the collected groundwater samples have a median mg concentration of 11 32 mg l high concentrations were identified for the other major elements including hco3 max 433 mg l median 223 mg l cl max 151 mg l median 62 1 mg l na max 86 3 mg l median 51 4 mg l k max 26 8 mg l median 7 66 mg l and ca max 120 3 mg l median 51 4 mg l in groundwater no3 concentrations were detected with values ranging from 2 8 to 166 mg l nine groundwater samples revealed no3 concentration above the natural baseline threshold value of 5 mg l appelo and postma 2005 panno et al 2006 suggesting potential anthropogenic influence over the study area surface water samples revealed a median ph value of 7 1 excessive nh4 concentrations were observed for some surface water samples 13 22 3 mg l 14 16 3 mg l suggesting an anthropogenic influence the surface water samples show a cationic dominance of na median value of 132 mg l or ca median value of 75 5 mg l the other major cations are ranked as follow mg k nh4 with corresponding median values of 27 8 11 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively for anions cl exhibited the highest concentrations with median value of 249 mg l whereas the other major anions are ranked as follow regarding their concentrations hco3 so4 no3 with respective median values of 175 47 1 and 8 2 mg l nitrate concentrations from the collected surface waters ranged from 0 4 to 75 9 mg l 4 2 nitrate contamination 4 2 1 nitrate distribution over the study area fig 4 shows that groundwater featuring no3 concentrations above the who drinking water guideline no3 50 mg l correspond to rural communities of dem el bagrat 16 el guelb 19 marabout aïcha 20 and the village of zaouia 22 suggesting a potential urban influence groundwater samples 17 and 24 collected from private wells located in small villages revealed moderate concentrations in no3 30 mg l no3 50 mg l whereas those having no3 concentrations 30 mg l 15 18 21 and 23 correspond to the less urbanized sector nitrate concentrations are not continuously monitored over the study area but the maximum no3 concentration in groundwater up to 97 mg l detected in 2007 hadj said 2007 is lower than the maximum value of 166 mg l reported in the present study fig 4 shows that no3 50 mg l in surface waters occur in the southern part of the study area including one sample 13 collected from magroune sws two samples 5 and 14 from the upstream of el kebir river and one sample 10 from ain nechema sws which is connected to the el kebir river nitrate concentrations along the el kebir river decrease from 60 mg l to 14 mg l with flow downstream indicating either dilution or denitrification 4 2 2 sources and apportionment of nitrate in water systems groundwater have δ15nno3 values ranging from 1 1 to 14 2 with a median value of 4 9 and δ18ono3 values varying between 4 3 and 29 8 with a median value of 11 8 surface water samples have values ranging from 2 4 to 18 7 with a median value of 5 4 for δ15nno3 and from 3 to 35 3 with a median value of 6 1 for δ18ono3 table 1 result from kendall s diagram indicates that the study area is affected by multiple sources of no3 fig 5a groundwater samples fall within two main groups the first one contains groundwater samples plotting in the manure and sewage zone fig 5a including two groundwater samples 19 and 20 with nitrate isotopic compositions that plot in the overlapping area of manure and sewage with soil derived nitrogen the second group contains groundwater samples falling within no3 based atmospheric precipitation including one groundwater sample 21 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers similarly surface water samples fall in two groups identified for groundwater except surface water sample 13 that plots in the overlapping area of manure and sewage with nh4 fertilizers and 1 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers fig 5a the combined analysis of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 makes it possible to evaluate nitrate transformation processes in a water system subjected to microbial denitrification böttcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 specifically the denitrification process is commonly reflected by a positive 2 1 relationship between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 mengis et al 1999 singleton et al 2007 here the scattered distribution of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 fig 5a makes it difficult to distinguish between mixing of differently denitrified sources and actual denitrification the mixsiar model results figs 5b c suggest that sewage and manure s m are the main no3 sources both in groundwater 31 7 and surface water 29 6 a finding which is consistent with the above outcomes from kendall s diagram the other considered sources of no3 in groundwater are observed with the following ranking order son 20 1 ap 18 nof 15 5 nhf 14 7 fig 5b in surface water these sources are ranked as follow son 21 1 nof 17 8 ap 17 1 nhf 14 4 fig 5c 4 2 3 discussion on the sources of nitrate it is somewhat surprising that s m are identified as the main sources of no3 over the study area because previous studies e g hadj said 2007 assumed synthetic fertilizers as the main no3 source nitrate derived from sewage within the study area could be from two sources first no3 could be derived from inefficient private sanitation systems still used by rural residences that are unable to connect to the collective sanitation networks these inefficient private sanitation systems are commonly built with open bottom sewage storage through which wastewater can directly reach groundwater boumaiza et al 2021b 2020 2019 second no3 could be derived from wastewater discharge from sanitation networks as the el kebir river which crosses the study area receives wastewater discharges without pre treatment bouleknafet and derradji 2017 toubal et al 2014 likely these wastewater discharges explain the concentrations of no3 detected from surface water samples collected from the el kebir river nitrate derived from manure source within the study area are linked to animal manure that is applied as an organic fertilizer further investigations based on additional isotope tracers and or emerging compounds could help to distinguish sewage from animal waste source erostate et al 2019 lasagna and de luca 2017 using animal manure to fertilise crops in agricultural areas is a common practice in algeria because the use of industrial synthetic fertilizers has been prohibited by the algerian government since the 1990s chabour 2004 surface water samples 1 and 21 having nitrate isotopic values falling in the overlapping area of no3 based atmospheric precipitation and no3 based fertilizers fig 5a could be accordingly assumed to have no3 based atmospheric precipitation source the accumulation of nhf son and nof in water systems of the study area agrees with land use which has been traditionally dominated by agricultural activities detecting no3 contributions derived from nhf son and nof in groundwater corresponds to what could be expected for the unconfined aquifer of the study area which is mainly dominated by sandy material with high permeability such material allows the infiltration of leached no3 based fertilizers which could occur via i direct rainwater infiltration and or during irrigation water return that subsequently facilitates the leaching of fertilizers added on the agricultural lands and or ii via potential no3 impacted surface water influx malki et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 although the majority of emitted anthropogenic nitrogen components can enter terrestrial and marine ecosystems via atmospheric nitrogen deposition galloway et al 2008 a potential no3 based atmospheric precipitation influence was neglected in previous studies undertaken in the study area bouleknafet and derradji 2017 hadj said 2007 hedjal et al 2018 toubal et al 2014 the present study identifies no3 based ap with a high apportionment both in groundwater 18 and surface water 17 1 this finding shows the particular features of the study area experiencing multi anthropogenic sources of no3 compared to other recent studies on algerian coastal areas that did not reveal no3 based atmospheric precipitation influence boumaiza et al 2022 2020 in the present study the ap apportionment in groundwater is higher than those of nof 15 5 and nhf 14 7 whereas in surface water it is higher than nhf 14 4 and showed comparable apportionment to that of nof 17 8 this finding illustrates the significant influence of atmospheric precipitation on the no3 concentrations and agrees with high no3 concentration measured in the collected rainwater sample 23 8 mg l sample 26 in table 1 while there is no on going monitoring of no3 concentration in rainwater within the study region the measured concentration of no3 in rainwater from this study is about eight times greater than that measured by erostate et al 2018 who studied a proximal western mediterranean coastal ecosystem the present study also reveals that ap apportionments in groundwater 18 and surface water 17 1 are relatively high compared to other agricultural areas where contributions from ap did not exceed 4 he et al 2022 li et al 2022 torres martínez et al 2021 recent environmental studies demonstrated the presence of atmospheric nitrogen from anthropogenic sources across regions neighbouring the study area mourdi 2011 nadhir 2019 however these studies did not distinguish the impact of atmospheric nitrogen on groundwater resources as demonstrated in the present study further specific local studies are recommended to investigate the potential sources of atmospheric nitrogen within the study area the kendall diagram fig 5a shows that surface water samples 1 2 and 6 and groundwater samples 15 18 and 21 that are impacted by no3 atmospheric precipitation are distributed relatively evenly over the entire study area fig 4 accordingly potential migration of no3 impacted water could occur via interactions between surface water and groundwater which justifies our second objective to identify these potential interactions within the study area the increase in nutrient inputs enhanced by urban agricultural or industrial discharges not only impact groundwater quality but can also upset the biodiversity equilibrium of ecosystems causing ecological damages that result in deterioration of ecosystem functions and consequently diminishing profitable benefits of these ecosystems erostate et al 2022 garcía and muñoz vera 2015 4 3 groundwater surface water origin and interactions 4 3 1 water origin and potential salinization processes the δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o compositions as well as 3 h activities for the samples drawn from groundwater and surface water from the study area are presented in table 1 the isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples range from 6 1 to 4 5 for δ18oh2o and from 33 to 23 8 for δ2hh2o these groundwater isotopic values are comparable to other north africa mediterranean coastal aquifers boumaiza et al 2022 2020 chafouq et al 2018 elmeknassi et al 2022 the surface water samples revealed isotopic compositions ranging from 5 7 to 5 3 for δ18oh2o and from 31 5 to 22 for δ2hh2o the mediterranean sea sample displays isotopic values corresponding to 0 46 for δ18oh2o and 1 7 for δ2hh2o in the present study the δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o values are interpreted according to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl celle 2000 in fig 6 groundwater samples cluster around the wmmwl suggesting that the groundwater has been recharged into the aquifer through direct infiltration of rainwater with minimal evaporation this corresponds to what could be expected for the unconfined aquifer of the study area composed of permeable sediments the groundwater d excess values ranging from 11 12 to 15 64 table 1 are indicative of modern recharge having typical isotopic compositions of recharge derived from mediterranean moisture sources celle jeanton et al 2001 gat and carmi 1970 the range of the calculated groundwater d excess can be explained by mixing processes involving local groundwater with other groundwater having different isotopic signatures tantawi et al 1998 the mixing process is evidenced also by isotopic enrichment directed towards the mediterranean sea isotopic signature blue point in fig 6 however this isotopic enrichment could constitute the result of infiltrated evaporative water like infiltrated rainwater affected by evaporation during precipitation events clark and fritz 1997 other studies in algeria have noted evaporative rainwater with comparable slope to that obtained in the present study mebrouk et al 2007 moulla and guendouz 1996 nonetheless as the groundwater samples fall above the gmwl mixing process is rather expected most surface water samples display heavier isotopic values compared to those of groundwater and deviate from the gmwl by following a distinct line fig 6 indicating a high isotopic fractionation effect the latter feature could be related to a high evaporation effect because i the evaporation line falls below the seawater mixing line and ii the d excess displays low values boumaiza et al 2021a gemitzi et al 2014 in fig 7 slight positive correlation is observed between surface water cl and δ18oh2o values r 2 0 6 suggesting an increase in salinity accompanying heavy isotope enrichment this positive relationship confirms the above effect of the evaporation process samples from el kebir river 4 5 and 14 display an isotopic enrichment towards the downstream direction of water flow with respective d excess values of 5 94 14 5 31 5 and 3 64 4 the water along the el kebir river is mostly controlled by the bekouche lakhdar dam implemented at an upstream level of the el kebir river which decreases the flow along the el kebir river leading to more surface water evaporation toubal et al 2014 this can explain why surface water samples 4 5 and 14 from the el kebir river show isotope evidence of evaporation however mixing is also probable particularly for sample 4 which plots along the seawater mixing line 4 3 2 dominant water type for groundwater and surface water the plot of the ten collected groundwater samples on the piper diagram fig 8a shows the dominance of two main water types four groundwater samples 15 18 21 and 22 are dominated by ca hco3 water type whereas the other samples 16 17 19 20 23 and 24 plot within the field of the cacl mixed water type wells 15 18 and 22 potentially correspond to a recharge area as they are characterized by a classic ca hco3 water type which is indicative of recent recharge hiscock 2009 well 21 is located downhill from the sandy dune deposits occupying the northeastern part of the study area the presence of ca hco3 water type at well 21 could also reflect recent recharge through the sandy dune deposits freshening of groundwater from wells 15 18 21 and 22 is supported by the gibbs s diagram fig 8c which shows that these samples form a distinct group that have been impacted by the freshening process the other six groundwater samples 16 17 19 20 23 and 24 which plot as cacl mixed water type on the piper diagram are distributed over the central part of the study area fig 9 with samples 16 23 and 24 located towards the east and the samples 17 19 and 20 situated towards the west of the study area the gibbs s diagram fig 8c suggests that samples 17 19 and 20 are predominantly undergoing a freshening process whereas samples 16 23 and 24 are undergoing mixing process it is possible that ca hco3 water type identified at wells 15 and 18 experienced some freshening control on groundwater at wells 17 19 and 20 resulting in the mixed water type described above the cl concentrations presented in table 1 show that highest cl and na concentrations occur in groundwater from well 16 cl 151 mg l na 86 3 mg l and well 23 cl 124 mg l na 70 9 mg l these two inland wells are located far from the mediterranean sea shoreline fig 3 conversely groundwater from well 21 neighbouring the mediterranean sea revealed low concentrations in cl 83 9 mg l and na 58 4 mg l these patterns of cl concentrations suggest that groundwater from wells 16 and 23 is enriched in cl and na from other potential sources rather than direct enrichment from the mediterranean sea the fact that groundwater from wells 15 22 and 24 plot below the equiline of 1 1 on fig 8d indicates slight dominance of na over cl calcium exchange from freshwater ca hco3 in composition with na sorbed on clays minerals is a common process along groundwater flow paths lee 1985 park et al 2009 toran and saunders 1999 the consequence of this cationic exchange process is an increase in na concentration in groundwater which is commonly observed in coastal aquifers appelo and postma 2005 however we cannot exclude the possible influence of an anthropogenic source of na e g urban wastewater as the samples 15 22 and 24 were collected from urbanized sectors of the study area the two surface water samples collected along upstream portions of the el kebir river 14 and ben azouz 5 correspond to the cacl mixed water type whereas the sample collected from the downstream of the el kebir river 4 corresponds to the nacl water type this observation suggests surface water evolution as water flows downstream also there is potential high mixing of surface water at sampling point 4 with the mediterranean sea as the el kebir river sample 4 is connected to the mediterranean sea we note that river water samples from the downstream portion of the el kebir river exhibit a similar signature to that of the mediterranean sea on the piper diagram fig 8b mixing of el kebir river waters with the mediterranean sea is also supported by the gibbs diagram fig 8c on which the downstream el kebir river water sample plots within a region suggestive of mixing with the mediterranean sea the piper diagram shows that surface water samples are dominated by saline waters of the nacl type as well as mixed water of the cacl type these two water types are also evidenced by the gibbs diagram fig 8c wherein the water surface samples having nacl water type 1 2 3 4 9 10 and 11 plot in advanced mixing stage compared to those having mixed cacl water type 5 6 7 8 12 13 and 14 that are grouped in early mixing stage 4 3 3 isotopic evidence of surface water groundwater interactions in fig 6 surface water sample 7 falls on the wmmwl suggesting less evaporation effect despite the fact that open surface water systems are commonly subjected to greater evaporation than groundwater dindane et al 2003 surface water sample 7 displayed a high d excess value of 14 4 and also plots on seawater mixing line these observations suggest that surface water is subject to mixing process which can also explain why sample 7 is classified as a cacl mixed water type according to the piper diagram the mixing process is also evidenced from the 3 h content here the surface water sample 7 revealed 3 h content of 1 7 0 2 tu indicating a reduced activity relative to the rainwater 3 h content having weighted mean of 3 8 tu erostate et al 2018 hence surface water sample 7 must have mixed with older water moreover surface water sample 7 exhibits an isotopic signature within the range of the groundwater samples fig 6 confirming that surface water from site 7 likely interacted with groundwater hence potential migration of the identified no3 impacted water at site 7 fig 4 could occur via the evidenced interactions between surface water and groundwater surface water sample 13 collected from the magroune sws has δ18oh2o 4 3 and δ2hh2o 23 6 values that fall outside the range exhibited by the groundwater samples fig 6 and plots on both the gmwl and the seawater mixing line these features suggest that sample 13 has experienced less evaporation while also undergoing possible mixing with saltwater which agrees with the piper diagram as sample 13 is classified as a cacl mixed water type it appears that excessive pumping of water from the magroune sws for irrigating the large neighbouring agricultural areas has exerted some control on the isotopic features when surface water is pumped from the magroune sws the extracted water appears to include a groundwater component because the isotopic signature of sample 13 is closer to that of the groundwater samples than to most of the surface water samples hence the magroune sws appears to be a groundwater dependent system containing less evaporated water due to the periodic pumping of its water the magroune sws revealed elevated no3 concentration 75 9 mg l which suggests influence from manure and sewage sources that are evidenced by isotope of nitrate hence mixing between the surface water and groundwater within the magroune sws combined with the dependence of this sws on groundwater suggest that nitrate in the magroune sws is from groundwater impacted by manure and sewage inputs the two surface water samples 6 δ18oh2o 3 5 δ2hh2o 19 8 and 12 δ18oh2o 3 6 δ2hh2o 22 5 collected respectively from the messoussa and el guelb swss display comparable isotopic signatures these two samples plot below the wmmwl and gmwl suggesting they were subject to evaporation process which is also supported by their low d excess values of 6 41 12 and 8 01 6 sample 6 plots on the seawater mixing line whereas sample 12 falls on the evaporation line indicative of more evaporation from the el guelb sws 12 compared to the messoussa sws 6 sample 6 revealed a 3 h content 2 3 0 2 tu that is lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu confirming that this surface water was subject to mixing processes with older groundwater these observations further support the notion that the messoussa sws 6 is a groundwater dependent system wherein its mixed cacl water type fig 9 results from groundwater surface water interactions fig 9 shows that groundwater flow towards sample 6 is from an upstream zone where water is less affected by no3 reason for which sample 6 revealed low no3 concentration 0 55 mg l which was distinguished to be with no3 based atmospheric precipitation origin surface water samples 8 and 9 were collected from the moussisi and zaouia swss respectively both located at the southeastern part of the study area these two samples fall on the evaporation line suggesting evaporation exerted some control on the surface water from both swss however sample 9 is more enriched in the heavy isotopes compared to sample 8 fig 6 leading to a d excess value for sample 9 20 79 substantially lower than that of sample 8 0 69 the zaouia sws 9 is an isolated sws this type of isolated sws is known to experience substantial evaporation kock et al 2019 leading to evapo concentrated water that explains the predominance of the nacl water type fig 8 the moussisi sws is also isolated but during flooding events becomes connected to the magroune river hence the moussisi sws drains excess water during these flooding events which likely explains why it is dominated by less evapo concentrated water of the cacl type in the sector neighbouring the moussisi and zaouia swss groundwater sample 22 revealed ca hco3 water type wherein mineralization likely reflects mixing between meteoric ca hco3 water type from the recharging area corresponding to well 22 featuring high groundwater level and urban wastewater enriched in cl it is possible that the cl concentrations measured in surface water samples 8 and 9 are partially derived from the mixing with groundwater with some of the cl content being concentrated by evaporation high no3 concentration was measured in groundwater from well 22 119 mg l this constitutes source of contamination that could be sprawled through the potential mixing process with groundwater the mixing of groundwater in the south part of the study area is also supported by groundwater sample 18 which exhibits a 3 h content of 2 7 0 3 tu that is lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu fig 6 shows that surface water samples 1 2 3 and 11 collected respectively from the hadj taher gerbes 1 gerbes 2 and gaïd lakhdar swss plot along the evaporation line with enriched isotopic compositions these surface water samples feature low d excess values ranging from 16 2 to 8 6 suggesting they are predominantly affected by evaporation processes however they are not excluded from simultaneous mixing process the water sample from the hadj taher sws for example shows evidence of strong evaporation fig 6 but it plots slightly off the evaporation line potentially due to mixing with saline water as salinity is among the factors controlling the slope of the evaporation line gonfiantini et al 2018 tremblay et al 2021 furthermore the samples 1 2 and 11 have 3 h contents lower than that of the local rainwater 3 8 tu suggesting mixing with older waters this interpretation is also valid for the sample 10 collected from the ain nechema sws which has a 3 h content of 1 8 0 2 tu as the samples 1 2 3 10 and 11 correspond to isolated swss potential mixing with groundwater is expected hence these swss constitute groundwater dependent systems involving active interactions between surface and groundwater wherein potential migration of no3 impacted water from surface water to groundwater and vice versa is expected 5 conclusion the effect of uncontrolled development strategies over the mediterranean coastal study site of guerbes senhadja in algeria are reflected by elevated and harmful no3 concentrations in fact most of the detected no3 concentrations both in groundwater and surface water are above the who drinking water guideline or the natural baseline threshold multiple sources of no3 were distinguished wherein sewage and manure were observed to constitute the main sources of no3 in groundwater and surface water it is somewhat surprising that sewage and manure constitute the chief sources of no3 as previous studies suggested without using more conclusive isotopic tools the use of synthetic fertilizers as the primary source contributing to the local nitrate pool here no3 derived from manure sources is explained by the high amounts of additive animal manure used to fertilise the agricultural areas whereas no3 derived from sewage source is related to rural wastewater discharge the later can be sourced i from the private sanitation systems used by isolated residences that are unable to connect to the sanitation networks and ii from the sanitation networks draining into the rivers without pre treatment compared to other recent studies on algerian eastern coastal areas the present study highlights the particular high apportionment of no3 based atmospheric precipitation both in groundwater and surface water agreeing with the high no3 concentration detected in rainwater this new specific site finding not only shows the particular features of the study area experiencing multiple sources of no3 but also demonstrates the effectiveness of using isotopic tracers to investigate the sources of nitrate in coastal ecosystems potential no3 from atmospheric precipitation was totally ignored in previous hydrogeological studies undertaken in the study area however this study did not identify the potential sources of no3 in local precipitation further efforts are recommended to monitor the no3 concentration in rainwater within the study area and to investigate the relative sources of atmospheric nitrogen the present study revealed that no3 impacted groundwater surface water samples are distributed relatively evenly over the entire study area as the migration of no3 impacted water could occur via interactions between surface water and groundwater the present study highlights the identification of such interactions here the evidenced interactions between surface water and groundwater through using multi isotopic tracers suggest that surface water systems are dependent on groundwater and even groundwater within aquifer is dependent on surface water this identified behavior over the study site shows the complex hydrogeology of this system but provides helpful information to further local studies aiming to understand anthropogenic sprawl pathways within the entire guerbes senhadja ecosystem this potential research topic can be added to other researches focusing in developing environmental optimization strategies to achieve a sustainable management of the mediterranean coastal site of guerbes senhadja given the elevated no3 concentrations enhanced by multi anthropogenic sources author contributions the first

1261,increased oil production in canada has resulted in proposals to extend or develop new oil pipelines many of these proposals have been met by concerns from the public over potential environmental impacts related to construction and the potential for oil spills to negatively affect groundwater quality crude oil sourced from the alberta oil sands represents a significant proportion of this increase in production this crude oil is produced as bitumen which is subsequently diluted with light hydrocarbons to lower viscosity to allow for pipeline transport producing diluted bitumen in this study we pumped water through tanks filled with sand to simulate groundwater flow tanks were injected with either conventional crude or diluted bitumen to simulate a crude oil spill from a pipeline rupture occurring below the water table representing a pipeline river crossing scenario water samples were collected from the downstream end of the tanks throughout the experiment period two months compared to water quality guidelines effluent waters from both conventional crude and diluted bitumen tanks contained elevated concentrations of dissolved organic compounds particularly benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes btex the effluent from each tank had similar concentrations of benzene whereas discharge water from conventional crude tanks contained higher concentrations of ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes in both tanks and as expected the btex concentrations appeared to be proportional to those determined in their injected crude oils the measured dissolved concentrations of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene are lower than predicted which is attributed largely due to dilution along the flow path in addition to organic constituents effluent sampled from the diluted bitumen tank contained some metals co cr fe and v which measured constituents of the oil keywords diluted bitumen crude oil btex oil spill pipeline transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction canadian crude oil production has increased from 2 6 106 barrels per day in 1999 to 5 7 106 barrels per day in 2019 capp 2019 sönnichsen 2021 much of canada s increased oil production is from bitumen extracted from alberta s oil sands capp 2019 to transport this higher volume of crude there has been an increase in transportation of oil by rail and several proposed projects to increase pipeline capacity cbc 2018 there have been high profile incidents such as the 2010 spill of diluted bitumen from a pipeline into the kalamazoo river in michigan douglas et al 2020 and the 2013 lac mégantic rail disaster where rail tankers containing a light crude oil exploded following a crash which also resulted in some of the oil entering nearby waterways généreux et al 2020 in addition to large spills that make the news many smaller spills also occur aer 2022 the increase in oil transportation and rare but serious accidents have resulted in increased public concern about the impacts of oil spills in this study we consider how a spill of diluted bitumen occurring at or below the groundwater table may impact groundwater compared with a spill of conventional crude 1 1 crude oil properties crude oil produced from the oil sands is produced as bitumen which is diluted with light hydrocarbons to form diluted bitumen such as dilbit diluted bitumen has different chemical and physical properties than conventional crude that may lead to different environmental behaviours following accidental release crude oils can be classified as light crude medium crude heavy crude and diluted bitumen bitumen has a higher viscosity than conventional crudes and must be diluted with light hydrocarbons to reduce its viscosity to meet specifications for pipeline transport nas 2016 the diluent is generally a naphtha based mixture of light liquid hydrocarbons mckinsey and company 2019 or synthetic crude government of canada 2013 despite its diluent content the density of diluted bitumen products e g cold lake blend diluted bitumen at 15 c has a density of 0 9284 g cm3 are still generally higher than conventional crudes e g mixed sweet blend conventional light crude at 0 8249 g cm3 zhou et al 2015 the viscosity of diluted bitumen is also usually higher than that of conventional crude at 15 c the viscosity of cold lake blend diluted bitumen is 287 cst centistokes while that of mixed sweet blend conventional light crude is 6 cst crude oil is dominated by hydrocarbons but also contains some metals and heteroatom compounds eser 2022 light crudes contain a blend of predominantly saturates and aromatics nas 2016 the concentrations of btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes as well as parent and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs vary between diluted bitumen and conventional crudes btex is considered a key indicator of hydrocarbon contamination of waters e g cooper et al 2015 zanello et al 2021 diluted bitumen and heavy crudes tend to have higher sulphur vanadium and nickel contents than medium and light conventional crudes 1 2 crude oil spills to groundwater if a spill occurs from a pipeline there is potential for oil to contaminate groundwater either by oil seeping down to the water table or by a spill occurring below the water table for example where a pipeline is beneath a river when the oil is in contact with groundwater the water will become contaminated the organic compounds that make up crude oil have low solubility in water and when spilled the majority of the product will not dissolve liquids that behave like this are often called nonaqueous phase liquids napl fetter 1999 napls that have a density 1 kg l will float on water and are referred to as a light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapls and those with a density 1 kg l will sink in water and are referred to as dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls crude oil has a density 1 kg l and will float on water the migration of napl products results in multiphase flow with the hydrocarbon product moving on its own dissolution of hydrocarbons from the initial product into groundwater and volatilization of the hydrocarbon with each of these phases evolving and migrating differently historically there has been significant research studying the impacts of spills of conventional crude oil to groundwater baedecker et al 2018 chaplin et al 2002 essaid et al 1995 essaid et al 2003 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 nambi et al 2017 one of the best studied crude oil spills that impacted groundwater and provided abundant information on how other spills may evolve occurred when a pipeline was breached in bemidji minnesota in 1979 this spill released 1 700 000 l of crude petroleum of which 400 000 l of crude remained in the ground on sediment grains and floating on the water table following cleanup usgs 1998 over time the oil floating on the water table has migrated and there has been loss from the oil due to dissolution volatilization and biodegradation the mass of oil has decreased while viscosity has increased by up to 250 along with the expected increase in density landon and hult 1991 usgs 1998 the changes were mostly caused by volatilization of low molecular weight compounds primarily alkanes the concentrations of more soluble organic compounds e g benzene and toluene were greatest near the oil source decreasing downgradient the bemidji spill not only added contaminants to groundwater but has also changed the geochemical regime with oxidation of crude oil causing the production of co2 h2s n2 and nh3 bennett et al 1993 while the bemidji spill has improved our understanding of how a spill of conventional crude may evolve the unique chemical and physical properties of diluted bitumen may result in a different subsurface spill evolution there have been relatively few studies considering how a spill of diluted bitumen might impact groundwater some research has been conducted into simulating the flow of diluted bitumen contaminants in the hyporheic zone sediment directly beneath a creek or river hossain and mumford 2017 hossain et al 2017 commonly water in the hyporheic zone interacts with surface water moving in and out of the sediment along a reach of river the experiments conducted by hossain et al 2017 and hossain and mumford 2017 involved flowing diluted bitumen through gravel sediments the experiments found that gravel sediments did not offer much resistance to the entry of diluted bitumen requiring 0 5 cm of diluted bitumen head to cause entry it was also found that once diluted bitumen had drained from the sediments 14 of the diluted bitumen remained in the gravel early in the experiment concentrations of soluble f1 hydrocarbons nc6 nc10 were at their highest below the water table f1 hydrocarbons cannot evaporate to the same extent than if directly exposed to the atmosphere but may however dissolve in water harper et al 2018 also conducted experiments comparing the potential for diluted bitumen to penetrate sediments finding fresh diluted bitumen could flow into sediments but penetration decreases with increased weathering adams et al 2021 considered the bioavailability of oil droplets in river gravels while stephenson et al 2018 considered the potential risk of a diluted bitumen spill to a range of receptors spalding and hirsh 2012 considered how pipelines should be routed to protect groundwater based on what is known about the properties of diluted bitumen products tsaprailis and zhou 2014 make reference to spills of diluted bitumen that have been cleaned up using traditional methods pensini et al 2018 consider the use of humic acids as a surfactant to aide in the remediation of diluted bitumen spills 1 3 objectives this paper presents the results of groundwater simulation tanks designed to simulate a spill of diluted bitumen occurring below the water table and compares the results with a spill of conventional crude oil under the same conditions this type of scenario may exist where a pipeline is installed below a river crossing the objective of this research is to better understand the potential impacts on groundwater of a spill of diluted bitumen in comparison to conventional crude under similar conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater flow tanks glass tanks having width height and length of 29 cm 47 cm and 83 cm respectively were used to simulate groundwater flow in a sandy aquifer fig 1 experiments were conducted in indoor laboratories at ambient temperature of 22 2 0 5 c at canmetenergy in devon alberta tanks 122 cm in length were purchased and partitioned to be 83 cm long to allow set up of inflow and outflow tubing the tanks were filled with fine grained quartz rich sand with a median grain size of 0 238 mm with 10 smaller than 0 105 mm to fill the tanks 24 l about 10 cm height of deionized water was poured into the tanks and moist sand was gradually added with the goal of avoiding air bubbles in the sand as the sand filled the tank and the water cap decreased more water was added with the goal of attaining a water table that was 5cm below the top of the sand at the upstream end of the tank water flow was established along the length of the tank by pumping deionized water into the tanks at one end and allowing drainage at the downstream end to simulate groundwater flow hydraulic head was controlled using an adjustable tube at the downstream end of the tank the flow rate out of the tanks was 5 1 ml min deionized water chosen as the source water in the experiment deionized water was used to replicate the dissolved ion load of recent precipitation and ensure as consistent as possible water chemistry between experiments prior to starting the experiment water was flushed through the tanks to achieve steady state geochemical conditions samples of the injected water were collected from the water reservoir at the start of the experiment and throughout the experiment tanks were refilled before they emptied tanks were kept saturated though the experiment 2 2 oil injection samples of conventional crude cc and diluted bitumen db were obtained from a non disclosed source prior to injection the oils were stored in a refrigerated area in airtight metal containers both oils were characterized to ensure they were representative of their respective types of crude oils oil was injected via an injection port fig 1 at ambient temperature 22 2 0 5 c where a vertical pipe was connected to a perforated horizontal tube located approximately 2 to 4 cm below the water table this was to simulate a spill below the water table for each tank 900 ml of crude was injected using fifteen 60 ml plastic syringes fifteen syringes were filled with oil in a fume hood at ambient temperature and the oil was injected one syringe at a time over the course of about 10 min this method of injection was selected to ensure the same quantity of oil was injected to each tank once injection was complete the valve was closed at the top of the injection port diluted bitumen was first injected into the three tanks and the experiments were run to the point at which concentrations of dissolved organics were either stable or decreasing tanks were then cleaned by washing with isopropyl alcohol followed by washing with water once clean sand was replaced and conditioned as described above and then experiments were conducted with conventional crude the tanks with diluted bitumen are denoted db 1 db 2 and db 3 while the conventional crude tanks are denoted cc 1 cc 2 and

briefly the five most leachable elements in decreasing concentrations were ca mg fe p and mn 3 2 injected oil characterization the physical and chemical properties of the cc and db crude oils are summarized in table 1 the cc had a lower density 0 8205 g ml at 20 c than db 0 9310 g ml at 20 c cc had a lower viscosity 4 4 cst at 20 c than db 334 3 cst at 20 c db has a higher viscosity than cc and as such will face greater resistance to migration in the sand and is not expected to spread out as much as cc db has a higher density than cc but both have densities below 1 and are expected to float on water when fresh results of htsd are show in fig 2 indicating that overall db had a higher portion of hydrocarbons with higher boiling points compared with cc cc lost a greater proportion of light hydrocarbons during htsd this likely reflects the difference in viscosity of the two oils the density and viscosity of the cc and db are comparable with other light and heavy oils respectively nas 2016 polaris applied sceinces inc 2013 the different physical properties are the result of different chemical properties cc had a higher proportion of saturates at 63 9 wt compared to that for db at 35 1 wt cc had a lower proportion of aromatics with 19 4 wt compared to db with 33 1 wt cc had a lower proportion of resins compounds at 9 2 wt compared to 17 1 wt for db cc contained a lower proportion of asphaltenes at 1 4 wt compared with 14 2 wt for db these values are similar to those reported for diluted bitumen and conventional crude in other studies nas 2016 while overall cc had lower proportions of aromatic hydrocarbons table 1 this does not indicate that all aromatic compounds were present at lower concentrations in cc compared to db the concentrations of btex and pah compounds in the cc and db crude oil are presented in table 2 the concentrations of benzene in cc and db were similar with 1014 122 mg kg for cc and 1045 361 mg kg for db table 2 the average concentration of ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes in cc was 3 8 1 6 and 2 5 times greater than the db concentration respectively it should be noted that db samples have a larger error range associated with the concentration of btex compounds than cc samples the variability in analysis is attributed in part to the complexity of the sample matrix the concentrations of 14 epa priority pahs plus acridine and quinoline table 2 were similar or below detection for cc and db oils with the exception of concentrations of chrysene fluorene naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene which were higher in cc

samples were collected at three locations across the tank from the oil body at depths immediately above similar to and below the oil injected at these areas across the tank in this area oil was commonly present in the sand however this was not a continuous plume for either cc or db photos of the oil distribution can be found in fig 4 and supplementary material 3 photos visually the cc appeared to have spread out more extensively than the db as illustrated in fig 2 the boiling point distribution curves of oils extracted from the sand at the end of the experiments have higher initial boiling points than those of fresh oils interestingly the initial boiling points of the cc extracted oils were 50 c higher than those of the db extracted oils the higher initial boiling points of the extracted cc oils suggest that during the tank experiments there were greater losses of light ends from the cc than from the db btex concentrations from oil body samples taken in the middle of the tanks are plotted in fig 5 the oil body benzene concentrations from the db tanks ranged from 0 0050 to 0 057 mg kg while in cc tanks it ranged from 0 0050 to 8 35 mg kg fig 5 a ethylbenzene concentrations in the db oil body ranged from 0 01 to 1 47 mg kg and for cc oil body samples from 0 01 to 26 7 mg kg fig 5 b the oil body toluene concentrations from the db tanks ranged from 0 050 to 3 5 mg kg while cc tanks ranged from 0 01 to 87 2 mg kg fig 5 c xylenes in the db oil body ranged from 0 1 to 16 6 mg kg and for cc oil body samples from 0 1 to 175 mg kg fig 5 f in general oil body samples collected from the cc tanks had higher btex concentrations than the oil body from db tanks as described previously samples were collected at three locations across the tank from the oil body

pahs in the oil body found at concentrations where at least one sample is above the detection limit are presented in fig 5 in general pah concentrations in oil body samples were higher in cc tank samples than db tank samples acenaphthene concentrations in oil body samples from the db tanks ranged from 0 0050 to 0 875 mg kg while samples from cc tanks ranged from 0 0050 to 0 132 mg kg fig 5 g the concentrations of fluorene for oil body samples from db tanks ranged from 0 010 to 0 889 mg kg while cc tanks ranged from 0 01 to 2 54 mg kg fig 5 h all concentrations of naphthalene in oil body

to 0 31 mg kg fig 5 k 3 4 water chemistry and isotopes full water chemistry results are presented in supplementary material 2 tables 2 and 3 full water chemistry results are presented in supplementary material 2 tables 2 and 3 3 4 1 standard parameters the ec of collected water samples is shown in fig 6 a and the ec from data loggers is shown in fig 6 b based on the water samples data the ec of the db tank discharge ranged from 185 to 442 μs cm and discharge from the cc tanks ranged from 138 to 241 μs cm over the course of the experiments the ec of discharge water from all tanks decreased this is attributed to the flushing of easily solubilized ions from the sand it should be noted that initial conductivity of discharge from db tanks was higher than the cc tanks this is attributed to allowing the cc tanks to condition for longer prior to the start of the experiment which was allowed to happen after observing the steep decline in conductivity during the first 10 days of the db experiment these different conditioning times explain the higher dissolved ion concentrations observed in the db tank compared to the cc tanks however this difference is not expected to impact the dissolved organics ec was also measured by data loggers placed immediately below the water discharge port in all tanks with the exception of db 2 where the logger failed to record the ec profiles of the tanks were similar to those observed by the water sample measurements although the magnitudes were lower this is attributed to these loggers measuring the conductivity at one point on the flow path whereas water samples are a composite sample of the water from other parts of the flow path the data loggers were always placed at the same depth in the tanks and are thus interpreted to be intercepting the same portion of the flow path in each tank the ph of discharge water from the db tanks ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 and for the cc tanks ranged from 7 8 to 8 4 fig 7 a the orp for db tanks ranged from 218 to 417 mv and for the cc tanks ranged from 180 to 408 mv fig 7 b the do for db tanks ranged from 1 3 to 5 2 mg l and for the cc tanks ranged from 2 4 to 4 3 mg l fig 7 c 3 4 2 major ions and metals the concentrations of major dissolved ions ca k na mg hco3 cl and so4 2 decreased over the course of the experiment which is attributed to leaching of major ions from the sand fig 8 most minor elements b ba cu mo ni p si se sr and zn showed the same decreasing profile while others were almost always below their respective detection limits be cd sb pb sn ti and tl arsenic concentrations are not presented due to analytical issues with these measurements the elements co cr fe mn and v appeared to show spikes in concentration over the course of the experiment fig 9 the concentrations of co in db tanks appeared to increase slightly after oil injection prior to gradually decreasing cc tanks appeared to show a gradual decrease in co concentrations over the course of the experiment fig 9 a the concentration of co was higher in db crude oil than cc crude oil as such the higher concentration in db effluent is expected from day 16 to 22 discharge from db tanks showed an increase in cr concentrations followed by a return to baseline levels close to the detection limit cc tank discharge remained close to the detection limit for the entire duration of the experiment fig 9 b the concentration of cr was higher in db than cc and higher in db effluent than cc effluent similar to cr the concentrations of fe from db tanks increased to maximum levels from day 16 to 20 while during the remainder of the experiment values were generally on the same order as deionized di water samples fig 9 c fe concentrations in cc discharge water remained stable throughout the experiment how the concentrations in the effluent compare with the concentrations in cc and db crude oils is unclear as the concentration of fe was below detection for both oils it is presumed that the fe is sourced from db crude oil due to the short spike in concentrations concentrations of mn in discharge from both cc and db tanks began to increase almost immediately after oil injection appearing to stabilize after around 20 days fig 9 d the concentrations of v in discharge from db tanks spiked between day 8 and 13 of the experiment fig 9 f concentrations of v from cc tanks generally decreased though the experiment 3 4 3 dissolved organics both db and cc tanks showed increases in toc following oil injection fig 10 the toc of discharge water from the bd tank increased to a maximum of 4 5 mg l 3 2 mg l and 3 2 mg l for tanks db 1 db 2 and db 3 respectively and the toc of discharge water from the cc tanks increased to maximum values of 6 3 mg l 6 7 mg l and 5 1 mg l in cc 1 cc 2 and cc 3 respectively the toc of discharge water from the db tanks appeared to increase for the first three days of the experiment then plateaued or decrease slightly before increasing to maximum values from day 43 onward the toc of discharge water from the cc tanks increased to a maximum value around day 36 then began to decrease the concentrations of btex compounds in the discharge water generally increased between day 3 and day 9 of the experiment fig 11 the different btex compounds reached maximum concentrations at different points in the experiment and then either stabilized or began to decrease through the rest of the experiment benzene dissolved benzene concentrations in the discharge water reached the following maximum concentrations db 1 1 17 mg l db 2 1 00 mg l db 3 1

concentrations in cc tank discharge were 1 7 to 4 0 higher than the db tank discharge for both cc and db tanks concentrations decrease gradually then appeared to plateau for the remainder of the experiment while magnitudes of different the o xylene fig 11 e and m p xylene fig 11 f show similar profiles to total xylene the concentrations of the 16 epa priority pahs naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene anthracene fluoranthene pyrene benzo a anthracene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene benzo ghi perylene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and dibenz a h anthracene were measured in tank discharge for db tanks all but four compounds were always below the detection limit and for cc only one compound was ever above the detection limit table 3 of those above the detection limit only naphthalene was above the detection limit most of the time naphthalene concentrations began increasing after between days 6 and 13 fig 12 maximum naphthalene

discharge water were an order of magnitude greater in cc tank discharge than db tank discharge for both cc and db tanks naphthalene concentrations were increasing at a lower rate and appear to be approaching a plateau at the end of the experiments fig 12 3 4 4 carbon isotopes the δ13c values of db and cc oils were 30 5 and 29 0 respectively at the start of the experiment based on samples collected immediately before oil injection and the day before oil injection the concentrations of toc in tank discharge were between 1 and 2 mg l which increased following oil injection to a maximum of 6 7 mg l for cc 2 and 4 5 mg l for db 1 fig 10 the δ13ctoc values are interpreted to be a mix of organics sourced from the sand itself i e background toc and the oil with their relative proportions varying through the experiment discharge on day 0 of the experiment from the cc tanks had a δ13ctoc of 27 0 which increased to 26 8 over the course of the experiment fig 13 on 1 of the experiment discharge from db tanks had a δ13ctoc of 27 0 which decreased to 27 4 for both cc and db tanks the δ13ctoc changed slightly after the injection of the oil however the observed changes are within the analytical error of 0 4 error associated with these analyses in neither cc nor db tanks the δ13ctoc of water samples did not reach the δ13c value of the crude oils samples for compound specific isotope analysis of benzene and toluene δ13cbenzene and δ13ctoluene were collected over the course of both db and cc experiments however only samples collected for cc experiments yielded sufficiently large peak sizes and reliable δ13c values the temporal trends in δ13cbenzene and δ13ctoluene values in the cc tanks are shown in fig 13 as illustrated here δ13cbenzene values varied little over time ranging from 29 0 on day 17 to 30 4 on day 36 and 64 the same trend was observed for δ13ctoluene which ranged from 29 3 on day 34 to 28 0 on day 64 the δ13ctoluene values were similar to the value of the δ13c of the oil 29 0 while δ13cbenzene values were depleted by around 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 oil body and oil migration processes visually cc appeared to spread out more than the db supplementary material 3 photos this is consistent with what was observed for the btex and pah concentrations extracted from the sand at the end of the experiment fig 5 this suggests that due to the lower viscosity cc may spread out more in the sand than the db in general the cc oil body has higher concentrations of organic compounds which is primarily attributed to the higher concentrations found in the initial cc oil visually cc appeared to spread out more than the db supplementary material 3 photos this is consistent with what was observed for the btex and pah concentrations extracted from the sand at the end of the experiment fig 5 this suggests that due to the lower viscosity cc may spread out more in the sand than the db in general the cc oil body has higher concentrations of organic compounds which is primarily attributed to the higher concentrations found in the initial cc oil previous oil spill studies have described the expected distribution of oil in the subsurface with an oil body where volatilization can occur where the oil is exposed to the atmosphere and dissolution occurring from the oil body into groundwater dillard et al 1997 usgs 1998 fig 14 shows a schematic diagram of the processes expected to have occurred during the experiment initially water flowed freely past the oil injector fig 14 a during oil injection oil spread out around the injector fig 14 b as the oil injection occurred below the water table less loss of light molecular weight component occurred than would have if the experiment had taken place above the water table during injections of oil in some tanks some oil broke through to the surface this occurred with both db and cc following injection some water flows past the oil dissolving soluble species from the oil fig 14 c oil that is above the water table loses light end hydrocarbons by volatilization during excavation of the tanks it was observed that although the injection of oil was done in a uniform manner the oil was not continuous in the subsurface as shown in the photograph in fig 4 it is presumed that water may flow around areas containing oil in the subsurface in a heterogeneous manner the distribution of oil observed in these tank experiments is similar to what has been observed in the field with spills of conventional crude dillard et al 1997 however the diluted bitumen used in this experiment spread out less than the conventional crude 4 2 dissolved organics in discharge water 4 2 1 dissolved organic trends the concentrations of dissolved organics in discharge water increased following the injection of cc and db into the groundwater tanks the maximum toc in discharge from cc tanks was around 50 greater than the maximum toc from db tanks fig 10 the maximum toc from cc tanks occured at around 30 days similar to maximum concentrations of xylenes after the maximum benzene and toluene concentrations but before maximum ethylbenzene concentrations the maximum toc from db tanks was further delayed occurring later than the maximum of other organics measured this suggests that btex compounds were only a fraction of the toc and future study should aim to understand what other organics are in the dissolved fraction the spikes in the concentrations of co cr and fe metal concentrations occured at approximately the same time as maximum benzene and toluene concentrations and before maximum ethylbenzene and xylene concentrations these difference were likely caused by differences in retardation rates of different compounds discharge from the cc tanks had higher btex concentrations than discharge from db tanks the concentration of benzene in cc oil samples was similar to the db oil samples consequently the maximum benzene concentrations in discharge were similar in both sets of experiments however the concentration of benzene in the oil body samples collected at the end of the experiment were higher in cc samples than db samples fig 5 in discharge water samples benzene concentrations from db were 30 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 54 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of ethylbenzene in the cc crude oil was 3 8 times greater than in the db crude oil while maximum concentrations in the cc tank discharge water were 3 3 to 4 9 times greater than the db discharge in discharge water samples ethylbenzene concentrations from db were 69 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 88 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of toluene in the cc crude oil was 1 6 times greater than that in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from the cc tanks were 1 7 to 3 9 higher than the db tanks in discharge water samples toluene concentrations from db were 36 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 45 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of xylenes in the cc crude oil was 2 5 times greater than those in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from the cc tanks were 1 7 to 4 0 higher than the db tanks in discharge water samples xylene concentrations from db were 57 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 73 of their maximum on the same day naphthalene was the only pah to be consistently above the detection limit in discharge water from both the cc and the db tanks the concentration of naphthalene in the cc crude oil was 14 times greater than those in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from cc tanks were 10 6 to 14 6 higher than the db tanks at the end of the experiment naphthalene concentrations were not decreasing the maximum concentrations of btex compounds and naphthalene in discharge water occurred in similar ratios to the concentrations in the crude oils this result suggests that following oil injection leaching occurred from the oil mainly in proportion to their concentrations in the oil and over time differences in physical properties of the oils contributed to differences in dissolved concentrations for both cc and db tanks btex concentrations reached their maximum after two to four weeks then decreased but db concentrations decreased proportionally more than cc the greater decrease in db concentrations is interpreted to be the result of the higher viscosity of db with db having spread out less in the tank allowing for less continued dissolution of dissolved organics from the oil 4 2 2 dissolved organic predictions the concentration of organic compounds that will partition into the water was predicted for three btex compounds benzene ethylbenzene and toluene using raoult s law eq 1 note because total xylenes were determined in crude oil the concentration of each xylene species in water could not be calculated using raoult s law eq 1 in eq 1 c represents the aqueous concentration of the compound x is the mole fraction and s is the solubility of the compound in water shiu et al 1988 1 c xs determining the mole fraction of different components in crude oils is difficult due to its complex composition here we estimate the mole fraction from the average molecular weight determined from the density eq 2 is used to determine the average molecular weight of the crude oil mw from the specific gravity sg specific gravity is the density of oil divided by the density of water king 2020 the concentration of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene predicted using raoult s law are presented in table 4 rearranged from king 2020 2 mw 6084 141 sg 137 4 despite db having the same or lower concentration of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene their mole fractions are higher than in cc resulting in higher predicted aqueous concentrations the predicted aqueous concentrations are compared with the average of the maximum concentration from each column for cc the predicted aqueous concentrations are 2 7 to 3 5 times the measured average maximum concentrations for benzene ethylbenzene and toluene while for db the predicted aqueous concentrations are 6 1 to 10 9 times the measured average maximum concentrations for these compounds one reason for the difference between the predicted and measured concentrations is that not all discharge from the tank has interacted with oil as such there is dilution of dissolved constituents additionally the flow rate through the tank may result in shorter residence times for oil than needed for dissolution to equilibrium furthermore there may be sorption of dissolved organics along the flow path the larger difference between the predicted aqueous concentration and the average maximum concentration for db is attributed to its greater viscosity resulting in less oil water interaction since db remains closer to the injection point and spreads out less further research is needed to better to predict dissolved concentrations of organic contaminants from diluted bitumen properties 4 2 3 conditions impacting dissolved organics these experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 0 5 c however the viscosity of crude oils increases as temperature decreases ground temperature is generally similar to the mean annual air temperature ngwa 2022 across all of canada and most of the united states the mean annual air temperature is below 22 c berkeley earth 2022 suggesting a spill of either oil will migrate more slowly due to the higher viscosity at lower temperature compared to the current study this may result in lower concentrations of dissolved organics in groundwater should a spill occur 4 2 4 evaluating in situ biodegradation microbial breakdown of benzene under aerobic conditions is associated with a noticeable positive shift up to 4 in residual δ13cbenzene values fischer et al 2008 hunkeler et al 2001 thus the lack of 13c enrichment in δ13cbenzene found here fig 13 implies no significant biodegradation of benzene during the course of the experiments although studies have reported a small yet significant isotopic fractionation during aerobic biodegradation of toluene by pure bacterial strains vogt et al 2008 no discernible fractionation was observed during 70 biodegradation by a mixed consortium sherwood lollar et al 1999 thus while the lack of variation in δ13ctoluene values fig 13 does not exclude the possibility of toluene biodegradation during these experiments significant microbial breakdown of toluene is considered unlikely given the absence of 13c enrichment in more easily fractionated benzene the compound specific isotope data presented here therefore implies that microbial activity had little impact on btex concentrations and distribution patterns 4 3 dissolved inorganics in discharge water the concentrations of most inorganic species major ions ca k na mg hco3 cl so4 2 trace metals b ba cu ni mo p si se sr and zn decreased over the course of the experiment presumably the result of a decrease in leaching from the sand the experiments were conducted in the concentrations of co cr fe mn and v underwent some form of increase over the course of the experiment in this discussion the increases in metals concentrations are discussed in two groups concentration spikes and gradual increases 4 3 1 concentration spikes concentration spikes were found for co cr fe and v where the concentration rapidly increased at some point soon after oil injection followed by a subsequent drop fig 9 this occurred for co cr fe and v in samples from db tanks no obvious spike trends were observed in cc tanks with the exception of v in one cc sample in the soluble extraction of the oils co and cr concentrations were higher in db compared to cc while fe was below detection for both and concentrations of v were within error of each other these metals are interpreted to be sourced from the oil and not from the sand as the concentrations increased as a spike after injection of the oils and their concentrations in the sand were low supplementary material 1 concentration spikes were found for co cr fe and v where the concentration rapidly increased at some point soon after oil injection followed by a subsequent drop fig 9 this occurred for co cr fe and v in samples from db tanks no obvious spike trends were observed in cc tanks with the exception of v in one cc sample in the soluble extraction of the oils co and cr concentrations were higher in db compared to cc while fe was below detection for both and concentrations of v were within error of each other these metals are interpreted to be sourced from the oil and not from the sand as the concentrations increased as a spike after injection of the oils and their concentrations in the sand were low supplementary material 1 4 3 2 gradual increases prior to oil injection the mn concentration in discharge water from the tanks was 0 07 mg l for cc and 0 02 mg l for db the concentrations of mn in discharge water from db and cc tanks increased soon after oil injection with average mn concentrations in discharge from cc tanks being 0 11 mg l and from db tanks being 0 12 mg l fig 9 the mn concentrations in the water are attributed to release from the sand due to changes in geochemical conditions this is discussed further in supplementary material 1 prior to oil injection the mn concentration in discharge water from the tanks was 0 07 mg l for cc and 0 02 mg l for db the concentrations of mn in discharge water from db and cc tanks increased soon after oil injection with average mn concentrations in discharge from cc tanks being 0 11 mg l and from db tanks being 0 12 mg l fig 9 the mn concentrations in the water are attributed to release from the sand due to changes in geochemical conditions this is discussed further in supplementary material 1 4 4 environmental implication pipelines transporting conventional crude and diluted bitumen are present in many jurisdictions as such if a spill occurs water contaminated by the oil will be compared with local relevant guidelines here we compare concentrations with alberta tier 1 groundwater remediation guidelines ab tier 1 guidelines as alberta is the primary source of diluted bitumen in north america alberta environment 2016 while different jurisdictions have different guidelines these guidelines are commonly based on the same science table 5 lists the number of samples collected that were above alberta tier 1 guidelines the alberta tier 1 guideline values for parameters that exceed the guidelines are also shown in fig 9 fig 11 and fig 12 for most of the experiment discharge from both the db and cc tanks was above alberta tier 1 guidelines for mn benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes discharge from db tanks was never above the alberta tier 1 guideline for naphthalene however discharge from cc tanks was above guideline values for 56 of samples analysed average concentrations of these analytes were up to 135 times the alberta tier 1 guideline based on the concentrations above alberta tier 1 guidelines the same volume of oil could be enough to contaminate a larger volume of water however multiple factors such as groundwater velocity dispersion and aquifer sorption will impact how much water could have concentrations above guidelines 5 conclusion these experiments demonstrated that for spills of diluted bitumen and conventional crude occurring below the water table the concentrations of dissolved organic compounds btex pahs will be proportional to those determined in the crude oil over time the concentrations of dissolved organics decreased faster for db than cc the maximum aqueous concentrations were lower than predicted based on raoult s law for both db and cc but were lowest for db a difference attributed to the higher viscosity of db additionally the concentration of some metals co cr fe and v appeared to spike in db tank discharge the stable isotope results suggested there has been no appreciable biological degradation of organics in the dissolved phase the results also suggested a spill of 0 9 l of db or cc into an aquifer 1 m 1 m 15 m would be sufficient to produce concentrations of benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylene above the alberta tier 1 guidelines funding research funded through

1261,increased oil production in canada has resulted in proposals to extend or develop new oil pipelines many of these proposals have been met by concerns from the public over potential environmental impacts related to construction and the potential for oil spills to negatively affect groundwater quality crude oil sourced from the alberta oil sands represents a significant proportion of this increase in production this crude oil is produced as bitumen which is subsequently diluted with light hydrocarbons to lower viscosity to allow for pipeline transport producing diluted bitumen in this study we pumped water through tanks filled with sand to simulate groundwater flow tanks were injected with either conventional crude or diluted bitumen to simulate a crude oil spill from a pipeline rupture occurring below the water table representing a pipeline river crossing scenario water samples were collected from the downstream end of the tanks throughout the experiment period two months compared to water quality guidelines effluent waters from both conventional crude and diluted bitumen tanks contained elevated concentrations of dissolved organic compounds particularly benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes btex the effluent from each tank had similar concentrations of benzene whereas discharge water from conventional crude tanks contained higher concentrations of ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes in both tanks and as expected the btex concentrations appeared to be proportional to those determined in their injected crude oils the measured dissolved concentrations of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene are lower than predicted which is attributed largely due to dilution along the flow path in addition to organic constituents effluent sampled from the diluted bitumen tank contained some metals co cr fe and v which measured constituents of the oil keywords diluted bitumen crude oil btex oil spill pipeline transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction canadian crude oil production has increased from 2 6 106 barrels per day in 1999 to 5 7 106 barrels per day in 2019 capp 2019 sönnichsen 2021 much of canada s increased oil production is from bitumen extracted from alberta s oil sands capp 2019 to transport this higher volume of crude there has been an increase in transportation of oil by rail and several proposed projects to increase pipeline capacity cbc 2018 there have been high profile incidents such as the 2010 spill of diluted bitumen from a pipeline into the kalamazoo river in michigan douglas et al 2020 and the 2013 lac mégantic rail disaster where rail tankers containing a light crude oil exploded following a crash which also resulted in some of the oil entering nearby waterways généreux et al 2020 in addition to large spills that make the news many smaller spills also occur aer 2022 the increase in oil transportation and rare but serious accidents have resulted in increased public concern about the impacts of oil spills in this study we consider how a spill of diluted bitumen occurring at or below the groundwater table may impact groundwater compared with a spill of conventional crude 1 1 crude oil properties crude oil produced from the oil sands is produced as bitumen which is diluted with light hydrocarbons to form diluted bitumen such as dilbit diluted bitumen has different chemical and physical properties than conventional crude that may lead to different environmental behaviours following accidental release crude oils can be classified as light crude medium crude heavy crude and diluted bitumen bitumen has a higher viscosity than conventional crudes and must be diluted with light hydrocarbons to reduce its viscosity to meet specifications for pipeline transport nas 2016 the diluent is generally a naphtha based mixture of light liquid hydrocarbons mckinsey and company 2019 or synthetic crude government of canada 2013 despite its diluent content the density of diluted bitumen products e g cold lake blend diluted bitumen at 15 c has a density of 0 9284 g cm3 are still generally higher than conventional crudes e g mixed sweet blend conventional light crude at 0 8249 g cm3 zhou et al 2015 the viscosity of diluted bitumen is also usually higher than that of conventional crude at 15 c the viscosity of cold lake blend diluted bitumen is 287 cst centistokes while that of mixed sweet blend conventional light crude is 6 cst crude oil is dominated by hydrocarbons but also contains some metals and heteroatom compounds eser 2022 light crudes contain a blend of predominantly saturates and aromatics nas 2016 the concentrations of btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes as well as parent and alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs vary between diluted bitumen and conventional crudes btex is considered a key indicator of hydrocarbon contamination of waters e g cooper et al 2015 zanello et al 2021 diluted bitumen and heavy crudes tend to have higher sulphur vanadium and nickel contents than medium and light conventional crudes 1 2 crude oil spills to groundwater if a spill occurs from a pipeline there is potential for oil to contaminate groundwater either by oil seeping down to the water table or by a spill occurring below the water table for example where a pipeline is beneath a river when the oil is in contact with groundwater the water will become contaminated the organic compounds that make up crude oil have low solubility in water and when spilled the majority of the product will not dissolve liquids that behave like this are often called nonaqueous phase liquids napl fetter 1999 napls that have a density 1 kg l will float on water and are referred to as a light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapls and those with a density 1 kg l will sink in water and are referred to as dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls crude oil has a density 1 kg l and will float on water the migration of napl products results in multiphase flow with the hydrocarbon product moving on its own dissolution of hydrocarbons from the initial product into groundwater and volatilization of the hydrocarbon with each of these phases evolving and migrating differently historically there has been significant research studying the impacts of spills of conventional crude oil to groundwater baedecker et al 2018 chaplin et al 2002 essaid et al 1995 essaid et al 2003 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 nambi et al 2017 one of the best studied crude oil spills that impacted groundwater and provided abundant information on how other spills may evolve occurred when a pipeline was breached in bemidji minnesota in 1979 this spill released 1 700 000 l of crude petroleum of which 400 000 l of crude remained in the ground on sediment grains and floating on the water table following cleanup usgs 1998 over time the oil floating on the water table has migrated and there has been loss from the oil due to dissolution volatilization and biodegradation the mass of oil has decreased while viscosity has increased by up to 250 along with the expected increase in density landon and hult 1991 usgs 1998 the changes were mostly caused by volatilization of low molecular weight compounds primarily alkanes the concentrations of more soluble organic compounds e g benzene and toluene were greatest near the oil source decreasing downgradient the bemidji spill not only added contaminants to groundwater but has also changed the geochemical regime with oxidation of crude oil causing the production of co2 h2s n2 and nh3 bennett et al 1993 while the bemidji spill has improved our understanding of how a spill of conventional crude may evolve the unique chemical and physical properties of diluted bitumen may result in a different subsurface spill evolution there have been relatively few studies considering how a spill of diluted bitumen might impact groundwater some research has been conducted into simulating the flow of diluted bitumen contaminants in the hyporheic zone sediment directly beneath a creek or river hossain and mumford 2017 hossain et al 2017 commonly water in the hyporheic zone interacts with surface water moving in and out of the sediment along a reach of river the experiments conducted by hossain et al 2017 and hossain and mumford 2017 involved flowing diluted bitumen through gravel sediments the experiments found that gravel sediments did not offer much resistance to the entry of diluted bitumen requiring 0 5 cm of diluted bitumen head to cause entry it was also found that once diluted bitumen had drained from the sediments 14 of the diluted bitumen remained in the gravel early in the experiment concentrations of soluble f1 hydrocarbons nc6 nc10 were at their highest below the water table f1 hydrocarbons cannot evaporate to the same extent than if directly exposed to the atmosphere but may however dissolve in water harper et al 2018 also conducted experiments comparing the potential for diluted bitumen to penetrate sediments finding fresh diluted bitumen could flow into sediments but penetration decreases with increased weathering adams et al 2021 considered the bioavailability of oil droplets in river gravels while stephenson et al 2018 considered the potential risk of a diluted bitumen spill to a range of receptors spalding and hirsh 2012 considered how pipelines should be routed to protect groundwater based on what is known about the properties of diluted bitumen products tsaprailis and zhou 2014 make reference to spills of diluted bitumen that have been cleaned up using traditional methods pensini et al 2018 consider the use of humic acids as a surfactant to aide in the remediation of diluted bitumen spills 1 3 objectives this paper presents the results of groundwater simulation tanks designed to simulate a spill of diluted bitumen occurring below the water table and compares the results with a spill of conventional crude oil under the same conditions this type of scenario may exist where a pipeline is installed below a river crossing the objective of this research is to better understand the potential impacts on groundwater of a spill of diluted bitumen in comparison to conventional crude under similar conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater flow tanks glass tanks having width height and length of 29 cm 47 cm and 83 cm respectively were used to simulate groundwater flow in a sandy aquifer fig 1 experiments were conducted in indoor laboratories at ambient temperature of 22 2 0 5 c at canmetenergy in devon alberta tanks 122 cm in length were purchased and partitioned to be 83 cm long to allow set up of inflow and outflow tubing the tanks were filled with fine grained quartz rich sand with a median grain size of 0 238 mm with 10 smaller than 0 105 mm to fill the tanks 24 l about 10 cm height of deionized water was poured into the tanks and moist sand was gradually added with the goal of avoiding air bubbles in the sand as the sand filled the tank and the water cap decreased more water was added with the goal of attaining a water table that was 5cm below the top of the sand at the upstream end of the tank water flow was established along the length of the tank by pumping deionized water into the tanks at one end and allowing drainage at the downstream end to simulate groundwater flow hydraulic head was controlled using an adjustable tube at the downstream end of the tank the flow rate out of the tanks was 5 1 ml min deionized water chosen as the source water in the experiment deionized water was used to replicate the dissolved ion load of recent precipitation and ensure as consistent as possible water chemistry between experiments prior to starting the experiment water was flushed through the tanks to achieve steady state geochemical conditions samples of the injected water were collected from the water reservoir at the start of the experiment and throughout the experiment tanks were refilled before they emptied tanks were kept saturated though the experiment 2 2 oil injection samples of conventional crude cc and diluted bitumen db were obtained from a non disclosed source prior to injection the oils were stored in a refrigerated area in airtight metal containers both oils were characterized to ensure they were representative of their respective types of crude oils oil was injected via an injection port fig 1 at ambient temperature 22 2 0 5 c where a vertical pipe was connected to a perforated horizontal tube located approximately 2 to 4 cm below the water table this was to simulate a spill below the water table for each tank 900 ml of crude was injected using fifteen 60 ml plastic syringes fifteen syringes were filled with oil in a fume hood at ambient temperature and the oil was injected one syringe at a time over the course of about 10 min this method of injection was selected to ensure the same quantity of oil was injected to each tank once injection was complete the valve was closed at the top of the injection port diluted bitumen was first injected into the three tanks and the experiments were run to the point at which concentrations of dissolved organics were either stable or decreasing tanks were then cleaned by washing with isopropyl alcohol followed by washing with water once clean sand was replaced and conditioned as described above and then experiments were conducted with conventional crude the tanks with diluted bitumen are denoted db 1 db 2 and db 3 while the conventional crude tanks are denoted cc 1 cc 2 and cc 3 2 3 sample collection and analysis 2 3 1 sand the sand was characterized in triplicate on a shimadzu toc vcph using a ssm 5000a module devon alberta canada inorganic carbon ic was determined in

summarized in table 1 the cc had a lower density 0 8205 g ml at 20 c than db 0 9310 g ml at 20 c cc had a lower viscosity 4 4 cst at 20 c than db 334 3 cst at 20 c db has a higher viscosity than cc and as such will face greater resistance to migration in the sand and is not expected to spread out as much as cc db has a higher density than cc but both have densities below 1 and are expected to float on water when fresh results of htsd are show in fig 2 indicating that overall db had a higher portion of hydrocarbons with higher boiling points compared with cc cc lost a greater proportion of light hydrocarbons during htsd this likely reflects the difference in viscosity of the two oils the density and viscosity of the cc and db are comparable with other light and heavy oils respectively nas 2016 polaris applied sceinces inc 2013 the different physical properties are the result of different chemical properties cc had a higher proportion of saturates at 63 9 wt compared to that for db at 35 1 wt cc had a lower proportion of aromatics with 19 4 wt compared to db with 33 1 wt cc had a lower proportion of resins compounds at 9 2 wt compared to 17 1 wt for db cc contained a lower proportion of asphaltenes at 1 4 wt compared with 14 2 wt for db these values are similar to those reported for diluted bitumen and conventional crude in other studies nas 2016 while overall cc had lower proportions of aromatic hydrocarbons table 1 this does not indicate that all aromatic compounds were present at lower concentrations in cc compared to db the concentrations of btex and pah compounds in the cc and db crude oil are presented in table 2 the concentrations of benzene in cc and db were similar with 1014 122 mg kg for cc and 1045 361 mg kg for db table 2 the average concentration of ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes in cc was 3 8 1 6 and 2 5 times greater than the db concentration respectively it should be noted that db samples have a larger error range associated with the concentration of btex compounds than cc samples the variability in analysis is attributed in part to the complexity of the sample matrix the concentrations of 14 epa priority pahs plus acridine and quinoline table 2 were similar or below detection for cc and db oils with the exception of concentrations of chrysene fluorene naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene which were higher in cc

samples were collected at three locations across the tank from the oil body at depths immediately above similar to and below the oil injected at these areas across the tank in this area oil was commonly present in the sand however this was not a continuous plume for either cc or db photos of the oil distribution can be found in fig 4 and supplementary material 3 photos visually the cc appeared to have spread out more extensively than the db as illustrated in fig 2 the boiling point distribution curves of oils extracted from the sand at the end of the experiments have higher initial boiling points than those of fresh oils interestingly the initial boiling points of the cc extracted oils were 50 c higher than those of the db extracted oils the higher initial boiling points of the extracted cc oils suggest that during the tank experiments there were greater losses of light ends from the cc than from the db btex concentrations from oil body samples taken in the middle of the tanks are plotted in fig 5 the oil body benzene concentrations from the db tanks ranged from 0 0050 to 0 057 mg kg while in cc tanks it ranged from 0 0050 to 8 35 mg kg fig 5 a ethylbenzene concentrations in the db oil body ranged from 0 01 to 1 47 mg kg and for cc oil body samples from 0 01 to 26 7 mg kg fig 5 b the oil body toluene concentrations from the db tanks ranged from 0 050 to 3 5 mg kg while cc tanks ranged from 0 01 to 87 2 mg kg fig 5 c xylenes in the db oil body ranged from 0 1 to 16 6 mg kg and for cc oil body samples from 0 1 to 175 mg kg fig 5 f in general oil body

material 2 tables 2 and 3 3 4 1 standard parameters the ec of collected water samples is shown in fig 6 a and the ec from data loggers is shown in fig 6 b based on the water samples data the ec of the db tank discharge ranged from 185 to 442 μs cm and discharge from the cc tanks ranged from 138 to 241 μs cm over the course of the experiments the ec of discharge water from all tanks decreased this is attributed to the flushing of easily solubilized ions from the sand it should be noted that initial conductivity of discharge from db tanks was higher than the cc tanks this is attributed to allowing the cc tanks to condition for longer prior to the start of the experiment which was allowed to happen after observing the steep decline in conductivity during the first 10 days of the db experiment these different conditioning times explain the higher dissolved ion concentrations observed in the db tank compared to the cc tanks however this difference is not expected to impact the dissolved organics ec was also measured by data loggers placed immediately below the water discharge port in all tanks with the exception of db 2 where the logger failed to record the ec profiles of the tanks were similar to those observed by the water sample measurements although the magnitudes were lower this is attributed to these loggers measuring the conductivity at one point on the flow path whereas water samples are a composite sample of the water from other parts of the flow path the data loggers were always placed at the same depth in the tanks and are thus interpreted to be intercepting the same portion of the flow path in each tank the ph of discharge water from the db tanks ranged from 7 5 to 8 1 and for the cc tanks ranged from 7 8 to 8 4 fig 7 a the orp for db tanks ranged from 218 to 417 mv and for the cc tanks ranged from 180 to 408 mv fig 7 b the do for db tanks ranged from 1 3 to 5 2 mg l and for the cc tanks ranged from 2 4 to 4 3 mg l fig 7 c 3 4 2 major ions and metals the concentrations of major dissolved ions ca k na mg hco3 cl and so4 2 decreased over the course of the experiment which is attributed to leaching of major ions from the sand fig 8

concentrations are not presented due to analytical issues with these measurements the elements co cr fe mn and v appeared to show spikes in concentration over the course of the experiment fig 9 the concentrations of co in db tanks appeared to increase slightly after oil injection prior to gradually decreasing cc tanks appeared to show a gradual decrease in co concentrations over the course of the experiment fig 9 a the concentration of co was higher in db crude oil than cc crude oil as such the higher concentration in db effluent is expected from day 16 to 22 discharge from db tanks showed an increase in cr concentrations followed by a return to baseline levels close to the detection limit cc tank discharge remained close to the detection limit for the entire duration of the experiment fig 9 b the concentration of cr was higher in db than cc and higher in db effluent than cc effluent similar to cr the concentrations of fe from db tanks increased to maximum levels from day 16 to 20 while during the remainder of the experiment values were generally on the same order as deionized di water samples fig 9 c fe concentrations in cc discharge water remained stable throughout the experiment how the concentrations in the effluent compare with the concentrations in cc and db crude oils is unclear as the concentration of fe was below detection for both oils it is presumed that the fe is sourced from db crude oil due to the short spike in concentrations concentrations of mn in discharge from both cc and db tanks began to increase almost immediately after oil injection appearing to stabilize after around 20 days fig 9 d the concentrations of v in discharge from db tanks spiked between day 8 and 13 of the experiment fig 9 f concentrations of v from cc tanks generally decreased though the experiment 3 4 3 dissolved organics both db and cc tanks showed increases in toc following oil injection fig 10 the toc of discharge water from the bd tank increased to a maximum of 4 5 mg l 3 2 mg l and 3 2 mg l for tanks db 1 db 2 and db 3 respectively and the toc of discharge water from the cc tanks increased to maximum values of 6 3 mg l 6 7 mg l and 5 1 mg l in cc 1 cc 2 and cc 3 respectively the toc of discharge water from the db tanks appeared to increase for the first three days of the experiment then plateaued or decrease slightly before increasing to maximum values from day 43 onward the toc of discharge water from the cc tanks increased to a maximum value around day 36 then began to decrease the concentrations of btex compounds in the discharge water generally increased between day 3 and day 9 of the experiment fig 11 the different btex compounds reached maximum concentrations at different points in the experiment and then either stabilized or began to decrease through the rest of the experiment benzene dissolved benzene concentrations in the discharge water reached the following maximum concentrations db 1 1 17 mg l db 2 1 00 mg l db 3 1 37 mg l cc 1 1 19 mg l cc 2 1 39 mg l and cc 3 0 96 mg l fig 11 a after reaching their maximum concentrations concentrations measured from both cc and db tanks decreased however concentrations from db

reaching their maximum concentrations toluene maximum toluene concentrations for the discharge water were the following db 1 0 221 mg l db 2 0 107 mg l db 3 0 161 mg l cc 1 0 402 mg l cc 2 0 425 mg l and cc 3 0 288 mg l fig 11 c maximum concentrations in cc tank discharge were 1 7 to 3 9 higher than the db tank discharge following reaching maximum concentrations concentrations decreased gradually xylenes maximum xylene concentrations for the discharge water were the following db 1 0 69 mg l db 2 0 32 mg l db 3 0 317 mg l cc 1 1 18 mg l cc 2 1 26 mg l and cc 3 0 78 mg l fig 11 c maximum concentrations in cc tank discharge were 1 7 to 4 0 higher than the db tank discharge for both cc and db tanks concentrations decrease gradually then appeared to plateau for the remainder of the experiment while magnitudes of different the o xylene fig 11 e and m p xylene fig 11 f show similar profiles to total xylene the concentrations of the 16 epa priority pahs naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene anthracene fluoranthene pyrene benzo a anthracene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene benzo ghi perylene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and dibenz a h anthracene were measured in tank discharge for db tanks all but four compounds were always below the detection limit and for cc only one compound was ever above the detection limit table 3 of those above the detection limit only naphthalene was above the detection limit most of the time naphthalene concentrations began increasing after between days 6 and 13 fig 12 maximum naphthalene concentrations for discharge water were the following db 1 0 00066 mg l db 2 0 00062 mg l db 3 0 00062 mg l cc 1 0 0083 mg l cc 2 0 0090 mg l and cc 3 0 00655 mg l fig 12 naphthalene concentrations in discharge water were an order of magnitude greater in cc tank discharge than db tank discharge for both cc and db tanks naphthalene concentrations were increasing at a lower rate and appear to be approaching a plateau at the end of the experiments fig 12 3 4 4 carbon isotopes the δ13c values of db and cc oils were 30 5 and 29 0 respectively at the start of the experiment based on samples collected immediately before oil injection and the day before oil injection the concentrations of toc in tank discharge were between 1 and 2 mg l which increased following oil injection to a maximum of 6 7 mg l for cc 2 and 4 5 mg l for db 1 fig 10 the δ13ctoc values are interpreted to be a mix of organics sourced from the sand itself i e background toc and the oil with their relative proportions varying through the experiment discharge on day 0 of the experiment from the cc tanks had a δ13ctoc of 27 0 which increased to 26 8 over the course of the experiment fig 13 on 1 of the experiment discharge from db tanks had a δ13ctoc of 27 0 which decreased to 27 4 for both cc and db tanks the δ13ctoc changed slightly after the injection of the oil however the observed changes are within the analytical error of 0 4 error associated with these analyses in neither cc nor db tanks the δ13ctoc of water samples did not reach the δ13c value of the crude oils samples for compound specific isotope analysis of benzene and toluene δ13cbenzene and δ13ctoluene were collected over the course of both db and cc experiments however only samples collected for cc experiments yielded sufficiently large peak sizes and reliable δ13c values the temporal trends in δ13cbenzene and δ13ctoluene values in the cc tanks are shown in fig 13 as illustrated here δ13cbenzene values varied little over time ranging from 29 0 on day 17 to 30 4 on day 36 and 64 the same trend was observed for δ13ctoluene which ranged from 29 3 on day 34 to 28 0 on day 64 the δ13ctoluene values were similar to the value of the δ13c of the oil 29 0 while δ13cbenzene values were depleted by around 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 oil body and oil migration processes visually cc appeared to spread out more than the db supplementary material 3 photos this is consistent with what was observed for the btex and pah concentrations extracted from the sand at the end of the experiment fig 5 this suggests that due to the lower viscosity cc may spread out more in the sand than the db in general the cc oil body has higher concentrations of organic compounds which is primarily attributed to the higher concentrations found in the initial cc oil visually cc appeared to spread out more than the db supplementary material 3 photos this is consistent with what was observed for the btex and pah concentrations extracted from the sand at the end of the experiment fig 5 this suggests that due to the lower viscosity cc may spread out more in the sand than the db in general the cc oil body has higher concentrations of organic compounds which is primarily attributed to the higher concentrations found in the initial cc oil previous oil spill studies have described the expected distribution of oil in the subsurface with an oil body where volatilization can occur where the oil is exposed to the atmosphere and dissolution occurring from the oil body into groundwater dillard et al 1997 usgs 1998 fig 14 shows a schematic diagram of the processes expected to have occurred during the experiment initially water flowed freely past the oil injector fig 14 a during oil injection oil spread out around the injector fig 14 b as the oil injection occurred below the water table less loss of light molecular weight component occurred than would have if the experiment had taken place above the water table during injections of oil in some tanks some oil broke through to the surface this occurred with both db and cc following injection some water flows past the oil dissolving soluble species from the oil fig 14 c oil that is above the water table loses light end hydrocarbons by volatilization during excavation of the tanks it was observed that although the injection of oil was done in a uniform manner the oil was not continuous in the subsurface as shown in the photograph in fig 4 it is presumed that water may flow around areas containing oil in the subsurface in a heterogeneous manner the distribution of oil observed in these tank experiments is similar to what has been observed in the field with spills of conventional crude dillard et al 1997 however the diluted bitumen used in this experiment spread out less than the conventional crude 4 2 dissolved organics in discharge water 4 2 1 dissolved organic trends the concentrations of dissolved organics in discharge water increased following the injection of cc and db into the groundwater tanks the maximum toc in discharge from cc tanks was around 50 greater than the maximum toc from db tanks fig 10 the maximum toc from cc tanks occured at around 30 days similar to maximum concentrations of xylenes after the maximum benzene and toluene concentrations but before maximum ethylbenzene concentrations the maximum toc from db tanks was further delayed occurring later than the maximum of other organics measured this suggests that btex compounds were only a fraction of the toc and future study should aim to understand what other organics are in the dissolved fraction the spikes in the concentrations of co cr and fe metal concentrations occured at approximately the same time as maximum benzene and toluene concentrations and before maximum ethylbenzene and xylene concentrations these difference were likely caused by differences in retardation rates of different compounds discharge from the cc tanks had higher btex concentrations than discharge from db tanks the concentration of benzene in cc oil samples was similar to the db oil samples consequently the maximum benzene concentrations in discharge were similar in both sets of experiments however the concentration of benzene in the oil body samples collected at the end of the experiment were higher in cc samples than db samples fig 5 in discharge water samples benzene concentrations from db were 30 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 54 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of ethylbenzene in the cc crude oil was 3 8 times greater than in the db crude oil while maximum concentrations in the cc tank discharge water were 3 3 to 4 9 times greater than the db discharge in discharge water samples ethylbenzene concentrations from db were 69 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 88 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of toluene in the cc crude oil was 1 6 times greater than that in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from the cc tanks were 1 7 to 3 9 higher than the db tanks in discharge water samples toluene concentrations from db were 36 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 45 of their maximum on the same day the concentration of xylenes in the cc crude oil was 2 5 times greater than those in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from the cc tanks were 1 7 to 4 0 higher than the db tanks in discharge water samples xylene concentrations from db were 57 of their maximum by day 56 while concentrations from the cc tanks were 73 of their maximum on the same day naphthalene was the only pah to be consistently above the detection limit in discharge water from both the cc and the db tanks the concentration of naphthalene in the cc crude oil was 14 times greater than those in the db crude oil while maximum discharge concentrations from cc tanks were 10 6 to 14 6 higher than the db tanks at the end of the experiment naphthalene concentrations were not decreasing the maximum concentrations of btex compounds and naphthalene in discharge water occurred in similar ratios to the concentrations in the crude oils this result suggests that following oil injection leaching occurred from the oil mainly in proportion to their concentrations in the oil and over time differences in physical properties of the oils contributed to differences in dissolved concentrations for both cc and db tanks btex concentrations reached their maximum after two to four weeks then decreased but db concentrations decreased proportionally more than cc the greater decrease in db concentrations is interpreted to be the result of the higher viscosity of db with db having spread out less in the tank allowing for less continued dissolution of dissolved organics from the oil 4 2 2 dissolved organic predictions the concentration of organic compounds that will partition into the water was predicted for three btex compounds benzene ethylbenzene and toluene using raoult s law eq 1 note because total xylenes were determined in crude oil the concentration of each xylene species in water could not be calculated using raoult s law eq 1 in eq 1 c represents the aqueous concentration of the compound x is the mole fraction and s is the solubility of the compound in water shiu et al 1988 1 c xs determining the mole fraction of different components in crude oils is difficult due to its complex composition here we estimate the mole fraction from the average molecular weight determined from the density eq 2 is used to determine the average molecular weight of the crude oil mw from the specific gravity sg specific gravity is the density of oil divided by the density of water king 2020 the concentration of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene predicted using raoult s law are presented in table 4 rearranged from king 2020 2 mw 6084 141 sg 137 4 despite db having the same or lower concentration of benzene ethylbenzene and toluene their mole fractions are higher than in cc resulting in higher predicted aqueous concentrations the predicted aqueous concentrations are compared with the average of the maximum concentration from each column for cc the predicted aqueous concentrations are 2 7 to 3 5 times the measured average maximum concentrations for benzene ethylbenzene and toluene while for db the predicted aqueous concentrations are 6 1 to 10 9 times the measured average maximum concentrations for these compounds one reason for the difference between the predicted and measured concentrations is that not all discharge from the tank has interacted with oil as such there is dilution of dissolved constituents additionally the flow rate through the tank may result in shorter residence times for oil than needed for dissolution to equilibrium furthermore there may be sorption of dissolved organics along the flow path the larger difference between the predicted aqueous concentration and the average maximum concentration for db is attributed to its greater viscosity resulting in less oil water interaction since db remains closer to the injection point and spreads out less further research is needed to better to predict dissolved concentrations of organic contaminants from diluted bitumen properties 4 2 3 conditions impacting dissolved organics these experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 0 5 c however the viscosity of crude oils increases as temperature decreases ground temperature is generally similar to the mean annual air temperature ngwa 2022 across all of canada and most of the united states the mean annual air temperature is below 22 c berkeley earth 2022 suggesting a spill of either oil will migrate more slowly due to the higher viscosity at lower temperature compared to the current study this may result in lower concentrations of dissolved organics in groundwater should a spill occur 4 2 4 evaluating in situ biodegradation microbial breakdown of benzene under aerobic conditions is associated with a noticeable positive shift up to 4 in residual δ13cbenzene values fischer et al 2008 hunkeler et al 2001 thus the lack of 13c enrichment in δ13cbenzene found here fig 13 implies no significant biodegradation of benzene during the course of the experiments although studies have reported a small yet significant isotopic fractionation during aerobic biodegradation of toluene by pure bacterial strains vogt et al 2008 no discernible fractionation was observed during 70 biodegradation by a mixed consortium sherwood lollar et al 1999 thus while the lack of variation in δ13ctoluene values fig 13 does not exclude the possibility of toluene biodegradation during these experiments significant microbial breakdown of toluene is considered unlikely given the absence of 13c enrichment in more easily fractionated benzene the compound specific isotope data presented here therefore implies that microbial activity had little impact on btex concentrations and distribution patterns 4 3 dissolved inorganics in discharge water the concentrations of most inorganic species major ions ca k na mg hco3 cl so4 2 trace metals b ba cu ni mo p si se sr and zn decreased over the course of the experiment presumably the result of a decrease in leaching from the sand the experiments were conducted in the concentrations of co cr fe mn and v underwent some form of increase over the course of the experiment in this discussion the increases in metals concentrations are discussed in two groups concentration spikes and gradual increases 4 3 1 concentration spikes concentration spikes were found for co cr fe and v where the concentration rapidly increased at some point soon after oil injection followed by a subsequent drop fig 9 this occurred for co cr fe and v in samples from db tanks no obvious spike trends were observed in cc tanks with the exception of v in one cc sample in the soluble extraction of the oils co and cr concentrations were higher in db compared to cc while fe was below detection for both and concentrations of v were within error of each other these metals are interpreted to be sourced from the oil and not from the sand as the concentrations increased as a spike after injection of the oils and their concentrations in the sand were low supplementary material 1 concentration spikes were found for co cr fe and v where the concentration rapidly increased at some point soon after oil injection followed by a subsequent drop fig 9 this occurred for co cr fe and v in samples from db tanks no obvious spike trends were observed in cc tanks with the exception of v in one cc sample in the soluble extraction of the oils co and cr concentrations were higher in db compared to cc while fe was below detection for both and concentrations of v were within error of each other these metals are interpreted to be sourced from the oil and not from the sand as the concentrations increased as a spike after injection of the oils and their concentrations in the sand were low supplementary material 1 4 3 2 gradual increases prior to oil injection the mn concentration in discharge water from the tanks was 0 07 mg l for cc and 0 02 mg l for db the concentrations of mn in discharge water from db and cc tanks increased soon after oil injection with average mn concentrations in discharge from cc tanks being 0 11 mg l and from db tanks being 0 12 mg l fig 9 the mn concentrations in the water are attributed to release from the sand due to changes in geochemical conditions this is discussed further in supplementary material 1 prior to oil injection the mn concentration in discharge water from the tanks was 0 07 mg l for cc and 0 02 mg l for db the concentrations of mn in discharge water from db and cc tanks increased soon after oil injection with average mn concentrations in discharge from cc tanks being 0 11 mg l and from db tanks being 0 12 mg l fig 9 the mn concentrations in the water are attributed to release from the sand due to changes in geochemical conditions this is discussed further in supplementary material 1 4 4 environmental implication pipelines transporting conventional crude and diluted bitumen are present in many jurisdictions as such if a spill occurs water contaminated by the oil will be compared with local relevant guidelines here we compare concentrations with alberta tier 1 groundwater remediation guidelines ab tier 1 guidelines as alberta is the primary source of diluted bitumen in north america alberta environment 2016 while different jurisdictions have different guidelines these guidelines are commonly based on the same science table 5 lists the number of samples collected that were above alberta tier 1 guidelines the alberta tier 1 guideline values for parameters that exceed the guidelines are also shown in fig 9 fig 11 and fig 12 for most of the experiment discharge from both the db and cc tanks was above alberta tier 1 guidelines for mn benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes discharge from db tanks was never above the alberta tier 1 guideline for naphthalene however discharge from cc tanks was above guideline values for 56 of samples analysed average concentrations of these analytes were up to 135 times the alberta tier 1 guideline based on the concentrations above alberta tier 1 guidelines the same volume of oil could be enough to contaminate a larger volume of water however multiple factors such as groundwater velocity dispersion and aquifer sorption will impact how much water could have concentrations above guidelines 5 conclusion these experiments demonstrated that for spills of diluted bitumen and conventional crude occurring below the water table the concentrations of dissolved organic compounds btex pahs will be proportional to those determined in the crude oil over time the concentrations of dissolved organics decreased faster for db than cc the maximum aqueous concentrations were lower than predicted based on raoult s law for both db and cc but were lowest for db a difference attributed to the higher viscosity of db additionally the concentration of some metals co cr fe and v appeared to spike in db tank discharge the stable isotope results suggested there has been no appreciable biological degradation of organics in the dissolved phase the results also suggested a spill of 0 9 l of db or cc into an aquifer 1 m 1 m 15 m would be sufficient to produce concentrations of benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylene above the alberta tier 1 guidelines funding research funded through

1262,this study evaluates the potential toxicity of the soils of the guadiamar green corridor ggc affected by the aznalcóllar mine spill andalusia spain one of the most important mining accidents in europe in recent decades twenty years after the accident although the area is considered to be recovered residual contamination in soils persists and the bioavailability of some contaminants such as as is showing trends of increasing therefore the potential residual toxicity in 84 soil samples was evaluated by bioassays with lettuce latuca sativa l earthworms eisenia andrei and determining the microbial activity by basal respiration and metabolic quotient the selected soils sampled along the ggc were divided into 4 types according to their physicochemical properties in the closest part of the mine two soil types appear ss1 and ss2 originally decarbonated and loamy with a reduction in lettuce root elongation of 57 and 34 compared to the control as well as a the highest metabolic quotient 23 9 and 18 1 ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 respectively with the highest risk of pb and as toxicity while located in the middle and final part of the affected area of the spill ss3 and ss4 soils presented alkaline ph finer textures and the lowest metabolic quotient 9 5 ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 in addition due to pb and as exceeded the guideline values established in the studied area the human toxicity risk was determined according to us epa methodology although the total contents were higher than the guidelines established the obtained hazard quotients for both contaminants were less than one so the risk for human health was discarded however monitoring over time of the toxicity risks of the ggc soils would be advisable especially due to the existence of areas where residual contamination persist and soil hazard quotient obtained for as in children was higher and close to unity keywords toxicity risk metabolic quotient basal respiration exposure pathway bioassay potentially toxic element data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils may accumulate potentially toxic elements ptes that affect their ecosystem functions compromising their quality and the balance of the ecosystem s communities palma et al 2019 metal mining represents a potential pollution concern since it can cause emissions of ptes such as heavy metals and other associated elements like arsenic which can be mobilized within the soil plant water system and dispersed in the atmosphere and might have adverse impacts on human health of local citizens liu et al 2017 khelifi et al 2019 therefore mining companies and public administrations should assess the risk of pollution associated with extractive activities and promote prevention protection and decontamination measures to ensure the safety of our environment morales et al 2019 because they may represent potential health hazard from chronic and daily exposure to mine wastes enriched with toxic elements hamed et al 2022 there are numerous regulatory measures to limit emissions and to establish cleanup standards for ptes in soil which are generally based on the total soil concentration of these elements however total metal concentrations are poor predictors of toxicity lanno et al 2004 smolders et al 2009 with bioavailable concentrations being more accurate to use bioavailable concentrations indicate the amount of ptes that may be easier absorbed by organisms and can cause damage to the ecosystem and or enter to the trophic chain van gestel 2008 favas et al 2011 niemeyer et al 2015 son et al 2019 therefore when the guidelines are exceeded based on total soil concentrations complementary studies are necessary for environmental and human health toxicity risk assessment renaud et al 2017 martinez et al 2018 fajana et al 2020 to establish the toxicity risks in contaminated soil ecosystems toxicity bioassays should be performed which are effective tools to assess the actual level of contamination of soils in addition to providing relevant and objective information to regulate the land use as well as to plan remediation measures if needed gonzález et al 2011 garcía carmona et al 2017 the aznalcóllar mining accident is one of the most important mining accidents associated with metal mining worldwide nikolic et al 2011 the breakage of the tailing dam caused the spill of 0 9 hm3 of pyritic sludge and 3 6 hm3 of acidic water into the guadiamar river basin simón et al 2001 due to the nature of the wastes stored in the tailing dam the acidic water and the sludge spilled into the soils of the guadiamar river basin resulted in a severe contamination of the soils by ptes with significant total soil concentrations reached for as bi cd cu pb sb tl and zn alastuey et al 1999 cabrera et al 1999 simón et al 1999 given the magnitude of the accident and the high pollution observed in the soils affected by the spill the regional government of andalusia invested an enormous amount of human technical and economic resources for the recovery of the area which was finally declared a protected site currently known as the guadiamar river green corridor ggc cma 2003 thanks to remediation measures applied and the effect produced by the passage of 20 years for the stabilization of the affected area the total and bioavailable concentrations of many of the ptes have been reduced with the latest work in the area focusing mainly on those ptes that persist in higher concentrations such as pb as zn cu and cd madejón et al 2006 martín et al 2015 romero freire et al 2016a however despite the remediation work carried out in the area between 1998 and 2001 there are still soils in which the guideline values established for andalusia for total pb and as concentrations are exceeded pastor jáuregui et al 2021 approximately 7 of the area affected by the spill remains contaminated randomly distributed in heterometric patches easily identifiable by the absence of vegetation where soils are acidic with high salinity and high total and bioavailable concentration of ptes martín et al 2015 these contaminated patches stay due to deficiencies in the removal of sludge and cleaning tasks carried out shortly after the accident thus there has been a continuous oxidation of the sludge remains that persists throughout the soil profile simón et al 2008 it represents a risk of spreading contamination linked to erosion and or leaching as the soils are not stabilized by vegetation madejón et al 2006 therefore a long term monitoring of the remediation of contaminated soils is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures applied and the safety of the soils for this reason the objective of this work is to evaluate the toxicity risks of the soils affected by the toxic spill of the aznalcóllar mining accident twenty years after the accident and fifteen years since the establishment of the area as recovered and declared as a protected landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the study area corresponds to the entire guadiamar green corridor ggc area affected by the toxic spill of the aznalcóllar mine andalusia spain which occurred in april 1998 it is located in the west of the province of seville between latitudes 37 30 and 37 00 north and longitudes 6 10 and 6 20 west covering a 45 km long and 500 m wide strip of irregular shape on both sides of the agrio and guadiamar riverbeds fig 1 the climate of the area is typically mediterranean characterized by hot dry summers and cold wet winters according to the data of the agro climatic station of the andalusian institute for agricultural fisheries and food research and training the average annual temperature is 18 3 c and the annual rainfall is 490 mm with an evapotranspiration coefficient of 920 mm considering the last 20 years 2001 2021 a total of 84 plots 10 10 m homogeneously randomly distributed along the ggc were sampled collecting composite samples at 0 10 cm depth to obtain a representative sample every 100 m2 satellite images fig si 1 were used to identify contaminated areas where remediation efforts were insufficient and which 20 years after the mining accident can be identified by the absence of vegetation according to that in addition of the 84 sampling points 6 patches without vegetation where pollution persists were randomly selected in the area closest to the mine and composite samples were also taken from the top 10 cm of soil 2 2 soil properties and pollutant concentrations all soil samples were bagged in the field identified and homogenized once transferred to the laboratory they were dried at room temperature and sieved 2 mm soil texture was determined by the robinson pipette method usda united states department of agriculture 1972 calcium carbonate content caco3 by volumetric method barahona 1984 soil ph was measured in water in a ratio 1 2 5 with a 914 ph conductometer metrohm total organic carbon oc was analyzed by a leco truspec cn after soil samples were acid washed hcl 1 mol l for 24 h to remove carbonates following ussiri and lal 2008 soil water extract 1 5 was prepared to determine the electrical conductivity ec using a eutech con700 conductivity meter field capacity was measured according to richards 1945 the total soil concentrations of the studied ptes pb and as were analyzed in finely ground samples by x ray fluorescence xrf with a portable niton xl3t 980 goldd analyzer niton billerica usa the precision and accuracy of this method was performed based on the measurement with 6 replicates of a certified reference material crm 052 050 rt corporation limited salisbury uk obtaining the following results certified vs measured mean values in mg kg

water soluble pollutants was determined in a 1 5 soil water suspension according to sposito et al 1982 bioavailable pollutant concentration was extracted using 0 05 m edta ph 7 as described by quevauviller et al 1998 the extracted elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a perkin elmer sciex elan 5000a spectrometer waltham ma usa the precision of the method was corroborated by analysis 6 replicates of a standard reference material srm 2711 obtaining the following results certified vs measured mean values in mg kg 1 and standard error in

samples ss1 ss4 and the 6 bares soils bs taken along the ggc two different short term assays were performed 1 a bioassay of germination and root elongation was performed with lactuca sativa l usepa 1996 in petri dishes a filter paper with 5 ml of soil water extract 1 5 were incubated with 20 seeds of l sativa l at 25 1 c for 5 days after that the of germinated seed and the length of the roots of the germinated seeds were recorded as control same procedure was done with distilled water in triplicate the percentage of root elongation was calculated in comparison with the control samples from 0 maximum toxicity to 100 no toxicity 2 a second assay determined the i basal heterotrophic respiration rate ii microbial carbon and iii metabolic coefficient following adapted iso 17155 iso 2012 and oecd 2000 protocols around 5 g of soil at field moisture capacity were placed with 2 ml of koh 0 2 in a sy lab μ trac 4200 respirometer samples were incubated at 25 c for 96 h and after that i mean basal heterotrophic respiration rate μg co2 h 1 gsoil 1 was obtained microbial biomass carbon ii μg cmicrob g csuelo 1 was quantified using the irradiation incubation method according to ferreira et al 1999 part of the soil microorganisms were removed by electromagnetic irradiation by microwave heating and then the soil was incubated for 10 days at 28 c and the amount of co2 released after incubation was measured in the same equipment the metabolic quotient iii qco2 was obtained as the ratio between i and ii expressed as ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 according to anderson and domsch 1993 higher values of the metabolic coefficient indicate elevated stress conditions for soil microbial communities nielsen and winding 2002 in addition in the 4 bare soils bs sampled in the areas where the pollution persists the evaluation of toxicity was performed by a long term toxicity test with earthworms eisenia andrei oecd organization for economic cooperation and development 2015 to determine soil toxicity a control soil was sampled in the vicinity of the contaminated area but outside the boundaries of the ggc thus ensuring that the soil was unaffected by the spill table si 1 summarizing containers with 500 g of moistened to field capacity soil were placed with five pre acclimatized weighed adult earthworms and incubated at 20 c with 14 h of light per day for 4 weeks to feed the earthworms wet horse manure drug free was added to each container and weekly moisture content and food requirements were monitored after these 4 weeks mortality rate and weight variation average difference in the weight of earthworms at 4 weeks in relation to their initial weight were recorded soils containing cocoons were incubated again for another 4 weeks at same conditions and at the end of these 4 weeks the containers were placed in a water bath 60 2 c to force the juveniles to come up to the surface and to count the number of hatchlings present in each sample the of survival and weight variation compared to the beginning of the experiment and the of juveniles compared to the control samples were calculated 2 4 human health risk assessment the potential human health risk for pb and as for children and adults in the ggc was estimated based on models proposed by the usepa 2017a and usepa 2017b from the calculation of the hazard quotient hq considering exposure pathways by ingestion inhalation and dermal contact in the studied soil samples to determine the hq by ingestion soil samples were digested simulating gastric digestion according to usepa 2017a summarizing 1 g of soil dried and sieved at 150 μm was shaken and incubated during 1 h at 37 c with 100 ml of extraction fluid 0 4 m glycine adjusted ph 1 50 after that supernatant was separated from the sample by filtration and analyzed for total pb and as concentration by icp ms spectroscopy the hq by inhalation in soil samples sieved at 50 μm according to the procedure described in islam et al 2016 were measured the hq by dermal contact were calculated from the finely ground samples according to the standard procedure usepa united states environmental protection agency 2004 the total soil concentration of pb and as for inhalation and dermal contact risk assessment were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf finally the human health risk assessment was estimated as the cumulative hazard index hi for children and for adults by dividing the average daily potential dose of the three exposure routes mg kg 1 day 1 by the chronic reference dose of the three routes mg kg 1 day 1 usepa 1989 when hi is higher than 1 it is considered that there may be a risk to human health the parameter values the reference values and the equations used for estimating human exposure to pb and as in this study are presented in si 2 5 statistical analysis prior to the statistical treatment of the data the normal distribution test kolmogorov smirnov was performed and the homogeneity of variances was tested using the levene test the data were analyzed with the comparison of means test anova and homogeneous subsets were performed using tukey s test determining significant differences between parameters p 0 05 if normality and or homogeneity of variances were not met nonparametric tests kruskal wallis and mann whitney u were performed based on the analytical data of the edaphic properties ph ec caco3 and co a division by soil type was carried out by means of a hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the relationship between the different study variables a principal component pca analysis was performed all statistical analyses were carried out using spss v 23 0 software spss inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties the hierarchical cluster analysis fig si 2 performed based on soil properties ph ce caco3 and oc and total pb and as soil concentration defined 4 soil types ss1 ss4 that are heterogeneously geographically distributed in two sectors fig 1 and fig si 2 soils ss1 n 9 and ss2 n 11 are located in the upper part of the ggc closest to the mine and are loamy textured soils not or slightly carbonated neutral or slightly acidic ph and show some salinity table 1 in contrast soils ss3 n 25 and ss4 n 39 are randomly located in the middle and lower sector of the ggc and are alkaline carbonated and fine textured soils two decades after the accident and after the cleaning and soil amendment work completed in 2001 the soils show similar properties to the soils existing before the accident described by simón et al 1999 as acid soils not or slightly carbonated and with loam to sandy loam texture in the sector near the mine this coincides with soils ss1 and ss2 while in the middle and lower part of the ggc the soils were neutral to slightly alkaline with carbonate contents above 5 and textures varying between clay loam loam and silty clay bare soils bs are extremely acidic and showed low ph and high ec properties that along with the presence of pollutants are a clear consequence of the continued contamination process and or as a result of the rapid and deficient first extensive cleanup operation that mixed the tailings with the soil in depth simón et al 2008 garcía carmona et al 2019a low carbonate contents are influenced by the acidic ph of the bs whereas the topsoil removed during the clean up in 1999 and the absence of vegetation over time in the bs is reflected in the low oc values observed the soils affected by the spill greatly increased in acidity in many cases reaching values below ph 4 aguilar et al 2004 due to the acidity of the water ph 5 cabrera et al 1999 and of the pyrite sludge which given its heterogeneity ranged from ph 4 1 to ph 5 1 simón et al 1999 the acidification of soils was aggravated by the oxidation of the sludge at the surface and even continued after the sludge removal tasks by sludge debris trapped in the soil cracks dorronsoro et al 2002 the oxidation of the sulphides involves oxidation hydrolysis and hydration processes that stumm and morgan 1981 summarized in eq 1 1 fes 2 3 75 o 2 3 5h 2 o fe oh 3 2h 2 so 4 this reaction starts with the release of fe2 and under oxidizing conditions is converted into fe3 when soil ph is above 4 5 then fe3 precipitate as iron hydroxide and the ph becomes more acidic eq 2 2 fe 3 3h 2 o fe oh 3 3h however when soil ph remains under 4 5 the fe3 can oxidize the pyrite this reaction is faster and can generate more acidity eq 3 3 fes 2 14 fe 3 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 2so 4 2 16 h the continued oxidation of the sulfides contained in the sludge significantly increased the soluble sulfate content of the soil leading to a sharp increase in soil salinity which over time has been significantly reduced especially in the most carbonated area which coincides with the ss3 and ss4 soils despite the positive evolution of the ph and salinity of the ggc soils acidic soils with high salinity ss1 are still detected located in the area closest to the mine these results agree with aguilar et al 2007 simón et al 2008 and martín et al 2015 which indicated the persistence of residual contamination in punctual areas of the corridor the carbonate content was significantly higher in ss3 and ss4 compared to ss1 and ss2 even though with the liming measures the doses of carbonates applied in the upper part of the ggc were higher 60 90 t ha 1 ss1 and ss2 compared to 20 t ha 1 applied in other areas soils ss1 and ss2 closer to the mine and originally decarbonated received a greater contribution of sludge after the accident and much of the added carbonate was consumed in the neutralization of acidity in general the recovery of the soils allowed the development of dense vegetation along the ggc which contributes a significant amount of organic matter to the soil reaching average contents higher than those reported by simón et al 1999 in the agricultural soils of the area before the accident and without significant differences in the oc content for the 4 studied soil types 3 2 concentration of pb and as in studied soil samples after the aznalcóllar mining accident the soils were seriously contaminated by heavy metals and associated elements the main soil contaminants spread in the area were as cd cu sb pb tl and zn simón et al 1999 two decades after the accident pb and as still show total soil concentrations above the guideline values established by the regional government of andalusia pastor jáuregui et al 2020 fig 2 shows the pb and as total concentrations in the four soil types considered in the ggc and for the studied bare soils bs in the ss1 and bs total pb exceeded in 89 of the studied sampling points the pb guideline value 275 mg kg 1 whilst in the ss2 ss3 and ss4 10 of the studied sampling points showed values higher for the case of as the established guideline value 36 mg kg 1 was exceeding in all sampling points of ss1 and bs in more than the 70 of sampling points of ss2 and ss4 and in 44 of the sampling points of ss3 in ss1 soils n 9 the persistence of higher total pb and as concentrations coincide with more acidic soils with higher salinity which martín et al 2008 and otero et al 2012 relate to more contaminated soils due to the formation of soluble sulfates by the oxidation of the sludge ss2 soils n 11 although sharing their geographic distribution in the ggc show significantly lower total pb and as concentrations similar to those reported by romero freire et al 2016a sierra et al 2019 and garcía carmona et al 2019b in soils that are considered recovered within the same area of the ggc soils ss3 n 25 and ss4 n 39 show in general lower total pb and as concentrations than ss2 but are only statistically significant with respect to ss1 table 2 since pb and as are elements considered not very mobile garcía carmona et al 2019a there is no expectation that the total concentration of these elements will decrease over time in addition the average annual rainfall in the area is 490 mm over the last 20 years with a trend towards greater aridity so the risk of pb and as leaching is limited on the other hand the natural vegetation in the area is mainly herbaceous so that pb and as assimilated by plants is recycled back to the soil according to the water soluble concentration pbs and ass we observed that values did not show significant differences for the case of pb while the ass was higher in the ss4 section table 2 the presence of calcium carbonate in all soil samples can produce the precipitation of pb at acidic phs which can support the low pb solubility observed in the studied soil samples simón et al 2005 garcía carmona et al 2017 lead is known as a very immobile element in soils with mineral content and type ph and organic matter being the most important factors determining pb sorption in soils kabata pendias 2010 romero freire et al 2015a garcía carmona et al 2017 the observed properties of the different sectors table 1 can be the responsible of the low water soluble pb concentration the water soluble as concentration has increased considerably in 2018 in ss4 0 10 mg kg 1 with respect to the concentrations reported by martín et al 2015 and romero freire et al 2016a in soils recovered from the middle and final part of ggc analyzed in 2013 0 01 and 0 07 mg kg 1 respectively even authors such as sierra et al 2019 or paniagua lópez et al 2021 report soluble as concentrations in soils recovered from the ggc of 0 15 and 0 24 mg kg 1 respectively when in 2004 the water soluble as concentration reported by martín peinado 2001 were 0 006 mg kg 1 in the middle and final part of the ggc the increase in water solubility of as in ss4 may be related to the naturalization of the soils in the middle and final part of the ggc where the recovery of the vegetation was faster after the remediation measures applied until 2001 the ss4 soils are the ones that presented the highest organic matter content although without reaching significant differences however the rapid development of vegetation has given rise to a supply of organic matter that promote interactions between the organic matter and as forms partially explaining the generally greater mobility of as in this natural environment wang and mulligan 2006 report that soil organic matter can increase as water solubility through competition for available adsorption sites formation of aqueous complexes and or changes in the redox potential of site surfaces and as redox speciation another factor that determines the mobility of as is its affinity for fe oxy hydroxides since under oxic conditions arsenic exists mainly in as v oxidation state as the arsenate oxyanion haso4 2 h2aso4 al abed et al 2007 this adsorption affinity is higher for as v at lower ph values ranging from 4 to 7 pierce and moore 1982 and in this sense simón et al 2010 indicates the importance of not exceeding ph values 6 5 when remediation tasks in as contaminated soils are carried out since it can lead to an increase in its solubility the bioaccessible pb content pbe showed interesting results because although lower total pb content was observed far from the upper part of the ggc closest to the mine the pbe higher values were observed in the ss4 ss3 ss2 with significant differences garcía carmona et al 2019a reported edta extractable pb concentrations in the ggc recovered soils even higher than ours and correlated with the higher carbonate content in this sense simón et al 2005 reported that pb co precipitate with fe coating the surface of carbonates that were used as an amendment in ggc soils and the quantity precipitated decreased at ph 6 5 castro larragoitia et al 2013 and armienta et al 2016 also reported that calcium carbonate soils have a neutralization potential that influences the availability of pb that is why ss2 ss4 soils due to its carbonate content and alkaline ph showed low water soluble pb concentration while edta extractable pb is high due to the strong chelating ability of the edta extracting pb from carbonate which is difficult to release owing to the stronger ionic bonding wang et al 2021 in the case of ase there were not significant differences between soil types and only in the bs high contents of ase were observed 3 3 toxicity assessment and soil properties the performance of bioassays in contaminated areas allows estimating the real ecotoxicological risk of soils under natural conditions fernández et al 2006 ecotoxicity tests are key tools in the study of the fate and bioavailability and to assess the potential ecotoxicological effects of metals as well as their possible transfer to the other compartments such as groundwater or even their transfer to the food chain the use of biological tests is essential for determining the potential ecological risk of soil contamination to organisms and ecosystems depending on the potentially toxic element ptes present in the soil it may produce toxicity in one specific organism and not in others matejczyk et al 2011 baderna et al 2015 for this reason in soils with multi elemental contamination it is difficult to attribute toxic effects to one specific element due to possible synergies or antagonisms between them spurgeon and hopkin 1995 this justifies the need to use bioassays with different organisms to obtain a reliable ecotoxicological risk assessment romero freire et al 2016a garcía carmona et al 2019a moreover it is recommendable to use different bioassays with both liquid and solid phase to assess soil toxicity in a more reliable way due to organisms can interact with soil particles and liquid soil components farré and barceló 2003 martín et al 2010 for the evaluation of the ecotoxicological risk of the ggc soils bioassays were performed in liquid phase with lactuca sativa l and in solid phase by determining the rate of heterotrophic respiration and establishing the stress degree of soil microorganisms through the metabolic quotient qco2 which expresses the ratio between respiration rate and microbial biomass of the soil table 3 the liquid phase bioassay with lactuca sativa l has been recommended by many international organizations for the determination of ecological effects of toxic substances and for toxicity testing escoto et al 2007 lyu et al 2018 as it is simple fast reliable inexpensive and does not require expensive equipment the germination rate of lettuce seeds from ss1 soils was significantly lower than that of the other soil types considered while root elongation was significantly lower in ss1 and ss2 soil types with respect to ss3 and ss4 types that did not present toxicity in this bioassay root elongation was therefore a more sensitive measure of toxicity than germination rate results that agreed with those reported in the literature bagur gonzález et al 2011 our results for soils ss1 and ss2 were consistent with those reported by romero freire et al 2016a from studies performed in the same area with a percentage of root elongation in soils close to the mine slightly below 60 whereas in soils in the middle and distal third of the ggc an elongation of 70 was reported compared to values close to 100 obtained in soils ss3 and ss4 which can indicate a reduction in toxicity over time heterotrophic soil respiration is related to soil fertility and soil quality iso 2012 niemeyer et al 2012 contamination may quantitatively and qualitatively affect soil microorganisms stefanowicz et al 2008 shukurov et al 2014 and the processes in which they are involved such as their role in soil nutrient cycling and in the processes of mineralization and synthesis of organic compounds moreno et al 2009 nwachukwu and pulford 2011 decreased microbial activity due to the presence of contaminants in the soil causes a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide produced so it can be used as an indicator of stress on microbial communities dai et al 2004 azarbad et al 2013 basal heterotrophic respiration data measured in the ggc did not show significant differences between the different soil types considered in fact there is controversy over the use of respiration rate as an indicator of contamination wakelin et al 2010 and zornoza et al 2015 found no correlation between respiration rate and potential toxicity while dinesh et al 2012 and romero freire et al 2016b reported a positive correlation between respiration and degree of contamination in contrast ss1 soils showed the highest heterotrophic respiration rate and the greatest total as and pb soil concentrations however the heterotrophic respiration rate alone was not conclusive for the evaluation of toxicity in the ggc soils analyzed since they showed different degrees of contamination that resulted in a high dispersion of respiration rates microbial biomass is another biological indicator that provides information on soil quality and its response to the incorporation of contaminants or to the application of amendment measures since microorganisms respond faster to these changes than to changes in soil physicochemical properties nannipieri et al 2017 oijagbe et al 2019 as a consequence of the exposure of soil microbiota to potential toxic elements the microbial biomass can be reduced due to cell death caused by the alteration of essential functions or by an unaffordable increase in vital energy cost akmal and jianming 2009 oijagbe et al 2019 soils in the ss3 and ss4 showed a significantly higher microbial biomass content than ss1 and ss2 soils nearly twice their value these results agree with those obtained from the lettuce bioassay showing signs of toxicity in ss1 and ss2 soils the metabolic quotient qco2 is perhaps the most widely used index to evaluate the efficiency of energy use by soil microorganisms it is usually correlated with an increase in biodiversity and ecosystem maturity and has been used to compare the impact that seasonal changes management systems addition of metals agrochemicals and xenobiotics have on soil microorganisms paolini 2018 the qco2 allows diagnosing the efficiency of microbial biomass in soil carbon use in terms of respiration expenditure anderson and domsch 1990 according to this index in ss1 microorganisms would be subject to higher stress compared to the other soil types coinciding with more limiting edaphic conditions in terms of salinity and acidity and higher total soil concentration of pb and as under unfavorable conditions microorganisms require more energy to maintain biomass and therefore qco2 increases and carbon is lost as co2 insam and domsch 1988 which may justify the higher respiration rate and lower microbial biomass content in ss1 soils where qco2 is significantly higher this circumstance may be indicative of a change in the structure and diversity of microbial populations in contaminated soils with respect to natural soils since microorganisms are able to develop resistance and resilience to certain ptes allison and martiny 2008 hänsch and emmerling 2010 in this sense paniagua lópez et al 2021 described differences between contaminated and recovered soils in the same area in terms of gene copy number microbial biodiversity shanon index and bacterial community structure at the genus level the principal components analysis of the 84 soil samples along the ggc includes the soil properties analyzed the total water soluble and bioavailable pb and as concentration and the bioassays grouped into two components that explain 49 of the variance fig 3 the total soil concentration of pb and as is directly related to the soils where the salinity and acidity are higher and the soils are not or slightly carbonated this trend is strongly marked by the ss1 soils which are the most contaminated and in which a higher qco2 is recorded furthermore pca component 1 groups the heterotrophic respiration rate the microbial biomass the root elongation with the ph and the carbonate content of the soil which are higher in soils with lower total concentration of pb and as pca component 2 inversely relates the water soluble concentrations of pb and as with the germination rate of the lettuce seed while the edta extractable concentration of pb and as considered to be bioavailable in the long term labanowski et al 2008 hurdebise et al 2015 is not grouped with any of the variables considered the root elongation bioassay compared to the metabolic coefficient has been shown to be more sensitive to contamination possibly due to the limitation of basal respiration as an indicator of soil toxicity in fact the sensitivity of the lettuce seed root elongation bioassay is widely recognized in the literature as an effective tool for ecotoxicological risk assessment martín et al 2010 lors et al 2011 romero freire et al 2014 romero freire et al 2015b garcía carmona et al 2019b hong et al 2021 from the bioassays it can be concluded that the ss1 soils are the ones that present a greater potential risk of toxicity for the ecosystem due to the high content of pb and as related to the soil acidity and the absence or low content of carbonates however carbonated soils especially ss4 in which the recovery of the vegetation was denser and faster can promote the remobilization of as due to the increase in the soil organic matter and this increase in the as solubility can be encouraged by the moderately alkaline soil ph therefore monitoring over time would be advisable to assess the evolution of the ecotoxicological risk of the ggc soils 3 4 ecotoxicological risk assessment of bare soils in the six contaminated areas selected in this work bare soils bs the average ph was 3 5 and the electrical conductivity was 3 1 ds m 1 table 1 in these bs total pb and as concentration were higher than the other sampling points table 2 and 10 times higher than adjacent soils that were not affected by the toxic spill lead and as average content in uncontaminated soils of the area were 81 6 and 19 5 mg kg 1 respectively martín et al 2015 have previously described the existence of areas where soil contamination persists of variable size and randomly dispersed in the upper part of the ggc and identifiable by the absence of vegetation which is hindered by the high concentration of contaminants as well as by the strong acidity and salinity the pb and as concentration measured were similar to those reported by paniagua lópez et al 2021 sierra et al 2019 and garcía carmona et al 2019a who also analyzed contaminated soils without vegetation located in the upper part of ggc due to the specific physicochemical conditions and the potential toxicity of the bare soils it is necessary to perform a deeper ecotoxicological risk assessment using not only short term test but also long term test to ensure the determination of risk for pb and as pollution for this reason the 6 bare soils were studied in comparison to uncontaminated soils near the area but not affected by the spill and 2 short term test and 1 long term test were performed basal heterotrophic respiration and root elongation bioassays confirmed toxic effect in bare soils with respiration rate and lettuce seed response being reduced by 6 and 9 times respectively compared to the selected soil control table 4 other studied in contaminated soils belonging also to the ggc without vegetation romero freire et al 2016a reported respiration rates lower than 0 5 μg co2 h 1 g 1 while in a similar studied paniagua lópez et al 2021 recorded values close to 1 μg co2 h 1 g 1 in the range of our results thus the heterotrophic respiration rate was shown to be a sensitive bioassay when contamination levels are high or edaphic conditions are extreme the results of the reduction in lettuce seed root elongation were also consistent with the literature which reports a reduction of around 90 with respect to the control romero freire et al 2016a garcía carmona et al 2017 paniagua lópez et al 2021 due to the toxicity detected in the bs highlighted by the absence of vegetation and the results obtained with the bioassays with l sativa and heterotrophic respiration the long term toxicity bioassay with earthworm e andrei was conducted to include an invertebrate species to complete the toxicity risk assessment romero freire et al 2015a indicated that these organisms are more susceptible to metal contamination than other soil invertebrates making them suitable organisms to be used as bioindicators to determine the toxicity of chemicals in soil and hence e andrei has been adopted as a standard organism for ecotoxicological testing by the european union eec european economic community 1984 in addition they grow easily under laboratory conditions have a high reproduction rate are sensitive to numerous contaminants and their size allows for easy handling nahmani et al 2007a thus making them a species of choice for ecotoxicological studies eec european economic community 1984 iso 2008 oecd organization for economic cooperation and development 2015 exposure of the earthworm to a pte can be either by ingestion of the contaminated soil or by dermal contact either route of exposure can cause death weight loss or impairment of their reproductive capacity hobbelen et al 2006 li et al 2008 kılıç 2011 leveque et al 2013 the earthworm mortality rate measured in contaminated and uncontaminated soils was not a good indicator of toxicity since earthworms survived in bs and control soils table 4 these results agree with nahmani et al 2007b which indicated the low sensitivity of this parameter in toxicity bioassays with earthworms in soils however it was observed that in bs the weight of earthworms after 4 weeks of exposition decreased 13 with a considerable difference when compared to the control soil us were earthworm gain weight 47 nevertheless we cannot be sure that this difference was exclusively due to the pb and as concentration of the contaminated soil since extreme soil conditions such as the very acidic ph of contaminated soils can also influence earthworm development garcía gómez et al 2014 aziz et al 2019 lorente casalini et al 2021 the reproductive capacity expressed as the percentage of juveniles with respect to those counted in the selected control soil proved to be a good indicator of toxicity since bs showed a very marked reduction in the juvenile population this parameter has shown great sensitivity in bioassays with different earthworm species in as contaminated soils garcía gómez et al 2014 romero freire et al 2015a romero freire et al 2017 according to the toxicity observed in the short term test and in the reproduction of the earthworm in the long term test there is some indicatives of the risk that pose the bs therefore it will be necessary further studies in this sense as a recreative area the human toxicity risk assessment should be necessary for ensure the safety of the ggc for the users 3 5 human health risk assessment of ggc soils soils contaminated with ptes may pose a risk to human health by direct ingestion of soils luo et al 2011 okorie et al 2011 inhalation of particles laidlaw and filippelli 2008 schmidt 2010 or dermal contact siciliano et al 2009 especially in residential areas or parks ljung et al 2007 luo et al 2012a luo et al 2012b the soils of ggc are currently intended for recreational use being an area for children and adults to enjoy walking or playing sports in nature however there are areas of the corridor where the guideline values established by the regional government of andalucía for ptes are exceeded as is the case of pb and as 275 and 36 mg kg 1 respectively so an assessment of the risks to human health is necessary to ensure the safety of recreational use of the ggc both pb and as are considered non essential elements that can pose a risk to human health when their concentration and bioavailability is high in soils kabata pendias 2010 nagajyoti et al 2010 especially in the case of prolonged exposures over time as they can trigger cardiovascular nervous system blood liver and bone diseases bhattacharya et al 2007 nriagu et al 2007 liu et al 2017 these elements can be transferred to water soil and plants and reach humans through the trophic chain or by direct ingestion posing a threat to human health bi et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to study the transfer of heavy metals from soil to humans both for human health risk assessment and pollution control liu et al 2017 to determine the risk of human toxicity from exposure to ggc soils individual hazard quotients for ingestion inhalation and dermal exposure for pb and as have been determined in all studied samples n 90 see si for more information the cumulative hazard index hi from exposure to ggc soils was calculated as the sum of the estimated risks for each of the exposure pathways depending on the exposed individual child or adult according to the methodology proposed by the usepa hi values 1 indicate that there is no potential risk of chronic toxicity from exposure to contaminated soils our results for adults showed hi values really lower than the unit both for pb and as hi 0 05 data not shown therefore from the results obtained for adults we can consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk in the case of the hi calculated for children pb showed hi also lower than one however we observed a potential risk assessment for the case of as in children fig 4 in bare soils 50 of the studies sites showed hi values higher than the unit whereas one studied site was also near the unit the hi for the soils belonged to the different soil types studied ss1 ss4 did not show values higher than the unit however hi where higher as near as the ss was to the mining dam fig 4 therefore from the results obtained we can consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk to human health for the recreational use to which it is currently dedicated despite exceeding the guideline values established by current regional legislation and only risk for children has been reported in the half part of the bare soils studied pecina et al 2021 advise against the development of recreational areas in heavily contaminated areas that have been reclaimed so a monitoring over time of the toxicity risks of these soils would be advisable especially due to the existence of areas of soils where residual contamination persist and where the hazard quotient obtained for as in children were higher and close to unity 4 conclusions twenty years after the aznalcóllar mine spill one of the most important mining accidents in europe in soils belonged to the affected area currently converted in a recreational area total soil concentrations of pb and as still exceeded the regional guideline values this study did a long term monitoring of the area in order to validate the state of soils after the remediation and to ensure the safety of the recreational use our results indicate that two decades after the accident most soils showed similar properties to the soils existing before the accident but there is still acidic soil with high salinity near the mine and randomly distributed as patches of bare soils with high pollution soils closed to the mine present a greater potential risk of toxicity for the ecosystem however there is also remobilization of as in soils distributed far away of the mine encouraged by the alkaline soil ph and therefore monitoring over time would be necessary although currently the human health risk assessment done in the most polluted soils of the region consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk to human health for the recreational use but we observed a potential risk for children due to arsenic the establishment of soil properties over time with the remobilization of as indicates that although the area is considered recovered the monitoring over time should be done for ensuring human safety because the elevated content in pb and as can be a chemical time bomb if the current soil properties changed in areas that remain contaminated and where vegetation does not grow it would be advisable to carry out remediation work to phytostabilize the area limiting the possible dispersion of pb and as to the rest of the ecosystem to this end organic amendments and liming should be applied to bare soils to correct their organic matter deficit and acidity together with the addition of iron rich amendments to prevent the increase in as solubility as the ph of these soils rises credit authorship contribution statement r p j conceptualization methodology soil sampling formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing m p l conceptualization investigation

1262,this study evaluates the potential toxicity of the soils of the guadiamar green corridor ggc affected by the aznalcóllar mine spill andalusia spain one of the most important mining accidents in europe in recent decades twenty years after the accident although the area is considered to be recovered residual contamination in soils persists and the bioavailability of some contaminants such as as is showing trends of increasing therefore the potential residual toxicity in 84 soil samples was evaluated by bioassays with lettuce latuca sativa l earthworms eisenia andrei and determining the microbial activity by basal respiration and metabolic quotient the selected soils sampled along the ggc were divided into 4 types according to their physicochemical properties in the closest part of the mine two soil types appear ss1 and ss2 originally decarbonated and loamy with a reduction in lettuce root elongation of 57 and 34 compared to the control as well as a the highest metabolic quotient 23 9 and 18 1 ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 respectively with the highest risk of pb and as toxicity while located in the middle and final part of the affected area of the spill ss3 and ss4 soils presented alkaline ph finer textures and the lowest metabolic quotient 9 5 ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 in addition due to pb and as exceeded the guideline values established in the studied area the human toxicity risk was determined according to us epa methodology although the total contents were higher than the guidelines established the obtained hazard quotients for both contaminants were less than one so the risk for human health was discarded however monitoring over time of the toxicity risks of the ggc soils would be advisable especially due to the existence of areas where residual contamination persist and soil hazard quotient obtained for as in children was higher and close to unity keywords toxicity risk metabolic quotient basal respiration exposure pathway bioassay potentially toxic element data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils may accumulate potentially toxic elements ptes that affect their ecosystem functions compromising their quality and the balance of the ecosystem s communities palma et al 2019 metal mining represents a potential pollution concern since it can cause emissions of ptes such as heavy metals and other associated elements like arsenic which can be mobilized within the soil plant water system and dispersed in the atmosphere and might have adverse impacts on human health of local citizens liu et al 2017 khelifi et al 2019 therefore mining companies and public administrations should assess the risk of pollution associated with extractive activities and promote prevention protection and decontamination measures to ensure the safety of our environment morales et al 2019 because they may represent potential health hazard from chronic and daily exposure to mine wastes enriched with toxic elements hamed et al 2022 there are numerous regulatory measures to limit emissions and to establish cleanup standards for ptes in soil which are generally based on the total soil concentration of these elements however total metal concentrations are poor predictors of toxicity lanno et al 2004 smolders et al 2009 with bioavailable concentrations being more accurate to use bioavailable concentrations indicate the amount of ptes that may be easier absorbed by organisms and can cause damage to the ecosystem and or enter to the trophic chain van gestel 2008 favas et al 2011 niemeyer et al 2015 son et al 2019 therefore when the guidelines are exceeded based on total soil concentrations complementary studies are necessary for environmental and human health toxicity risk assessment renaud et al 2017 martinez et al 2018 fajana et al 2020 to establish the toxicity risks in contaminated soil ecosystems toxicity bioassays should be performed which are effective tools to assess the actual level of contamination of soils in addition to providing relevant and objective information to regulate the land use as well as to plan remediation measures if needed gonzález et al 2011 garcía carmona et al 2017 the aznalcóllar mining accident is one of the most important mining accidents associated with metal mining worldwide nikolic et al 2011 the breakage of the tailing dam caused the spill of 0 9 hm3 of pyritic sludge and 3 6 hm3 of acidic water into the guadiamar river basin simón et al 2001 due to the nature of the wastes stored in the tailing dam the acidic water and the sludge spilled into the soils of the guadiamar river basin resulted in a severe contamination of the soils by ptes with significant total soil concentrations reached for as bi cd cu pb sb tl and zn alastuey et al 1999 cabrera et al 1999 simón et al 1999 given the magnitude of the accident and the high pollution observed in the soils affected by the spill the regional government of andalusia invested an enormous amount of human technical and economic resources for the recovery of the area which was finally declared a protected site currently known as the guadiamar river green corridor ggc cma 2003 thanks to remediation measures applied and the effect produced by the passage of 20 years for the stabilization of the affected area the total and bioavailable concentrations of many of the ptes have been reduced with the latest work in the area focusing mainly on those ptes that persist in higher concentrations such as pb as zn cu and cd madejón et al 2006 martín et al 2015 romero freire et al 2016a however despite the remediation work carried out in the area between 1998 and 2001 there are still soils in which the guideline values established for andalusia for total pb and as concentrations are exceeded pastor jáuregui et al 2021 approximately 7 of the area affected by the spill remains contaminated randomly distributed in heterometric patches easily identifiable by the absence of vegetation where soils are acidic with high salinity and high total and bioavailable concentration of ptes martín et al 2015 these contaminated patches stay due to deficiencies in the removal of sludge and cleaning tasks carried out shortly after the accident thus there has been a continuous oxidation of the sludge remains that persists throughout the soil profile simón et al 2008 it represents a risk of spreading contamination linked to erosion and or leaching as the soils are not stabilized by vegetation madejón et al 2006 therefore a long term monitoring of the remediation of contaminated soils is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures applied and the safety of the soils for this reason the objective of this work is to evaluate the toxicity risks of the soils affected by the toxic spill of the aznalcóllar mining accident twenty years after the accident and fifteen years since the establishment of the area as recovered and declared as a protected landscape 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the study area corresponds to the entire guadiamar green corridor ggc area affected by the toxic spill of the aznalcóllar mine andalusia spain which occurred in april 1998 it is located in the west of the province of seville between latitudes 37 30 and 37 00 north and longitudes 6 10 and 6 20 west covering a 45 km long and 500 m wide strip of irregular shape on both sides of the agrio and guadiamar riverbeds fig 1 the climate of the area is typically mediterranean characterized by hot dry summers and cold wet winters according to the data of the agro climatic station of the andalusian institute for agricultural fisheries and food research and training the average annual temperature is 18 3 c and the annual rainfall is 490 mm with an evapotranspiration coefficient of 920 mm considering the last 20 years 2001 2021 a total of 84 plots 10 10 m homogeneously randomly distributed along the ggc were sampled collecting composite samples at 0 10 cm depth to obtain a representative sample every 100 m2 satellite images fig si 1 were used to identify contaminated areas where remediation efforts were insufficient and which 20 years after the mining accident can be identified by the absence of vegetation according to that in addition of the 84 sampling points 6 patches without vegetation where pollution persists were randomly selected in the area closest to the mine and composite samples were also taken from the top 10 cm of soil 2 2 soil properties and pollutant concentrations all soil samples were bagged in the field identified and homogenized once transferred to the laboratory they were dried at room temperature and sieved 2 mm soil texture was determined by the robinson pipette method usda united states department of agriculture 1972 calcium carbonate content caco3 by volumetric method barahona 1984 soil ph was measured in water in a ratio 1 2 5 with a 914 ph conductometer

prepared to determine the electrical conductivity ec using a eutech con700 conductivity meter field capacity was measured according to richards 1945 the total soil concentrations of the studied ptes pb and as were analyzed in finely ground samples by x ray fluorescence xrf with a portable niton xl3t 980 goldd analyzer niton billerica usa the precision and accuracy of this method was performed based on the measurement with 6 replicates of a certified reference material crm 052 050 rt corporation limited salisbury uk obtaining the following results certified vs measured mean values in mg kg

samples ss1 ss4 and the 6 bares soils bs taken along the ggc two different short term assays were performed 1 a bioassay of germination and root elongation was performed with lactuca sativa l usepa 1996 in petri dishes a filter paper with 5 ml of soil water extract 1 5 were incubated with 20 seeds of l sativa l at 25 1 c for 5 days after that the of germinated seed and the length of the roots of the germinated seeds were recorded as control same procedure was done with distilled water in triplicate the percentage of root elongation was calculated in comparison with the control samples from 0 maximum toxicity to 100 no toxicity 2 a second assay determined the i basal heterotrophic respiration rate ii microbial carbon and iii metabolic coefficient following adapted iso 17155 iso 2012 and oecd 2000 protocols around 5 g of soil at field moisture capacity were placed with 2 ml of koh 0 2 in a sy lab μ trac 4200 respirometer samples were incubated at 25 c for 96 h and after that i mean basal heterotrophic respiration rate μg co2 h 1 gsoil 1 was obtained microbial biomass carbon ii μg cmicrob g csuelo 1 was quantified using the irradiation incubation method according to ferreira et al 1999 part of the soil microorganisms were removed by electromagnetic irradiation by microwave heating and then the soil was incubated for 10 days at 28 c and the amount of co2 released after incubation was measured in the same equipment the metabolic quotient iii qco2 was obtained as the ratio between i and ii expressed as ng cco2 μg cmicrob 1 h 1 according to anderson and domsch 1993 higher values of the metabolic coefficient indicate elevated stress conditions for soil microbial communities nielsen and winding 2002 in addition in the 4 bare soils bs sampled in the areas where the pollution persists the evaluation of toxicity was performed by a long term toxicity test with earthworms eisenia andrei oecd organization for economic cooperation and development 2015 to determine soil toxicity a control soil was sampled in the vicinity of the contaminated area but outside the boundaries of the ggc thus ensuring that the soil was unaffected by the spill table si 1 summarizing containers with 500 g of moistened to field capacity soil were placed with five pre acclimatized weighed adult earthworms and incubated at 20 c with 14 h of light per day for 4 weeks to feed the earthworms wet horse manure drug free was added to each container and weekly moisture content and food requirements were monitored after these 4 weeks mortality rate and weight variation average difference in the weight of earthworms at 4 weeks in relation to their initial weight were recorded soils containing cocoons were incubated again for another 4 weeks at same conditions and at the end of these 4 weeks the containers were placed in a water bath 60 2 c to force the juveniles to come up to the surface and to count the number of hatchlings present in each sample the of survival and weight variation compared to the beginning of the experiment and the of juveniles compared to the control samples were calculated 2 4 human health risk assessment the potential human health risk for pb and as for children and adults in the ggc was estimated based on models proposed by the usepa 2017a and usepa 2017b from the calculation of the hazard quotient hq considering exposure pathways by ingestion inhalation and dermal contact in the studied soil samples to determine the hq by ingestion soil samples were digested simulating gastric digestion according to usepa 2017a summarizing 1 g of soil dried and sieved at 150 μm was shaken and incubated during 1 h at 37 c with 100 ml of extraction fluid 0 4 m glycine adjusted ph 1 50 after that supernatant was separated from the sample by filtration and analyzed for total pb and as concentration by icp ms spectroscopy the hq by inhalation in soil samples sieved at 50 μm according to the procedure described in islam et al 2016 were measured the hq by dermal contact were calculated from the finely ground samples according to the standard procedure usepa united states environmental protection agency 2004 the total soil concentration of pb and as for inhalation and dermal contact risk assessment were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf finally the human health risk assessment was estimated as the cumulative hazard index hi for children and for adults by dividing the average daily potential dose of the three exposure routes mg kg 1 day 1 by the chronic reference dose of the three routes mg kg 1 day 1 usepa 1989 when hi is higher than 1 it is considered that there may be a risk to human health the parameter values the reference values and the equations used for estimating human exposure to pb and as in this study are presented in si 2 5 statistical analysis prior to the statistical treatment of the data the normal distribution test kolmogorov smirnov was performed and the homogeneity of variances was tested using the levene test the data were analyzed with the comparison of means test anova and homogeneous subsets were performed using tukey s test determining significant differences between

fig si 2 soils ss1 n 9 and ss2 n 11 are located in the upper part of the ggc closest to the mine and are loamy textured soils not or slightly carbonated neutral or slightly acidic ph and show some salinity table 1 in contrast soils ss3 n 25 and ss4 n 39 are randomly located in the middle and lower sector of the ggc and are alkaline carbonated and fine textured soils two decades after the accident and after the cleaning and soil amendment work completed in 2001 the soils show similar properties to the soils existing before the accident described by simón et al 1999 as acid soils not or slightly carbonated and with loam to sandy loam texture in the sector near the mine this coincides with soils ss1 and ss2 while in the middle and lower part of the ggc the soils were neutral to slightly alkaline with carbonate contents above 5 and textures varying between clay loam loam and silty clay bare soils bs are extremely acidic and showed low ph and high ec properties that along with the presence of pollutants are a clear consequence of the continued contamination process and or as a result of the rapid and deficient first extensive cleanup operation that mixed the tailings with the soil in depth simón et al 2008 garcía carmona et al 2019a low carbonate contents are influenced by the acidic ph of the bs whereas the topsoil removed during the clean up in 1999 and the absence of vegetation over time in the bs is reflected in the low oc values observed the soils affected by the spill greatly increased in acidity in many cases reaching values below ph 4 aguilar et al 2004 due to the acidity of the water ph 5 cabrera et al 1999 and of the pyrite sludge which given its heterogeneity ranged from ph 4 1 to ph 5 1 simón et al 1999 the acidification of soils was aggravated by the oxidation of the sludge at the surface and even continued after the sludge removal tasks by sludge debris trapped in the soil cracks dorronsoro et al 2002 the oxidation of the sulphides involves oxidation hydrolysis and hydration processes that stumm and morgan 1981 summarized in eq 1 1 fes 2 3 75 o 2 3 5h 2 o fe oh 3 2h 2 so 4 this reaction starts with the release of fe2 and under oxidizing conditions is converted into fe3 when soil ph is above 4 5 then fe3 precipitate as iron hydroxide and the ph becomes more acidic eq 2 2 fe 3 3h 2 o fe oh 3 3h however when soil ph remains under 4 5 the fe3 can oxidize the pyrite this reaction is faster and can generate more acidity eq 3 3 fes 2 14 fe 3 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 2so 4 2 16 h the continued oxidation of the sulfides contained in the sludge significantly increased the soluble sulfate content of the soil leading to a sharp increase in soil salinity which over time has been significantly reduced especially in the most carbonated area which coincides with the ss3 and ss4 soils despite the positive evolution of the ph and salinity of the ggc soils acidic soils with high salinity ss1 are still detected located in the area closest to the mine these results agree with aguilar et al 2007 simón et al 2008 and martín et al 2015 which indicated the persistence of residual contamination in punctual areas of the corridor the carbonate content was significantly higher in ss3 and ss4 compared to ss1 and ss2 even though with the liming measures the doses of carbonates applied in the upper part of the ggc were higher 60 90 t ha 1 ss1 and ss2 compared to 20 t ha 1 applied in other areas soils ss1 and ss2 closer to the mine and originally decarbonated received a greater contribution of sludge after the accident and much of the added carbonate was consumed in the neutralization of acidity in general the recovery of the soils allowed the development of dense vegetation along the ggc which contributes a significant amount of organic matter to the soil reaching average contents higher than those reported by simón et al 1999 in the agricultural soils of the area before the accident and without significant differences in the oc content for the 4 studied soil types 3 2 concentration of pb and as in studied soil samples after the aznalcóllar mining accident the soils were seriously contaminated by heavy metals and associated elements the main soil contaminants spread in the area were as cd cu sb pb tl and zn simón et al 1999 two decades after the accident pb and as still show total soil concentrations above the guideline values established by the regional government of andalusia pastor jáuregui et al 2020 fig 2 shows the pb and as total concentrations in the four soil types considered in the ggc and for the studied bare soils bs in the ss1 and bs total pb exceeded in 89 of the studied sampling points the pb guideline value 275 mg kg 1 whilst in the ss2 ss3 and ss4 10 of the studied sampling points showed values higher for the case of as the established guideline value 36 mg kg 1 was exceeding in all sampling points of ss1 and bs in more than the 70 of sampling points of ss2 and ss4 and in 44 of the sampling points of ss3 in ss1 soils n 9 the persistence of higher total pb and as concentrations coincide with more acidic soils with higher salinity which martín et al 2008 and otero et al 2012 relate to more contaminated soils due to the formation of soluble sulfates by the oxidation of the sludge ss2 soils n 11 although sharing their geographic distribution in the ggc show significantly lower total pb and as concentrations similar to those reported by romero freire et al 2016a sierra et al 2019 and garcía carmona et al 2019b in soils that are considered recovered within the same area of the ggc soils ss3 n 25 and ss4 n 39 show in general lower total pb and as concentrations than ss2 but are only statistically significant with respect to ss1 table 2 since pb and as are elements considered not very mobile garcía carmona et al 2019a there is no expectation that the total concentration of these elements will decrease over time in addition the average annual rainfall in the area is 490 mm over the last 20 years with a trend towards greater aridity so the risk of pb and as leaching is limited on the other hand the natural vegetation in the area is mainly herbaceous so that pb and as assimilated by plants is recycled back to the soil according to the water soluble concentration pbs and ass we observed that values did not show significant differences for the case of pb while the ass was higher in the ss4 section table 2 the presence of calcium carbonate in all soil samples can produce the precipitation of pb at acidic phs which can support the low pb solubility observed in the studied soil samples simón et al 2005 garcía carmona et al 2017 lead is known as a very immobile element in soils with mineral content and type ph and organic matter being the most important factors determining pb sorption in soils kabata pendias 2010 romero freire et al 2015a garcía carmona et al 2017 the observed properties of the different sectors table 1 can be the responsible of the low water soluble pb concentration the water soluble as concentration has increased considerably in 2018 in ss4 0 10 mg kg 1 with respect to the concentrations reported by martín et al 2015 and romero freire et al 2016a in soils recovered from the middle and final part of ggc analyzed in 2013 0 01 and 0 07 mg kg 1 respectively even authors such as sierra et al 2019 or paniagua lópez et al 2021 report soluble as concentrations in soils recovered from the ggc of 0 15 and 0 24 mg kg 1 respectively when in 2004 the water soluble as concentration reported by martín peinado 2001 were 0 006 mg kg 1 in the middle and final part of the ggc the increase in water solubility of as in ss4 may be related to the naturalization of the soils in the middle and final part of the ggc where the recovery of the vegetation was faster after the remediation measures applied until 2001 the ss4 soils are the ones that presented the highest organic matter content although without reaching significant differences however the rapid development of vegetation has given rise to a supply of organic matter that promote interactions between the organic matter and as forms partially explaining the generally greater mobility of as in this natural environment wang and mulligan 2006 report that soil organic matter can increase as water solubility through competition for available adsorption sites formation of aqueous complexes and or changes in the redox potential of site surfaces and as redox speciation another factor that determines the mobility of as is its affinity for fe oxy hydroxides since under oxic conditions arsenic exists mainly in as v oxidation state as the arsenate oxyanion haso4 2 h2aso4 al abed et al 2007 this adsorption affinity is higher for as v at lower ph values ranging from 4 to 7 pierce and moore 1982 and in this sense simón et al 2010 indicates the importance of not exceeding ph values 6 5 when remediation tasks in as contaminated soils are carried out since it can lead to an increase in its solubility the bioaccessible pb content pbe showed interesting results because although lower total pb content was observed far from the upper part of the ggc closest to the mine the pbe higher values were observed in the ss4 ss3 ss2 with significant differences garcía carmona et al 2019a reported edta extractable pb concentrations in the ggc recovered soils even higher than ours and correlated with the higher carbonate content in this sense simón et al 2005 reported that pb co precipitate with fe coating the surface of carbonates that were used as an amendment in ggc soils and the quantity precipitated decreased at ph 6 5 castro larragoitia et al 2013 and armienta et al 2016 also reported that calcium carbonate soils have a neutralization potential that influences the availability of pb that is why ss2 ss4 soils due to its carbonate content and alkaline ph showed low water soluble pb concentration while edta extractable pb is high due to the strong chelating ability of the edta extracting pb from carbonate which is difficult to release owing to the stronger ionic bonding wang et al 2021 in the case of ase there were not significant differences between soil types and only in the bs high contents of ase were observed 3 3 toxicity assessment and soil properties the performance of bioassays in contaminated areas allows estimating the real ecotoxicological risk of soils under natural conditions fernández et al 2006 ecotoxicity tests are key tools in the study of the fate and bioavailability and to assess the potential ecotoxicological effects of metals as well as their possible transfer to the other compartments such as groundwater or even their transfer to the food chain the use of biological tests is essential for determining the potential ecological risk of soil contamination to organisms and ecosystems depending on the potentially toxic element ptes present in the soil it may produce toxicity in one specific organism and not in others matejczyk et al 2011 baderna et al 2015 for this reason in soils with multi elemental contamination it is difficult to attribute toxic effects to one specific element due to possible synergies or antagonisms between them spurgeon and hopkin 1995 this justifies the need to use bioassays with different organisms to obtain a reliable ecotoxicological risk assessment romero freire et al 2016a garcía carmona et al 2019a moreover it is recommendable to use different bioassays with both liquid and solid phase to assess soil toxicity in a more reliable way due to organisms can interact with soil particles and liquid soil components farré and barceló 2003 martín et al 2010 for the evaluation of the ecotoxicological risk of the ggc soils bioassays were performed in liquid phase with lactuca sativa l and in solid phase by determining the rate of heterotrophic respiration and establishing the stress degree of soil microorganisms through the metabolic quotient qco2 which expresses the ratio between respiration rate and microbial biomass of the soil table 3 the liquid phase bioassay with lactuca sativa l has been recommended by many international organizations for the determination of ecological effects of toxic substances and for toxicity testing escoto et al 2007 lyu et al 2018 as it is simple fast reliable inexpensive and does not require expensive equipment the germination rate of lettuce seeds from ss1 soils was significantly lower than that of the other soil types considered while root elongation was significantly lower in ss1 and ss2 soil types with respect to ss3 and ss4 types that did not present toxicity in this bioassay root elongation was therefore a more sensitive measure of toxicity than germination rate results that agreed with those reported in the literature bagur gonzález et al 2011 our results for soils ss1 and ss2 were consistent with those reported by romero freire et al 2016a from studies performed in the same area with a percentage of root elongation in soils close to the mine slightly below 60 whereas in soils in the middle and distal third of the ggc an elongation of 70 was reported compared to values close to 100 obtained in soils ss3 and ss4 which can indicate a reduction in toxicity over time heterotrophic soil respiration is related to soil fertility and soil quality iso 2012 niemeyer et al 2012 contamination may quantitatively and qualitatively affect soil microorganisms stefanowicz et al 2008 shukurov et al 2014 and the processes in which they are involved such as their role in soil nutrient cycling and in the processes of mineralization and synthesis of organic compounds moreno et al 2009 nwachukwu and pulford 2011 decreased microbial activity due to the presence of contaminants in the soil causes a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide produced so it can be used as an indicator of stress on microbial communities dai et al 2004 azarbad et al 2013 basal heterotrophic respiration data measured in the ggc did not show significant differences between the different soil types considered in fact there is controversy over the use of respiration rate as an indicator of contamination wakelin et al 2010 and zornoza et al 2015 found no correlation between respiration rate and potential toxicity while dinesh et al 2012 and romero freire et al 2016b reported a positive correlation between respiration and degree of contamination in contrast ss1 soils showed the highest heterotrophic respiration rate and the greatest total as and pb soil concentrations however the heterotrophic respiration rate alone was not conclusive for the evaluation of toxicity in the ggc soils analyzed since they showed different degrees of contamination that resulted in a high dispersion of respiration rates microbial biomass is another biological indicator that provides information on soil quality and its response to the incorporation of contaminants or to the application of amendment measures since microorganisms respond faster to these changes than to changes in soil physicochemical properties nannipieri et al 2017 oijagbe et al 2019 as a consequence of the exposure of soil microbiota to potential toxic elements the microbial biomass can be reduced due to cell death caused by the alteration of essential functions or by an unaffordable increase in vital energy cost akmal and jianming 2009 oijagbe et al 2019 soils in the ss3 and ss4 showed a significantly higher microbial biomass content than ss1 and ss2 soils nearly twice their value these results agree with those obtained from the lettuce bioassay showing signs of toxicity in ss1 and ss2 soils the metabolic quotient qco2 is perhaps the most widely used index to evaluate the efficiency of energy use by soil microorganisms it is usually correlated with an increase in biodiversity and ecosystem maturity and has been used to compare the impact that seasonal changes management systems addition of metals agrochemicals and xenobiotics have on soil microorganisms paolini 2018 the qco2 allows diagnosing the efficiency of microbial biomass in soil carbon use in terms of respiration expenditure anderson and domsch 1990 according to this index in ss1 microorganisms would be subject to higher stress compared to the other soil types coinciding with more limiting edaphic conditions in terms of salinity and acidity and higher total soil concentration of pb and as under unfavorable conditions microorganisms require more energy to maintain biomass and therefore qco2 increases and carbon is lost as co2 insam and domsch 1988 which may justify the higher respiration rate and lower microbial biomass content in ss1 soils where qco2 is significantly higher this circumstance may be indicative of a change in the structure and diversity of microbial populations in contaminated soils with respect to natural soils since microorganisms are able to develop resistance and resilience to certain ptes allison and martiny 2008 hänsch and emmerling 2010 in this sense paniagua lópez et al 2021 described differences between contaminated and recovered soils in the same area in terms of gene copy number microbial biodiversity shanon index and bacterial community structure at the genus level the principal components analysis of the 84 soil samples along the ggc includes the soil properties analyzed the total water soluble and bioavailable pb and as concentration and the bioassays grouped into two components that explain 49 of the variance fig 3 the total soil concentration of pb and as is directly related to the soils where the salinity and acidity are higher and the soils are not or slightly carbonated this trend is strongly marked by the ss1 soils which are the most contaminated and in which a higher qco2 is recorded furthermore pca component 1 groups the heterotrophic respiration rate the microbial biomass the root elongation with the ph and the carbonate content of the soil which are higher in soils with lower total concentration of pb and as pca component 2 inversely relates the water soluble concentrations of pb and as with the germination rate of the lettuce seed while the edta extractable concentration of pb and as considered to be bioavailable in the long term labanowski et al 2008 hurdebise et al 2015 is not grouped with any of the variables considered the root elongation bioassay compared to the metabolic coefficient has been shown to be more sensitive to contamination possibly due to the limitation of basal respiration as an indicator of soil toxicity in fact the sensitivity of the lettuce seed root elongation bioassay is widely recognized in the literature as an effective tool for ecotoxicological risk assessment martín et al 2010 lors et al 2011 romero freire et al 2014 romero freire et al 2015b garcía carmona et al 2019b hong et al 2021 from the bioassays it can be concluded that the ss1 soils are the ones that present a greater potential risk of toxicity for the ecosystem due to the high content of pb and as related to the soil acidity and the absence or low content of carbonates however carbonated soils especially ss4 in which the recovery of the vegetation was denser and faster can promote the remobilization of as due to the increase in the soil organic matter and this increase in the as solubility can be encouraged by the moderately alkaline soil ph therefore monitoring over time would be advisable to assess the evolution of the ecotoxicological risk of the ggc soils 3 4 ecotoxicological risk assessment of bare soils in the six contaminated areas selected in this work bare soils bs the average ph was 3 5 and the electrical conductivity was 3 1 ds m 1 table 1 in these bs total pb and as concentration were higher than the other sampling points table 2 and 10 times higher than adjacent soils that were not affected by the toxic spill lead and as average content in uncontaminated soils of the area were 81 6 and 19 5 mg kg 1 respectively martín et al 2015 have previously described the existence of areas where soil contamination persists of variable size and randomly dispersed in the upper part of the ggc and identifiable by the absence of vegetation which is hindered by the high concentration of contaminants as well as by the strong acidity and salinity the pb and as concentration measured were similar to those reported by paniagua lópez et al 2021 sierra et al 2019 and garcía carmona et al 2019a who also analyzed contaminated soils without vegetation located in the upper part of ggc due to the specific physicochemical conditions and the potential toxicity of the bare soils it is necessary to perform a deeper ecotoxicological risk assessment using not only short term test but also long term test to ensure the determination of risk for pb and as pollution for this reason the 6 bare soils were studied in comparison to uncontaminated soils near the area but not affected by the spill and 2 short term test and 1 long term test were performed basal heterotrophic respiration and root elongation bioassays confirmed toxic effect in bare soils with respiration rate and lettuce seed response being reduced by 6 and 9 times respectively compared to the selected soil control table 4 other studied in contaminated soils belonging also to the ggc without vegetation romero freire et al 2016a reported respiration rates lower than 0 5 μg co2 h 1 g 1 while in a similar studied paniagua lópez et al 2021 recorded values close to 1 μg co2 h 1 g 1 in the range of our results thus the heterotrophic respiration rate was shown to be a sensitive bioassay when contamination levels are high or edaphic conditions are extreme the results of the reduction in lettuce seed root elongation were also consistent with the literature which reports a reduction of around 90 with respect to the control romero freire et al 2016a garcía carmona et al 2017 paniagua lópez et al 2021 due to the toxicity detected in the bs highlighted by the absence of vegetation and the results obtained with the bioassays with l sativa and heterotrophic respiration the long term toxicity bioassay with earthworm e andrei was conducted to include an invertebrate species to complete the toxicity risk assessment romero freire et al 2015a indicated that these organisms are more susceptible to metal contamination than other soil invertebrates making them suitable organisms to be used as bioindicators to determine the toxicity of chemicals in soil and hence e andrei has been adopted as a standard organism for ecotoxicological testing by the european union eec european economic community 1984 in addition they grow easily under laboratory conditions have a high reproduction rate are sensitive to numerous contaminants and their size allows for easy handling nahmani et al 2007a thus making them a species of choice for ecotoxicological studies eec european economic community 1984 iso 2008 oecd organization for economic cooperation and development 2015 exposure of the earthworm to a pte can be either by ingestion of the contaminated soil or by dermal contact either route of exposure can cause death weight loss or impairment of their reproductive capacity hobbelen et al 2006 li et al 2008 kılıç 2011 leveque et al 2013 the earthworm mortality rate measured in contaminated and uncontaminated soils was not a good indicator of toxicity since earthworms survived in bs and control soils table 4 these results agree with nahmani et al 2007b which indicated the low sensitivity of this parameter in toxicity bioassays with earthworms in soils however it was observed that in bs the weight of earthworms after 4 weeks of exposition decreased 13 with a considerable difference when compared to the control soil us were earthworm gain weight 47 nevertheless we cannot be sure that this difference was exclusively due to the pb and as concentration of the contaminated soil since extreme soil conditions such as the very acidic ph of contaminated soils can also influence earthworm development garcía gómez et al 2014 aziz et al 2019 lorente casalini et al 2021 the reproductive capacity expressed as the percentage of juveniles with respect to those counted in the selected control soil proved to be a good indicator of toxicity since bs showed a very marked reduction in the juvenile population this parameter has shown great sensitivity in bioassays with different earthworm species in as contaminated soils garcía gómez et al 2014 romero freire et al 2015a romero freire et al 2017 according to the toxicity observed in the short term test and in the reproduction of the earthworm in the long term test there is some indicatives of the risk that pose the bs therefore it will be necessary further studies in this sense as a recreative area the human toxicity risk assessment should be necessary for ensure the safety of the ggc for the users 3 5 human health risk assessment of ggc soils soils contaminated with ptes may pose a risk to human health by direct ingestion of soils luo et al 2011 okorie et al 2011 inhalation of particles laidlaw and filippelli 2008 schmidt 2010 or dermal contact siciliano et al 2009 especially in residential areas or parks ljung et al 2007 luo et al 2012a luo et al 2012b the soils of ggc are currently intended for recreational use being an area for children and adults to enjoy walking or playing sports in nature however there are areas of the corridor where the guideline values established by the regional government of andalucía for ptes are exceeded as is the case of pb and as 275 and 36 mg kg 1 respectively so an assessment of the risks to human health is necessary to ensure the safety of recreational use of the ggc both pb and as are considered non essential elements that can pose a risk to human health when their concentration and bioavailability is high in soils kabata pendias 2010 nagajyoti et al 2010 especially in the case of prolonged exposures over time as they can trigger cardiovascular nervous system blood liver and bone diseases bhattacharya et al 2007 nriagu et al 2007 liu et al 2017 these elements can be transferred to water soil and plants and reach humans through the trophic chain or by direct ingestion posing a threat to human health bi et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to study the transfer of heavy metals from soil to humans both for human health risk assessment and pollution control liu et al 2017 to determine the risk of human toxicity from exposure to ggc soils individual hazard quotients for ingestion inhalation and dermal exposure for pb and as have been determined in all studied samples n 90 see si for more information the cumulative hazard index hi from exposure to ggc soils was calculated as the sum of the estimated risks for each of the exposure pathways depending on the exposed individual child or adult according to the methodology proposed by the usepa hi values 1 indicate that there is no potential risk of chronic toxicity from exposure to contaminated soils our results for adults showed hi values really lower than the unit both for pb and as hi 0 05 data not shown therefore from the results obtained for adults we can consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk in the case of the hi calculated for children pb showed hi also lower than one however we observed a potential risk assessment for the case of as in children fig 4 in bare soils 50 of the studies sites showed hi values higher than the unit whereas one studied site was also near the unit the hi for the soils belonged to the different soil types studied ss1 ss4 did not show values higher than the unit however hi where higher as near as the ss was to the mining dam fig 4 therefore from the results obtained we can consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk to human health for the recreational use to which it is currently dedicated despite exceeding the guideline values established by current regional legislation and only risk for children has been reported in the half part of the bare soils studied pecina et al 2021 advise against the development of recreational areas in heavily contaminated areas that have been reclaimed so a monitoring over time of the toxicity risks of these soils would be advisable especially due to the existence of areas of soils where residual contamination persist and where the hazard quotient obtained for as in children were higher and close to unity 4 conclusions twenty years after the aznalcóllar mine spill one of the most important mining accidents in europe in soils belonged to the affected area currently converted in a recreational area total soil concentrations of pb and as still exceeded the regional guideline values this study did a long term monitoring of the area in order to validate the state of soils after the remediation and to ensure the safety of the recreational use our results indicate that two decades after the accident most soils showed similar properties to the soils existing before the accident but there is still acidic soil with high salinity near the mine and randomly distributed as patches of bare soils with high pollution soils closed to the mine present a greater potential risk of toxicity for the ecosystem however there is also remobilization of as in soils distributed far away of the mine encouraged by the alkaline soil ph and therefore monitoring over time would be necessary although currently the human health risk assessment done in the most polluted soils of the region consider that the ggc soils do not represent a potential risk to human health for the recreational use but we observed a potential risk for children due to arsenic the establishment of soil properties over time with the remobilization of as indicates that although the area is considered recovered the monitoring over time should be done for ensuring human safety because the elevated content in pb and as can be a chemical time bomb if the current soil properties changed in areas that remain contaminated and where vegetation does not grow it would be advisable to carry out remediation work to phytostabilize the area limiting the possible dispersion of pb and as to the rest of the ecosystem to this end organic amendments and liming should be applied to bare soils to correct their organic matter deficit and acidity together with the addition of iron rich amendments to prevent the increase in as solubility as the ph of these soils rises credit authorship contribution statement r p j conceptualization methodology soil sampling formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing m p l conceptualization investigation

1263,the use of electrokinetics ek has great potential to deliver reactants in impervious porous media thus overcoming some of the challenges in the remediation of contaminants trapped in low permeability zones in this work we experimentally investigate electrokinetic transport in heterogeneous porous media consisting of a sandy matrix with a target clay inclusion we demonstrate the efficient ek delivery of permanganate in the target clay zone transport velocity 0 3 0 5 m day 1 and its reactivity with methylene blue a positively charged contaminant trapped within the inclusion the delivery method was optimized using a kh2po4 k2hpo4 buffer to attenuate the effect of electrolysis reactions in the electrode chambers thus mitigating the propagation of ph fronts and preventing the phenomenon of permanganate stalling the experiments showed that the buffer electrical conductivity greatly impacts the potential gradient in the heterogeneous porous medium with implications on the observed rates of electrokinetic transport variation up to 40 the reactive experiments provided direct evidence of the permanganate penetration within the clay and of its capability to degrade the target immobilized contaminant the experimental results were analyzed using a process based model elucidating the governing transport mechanisms and highlighting the effect of different mass transfer processes on conservative and reactive electrokinetic transport graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrokinetic remediation experiments in heterogeneous porous media clayey zones coulombic interactions reactive transport modeling data availability most data are already available in supplementary material additional data can be made available on request 1 introduction different technologies have been developed for in situ remediation of contaminated aquifers based on the injection and mixing of reactive amendments khan et al 2004 kitanidis and mccarty 2012 rolle and le borgne 2019 tosco et al 2014 among these techniques in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ chemical reduction iscr showed good performances for the remediation of a wide variety of organic and inorganic contaminants ludwig et al 2007 romero et al 2009 siegrist et al 2011 tratnyek et al 2014 however the reactant delivery in the subsurface typically performed by hydraulic injection is limited by the presence of low permeability zones which can strongly impact the flow field and impair the distribution of the reactants chen et al 2022 guo and brusseau 2017 velimirovic et al 2020 moreover pollutants diffusing in low permeability layers and inclusions can be trapped over long time scales and potentially act as secondary contamination sources slow contaminant release by back diffusion is indeed often responsible for the persistence of groundwater plumes casasso et al 2021 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 parker et al 2008 and for long remediation times kueper et al 2014 sethi and di molfetta 2019 therefore achieving a complete and fast delivery of reactants in low permeability zones can greatly enhance the effectiveness of remediation technologies and improve the quality of groundwater in many contaminated sites palma et al 2020 reddy and cameselle 2009 wu et al 2013 electrokinetic techniques have the potential to deliver both charged and uncharged species in low permeability porous media gill et al 2016 gill et al 2015 inglis et al 2021 lima et al 2017 reynolds et al 2008 sprocati et al 2020 wu et al 2012 applications have been proposed to mobilize and remove inorganic contaminants kim et al 2009 2012 li et al 2011 li et al 1996 reddy et al 2001 ribeiro and mexia 1997 as well as to enhance the chemical and biological degradation or organic compounds cappello et al 2019 czinnerová et al 2020 head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 thepsithar and roberts 2006 wick et al 2004 upon the application of a direct current electric field charged species migrate towards the electrode of opposite polarity as a result of electromigration acar and alshawabkeh 1993 appelo 2017 reddy and cameselle 2009 sprocati and rolle 2022 simultaneously an electroosmotic flow is generated from the transport of the positively charged species around the negatively charged surfaces which induces drag forces resulting in the movement of water towards the cathode acar et al 1995 newman and thomas alyea 2012 vane and zang 1997 despite the promise of electrokinetics for subsurface applications several challenges are still open and need careful investigation for instance in absence of adequate buffering strategies to promptly neutralize alkaline and acidic species produced by electrolysis reactions ph fronts can form and propagate in porous media alshawabkeh 2009 cherepy and wildenschild 2003 zhang et al 2020 causing the stalling of delivered amendments a first cause of this behavior is determined by the alteration in conductivity and surface charge of the porous medium the latter with heavier impact on clay materials determined by the ph variations ultimately affecting the electroosmotic flow and the overall electrokinetic mobility acar and alshawabkeh 1993 alshawabkeh 2009 newman and thomas alyea 2012 a second effect is a consumption of permanganate which is unstable outside the 3 5 12 ph range hence advancing acidic and alkaline fronts promote permanganate transformation to mn2 and mno2 respectively hodges et al 2013 reynolds et al 2008 roach 2006 which are inactive species in the remediation process additionally the migration of ph fronts from the electrode reservoirs in the porous medium can induce leaching of contaminants such as heavy metals from the solid matrix iannelli et al 2015 masi et al 2017 reddy et al 2001 most experimental investigation of electrokinetic transport and reactivity in the subsurface has been performed in homogeneous porous media whereas only a few contributions have studied the effects of heterogeneity during electrokinetic transport and reactant delivery chowdhury et al 2017b chowdhury et al 2017a gill et al 2016 sprocati and rolle 2022 furthermore previous experimental work was performed with mobile contaminants chowdhury et al 2017b thepsithar and roberts 2006 that were also subject to electroosmotic mobilization from the clay during the ek delivery of amendments cameselle et al 2021 this study investigates the electrokinetic transport of a charged species in heterogeneous porous media composed of a clay inclusion embedded in a sandy matrix experiments were performed to explore both conservative and reactive transport in the heterogeneous sandy clayey domain using potassium permanganate a strong oxidant widely employed in wastewater and groundwater remediation chang et al 2006 liang et al 2014 schnarr et al 1998 in a first set of conservative experiments potassium permanganate a negatively charged strong oxidant was delivered in the heterogeneous domain we investigated the displacement of permanganate in the sand and clay zones as well as the impact of hydrochemical conditions such as the concentration of the buffer used in the electrode chambers for ph stabilization we also performed a reactive experiment focusing on the degradation of an organic contaminant methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion where it is sorbed to the negatively charged clay surfaces and thus it is not mobilized by the induced electroosmotic flow the dynamics of permanganate transport and the reaction with the sorbed organic contaminant were analyzed using a process based model in order to identify and elucidate the governing mechanisms controlling electrokinetic conservative and reactive transport in the heterogeneous porous media 2 materials and methods the experimental setup consisted of a squared pvc column with inner dimension of 240 23 23 mm3 l w h schematically illustrated in fig 1 two honeycomb separators covered with a high density polyethylene filter mesh size 150 μm were installed to delimitate a central section and two lateral chambers the inner section with size 120 23 23 mm3 and an open top was filled with the porous media with a central clay inclusion of size 27 23 23 mm3 embedded within two sand zones of size 47 23 23 mm3 the sandy porous medium gebrüder dorfner gmbh co was silica sand grain size 0 3 0 8 mm porosity n 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity

gill et al 2020 reynolds et al 2008 roach 2006 and in the same order of magnitude of first field applications head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 mena et al 2016 wu et al 2013 even though the latter are typically conducted with lower voltages the two electrode chambers equipped with a vent port to expel the gases produced by electrolysis were filled with a phosphate buffer solution also referred as buffer electrolyte kh2po4 k2hpo4 at ph 6 8 to a water level of 18 mm a water table lower than the upper edge of the porous medium was used to prevent the formation of a surface water layer which would cause a preferential pathway for the electric current in the system each electrode chamber was stirred and the electrolytes recirculated with a larger 1 5 l reservoir to enhance the ph buffering capacity of the system the recirculation system also allowed maintaining a constant water table removing the water moved by electroosmosis at the cathode and restoring the same amount at the anode a multichannel multimeter siglent germany was used to monitor the input current density and the potential drop within the porous medium across the column ec and the half column eh the voltages ec and eh were measured using three stainless steel probes ø0 8 mm with 1 mm of exposed tip installed in the sand close to the cathodic chamber in the middle of the clay inclusion and in the sand close to the anodic chamber as shown in fig 1 the background electrolyte in the porous media consisted of an aqueous solution prepared according to minella et al 2018 with the composition reported in table 1 prior to the experiments the sand was washed to remove any colloid mondino et al 2020 and subsequently soaked for 20 h in the background electrolyte before the wet packing procedure haberer et al 2012 the sand was washed again for three times with a freshly prepared background electrolyte solution for the conservative experiments the clayey medium was prepared at a 96 water content using the same background electrolyte solution as for the sandy porous medium creating a fine paste that was then inserted into the central section the preparation was similar for the reactive experiment but the clay was spiked with a 0 3 mm methylene blue sigma aldrich acs grade solution the species in the electrode reservoirs were different from the species present in the background electrolyte of the porous media and consisted of a phosphate buffer kh2po4 k2hpo4 at ph 6 8 the phosphate solutions were prepared to achieve an electrolyte conductivity approximately equal ek equal buffer scenario 2 5 times greater ek high buffer scenario and 2 5 times lower ek low buffer scenario than the one of the background electrolyte used in the porous medium a summary of the species and their concentration is presented in table 1 the conservative transport experiments were performed using the three different background electrolyte solutions whereas the reactive experiment was performed with composition of the electrolyte solutions corresponding to the ek equal buffer scenario the ability of permanganate to effectively degrade and decolorize methylene blue was first verified using batch tests and uv visible spectrophotometry analytik jena specord s600 the concentration of the potassium permanganate solution sigma aldrich acs grade was 11 mm for all experiments corresponding to an electrolyte conductivity of 1450 ms cm which can be assumed as an equal conductivity with the background with the consequences discussed in sprocati et al 2021 and the volume injected in the system was 3 ml for each experiment an additional experiment was initially performed to verify the extent of the delivery within the clay inclusion in this test performed under ek equal buffer scenario conditions the electric field was turned off as soon as the entire permanganate plume was delivered in the clay zone by core sampling the clay was exposed to determine the distribution of permanganate and the obtained uniform distribution allowed excluding preferential flow at the interface between the clay and the column walls fig sm3 supplementary material the electrokinetic transport experiments were run in a photographic lightbox with controlled light conditions consisting of a top light built in led panel 5600 k and a front light 18 w led flood light 5600 k placed above the dslr camera at 60 cm from the set up pictures were taken every minute using a dslr camera nikon d500 equipped with a nikkor 17 55 mm dx to image the displacement and spatial distribution of the permanganate plume as well as the decolorization of methylene blue in the reactive test all images are side views of the column the software imagej rueden et al 2017 was used for the image processing 3 governing equations and numerical model the transport of species in porous media is described with the nernst plank equations liu et al 2011 muniruzzaman and rolle 2015 rasouli et al 2015 which account for diffusive fluxes j

work was performed with np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 that couples comsol multiphysics with phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 using a matlab livelink interface muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 rolle et al 2018 sprocati and rolle 2021 the code allows solving the nernst plank poisson equations governing the flow and transport processes as well as a wide range of equilibrium and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions the simulated domain was a two dimensional cross section of the porous medium discretized with a triangular mesh of 2200 elements dirichlet boundary conditions were implemented at the edges of the domain the values of the electric potential within the porous medium and buffer electrolyte concentrations were used as boundary conditions given the background electrolyte concentration was constant in all tests the buffer concentration controls the electric potential effectively present across the porous media thus always lower than the input potential at the electrodes and therefore the mass fluxes the experimental measure of the potential across the entire porous medium and the initial buffer concentration for the different scenarios were used to set the initial values in the numerical simulations the input quantities used in the model including the aqueous diffusion coefficients of the considered species are provided in the supplementary material section sm6 in the case of the clay inclusion the high surface charge determines a significant contribution to the bulk electrical conductivity and needs to be accounted for in the numerical simulations the measured bulk electrical conductivity was used to define the electrolyte concentration in the clay to account for its contribution in the numerical simulations further details on the approach and the measured bulk conductivity values are provided in the supplementary material section sm1 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative ek transport the results of the conservative experiments showing the displacement of the permanganate plume in the heterogeneous porous medium are presented in fig 2a the images indicate that complete delivery of permanganate in the clay inclusion is achieved within 200 min from the start for every scenario the different concentration of the buffer electrolyte affects electrokinetic transport exhibiting a faster delivery in the ek high buffer scenario and a slower delivery in the ek low buffer scenario despite the application of the same electrical potential gradient this is a direct consequence of the higher potential gradient present across the porous medium discussed in detail later in this section in all experiments the negatively charged permanganate migrates towards the anode and the shape of the injection appears to be conserved until the plume reaches the clay inclusion when the permanganate plume approaches the interface between the sand and clay its size decreases and the local concentration increases as indicate by a more intense purple color in fig 2a subsequently when the plume travels in the clay inclusion the size appears to be reduced with respect to the sand due to the higher porosity in the clay this results in the distribution of the permanganate plume in a lower bulk volume of the porous medium the results of the 2d electrokinetic transport model capture the experimental observations and can reproduce the displacement of the permanganate plume as well as the observed dynamics of plume deformation induced by the physical and chemical heterogeneity of the porous medium and by the electrostatic coupling between the different charged species in the numerical simulations the initial concentration of the electrolytes in the clay inclusion which determines the electrical conductivity σ e was set to 3 5 times the concentration of the electrolytes in the sand domains based on the experimental measurements of the bulk electrical conductivity in the two porous media supplementary material section sm1 fig 3 presents the comparison between the computed electric potentials and the values measured in the different experiments despite the same electric potential was applied to the electrodes the buffer with the lowest conductivity resulted in a lower electric potential gradient across the porous medium whereas the opposite condition was observed for the scenario with the highest buffer conductivity such behavior is due to eq 5 governing the relation between the conductivity and the electric potential gradient in particular a higher electrolyte conductivity in the electrode reservoirs results in a smaller electric potential gradient therefore leading to a higher electric potential within the porous medium indeed the opposite can be observed for the lower conductivity scenario in which a higher electric potential gradient occurs in the electrolyte reservoirs therefore resulting in a lower electric potential gradient through the porous medium the simulation results capture the experimental observations with some deviations at 150 min in the clay inclusion particularly for the ek high buffer scenario the effect of the specific conductivity of the different porous media is well represented by the lines measured at the beginning of the experiments panel a in the two sandy domains for the respective buffer conditions the slope is very similar given the same pore water composition and solid matrix properties whereas the clay inclusion shows a significantly lower slope due to the higher electrolyte conductivity at 150 min the initially linear and discontinuous trends across the heterogeneous porous medium become smoother due to the non linear charge interactions between the ions in solution but still show a distinct behavior between the sandy and clayey zones during the entire experiment duration the potential across the entire porous medium across the half column i e between the cathodic sand layer and the clay inclusion and the circulating current are subject to limited variation reported in figure sm2 and sm3 the latter is particularly significant as indicates that the buffer successfully stabilizes the chemical conditions in the system during the application of the electric field the process based model also allows visualizing the total permanganate mass fluxes and their components in the different experimental scenarios fig 4 considering the total fluxes higher values are observed for the scenario ek high buffer and the area in which these fluxes are higher correspond to the area in which permanganate is present at 200 min the diffusive fluxes present at the fringes of the permanganate plume are very similar in magnitude in all scenarios and their magnitude is more than 10 times smaller than the total fluxes the dominant flux components in all scenarios are the electromigration fluxes which vary as a result of the different electrical potential gradient present in the domain the latter is highest for the scenario ek high buffer and leads to values of j mno 4 mig more than double with respect to the other two scenarios a similar trend can also be observed for the advective fluxes which are dependent on the electroosmotic fluxes generated in the clay inclusion although their magnitude is lower than the electromigration fluxes the advective fluxes show a complex distribution in the heterogeneous porous media with different contributions of the hydraulic and electroosmotic components in the distinct scenarios supplementary material figure sm4 in all cases the resulting water flow has an opposite direction with respect to the dominant electromigration flux of permanganate towards the anode therefore it can be concluded that in the conservative experiments the transport of permanganate is dominated by electromigration and this main mass transfer mechanism is hindered by the opposite electroosmotic flux occurring in the clay inclusion 4 2 reactive ek transport a batch test was performed to investigate the ability of permanganate to effectively degrade methylene blue the uv visible spectra reported in fig 5a and b show the characteristic peak of permanganate 525 nm and of methylene blue 664 nm fig 5c shows the spectra of the solution after reactants mixing the absence of a methylene blue peak supports the degradative ability of permanganate and the visual evidence indicates that a brown reaction byproduct forms where the reaction with permanganate occurred visualization of the reactive experiment in the heterogeneous porous medium is shown in fig 5d e for the initial and final conditions before the permanganate plume reaches the contaminated clay medium methylene blue is not displaced from the low permeability zone over 70 min confirming that the positively charged dye is immobilized onto the negatively charged clay particles in this first stage the transport of permanganate follows the same dynamics observed in the conservative scenarios with a very similar time of arrival at the clay inclusion and progressive plume compression when permanganate enters the clay medium it is consumed by the reaction with methylene blue with a final reacted area accounting for 22 of the clay inclusion the displacement of the permanganate plume and its spatial distribution observed in the experiments fig 6a are captured by the simulations performed with the process based model fig 6b since methylene blue is immobilized in the clay inclusion contact of the reactants occurs as the permanganate enters the clay inclusion by electromigration the simulated evolution of methylene blue degradation presented in fig 6c also closely reproduces the experimental observations fig 6a the reactive transport model also allowed us to evaluate the magnitude and spatial distribution of the reaction rate fig 6d the observed decrease in the rate over time is due to the rapid permanganate consumption upon the oxidation of the trapped methylene blue our results demonstrates that permanganate can also react with contaminants strongly sorbed on the clay surface thus adding on previous studies exploring the reactivity of permanganate in electrokinetic applications chokejaroenrat et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2017b thepsithar and roberts 2006 with mobile contaminants 4 3 velocity analysis the presence of the clay zone in the heterogenous porous media introduces an advective component to the overall displacement of permanganate with an electroosmotic flow opposing the electromigration of the permanganate ion electromigration still prevails in all the scenarios explored and determines the displacement of permanganate towards the anode a detailed analysis of the advective flow components is presented in supplementary materials section sm4 the transport velocities of the permanganate plume were evaluated from the experimental data for both conservative and reactive experiments the values were obtained using the imagej software rueden et al 2017 to trace the plume front from the digital images fig 7 indicates that for the conservative delivery of permanganate the same velocity trend was observed for the three scenarios with a difference caused by the distinct electric potential gradients in all experiments the displacement velocities of the permanganate front rapidly decrease with time and reach almost constant values for the remaining duration of the tests after the permanganate has been completely delivered in the clay zone this decrease in the migration velocity is determined by the lower local potential gradient within the clay see fig 3 which affects electromigration and electroosmosis fig 4 at later times in the experiment 70 90 min the numerical simulations predict smoothing of the potential gradient in the clay and the sand layer on the right and this is confirmed by the measured migration velocity reaching a steady state the effect of a higher background electrolyte concentration of the buffer leads to higher velocities whereas the lowest velocities are observed in the scenario with the lowest concentration of the buffer this is a direct consequence of the modification in the electric potential across the porous medium as previously discussed section 4 1 fig 3 despite some slowdown in the clay compared to the sandy matrix permanganate transport velocities within the clay inclusion in the range 0 3 0 5 m day were observed in all scenarios these velocity values in the clay zone are significantly higher than the transport velocities achievable with injection strategies relying on advective and or diffusive mass transfer which would require impractical injection pressures to attain similar mass transfer rates in such low permeability porous media the velocity trends in the reactive experiment are comparable to the conservative scenario ek equal buffer and very similar velocity values are observed in the first 20 min within the sand zone adjacent to the cathode however a delay of approximately 20 in the permanganate transport is observed for the reactive scenario when the plume reaches the clay zone such delay is the result of the reaction of permanganate with the methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion table 2 summarizes the velocities of the permanganate front observed in different stages of the experiments v s 0 indicates the velocity in the first 20 min of transport v s ave indicates the average velocity in the sand layer hence before the permanganate front reaches the clay v c ave indicates the average transport velocity of the permanganate plume front as soon it enters the clay inclusion while v c p indicates the average velocity after it reaches a plateau in other words after the entire plume is delivered in the clay inclusion for the reactive case no plateau velocity is registered since all permanganate is rapidly consumed the results obtained for these experiments performed in heterogeneous porous media show good electrokinetic mobilities the estimated values of overall electrokinetic mobilities in the clay inclusions in our setup fall in the range 4 5 10 4 cm2 v 1 s 1 this result is in good agreement with previous studies thepsithar and roberts 2006 conducted in homogeneous clay media with a different bulk conductivity porosity and tortuosity 5 conclusions the experiments performed in this study highlight the potential of electrokinetics to deliver reactants in heterogeneous porous media where they can react and degrade contaminants trapped in low permeability zones the results of the experiments performed in sandy clayey porous media showed effective solute displacement and promising velocities which reached high values 0 3 0 4 m day also in the clay inclusions the reactant delivery in the clay also indicates that the use of a buffer electrolyte solution allows stabilizing the system ph and preventing the stalling of the permanganate plume the investigation of conservative scenarios also demonstrated that microscopic coulombic interactions between charged species arising from the different composition of the buffer electrolyte have a relevant impact on the macroscopic plume evolution affecting both the transport velocity and the distribution of the delivered reactant a lower concentration in the buffer electrolyte used for ph stabilization in the electrode chambers with respect to the pore water resulted in a detrimental effect on the delivery rates of permanganate with velocities up to 30 lower than the ek equal buffer conductivity scenario and up to 40 lower than the ek high buffer scenario these outcomes have relevant implications not only for controlled experimental studies but also for future pilot and full scale applications at contaminated sites the investigation of the reactive scenario also proved with direct evidence the ability of permanganate to react during the application of the electric field the experimental results show that permanganate was able to reach the target contaminated zone and effectively degrade an immobilized organic compound the numerical simulations of both conservative and reactive transport experiments captured the observed permanganate transport behavior and its reactivity with the model organic contaminant methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion the process based model was instrumental to elucidate the role of the different flow and transport processes induced by the application of an electric field in a heterogeneous porous medium the analysis of mass transfer fluxes allowed us to confirm the key role of electromigration which was found to be dominant compared to the diffusive and the electroosmotic fluxes the latter was important particularly in the clay inclusion where it slowed down the transport of the permanganate plume towards the anode similarly the analysis of the velocities their spatial distribution their values in presence of different electrolyte solutions and their different components was helpful to understand the observed displacement of the permanganate plume in the sandy clayey medium and under the different experimental conditions explored in this study the extension of the approach to fully two dimensional and three dimensional systems will allow us to substantiate the capability of the proposed targeted ek delivery and remediation of selected contaminated zones in heterogeneous porous media in this perspective future studies shall also address transport in setups with natural clay inclusion which could show a distinct behavior due to physical and chemical properties e g higher content in metallic elements than pure kaolin wider grain size distribution organic matter content etc furthermore the development of process based modeling will be an important tool not only to interpret well controlled laboratory experiments but also to upscale design and optimize field scale implementation of electrokinetic remediation in inherently complex physically chemically and electrostatically heterogeneous subsurface porous media the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary video 1 time lapse video time step 5 minutes obtained from the

1263,the use of electrokinetics ek has great potential to deliver reactants in impervious porous media thus overcoming some of the challenges in the remediation of contaminants trapped in low permeability zones in this work we experimentally investigate electrokinetic transport in heterogeneous porous media consisting of a sandy matrix with a target clay inclusion we demonstrate the efficient ek delivery of permanganate in the target clay zone transport velocity 0 3 0 5 m day 1 and its reactivity with methylene blue a positively charged contaminant trapped within the inclusion the delivery method was optimized using a kh2po4 k2hpo4 buffer to attenuate the effect of electrolysis reactions in the electrode chambers thus mitigating the propagation of ph fronts and preventing the phenomenon of permanganate stalling the experiments showed that the buffer electrical conductivity greatly impacts the potential gradient in the heterogeneous porous medium with implications on the observed rates of electrokinetic transport variation up to 40 the reactive experiments provided direct evidence of the permanganate penetration within the clay and of its capability to degrade the target immobilized contaminant the experimental results were analyzed using a process based model elucidating the governing transport mechanisms and highlighting the effect of different mass transfer processes on conservative and reactive electrokinetic transport graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrokinetic remediation experiments in heterogeneous porous media clayey zones coulombic interactions reactive transport modeling data availability most data are already available in supplementary material additional data can be made available on request 1 introduction different technologies have been developed for in situ remediation of contaminated aquifers based on the injection and mixing of reactive amendments khan et al 2004 kitanidis and mccarty 2012 rolle and le borgne 2019 tosco et al 2014 among these techniques in situ chemical oxidation isco and in situ chemical reduction iscr showed good performances for the remediation of a wide variety of organic and inorganic contaminants ludwig et al 2007 romero et al 2009 siegrist et al 2011 tratnyek et al 2014 however the reactant delivery in the subsurface typically performed by hydraulic injection is limited by the presence of low permeability zones which can strongly impact the flow field and impair the distribution of the reactants chen et al 2022 guo and brusseau 2017 velimirovic et al 2020 moreover pollutants diffusing in low permeability layers and inclusions can be trapped over long time scales and potentially act as secondary contamination sources slow contaminant release by back diffusion is indeed often responsible for the persistence of groundwater plumes casasso et al 2021 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 parker et al 2008 and for long remediation times kueper et al 2014 sethi and di molfetta 2019 therefore achieving a complete and fast delivery of reactants in low permeability zones can greatly enhance the effectiveness of remediation technologies and improve the quality of groundwater in many contaminated sites palma et al 2020 reddy and cameselle 2009 wu et al 2013 electrokinetic techniques have the potential to deliver both charged and uncharged species in low permeability porous media gill et al 2016 gill et al 2015 inglis et al 2021 lima et al 2017 reynolds et al 2008 sprocati et al 2020 wu et al 2012 applications have been proposed to mobilize and remove inorganic contaminants kim et al 2009 2012 li et al 2011 li et al 1996 reddy et al 2001 ribeiro and mexia 1997 as well as to enhance the chemical and biological degradation or organic compounds cappello et al 2019 czinnerová et al 2020 head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 thepsithar and roberts 2006 wick et al 2004 upon the application of a direct current electric field charged species migrate towards the electrode of opposite polarity as a result of electromigration acar and alshawabkeh 1993 appelo 2017 reddy and cameselle 2009 sprocati and rolle 2022 simultaneously an electroosmotic flow is generated from the transport of the positively charged species around the negatively charged surfaces which induces drag forces resulting in the movement of water towards the cathode acar et al 1995 newman and thomas alyea 2012 vane and zang 1997 despite the promise of electrokinetics for subsurface applications several challenges are still open and need careful investigation for instance in absence of adequate buffering strategies to promptly neutralize alkaline and acidic species produced by electrolysis reactions ph fronts can form and propagate in porous media alshawabkeh 2009 cherepy and wildenschild 2003 zhang et al 2020 causing the stalling of delivered amendments a first cause of this behavior is determined by the alteration in conductivity and surface charge of the porous medium the latter with heavier impact on clay materials determined by the ph variations ultimately affecting the electroosmotic flow and the overall electrokinetic mobility acar and alshawabkeh 1993 alshawabkeh 2009 newman and thomas alyea 2012 a second effect is a consumption of permanganate which is unstable outside the 3 5 12 ph range hence advancing acidic and alkaline fronts promote permanganate transformation to mn2 and mno2 respectively hodges et al 2013 reynolds et al 2008 roach 2006 which are inactive species in the remediation process additionally the migration of ph fronts from the electrode reservoirs in the porous medium can induce leaching of contaminants such as heavy metals from the solid matrix iannelli et al 2015 masi et al 2017 reddy et al 2001 most experimental investigation of electrokinetic transport and reactivity in the subsurface has been performed in homogeneous porous media whereas only a few contributions have studied the effects of heterogeneity during electrokinetic transport and reactant delivery chowdhury et al 2017b chowdhury et al 2017a gill et al 2016 sprocati and rolle 2022 furthermore previous experimental work was performed with mobile contaminants chowdhury et al 2017b thepsithar and roberts 2006 that were also subject to electroosmotic mobilization from the clay during the ek delivery of amendments cameselle et al 2021 this study investigates the electrokinetic transport of a charged species in heterogeneous porous media composed of a clay inclusion embedded in a sandy matrix experiments were performed to explore both conservative and reactive transport in the heterogeneous sandy clayey domain using potassium permanganate a strong oxidant widely employed in wastewater and groundwater remediation chang et al 2006 liang et al 2014 schnarr et al 1998 in a first set of conservative experiments potassium permanganate a negatively charged strong oxidant was delivered in the heterogeneous domain we investigated the displacement of permanganate in the sand and clay zones as well as the impact of hydrochemical conditions such as the concentration of the buffer used in the electrode chambers for ph stabilization we also performed a reactive experiment focusing on the degradation of an organic contaminant methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion where it is sorbed to the negatively charged clay surfaces and thus it is not mobilized by the induced electroosmotic flow the dynamics of permanganate transport and the reaction with the sorbed organic contaminant were analyzed using a process based model in order to identify and elucidate the governing mechanisms controlling electrokinetic conservative and reactive transport in the heterogeneous porous media 2 materials and methods the experimental setup consisted of a squared pvc column with inner dimension of 240 23 23 mm3 l w h schematically illustrated in fig 1 two honeycomb separators covered with a high density polyethylene filter mesh size 150 μm were installed to delimitate a central section and two lateral chambers the inner section with size 120 23 23 mm3 and an open top was filled with the porous media with a central clay inclusion of size 27 23 23 mm3 embedded within two sand zones of size 47 23 23 mm3 the sandy porous medium gebrüder dorfner gmbh co was silica sand grain size 0 3 0 8 mm porosity n 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity

typically conducted with lower voltages the two electrode chambers equipped with a vent port to expel the gases produced by electrolysis were filled with a phosphate buffer solution also referred as buffer electrolyte kh2po4 k2hpo4 at ph 6 8 to a water level of 18 mm a water table lower than the upper edge of the porous medium was used to prevent the formation of a surface water layer which would cause a preferential pathway for the electric current in the system each electrode chamber was stirred and the electrolytes recirculated with a larger 1 5 l reservoir to enhance the ph buffering capacity of the system the recirculation system also allowed maintaining a constant water table removing the water moved by electroosmosis at the cathode and restoring the same amount at the anode a multichannel multimeter siglent germany was used to monitor the input current density and the potential drop within the porous medium across the column ec and the half column eh the voltages ec and eh were measured using three stainless steel probes ø0 8 mm with 1 mm of exposed tip installed in the sand close to the cathodic chamber in the middle of the clay inclusion and in the sand close to the anodic chamber as shown in fig 1 the background electrolyte in the porous media consisted of an aqueous solution prepared according to minella et al 2018 with the composition reported in table 1 prior to the experiments the sand was washed to remove any colloid mondino et al 2020 and subsequently soaked for 20 h in the background electrolyte before the wet packing procedure haberer et al 2012 the sand was washed again for three times with a freshly prepared background electrolyte solution for the conservative experiments the clayey medium was prepared at a 96 water content using the same background electrolyte solution as for the sandy porous medium creating a fine paste that was then inserted into the central section the preparation was similar for the reactive experiment but the clay was spiked with a 0 3 mm methylene blue sigma aldrich acs grade solution the species in the electrode reservoirs were different from the species present in the background electrolyte of the porous media and consisted of a phosphate buffer kh2po4 k2hpo4 at ph 6 8 the phosphate solutions were prepared to achieve an electrolyte conductivity approximately equal ek equal buffer scenario 2 5 times greater ek high buffer scenario and 2 5 times lower ek low buffer scenario than the one of the background electrolyte used in the porous medium a summary of the species and their concentration is presented in table 1 the conservative transport experiments were performed using the three different background electrolyte solutions whereas the reactive experiment was performed with composition of the electrolyte solutions corresponding to the ek equal buffer scenario the ability of permanganate to effectively degrade and decolorize methylene blue was first verified using batch tests and uv visible spectrophotometry analytik jena specord s600 the concentration of the potassium permanganate solution sigma aldrich acs grade was 11 mm for all experiments corresponding to an electrolyte conductivity of 1450 ms cm which can be assumed as an equal conductivity with the background with the consequences discussed in sprocati et al 2021 and the volume injected in the system was 3 ml for each experiment an additional experiment was initially performed to verify the extent of the delivery within the clay inclusion in this test performed under ek equal buffer scenario conditions the electric field was turned off as soon as the entire permanganate plume was delivered in the clay zone by core sampling the clay was exposed to determine the distribution of permanganate and the obtained uniform distribution allowed excluding preferential flow at the interface between the clay and the column walls fig sm3 supplementary material the electrokinetic transport experiments were run in a photographic lightbox with controlled light conditions consisting of a top light built in led panel 5600 k and a front light 18 w led flood light 5600 k placed above the dslr camera at 60 cm from the set up pictures were taken every minute using a dslr camera nikon d500 equipped with a nikkor 17 55 mm dx to image the displacement and spatial distribution of the permanganate plume as well as the decolorization of methylene blue in the reactive test all images are side views of the column the software imagej rueden et al 2017 was used for the image processing 3 governing equations and numerical model the transport of species in porous media is described with the nernst plank equations liu et al 2011 muniruzzaman and rolle 2015 rasouli et al 2015 which account for diffusive fluxes j

work was performed with np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 that couples comsol multiphysics with phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 using a matlab livelink interface muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 rolle et al 2018 sprocati and rolle 2021 the code allows solving the nernst plank poisson equations governing the flow and transport processes as well as a wide range of equilibrium and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions the simulated domain was a two dimensional cross section of the porous medium discretized with a triangular mesh of 2200 elements dirichlet boundary conditions were implemented at the edges of the domain the values of the electric potential within the porous medium and buffer electrolyte concentrations were used as boundary conditions given the background electrolyte concentration was constant in all tests the buffer concentration controls the electric potential effectively present across the porous media thus always lower than the input potential at the electrodes and therefore the mass fluxes the experimental measure of the potential across the entire porous medium and the initial buffer concentration for the different scenarios were used to set the initial values in the numerical simulations the input quantities used in the model including the aqueous diffusion coefficients of the considered species are provided in the supplementary material section sm6 in the case of the clay inclusion the high surface charge determines a significant contribution to the bulk electrical conductivity and needs to be accounted for in the numerical simulations the measured bulk electrical conductivity was used to define the electrolyte concentration in the clay to account for its contribution in the numerical simulations further details on the approach and the measured bulk conductivity values are provided in the supplementary material section sm1 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative ek transport the results of the conservative experiments showing the displacement of the permanganate plume in the heterogeneous porous medium are presented in fig 2a the images indicate that complete delivery of permanganate in the clay inclusion is achieved within 200 min from the start for every scenario the different concentration of the buffer electrolyte affects electrokinetic transport exhibiting a faster delivery in the ek high buffer scenario and a slower delivery in the ek low buffer scenario despite the application of the same electrical potential gradient this is a direct consequence of the higher potential gradient present across the porous medium discussed in detail later in this section in all experiments the negatively charged permanganate migrates towards the anode and the shape of the injection appears to be conserved until the plume reaches the clay inclusion when the permanganate plume approaches the interface between the sand and clay its size decreases and the local concentration increases as indicate by a more intense purple color in fig 2a subsequently when the plume travels in the clay inclusion the size appears to be reduced with respect to the sand due to the higher porosity in the clay this results in the distribution of the permanganate plume in a lower bulk volume of the porous medium the results of the 2d electrokinetic transport model capture the experimental observations and can reproduce the displacement of the permanganate plume as well as the observed dynamics of plume deformation induced by the physical and chemical heterogeneity of the porous medium and by the electrostatic coupling between the different charged species in the numerical simulations the initial concentration of the electrolytes in the clay inclusion which determines the electrical conductivity σ e was set to 3 5 times the concentration of the electrolytes in the sand domains based on the experimental measurements of the bulk electrical conductivity in the two porous media supplementary material section sm1 fig 3 presents the comparison between the computed electric potentials and the values measured in the different experiments despite the same electric potential was applied to the electrodes the buffer with the lowest conductivity resulted in a lower electric potential gradient across the porous medium whereas the opposite condition was observed for the scenario with the highest buffer conductivity such behavior is due to eq 5 governing the relation between the conductivity and the electric potential gradient in particular a higher electrolyte conductivity in the electrode reservoirs results in a smaller electric potential gradient therefore leading to a higher electric potential within the porous medium indeed the opposite can be observed for the lower conductivity scenario in which a higher electric potential gradient occurs in the electrolyte reservoirs therefore resulting in a lower electric potential gradient through the porous medium the simulation results capture the experimental observations with some deviations at 150 min in the clay inclusion particularly for the ek high buffer scenario the effect of the specific conductivity of the different porous media is well represented by the lines measured at the beginning of the experiments panel a in the two sandy domains for the respective buffer conditions the slope is very similar given the same pore water composition and solid matrix properties whereas the clay inclusion shows a significantly lower slope due to the higher electrolyte conductivity at 150 min the initially linear and discontinuous trends across the heterogeneous porous medium become smoother due to the non linear charge interactions between the ions in solution but still show a distinct behavior between the sandy and clayey zones during the entire experiment duration the potential across the entire porous medium across the half column i e between the cathodic sand layer and the clay inclusion and the circulating current are subject to limited variation reported in figure sm2 and sm3 the latter is particularly significant as indicates that the buffer successfully stabilizes the chemical conditions in the system during the application of the electric field the process based model also allows visualizing the total permanganate mass fluxes and their components in the different experimental scenarios fig 4 considering the total fluxes higher values are observed for the scenario ek high buffer and the area in which these fluxes are higher correspond to the area in which permanganate is present at 200 min the diffusive fluxes present at the fringes of the permanganate plume are very similar in magnitude in all scenarios and their magnitude is more than 10 times smaller than the total fluxes the dominant flux components in all scenarios are the electromigration fluxes which vary as a result of the different electrical potential gradient present in the domain the latter is highest for the scenario ek high buffer and leads to values of j mno 4 mig more than double with respect to the other two scenarios a similar trend can also be observed for the advective fluxes which are dependent on the electroosmotic fluxes generated in the clay inclusion although their magnitude is lower than the electromigration fluxes the advective fluxes show a complex distribution in the heterogeneous porous media with different contributions of the hydraulic and electroosmotic components in the distinct scenarios supplementary material figure sm4 in all cases the resulting water flow has an opposite direction with respect to the dominant electromigration flux of permanganate towards the anode therefore it can be concluded that in the conservative experiments the transport of permanganate is dominated by electromigration and this main mass transfer mechanism is hindered by the opposite electroosmotic flux occurring in the clay inclusion 4 2 reactive ek transport a batch test was performed to investigate the ability of permanganate to effectively degrade methylene blue the uv visible spectra reported in fig 5a and b show the characteristic peak of permanganate 525 nm and of methylene blue 664 nm fig 5c shows the spectra of the solution after reactants mixing the absence of a methylene blue peak supports the degradative ability of permanganate and the visual evidence indicates that a brown reaction byproduct forms where the reaction with permanganate occurred visualization of the reactive experiment in the heterogeneous porous medium is shown in fig 5d e for the initial and final conditions before the permanganate plume reaches the contaminated clay medium methylene blue is not displaced from the low permeability zone over 70 min confirming that the positively charged dye is immobilized onto the negatively charged clay particles in this first stage the transport of permanganate follows the same dynamics observed in the conservative scenarios with a very similar time of arrival at the clay inclusion and progressive plume compression when permanganate enters the clay medium it is consumed by the reaction with methylene blue with a final reacted area accounting for 22 of the clay inclusion the displacement of the permanganate plume and its spatial distribution observed in the experiments fig 6a are captured by the simulations performed with the process based model fig 6b since methylene blue is immobilized in the clay inclusion contact of the reactants occurs as the permanganate enters the clay inclusion by electromigration the simulated evolution of methylene blue degradation presented in fig 6c also closely reproduces the experimental observations fig 6a the reactive transport model also allowed us to evaluate the magnitude and spatial distribution of the reaction rate fig 6d the observed decrease in the rate over time is due to the rapid permanganate consumption upon the oxidation of the trapped methylene blue our results demonstrates that permanganate can also react with contaminants strongly sorbed on the clay surface thus adding on previous studies exploring the reactivity of permanganate in electrokinetic applications chokejaroenrat et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2017b thepsithar and roberts 2006 with mobile contaminants 4 3 velocity analysis the presence of the clay zone in the heterogenous porous media introduces an advective component to the overall displacement of permanganate with an electroosmotic flow opposing the electromigration of the permanganate ion electromigration still prevails in all the scenarios explored and determines the displacement of permanganate towards the anode a detailed analysis of the advective flow components is presented in supplementary materials section sm4 the transport velocities of the permanganate plume were evaluated from the experimental data for both conservative and reactive experiments the values were obtained using the imagej software rueden et al 2017 to trace the plume front from the digital images fig 7 indicates that for the conservative delivery of permanganate the same velocity trend was observed for the three scenarios with a difference caused by the distinct electric potential gradients in all experiments the displacement velocities of the permanganate front rapidly decrease with time and reach almost constant values for the remaining duration of the tests after the permanganate has been completely delivered in the clay zone this decrease in the migration velocity is determined by the lower local potential gradient within the clay see fig 3 which affects electromigration and electroosmosis fig 4 at later times in the experiment 70 90 min the numerical simulations predict smoothing of the potential gradient in the clay and the sand layer on the right and this is confirmed by the measured migration velocity reaching a steady state the effect of a higher background electrolyte concentration of the buffer leads to higher velocities whereas the lowest velocities are observed in the scenario with the lowest concentration of the buffer this is a direct consequence of the modification in the electric potential across the porous medium as previously discussed section 4 1 fig 3 despite some slowdown in the clay compared to the sandy matrix permanganate transport velocities within the clay inclusion in the range 0 3 0 5 m day were observed in all scenarios these velocity values in the clay zone are significantly higher than the transport velocities achievable with injection strategies relying on advective and or diffusive mass transfer which would require impractical injection pressures to attain similar mass transfer rates in such low permeability porous media the velocity trends in the reactive experiment are comparable to the conservative scenario ek equal buffer and very similar velocity values are observed in the first 20 min within the sand zone adjacent to the cathode however a delay of approximately 20 in the permanganate transport is observed for the reactive scenario when the plume reaches the clay zone such delay is the result of the reaction of permanganate with the methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion table 2 summarizes the velocities of the permanganate front observed in different stages of the experiments v s 0 indicates the velocity in the first 20 min of transport v s ave indicates the average velocity in the sand layer hence before the permanganate front reaches the clay v c ave indicates the average transport velocity of the permanganate plume front as soon it enters the clay inclusion while v c p indicates the average velocity after it reaches a plateau in other words after the entire plume is delivered in the clay inclusion for the reactive case no plateau velocity is registered since all permanganate is rapidly consumed the results obtained for these experiments performed in heterogeneous porous media show good electrokinetic mobilities the estimated values of overall electrokinetic mobilities in the clay inclusions in our setup fall in the range 4 5 10 4 cm2 v 1 s 1 this result is in good agreement with previous studies thepsithar and roberts 2006 conducted in homogeneous clay media with a different bulk conductivity porosity and tortuosity 5 conclusions the experiments performed in this study highlight the potential of electrokinetics to deliver reactants in heterogeneous porous media where they can react and degrade contaminants trapped in low permeability zones the results of the experiments performed in sandy clayey porous media showed effective solute displacement and promising velocities which reached high values 0 3 0 4 m day also in the clay inclusions the reactant delivery in the clay also indicates that the use of a buffer electrolyte solution allows stabilizing the system ph and preventing the stalling of the permanganate plume the investigation of conservative scenarios also demonstrated that microscopic coulombic interactions between charged species arising from the different composition of the buffer electrolyte have a relevant impact on the macroscopic plume evolution affecting both the transport velocity and the distribution of the delivered reactant a lower concentration in the buffer electrolyte used for ph stabilization in the electrode chambers with respect to the pore water resulted in a detrimental effect on the delivery rates of permanganate with velocities up to 30 lower than the ek equal buffer conductivity scenario and up to 40 lower than the ek high buffer scenario these outcomes have relevant implications not only for controlled experimental studies but also for future pilot and full scale applications at contaminated sites the investigation of the reactive scenario also proved with direct evidence the ability of permanganate to react during the application of the electric field the experimental results show that permanganate was able to reach the target contaminated zone and effectively degrade an immobilized organic compound the numerical simulations of both conservative and reactive transport experiments captured the observed permanganate transport behavior and its reactivity with the model organic contaminant methylene blue trapped in the clay inclusion the process based model was instrumental to elucidate the role of the different flow and transport processes induced by the application of an electric field in a heterogeneous porous medium the analysis of mass transfer fluxes allowed us to confirm the key role of electromigration which was found to be dominant compared to the diffusive and the electroosmotic fluxes the latter was important particularly in the clay inclusion where it slowed down the transport of the permanganate plume towards the anode similarly the analysis of the velocities their spatial distribution their values in presence of different electrolyte solutions and their different components was helpful to understand the observed displacement of the permanganate plume in the sandy clayey medium and under the different experimental conditions explored in this study the extension of the approach to fully two dimensional and three dimensional systems will allow us to substantiate the capability of the proposed targeted ek delivery and remediation of selected contaminated zones in heterogeneous porous media in this perspective future studies shall also address transport in setups with natural clay inclusion which could show a distinct behavior due to physical and chemical properties e g higher content in metallic elements than pure kaolin wider grain size distribution organic matter content etc furthermore the development of process based modeling will be an important tool not only to interpret well controlled laboratory experiments but also to upscale design and optimize field scale implementation of electrokinetic remediation in inherently complex physically chemically and electrostatically heterogeneous subsurface porous media the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary video 1 time lapse video time step 5 minutes obtained from the

1264,in this paper two meshless methods namely a weak form meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method and meshless weak strong mws form method obtained by combining mlpg with a strong form radial point collocation method rpcm are presented for simulation of advection dispersion reaction phenomena of the contaminants in the porous media the first order decay and sorption reactions are considered in this study the crank nicolson scheme is applied for the time discretization the weak form mlpg is a truly meshless and robust numerical technique that can be applied to complex aquifer systems with derivative boundaries however in this method the computational time is increased due to the integration which is not essential for simple problems thus the mlpg method is further coupled with a strong form rpcm with an aim of decreasing the background integration by modelling only the nodes around the derivative boundaries using mlpg method and the other nodes by a direct rpcm which do not require integration the proposed mws model automatically converts into a complete rpcm model if there are no derivative boundaries thus this model being both accurate and computationally efficient is suitable for simple and moderately complex aquifer systems and mlpg is the most stable and reliable method for modelling the most complex aquifer problems both the developed models are tested with available analytical solutions and applied for hypothetical case studies the results prove the efficiency of the models and the applicability of each model is described in detail keywords

introduction groundwater is a vital resource serving about one third of global drinking water demand one fourth of industrial water demand and 40 of agricultural water demand international association of hydrogeologists 2020 which are expected to further increase in the future owing to its extensive use the contamination of groundwater is a major concern to the hydrogeologists the research on subsurface contamination started in the early 1960s and became widely popular after the term contaminant hydrogeology was introduced by cherry et al 1975 aiming at the attenuation of contaminants and protection of aquifers the prediction of the contaminant behavior is extremely necessary for the mitigation of groundwater pollution a reliable prediction requires a scientific understanding of the contaminant fate controlling processes namely the advection hydrodynamic dispersion and the reactions in groundwater khondaker et al 1990 sorption is a reaction process that involves the exchange of molecules between the contaminant and the porous media todd and mays 2004 and it includes the adsorption absorption and chemisorption of the contaminant particles into the solid surface goltz and huang 2017 which retard the contaminant movement the solubility controlled reactions and hydrophobic reactions may also cause retardation jackson and hoehn 1987 certain contaminants especially the toxic and radioactive contaminants degrade over time the complex reactive transport phenomenon comprising of these processes can be analyzed with the help of mathematical simulation models based on the laws of conservation of mass energy and momentum sharma et al 2020 several analytical mathematical models were derived for the reactive transport equation by carslaw and jaeger 1959 ogata and banks 1961 brenner 1962 lindstrom et al 1967 bear 1972 mariño 1974 van genuchten 1982 domenico 1987 wexler 1992 lunn et al 1996 park and zhan 2001 and jones et al 2006 the analytical solutions are mathematically exact solutions and are widely used for validating the numerical solutions however the analytical models are capable of modelling only the aquifers with simple geometry with constant changes in space and time and simple initial and boundary conditions thus for the practical problems where the analytical solutions are impossible to derive numerical models are the most suitable alternatives bear and cheng 2010 conventional numerical methods such as the finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem are widely used to model the reactive transport phenomenon which result in reliable solutions these methods involve gridding meshing the aquifer domain and the solution evolves from one space and time step to another for a particular order of accuracy the errors in these models can be controlled by using a finer grid mesh sharma et al 2011 the creation and recreation of mesh grid are expensive and cannot be completely automated without compromising the accuracy of the solution thus making the process of adaptive analysis complex liu and gu 2005 moreover the reduction of errors is not straightforward for the problems with high peclet numbers steefel and macquarrie 2018 the finite volume method fvm is another widely used numerical technique where unstructured grids meshes can be used to represent the problem domain fvm though having the advantages of local accuracy and being an integral scheme has a limitation when compared to fem that the functions for solution approximation cannot be easily made as higher order the difficulties arising due to the involvement of grid mesh in fdm fem and fvm are alleviated in the meshless methods as only the nodes are arranged inside and on the domain and a connection between these nodes is not required the meshless techniques can be classified as weak strong and hybrid weak strong form methods liu and gu 2005 weak form methods involve integration of governing equation before converting it to a system of algebraic equations on the other hand in the strong form method a collocation technique is applied to the governing equation the strong form methods are truly meshless as they do not require background cells throughout the solution procedure they are also faster and direct to simulate however the stability and the accuracy of the solution reduce the problems with derivative boundaries liu and gu 2005 therefore for the real aquifer problems which involve derivative boundaries the strong form based models may not be robust such complications are resolved in the weak form methods due to the integration process pathania et al 2020 in these methods the continuity requirement is weakened and the accuracy is improved but at a cost of higher computational efforts in the meshless weak strong mws form methods the weak and strong form methods are coupled to obtain the advantages of both methods liu and gu 2003 recently some of the meshless methods are applied to study the transport of reactive contaminants in porous media tartakovsky et al 2007 applied meshless smooth particle hydrodynamics sph to simulate the reactive transport and mineral precipitation phenomena herrera et al

ahmad et al 2020 presented a local meshless scheme based on inverse multiquadric imq radial basis function rbf for space discretization coupled with caputo definition approximation for time discretization for modelling solute transport phenomenon yekta et al 2021 coupled a reaction package phreeqcrm with imperial college finite element reactive simulator ic ferst for the simulation of reactive transport and in the proposed method the geological features are represented by a meshless procedure using non uniform rational b spline pathania et al 2020 developed simulation model for coupled flow and reactive transport using a weak form element free galerkin method efgm anshuman and eldho 2022 further extended the rpcm based reactive transport model for the contaminant transport modelling with nonlinear adsorption reactions in heterogeneous aquifers in this study two new reactive transport simulation models based on meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method and a hybrid mlpg and radial point collocation method rpcm based meshless weak strong mws form method are presented with an objective of obtaining robust models which are efficient in terms of accuracy as well as computational cost mlpg is a powerful and truly meshless weak form method which was first developed by atluri and zhu 1998 further mlpg was successfully applied for the computation of groundwater flow swathi and eldho 2013 swathi and eldho 2014 mohtashami et al 2017 mohtashami et al 2022 for the simulation of non reactive contaminant transport swathi and eldho 2017 groundwater remediation ilati and dehghan 2016 the study of groundwater management swathi and eldho 2018 and estimation of recharge by injection wells doulabi et al 2019 the concept of hybrid weak and strong form methods was first presented by liu and gu 2003 a combination of mlpg and radial point interpolation method rpim with implicit time stepping scheme was investigated for the study of mobile immobile advection diffusion transport phenomenon by ghehsareh et al 2018 ghehsareh et al 2019a extended the model for the study of modified anomalous process where the source term is nonlinear ghehsareh et al 2019b and ghehsareh et al 2019c applied the hybrid mlpg rpim model to the reaction diffusion process and tricomi type equation das and eldho 2022a applied coupled rpcm mlpg mws model for flow simulation and das and eldho 2022b extended rpcm mlpg mws model for coupled flow and transport simulation mlpg model is a powerful numerical tool which can produce reliable solutions even for the most complex real aquifers involving derivative boundaries also being a local weak form meshless method mlpg is truly meshless liu and gu 2005 in the present study the first reactive transport model is based on mlpg which is used for the first time for the formulation and simulation of the groundwater advection dispersion reaction phenomena for the reactive contaminants undergoing first order decay and sorption reactions with an objective of creating a robust meshless tool with minimum preprocessing efforts however mlpg requires a higher computational cost thus causing a limitation for simple problems for which a complex modelling procedure is not necessary thus the developed mlpg model is further coupled with a reactive transport model based on strong form rpcm to obtain the second model proposed in this study which is a mws model that can simulate the reactive transport phenomenon with higher accuracy and with less computational cost das and eldho 2022a such a hybrid mws method is for the first time proposed in the reactive transport studies the presented mws model can automatically convert itself to a complete rpcm model in the absence of derivative boundaries thus reducing the computational cost for simple problems both the developed models are validated with the available analytical solutions and are applied to hypothetical case studies and the merits are discussed 2 governing equation and boundary conditions 2 1 reactive transport the governing equation for the transport of a reactive contaminant undergoing decay and sorption reactions in a two dimensional aquifer with an assumption that the reactions occur only in the dissolved phase is given by bear and cheng 2010 1 x d xx c x y d yy c y v x c x v y c y λc r c t where c is concentration and t represents time vx vy dxx and dyy are velocities and dispersion coefficients in x and y directions r is the retardation factor given as rastogi 2012 2 r 1 ρ b k d η e in which kd is the sorption distribution coefficient and ρb and ηe are the bulk density and effective porosity of the medium λ is decay rate calculated in terms of half life t1 2 as groch 1998 3 λ ln 2 t 1 2 assuming that initially the entire aquifer domain ω is contaminated with a concentration of c0 the initial condition can be written as bear 1972 4 c x y 0 c 0 x y x y ω the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are given by bear 1972 5 c x

neumann boundary ω2 therefore for all the meshless nodes on the dirichlet boundary the unknown concentration c in the governing eq 1 becomes c1 for all the neumann boundary nodes a constant concentration flux of g is incorporated in the meshless techniques as described later in section 3 5 2 2 groundwater flow the governing equation describing unconfined aquifer flow is given by bear

dispersion coefficient using the equations bear 1972 8 v x k x h x v y k y h y 9 d xx α x v x 2 α y v y 2 v x 2 v y 2 d e d yy α x v y 2 α y v x 2 v x 2 v y 2 d e where αx and αy are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities and de is effective diffusion coefficient diffusion is usually ignored in contaminant transport simulation as it has a very low effect in fate of contaminant in porous media when compared to dispersion and is important only at low flow velocities goltz and huang 2017 therefore in eq 9 the term de can be ignored in the present study here the unknown heads at each meshless node are calculated using the flow model which are further applied for the computation of vx vy dxx and dyy at each node using eqs 8 and 9 finally the nodal velocities and dispersivities are given as inputs to the reactive transport model by substituting vx vy dxx and dyy in the governing eq 1 as applied in the case studies discussed in section 5 3 meshless models 3 1 moving least squares

2005 for the time discretization the finite difference method fdm is best suited as per the numerical experiments conducted by pinder and gray 1977 wang and anderson 1982 and swathi and eldho 2013 therefore the implicit crank nicholson scheme is used for time discretization for a better stability of the solutions here the unknown concentration is considered as an average value at two time steps

a recommended value for this parameter liu and gu 2005 and αc is maintained between 2 and 3 as the mws model is observed to be stable for these values the concentration at node j are estimated in

further details of the validation and applicability of the rpcm rt model to the reactive transport simulation are presented in anshuman et al 2019 3 4 mws formulation in the mws method the mlpg and rpcm are applied to different set of nodes in the same problem the mlpg formulation is applied to the derivative boundary nodes and the meshless nodes within the support domain of these nodes together denoted as mlpg nodes das and eldho 2022a thus the eqs 20 21 and 22 are applied to the mlpg nodes all the other nodes are rpcm nodes to which the eqs 28 29 and 30 are applied therefore the mws formulation for the governing eq 1 can be represented as 31 k c t 1 f where a for the nodes on the derivative boundary and the nodes within the support domain of these nodes 32 k j ω s r t dω ω s d xx

model using matlab the detailed modelling procedure is described in section 3 6 3 5 application of boundary conditions in the mlpg model the penalty function is used for the application of dirichlet or essential boundary conditions of the reactive contaminant transport model here the dirichlet or essential boundary conditions are known concentrations if α is the penalty factor then the essential boundary condition is given by liu and gu 2005 36 α ω 1 i 1 n ϕ i x y c i α ω 1 c 1 x y ω 1 mlpg being a weak form method one of the advantages is that the derivative boundary conditions can be applied directly as 37 ω 2 d xx i 1 n ϕ i x n x d yy i 1 n ϕ i y n y c i g x y ω 2 in the mws model the derivative boundary conditions are applied using eq 37 the essential boundaries are modelled using rpcm therefore the essential boundary conditions can also be applied directly without special treatment as 38 p 1 n p c p c 1 x y ω 1 thus in the mlpg model the derivative and the essential boundaries do not require any special handling which is a reason for an improved accuracy 3 6 modelling procedure based on the formulations presented in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 the mlpg rt mlpg reactive transport and mws rt mws reactive transport models are developed in matlab following are the steps for the reactive transport simulation in aquifers using mlpg rt and mws rt models 1 the necessary inputs are given to the model the inputs required are aquifer geometry and properties initial and boundary conditions contaminant details retardation factor sorption coefficient and the total simulation time the nodal arrangement and the time step are selected 2 the aquifer is discretized using the nodal arrangement the model parameters such as shape and size of sub and support domain for mlpg model and an additional rpcm support domain size for the mws model are specified 3 the integration limits and the shape functions are determined for the mws model additionally the nodes are divided into mlpg and rpcm nodes based on their proximity to the derivative boundaries 4 for the mlpg model and mlpg nodes of mws model the k and f matrices are computed using eqs 20 21 and 22 for the rpcm nodes of the mws model eqs 28 29 and 30 are used to compute the k and f matrices at each node 5 the boundary conditions are applied the global k and f matrices are derived and the system is solved to obtain the unknown concentration values 6 the procedure is repeated for all the time steps till the final time considered is achieved flowcharts depicting simulation procedure of mlpg and mws models are shown in fig 1 4 validation of mlpg rt and mws rt models the developed models are verified using two hypothetical problems and the results are compared with the analytical solutions available in the literature 4 1 one dimensional validation 4 1 1 reactions involving single species decay the governing eq 1 for groundwater contaminant transport with single species decay can be written as anshuman et al 2019 39 c t d 2 c x 2 v c t λc a hypothetical one dimensional porous media of an assumed length of 10 m is used for the model verification fig 2 a the domain is discretized into 21 nodes with a spacing of 0 5 m for both mlpg and mws models as shown in fig 2 b the aquifer is assumed to be initially free of contamination therefore the initial condition can be written as 40 c x 0 0 a continuous source of c0 100 ppm is introduced on the left boundary and the right boundary l 10 m is impervious resulting in the boundary conditions as 41 c 0 t c 0 42 c x l t 0 the contaminant is assumed to have a decay rate of 0 5 day 1 the dispersion coefficient and velocity are considered as 0 8 m2 day and 1 m day in the mlpg rt model the support and sub domains of size 3l and 0 45l are used where l is the average distance between consecutive nodes or the nodal spacing in mws rt model a support domain of radius 3l and 2l is considered for mlpg and rpcm nodes resulting in 4 mlpg nodes and 17 rpcm nodes as depicted in fig 2 b the sub domain size for the mlpg nodes of mws rt model is considered as 0 45l the model is simulated for 30 days with a time step of 1 day the contamination concentration obtained from the mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with the analytical solution given by van genuchten 1982 by substituting r 1 in the equation 43 c x t c 0 c term 1 u v u v exp ul d where 44 c term 1 2 exp v u x 2 d erfc rx ut 2 drt 1 2 1 2 exp v u x 2 d erfc rx ut 2 drt 1 2 u v 2 u v exp v u x 2 ul 2 d erfc r 2 l x ut 2 drt 1 2 u v 2 u v exp v u x 2 ul

table 1 a it can be observed that the results of the mlpg rt and mws rt models are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution thereby verifying the proposed models for simulation of 1d contaminant transport with decay 4 1 2 reactions involving only sorption the governing eq 1 for contaminant transport in porous media with sorption can be written as van genuchten 1982 46 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c t a 25 m long aquifer domain is considered for this example as shown in fig 4 a the domain is divided into 51 nodes out of which 4 are mlpg nodes and 47 are rpcm nodes for the mws model as depicted in fig 4 b the initial and boundary conditions are similar to that in section 4 1 1 as described in eqs 40 41 and 42 with the left end being considered as a dirichlet boundary with a constant concentration of 100 ppm and a zero flux right boundary the retardation factor velocity and dispersion coefficient are assumed to be 1 5 0 3 m day and 0 2 m2 day the radius of support domain is considered to be 3l 2l and 3l for the mlpg rt model rpcm and mlpg nodes of the mws rt model respectively a constant sub domain radius of 0 6l is assumed throughout the problem the concentration after 45 days of simulation considering a time step of 0 5 days from mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with the analytical solution given by van genuchten 1982 47 c x t c 0 1 2 erfc rx vt 2 drt 1 2 1 2

solution is depicted in fig 5 and table 1 b 4 1 3 reactions involving both decay and sorption the governing equation describing the transport of single species contaminant involving sorption and decay is given by anshuman et al 2019 48 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c t λc the porous media defined in section 4 1 1 is used for validation a hypothetical contaminant of decay rate 2 day 1 is introduced at the left boundary the retardation factor is assumed as r 3 the nodal arrangement similar to fig 2 b is adopted the analytical solution is computed from eqs 43 44 and 45 the concentration obtained after 30 days of simulation from mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with analytical solution considering a time step of 1 day and the results are presented in fig 6 and table 1 c the simulated solutions are similar to the analytical solution with low errors thereby validating mlpg rt and mws rt models for simulating combined sorption and decay reactions 4 2 two dimensional validation the two dimensional mlpg rt and mws rt are verified with a 100 m 50 m rectangular hypothetical aquifer as shown in fig 7 a the top and the bottom boundaries are considered to have a constant concentration of 0 the right boundary is a no flux derivative boundary on the left boundary a continuous line source of 30 m is introduced which releases the contaminant having a decay constant 0 034 day 1 at a constant concentration of 1 ppm a space step size of 10 m is used in both x and y vertical directions thus 66 nodes 18 mlpg and 48 rpcm nodes in the mws model are placed on the aquifer as depicted in fig 7 b pore velocity is assumed as 1 2 m d the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are assumed as 0 3 m2 d and 0 03 m2 d considering a retardation coefficient of 1 and assuming zero velocity in the y direction the governing eq 1 can be reduced to goltz and huang 2017 49 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 v x c x λc the mlpg rt and mws rt models are run for a simulation period of 15 days with a time step of 1 day with the source releasing the contaminant during the entire run time the results are validated with the semi analytical solution given by goltz and huang 2017 from the concentration plot depicted in fig 8 a and the breakthrough curves at the 4 observation points p1 p2 p3 and p4 depicted in fig 8 b it can be concluded that both mlpg and mws methods can simulate the reactive transport phenomenon with a great accuracy thereby validating the mlpg rt and mws rt models for two dimensional problems 4 3 sensitivity studies the model solution varies with the nodal density the shape and size of the sub and support domain and the shape function considered the mlpg model is highly sensitive to the sub and support domain radii and hence the proper selection of these parameters are absolutely necessary to obtain the desired accuracy in addition to these parameters the accuracy of the mws model is also dependent on the division of nodes as the mlpg and rpcm nodes in this study the l norm error e and the root mean square error rmse are used as the indicators of accuracy here e is the maximum absolute error calculated as 50 e max c analytical c meshless and the rmse can be estimated as 51 rmse j 1 n nodes c j analytical c j meshless 2 n nodes where cj analytical and cj meshless are the concentrations at jth node obtained from the analytical solution and meshless mlpg or mws solution canalytical and cmeshless are the vectors of analytical and meshless mlpg or mws solutions at all nodes and nnodes is the total number of nodes in the aquifer domain the sensitivity studies are applied to the one dimensional case studies given in section 4 1 by varying one parameter at a time the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 9 where two different plots are presented for each model each plot representing e or rmse 4 3 1 sensitivity of the mlpg and mws models with respect to nodal density the variation of the accuracy with respect to the nodal spacing is tested for the one dimensional validation problems as shown in fig 9 a b and c this analysis serves as a basis for convergence study of the mlpg and mws models the mlpg and mws models are more accurate for a larger number of nodes or a lower nodal spacing and the error tends to zero as the number of nodes increases proving that these models satisfy the convergence criteria of the numerical models of error approaching a fixed value with an increased refinement however the computational time increases if the number of nodes are high therefore the nodal spacing is selected in such a way that the desired accuracy and stability is obtained in a least computational time for example in fig 9 b representing the validation problem 4 1 2 the number of nodes is taken as 50 as there is no significant improvement in accuracy on a further increase in number of nodes also from fig 9 the mws model is observed to be more accurate than the mlpg model for all the three validation cases and for all nodal spacings 4 3 2 sensitivity of the mlpg and mws models with respect to sub domain radius one of the limitations of the mlpg method is that the solution is highly dependent on the model parameters such as the sub and support domain the variation of error in the mlpg rt and mws rt models with respect to the ratio of sub domain radius to nodal spacing is depicted in fig 9 d e and f in all the cases the least error or maximum accuracy is obtained for a radius of sub domain of 0 3 to 0 7 times the nodal spacing thus justifying the selection of this range in the present study the dependency of mws model on the sub domain is relatively less and even zero as indicated by flat variation of error in fig 9 e and f in contrast to the steep curves of errors of the mlpg model thus it can be inferred that another advantage of the mws model is a reduced dependency of the solution on the sub domain radius 4 3 3 sensitivity of the mlpg model with respect to support domain as illustrated in fig 9 g h and i the mlpg rt model gives the best results for a support domain of range 2 to 4 times the nodal spacing thus the model is tested with the support domain radii of this range by the trial and error method to obtain the best solutions in general a support domain radius of 2l to 3l can give accurate results 4 3 4 sensitivity of the mws model with respect to ratio of mlpg and rpcm nodes the number of rpcm and mlpg nodes varies with support domain size of the mlpg nodes of mws rt model greater the support domain radius of the mlpg nodes lower is the computational efficiency due to an increase in the integration process thus the ratio of mlpg nodes to rpcm nodes is selected in such a way that the maximum accuracy is obtained in a minimum computational time fig 9 j k and l depict the change in accuracy of the mws model with a change in percentage of mlpg nodes out of the total number of nodes it can be observed that the change in error with the number of mlpg nodes is relatively less and hence the support domain of the mlpg nodes of mws model has a less impact on the accuracy however generally a support domain radius of 2l to 3l can be considered for the mlpg nodes 5 case studies here the developed models are further applied to two case studies the solutions are compared with finite difference method fdm based rt3d clement 1999 model in the mt3dms module of the groundwater modelling system gms aquaveo 2017 the velocities and dispersion coefficient are obtained from the flow model discussed in section 2 2 using the eqs 8 and 9 these are given as inputs to the mlpg rt and mws rt transport models 5 1 case study 1 a square aquifer of dimensions 600 m 600 m fig 10 a and thickness 10 m is considered for the demonstration of the application of mlpg rt and mws rt models for the study of reactive transport the east and west boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with zero concentration and constant head of 20 m and 10 m respectively there is zero flow and zero flux over the north and south boundaries initially the aquifer is free of contamination two wells are considered at w1 180 m 300 m and w2 420 m 300 m which inject tritium 3h a radioactive isotope of hydrogen in its liquid form i e tritiated water at a rate of 50 mg l through a recharge of 100 m3 day tritium reacts with oxygen and also can disintegrate into helium usepa 1999 due to a moderately high half life of 12 3 years tritium used as an indicator of hydrologic processes usepa 1999 tritium has a low sorption and therefore a distribution coefficient of 0 07 ml g thibault et al 1990 is considered in this study the aquifer bulk density and porosity are assumed to be 1 5 g cc and 0 3 with the above mentioned data the retardation coefficient and the decay constant can be calculated as 1 35 and 0 0001544 day 1 respectively using the eqs 2 and 3 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity are taken as 5 m and 1 m using a constant transmissivity of 100 m2 day the head and further the velocities and dispersion coefficients are calculated the domain is discretized into 121 nodes out of which 62 are mlpg nodes and 59 are rpcm nodes in the mws rt model as illustrated in fig 10 b the support domain radius in mlpg rt model is taken as 3l and in the mws rt model it is considered as 2l for the rpcm as well as the mlpg nodes a constant sub domain of radius 0 3l and 0 45l is taken in the mlpg rt model and mlpg nodes of mws rt model the mlpg rt and mws rt models are simulated for 150 days with a time step of 3 days a cell centered grid with 30 cells each along x and y directions is used in the rt3d model for an accurate prediction of contamination the comparison of the concentration contours and the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 11 a and b and the concentrations at the injection wells after 150 days is presented in table 2 as can be seen from fig 11 and table 2 both mlpg rt and mws rt models are satisfactorily simulating the concentration and matching well with the rt3d solution however the required computational time for mws rt model is much smaller as shown in table 4 5 2 case study 2 the mlpg rt and mws rt models are applied to an irregular hypothetical heterogeneous unconfined aquifer as shown in fig 12 the thickness of the aquifer is 10 m the east and the west boundaries are constant head boundaries and all the other boundaries have zero flow using the data given in fig 12 the velocities and dispersivities were calculated using the mlpg and mws flow models as described by das and eldho 2022a and are given as inputs to the mlpg rt and mws rt models the transverse dispersivity is considered to be 0 1 times the longitudinal dispersivity all over the domain the initial contamination is assumed to be zero all over the domain the longitudinal dispersivities are as mentioned in fig 12 and the transverse dispersivity is taken as 0 1 times the longitudinal dispersivity there is a square pond in the domain fig 12 which recharges the aquifer at 0 001 m day and injects cobalt 60 60co at a rate of 1 ppm the soils exposed to high traffic near to industries or ore deposits may contain cobalt which enters groundwater through the leaching process when rainfall occurs on such soils 60co is a radioactive isotope of cobalt which is released to the environment from nuclear reactors radiation therapy manufacture of plastic and sterilization of medical equipment and has a half life of 5 3 years atsdr 2004 the retardation coefficient is taken as 70 khayyun 2018 exposure to 60co may cause cancer and may affect the bones liver and kidney usepa 2021 an example of groundwater contamination by 60co is discussed and modelled by khayyun 2018 the aquifer is discretized into 209 nodes for the mlpg rt and mws rt models based on sensitivity studies the sub domain radius is assumed to be 0 4 l and 0 6 l in mlpg rt and mlpg nodes of mws rt model for mlpg rt model the support domain radius is considered as 3 l and for mws rt model a radius of 2 l is taken for the mlpg and rpcm nodes resulting in 143 and 66 mlpg and rpcm nodes respectively as illustrated in fig 13 the problem is simulated for 10 years with a time step of 10 days and the resulting concentration is depicted in fig 14 the problem is simulated with rt3d model with cell centered mesh grid with cell length 500 m the comparison of concentrations at 6 observation points near to the contamination pond is summarized in table 3 the total simulation time required for the mlpg and mws models for both the case studies is given in table 4 as can be in fig 14 and table 3 both mlpg rt and mws rt models are satisfactorily simulating the concentration distribution and comparable to the rt3d model results as expected the mlpg model results were closer to rt3d results but with a higher computational time 6 discussion as observed from the validation problems the mlpg rt and mws rt can simulate the single species reactive transport phenomenon with a better accuracy the models are first validated for one dimensional cases considering the decay and sorption reactions one at a time and then a combination of both the reactions in all the three problems the solutions of the models are exactly matching with the analytical solutions as indicated by fig 3 fig 5 and fig 6 the models are further validated for a two dimensional problem with a line source contaminant and the solutions are matching with the semi analytical solution as indicated by fig 8 the solutions being highly dependent on the model parameters are tested by changing one parameter at a time the accuracy of the mlpg rt and mws rt models are observed to increase with a decrease in nodal spacing thereby satisfying the convergence criteria with the error approaching zero with the refinement the mlpg method is observed to give the most accurate results for a sub domain radius of 0 3 to 0 7 times nodal spacing and a support domain radius of 2 or 3 times the nodal spacing and thus this range is adopted in the mlpg rt and the mws rt models in the mws scheme the radius of support domain directly influences the number of nodes executed by the mlpg and rpcm methods in this study percentage of mlpg nodes corresponding to a mlpg support domain radius of 2l to 3l is observed to give the desired accuracy in a less simulation time where l is the nodal spacing further increase of mlpg nodes either decreases or do not impact the accuracy and increases the computational time and hence is not recommended in all the test cases used in the sensitivity analysis the errors are within the permissible limits thereby verifying the robustness of the proposed models the errors in the mws rt model is relatively less compared to the mlpg rt model for the validation problems which are simple problems the mlpg rt and mws rt are further applied to a hypothetical rectangular case study and compared with standard rt3d model from the contour plots shown in fig 11 a it can be observed that the prediction of the future contamination near to the source is almost similar to rt3d solution and there is a slight variation while moving away from the source such a change is due to the low contamination values considered the results of the models are similar to the rt3d solutions as depicted by breakthrough curves in fig 11 b and table 2 table 2 and table 4 indicate the advantage of mws rt over mlpg rt model as a higher accuracy is obtained in a less computational time the mws method do not require a special handling of both the derivative and the dirichlet boundaries thus justifying the improved accuracy moreover as the mws rt model converts to rpcm rt model if there are no derivative boundaries the computational efficiency of the mws rt model will be much higher for the problems with all essential boundaries when compared to the mlpg rt model extending the application of the developed models to complex field like situations a hypothetical irregular boundary aquifer is considered as a second case study the flux derivative boundaries are considered on nine boundaries of the domain to increase the complexity in such a case the number of mlpg nodes is high as these nodes spread near to almost all the boundaries thus leaving only the interior nodes and a few boundary nodes to be modelled by rpcm due to this the improvement in the computational efficiency by the mws rt model reduces as more number of nodes require integration both the models can estimate the contamination similar to rt3d model as observed from fig 14 however the mlpg rt model solution is nearer to the results of rt3d the irregularities observed in the concentration contours of the mws model may be due to nodes in the support domains of such nodes being of both the rpcm and mlpg type and the effect due to this dissimilarity is greater in complex cases thus in the case of complex aquifers with more number of derivative or neumann boundaries the mlpg rt model is more efficient thus the two proposed models can reliably simulate the reactive transport phenomenon each model being better than the other based on the complexity of the problem 7 conclusions in this paper two meshless based reactive transport simulation models are presented for the determination of the fate of the contaminants undergoing sorption and decay reactions along with advection and dispersion mechanisms the developed weak form based meshless local petrov galerkin reactive transport mlpg rt model can be considered as a reliable tool for modelling real aquifer problems with derivative boundaries the moving least squares mls scheme is used for the shape function approximation with respect to circular support domains crank nicolson scheme is used for the time discretization the complexity and the high computational efforts required in the mlpg rt model are reduced by coupling it with radial point collocation method rpcm to obtain meshless weak strong mws form model mws rt which can be applied to aquifers with dirichlet boundaries or fewer derivative boundaries the developed mlpg rt and mws rt models are validated with three one dimensional and one two dimensional problems and there is an excellent similarity with the analytical solutions in all the cases the mws rt model is observed to be more accurate than the mlpg rt model for the validation cases further the models are applied to a hypothetical rectangular aquifer with two derivative boundaries the results are in good agreement with the rt3d solutions and the mws rt model is observed to perform better for a hypothetical irregular boundary aquifer resembling a real aquifer the results of both the models are satisfactory however the results of mlpg rt model are observed to be closer to the rt3d solution thereby proving the advantage of weak form methods for complex real aquifers but with increased computational time mlpg rt and mws rt can be used as alternatives to the existing numerical reactive transport simulation models depending on the complexity of the aquifer and the available computational resources as the proposed models are stable and have a good accuracy credit

1264,in this paper two meshless methods namely a weak form meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method and meshless weak strong mws form method obtained by combining mlpg with a strong form radial point collocation method rpcm are presented for simulation of advection dispersion reaction phenomena of the contaminants in the porous media the first order decay and sorption reactions are considered in this study the crank nicolson scheme is applied for the time discretization the weak form mlpg is a truly meshless and robust numerical technique that can be applied to complex aquifer systems with derivative boundaries however in this method the computational time is increased due to the integration which is not essential for simple problems thus the mlpg method is further coupled with a strong form rpcm with an aim of decreasing the background integration by modelling only the nodes around the derivative boundaries using mlpg method and the other nodes by a direct rpcm which do not require integration the proposed mws model automatically converts into a complete rpcm model if there are no derivative boundaries thus this model being both accurate and computationally efficient is suitable for simple and moderately complex aquifer systems and mlpg is the most stable and reliable method for modelling the most complex aquifer problems both the developed models are tested with available analytical solutions and applied for hypothetical case studies the results prove the efficiency of the models and the applicability of each model is described in detail keywords

introduction groundwater is a vital resource serving about one third of global drinking water demand one fourth of industrial water demand and 40 of agricultural water demand international association of hydrogeologists 2020 which are expected to further increase in the future owing to its extensive use the contamination of groundwater is a major concern to the hydrogeologists the research on subsurface contamination started in the early 1960s and became widely popular after the term contaminant hydrogeology was introduced by cherry et al 1975 aiming at the attenuation of contaminants and protection of aquifers the prediction of the contaminant behavior is extremely necessary for the mitigation of groundwater pollution a reliable prediction requires a scientific understanding of the contaminant fate controlling processes namely the advection hydrodynamic dispersion and the reactions in groundwater khondaker et al 1990 sorption is a reaction process that involves the exchange of molecules between the contaminant and the porous media todd and mays 2004 and it includes the adsorption absorption and chemisorption of the contaminant particles into the solid surface goltz and huang 2017 which retard the contaminant movement the solubility controlled reactions and hydrophobic reactions may also cause retardation jackson and hoehn 1987 certain contaminants especially the toxic and radioactive contaminants degrade over time the complex reactive transport phenomenon comprising of these processes can be analyzed with the help of mathematical simulation models based on the laws of conservation of mass energy and momentum sharma et al 2020 several analytical mathematical models were derived for the reactive transport equation by carslaw and jaeger 1959 ogata and banks 1961 brenner 1962 lindstrom et al 1967 bear 1972 mariño 1974 van genuchten 1982 domenico 1987 wexler 1992 lunn et al 1996 park and zhan 2001 and jones et al 2006 the analytical solutions are mathematically exact solutions and are widely used for validating the numerical solutions however the analytical models are capable of modelling only the aquifers with simple geometry with constant changes in space and time and simple initial and boundary conditions thus for the practical problems where the analytical solutions are impossible to derive numerical models are the most suitable alternatives bear and cheng 2010 conventional numerical methods such as the finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem are widely used to model the reactive transport phenomenon which result in reliable solutions these methods involve gridding meshing the aquifer domain and the solution evolves from one space and time step to another for a particular order of accuracy the errors in these models can be controlled by using a finer grid mesh sharma et al 2011 the creation and recreation of mesh grid are expensive and cannot be completely automated without compromising the accuracy of the solution thus making the process of adaptive analysis complex liu and gu 2005 moreover the reduction of errors is not straightforward for the problems with high peclet numbers steefel and macquarrie 2018 the finite volume method fvm is another widely used numerical technique where unstructured grids meshes can be used to represent the problem domain fvm though having the advantages of local accuracy and being an integral scheme has a limitation when compared to fem that the functions for solution approximation cannot be easily made as higher order the difficulties arising due to the involvement of grid mesh in fdm fem and fvm are alleviated in the meshless methods as only the nodes are arranged inside and on the domain and a connection between these nodes is not required the meshless techniques can be classified as weak strong and hybrid weak strong form methods liu and gu 2005 weak form methods involve integration of governing equation before converting it to a system of algebraic equations on the other hand in the strong form method a collocation technique is applied to the governing equation the strong form methods are truly meshless as they do not require background cells throughout the solution procedure they are also faster and direct to simulate however the stability and the accuracy of the solution reduce the problems with derivative boundaries liu and gu 2005 therefore for the real aquifer problems which involve derivative boundaries the strong form based models may not be robust such complications are resolved in the weak form methods due to the integration process pathania et al 2020 in these methods the continuity requirement is weakened and the accuracy is improved but at a cost of higher computational efforts in the meshless weak strong mws form methods the weak and strong form methods are coupled to obtain the advantages of both methods liu and gu 2003 recently some of the meshless methods are applied to study the transport of reactive contaminants in porous media tartakovsky et al 2007 applied meshless smooth particle hydrodynamics sph to simulate the reactive transport and mineral precipitation phenomena herrera et al 2009 proposed a stable and accurate sph model to simulate the plume movement in heterogeneous aquifers tartakovsky et al 2016 further applied sph for solving multi phase navier stokes and advection dispersion reaction equations in porous media anshuman et al 2019 presented radial point collocation method rpcm based meshless reactive transport simulation model for sorption and decay reactions ahmad et al 2020 presented a local meshless scheme based on inverse multiquadric imq radial basis function rbf for space discretization coupled with caputo definition approximation for time discretization for modelling solute transport phenomenon yekta et al 2021 coupled a reaction package phreeqcrm with imperial college finite element reactive simulator ic ferst for the simulation of reactive transport and in the proposed method the geological features are represented by a meshless procedure using non uniform rational b spline pathania et al 2020 developed simulation model for coupled flow and reactive transport using a weak form element free galerkin method efgm anshuman and eldho 2022 further extended the rpcm based reactive transport model for the contaminant transport modelling with nonlinear adsorption reactions in heterogeneous aquifers in this study two new reactive transport simulation models based on meshless local petrov galerkin mlpg method and a hybrid mlpg and radial point collocation method rpcm based meshless weak strong mws form method are presented with an objective of obtaining robust models which are efficient in terms of accuracy as well as computational cost mlpg is a powerful and truly meshless weak form method which was first developed by atluri and zhu 1998 further mlpg was successfully applied for the computation of groundwater flow swathi and eldho 2013 swathi and eldho 2014 mohtashami et al 2017 mohtashami et al 2022 for the simulation of non reactive contaminant transport swathi and eldho 2017 groundwater remediation ilati and dehghan 2016 the study of groundwater management swathi and eldho 2018 and estimation of recharge by injection wells doulabi et al 2019 the concept of hybrid weak and strong form methods was first presented by liu and gu 2003 a combination of mlpg and radial point interpolation method rpim with implicit time stepping scheme was investigated for the study of mobile immobile advection diffusion transport phenomenon by ghehsareh et al 2018 ghehsareh et al 2019a extended the model for the study of modified anomalous process where the source term is nonlinear ghehsareh et al 2019b and ghehsareh et al 2019c applied the hybrid mlpg rpim model to the reaction diffusion process and tricomi type equation das and eldho 2022a applied coupled rpcm mlpg mws model for flow simulation and das and eldho 2022b extended rpcm mlpg mws model for coupled flow and transport simulation mlpg model is a powerful numerical tool which can produce reliable solutions even for the most complex real aquifers involving derivative boundaries also being a local weak form meshless method mlpg is truly meshless liu and gu 2005 in the present study the first reactive transport model is based on mlpg which is used for the first time for the formulation and simulation of the groundwater advection dispersion reaction phenomena for the reactive contaminants undergoing first order decay and sorption reactions with an objective of creating a robust meshless tool with minimum preprocessing efforts however mlpg requires a higher computational cost thus causing a limitation for simple problems for which a complex modelling procedure is not necessary thus the developed mlpg model is further coupled with a reactive transport model based on strong form rpcm to obtain the second model proposed in this study which is a mws model that can simulate the reactive transport phenomenon with higher accuracy and with less computational cost das and eldho 2022a such a hybrid mws method is for the first time proposed in the reactive transport studies the presented mws model can automatically convert itself to a complete rpcm model in the absence of derivative boundaries thus reducing the computational cost for simple problems both the developed models are validated with the available analytical solutions and are applied to hypothetical case studies and the merits are discussed 2 governing equation and boundary conditions 2 1 reactive transport the governing equation for the transport of a reactive contaminant undergoing decay and sorption reactions in a two dimensional aquifer with an assumption that the reactions occur only in the dissolved phase is given by bear and cheng 2010 1 x d xx c x y d yy c y v x c x v y c y λc r c t where c is concentration and t represents time vx vy dxx and dyy are velocities and dispersion coefficients in x and y directions r is the retardation factor given as rastogi 2012 2 r 1 ρ b k d η e in which kd is the sorption distribution coefficient and ρb and ηe are the bulk density and effective porosity of the medium λ is decay rate calculated in terms of half life t1 2 as groch 1998 3 λ ln 2 t 1 2 assuming that initially the entire aquifer domain ω is contaminated with a concentration of c0 the initial condition can be written as bear 1972 4 c x y 0 c 0 x y x y ω the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are given by bear 1972 5 c x y t c 1 x y t x y ω 1 6 d xx c x n x d yy c y n y g x y t x y ω 2 in which nx and ny are the unit normal vectors c1 is a constant concentration at the dirichlet boundary ω1 and g is the flux at the neumann boundary ω2 therefore for all the meshless nodes on the dirichlet boundary the unknown concentration c in the governing eq 1 becomes c1 for all the neumann boundary nodes a constant concentration flux of g is incorporated in the meshless techniques as described later in section 3 5 2 2 groundwater flow the governing equation describing unconfined aquifer flow is given by bear 1979 7 x k x h h x y k y h h y s y h t w 1 w q w δ x x w y y w f the meaning of the various notations used in the eq 7 the initial and boundary conditions the formulation and validation of the mlpg and mws flow models are given by das and eldho 2022a and das and eldho 2022b the mlpg and mws flow models result in head values h which can further be applied for the calculation of velocity and dispersion coefficient using the equations bear 1972 8 v x k x h x v y k y h y 9 d xx α x v x 2 α y v y 2 v x 2 v y 2 d e d yy α x v y 2 α y v x 2 v x 2 v y 2 d e where αx and αy are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities and de is effective diffusion coefficient diffusion is usually ignored in contaminant transport simulation as it has a very low effect in fate of contaminant in porous media when compared to dispersion and is important only at low flow velocities goltz and huang 2017 therefore in eq 9 the term de can be ignored in the present study here the unknown heads at each meshless node are calculated using the flow model which are further applied for the computation of vx vy dxx and dyy at each node using eqs 8 and 9 finally the nodal velocities and dispersivities are given as inputs to the reactive transport model by substituting vx vy dxx and dyy in the governing eq 1 as applied in the case studies discussed in section 5 3 meshless models 3 1 moving least squares mls scheme in this study the moving least squares mls method lancaster and salkauskas 1981 with fourth order spline weight function is adopted for the interpolation of the unknown concentration at a node in terms of the concentrations at the nodes lying within its support domain using the shape function φ the shape function is calculated as swathi and eldho 2017 10 φ p a 1 b 11 where a p t wp and b p t w p is the matrix of basis of dimensions n m which is considered as a linear basis in the present study here n is the number of support domain nodes and m 3 for linear basis w is diagonal matrix of weight function and is of dimensions an n n 3 2 mlpg formulation the eq 1 describing the reactive transport phenomenon can be written as 12 r c t d c vc λc multiplying eq 12 with a suitable test function represented by υ and integrating over small areas called sub domains ωs atluri and zhu 1998 13 ω s d c υdω ω s vc υdω ω s λc υdω r ω s c t υdω in this study the integration is performed by the gauss quadrature method using circular integration sub domains of radius 0 3 to 0 7 times the nodal spacing the gauss quadrature method for the integration of a function converts the integral term into a weighted sum of that function value over gauss points in this study 12 gauss points are considered the shape and the size of the sub domain is assumed to be the same for all the nodes by divergence theorem eq 13 can be represented as 14 ω s d c nυ dω ω s d c υdω ω s vc υdω ω s λc υdω r ω s c t υdω where n is unit normal vector and ωs is the sub domain boundary the mlpg5 method is considered atluri 2004 where the test function υ is substituted as the heaviside step function assuming that the aquifer is isotropic and dispersivity and velocity are constant in each sub domain for the jth node the eq 14 reduces to 15 d j ω s j c j x n x c j y n y dω v j ω s c j dω ω s λ c j dω r ω s c j t dω where cj is the concentration at the jth node the unknown terms cj derived by the mlpg5 method are replaced by the shape functions using mls technique as a weighted sum of the concentration values in a support domain surrounding the jth node using the mls approximation technique the unknown concentration at node j can be represented as 16 c j x y t p 1 n p x y c p t where n is number of support domain nodes p represents nodes inside the support domain φ can be obtained from eqs 10 and 11 and c p is the fictitious concentration at the pth support domain node therefore eq 15 can be written as 17 d j ω s j p 1 n p x c p n x p 1 n p y c p n y dω v j ω s p 1 n p x c p n x p 1 n p

2005 for the time discretization the finite difference method fdm is best suited as per the numerical experiments conducted by pinder and gray 1977 wang and anderson 1982 and swathi and eldho 2013 therefore the implicit crank nicholson scheme is used for time discretization for a better stability of the solutions here the unknown concentration is considered as an average value at two time steps t and t 1 resulting in a relaxation parameter θ value of 0 5 rastogi 2012 18 ω s j d xx j p 1 n p x c p t 1 n x d yy j p 1 n p y c p t 1 n y dω ω s v x j p 1 n p x c p t 1 n x v y j p 1 n p y c p t 1

eq 18 represents the mlpg formulation at the jth node the equations at all the nodes can be assembled to form a global equation therefore rearranging the terms and using the notation φ from eq 10 19 ω

in section 3 6 3 3 rpcm formulation considering a multi quadric radial basis function mq rbf for the interpolation of concentration using nodes in support domain the equation for shape function can be written as 23 p r p 2 α c d c 2 q t a p t b where rp is the distance from a node under consideration to a node in its support domain the subscript p represents support domain nodes pt is transpose of linear basis αc and q are mq rbf parameters dc is known as characteristic length which is taken as average nodal spacing and a and b are unknown coefficients in this study q is fixed as 0 98 as it is a recommended value for this parameter liu and gu 2005 and αc is maintained between 2 and 3 as the mws model is observed to be stable for these values the concentration at node j are estimated in terms of the shape function mentioned in eq 23 as 24 c j x y t p 1 n p x y c p t substituting eq 24 in the governing eq 1 25 x d xx p 1 n p x c p y d yy p 1 n p y c p v x p 1 n p x c p v y p 1 n p y c

further details of the validation and applicability of the rpcm rt model to the reactive transport simulation are presented in anshuman et al 2019 3 4 mws formulation in the mws method the mlpg and rpcm are applied to different set of nodes in the same problem the mlpg formulation is applied to the derivative boundary nodes and the meshless nodes within the support domain of these nodes together denoted as mlpg nodes das and eldho 2022a thus the eqs 20 21 and 22 are applied to the mlpg nodes all the other nodes are rpcm nodes to which the eqs 28 29 and 30 are applied therefore the mws formulation for the governing eq 1 can be represented as 31 k c t 1 f where a for the nodes on the derivative boundary and the nodes within the support domain of these nodes 32 k j ω s r t dω ω s d xx

model using matlab the detailed modelling procedure is described in section 3 6 3 5 application of boundary conditions in the mlpg model the penalty function is used for the application of dirichlet or essential boundary conditions of the reactive contaminant transport model here the dirichlet or essential boundary conditions are known concentrations if α is the penalty factor then the essential boundary condition is given by liu and gu 2005 36 α ω 1 i 1 n ϕ i x y c i α ω 1 c 1 x y ω 1 mlpg being a weak form method one of the advantages is that the derivative boundary conditions can be applied directly as 37 ω 2 d xx i 1 n ϕ i x n x d yy i 1 n ϕ i y n y c i g x y ω 2 in the mws model the derivative boundary conditions are applied using eq 37 the essential boundaries are modelled using rpcm therefore the essential boundary conditions can also be applied directly without special treatment as 38 p 1 n p c p c 1 x y ω 1 thus in the mlpg model the derivative and the essential boundaries do not require any special handling which is a reason for an improved accuracy 3 6 modelling procedure based on the formulations presented in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 the mlpg rt mlpg reactive transport and mws rt mws reactive transport models are developed in matlab following are the steps for the reactive transport simulation in aquifers using mlpg rt and mws rt models 1 the necessary inputs are given to the model the inputs required are aquifer geometry and properties initial and boundary conditions contaminant details retardation factor sorption coefficient and the total simulation time the nodal arrangement and the time step are selected 2 the aquifer is discretized using the nodal arrangement the model parameters such as shape and size of sub and support domain for mlpg model and an additional rpcm support domain size for the mws model are specified 3 the integration limits and the shape functions are determined for the mws model additionally the nodes are divided into mlpg and rpcm nodes based on their proximity to the derivative boundaries 4 for the mlpg model and mlpg nodes of mws model the k and f matrices are computed using eqs 20 21 and 22 for the rpcm nodes of the mws model eqs 28 29 and 30 are used to compute the k and f matrices at each node 5 the boundary conditions are applied the global k and f matrices are derived and the system is solved to obtain the unknown concentration values 6 the procedure is repeated for all the time steps till the final time considered is achieved flowcharts depicting simulation procedure of mlpg and mws models are shown in fig 1 4 validation of mlpg rt and mws rt models the developed models are verified using two hypothetical problems and the results are compared with the analytical solutions available in the literature 4 1 one dimensional validation 4 1 1 reactions involving single species decay the governing eq 1 for groundwater contaminant transport with single species decay can be written as anshuman et al 2019 39 c t d 2 c x 2 v c t λc a hypothetical one dimensional porous media of an assumed length of 10 m is used for the model verification fig 2 a the domain is discretized into 21 nodes with a spacing of 0 5 m for both mlpg and mws models as shown in fig 2 b the aquifer is assumed to be initially free of contamination therefore the initial condition can be written as 40 c x 0 0 a continuous source of c0 100 ppm is introduced on the left boundary and the right boundary l 10 m is impervious resulting in the boundary conditions as 41 c 0 t c 0 42 c x l t 0 the contaminant is assumed to have a decay rate of 0 5 day 1 the dispersion coefficient and velocity are considered as 0 8 m2 day and 1 m day in the mlpg rt model the support and sub domains of size 3l and 0 45l are used where l is the average distance between consecutive nodes or the nodal spacing in mws rt model a support domain of radius 3l and 2l is considered for mlpg and rpcm nodes resulting in 4 mlpg nodes and 17 rpcm nodes as depicted in fig 2 b the sub domain size for the mlpg nodes of mws rt model is considered as 0 45l the model is simulated for 30 days with a time step of 1 day the contamination concentration obtained from the mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with the analytical solution given by van genuchten 1982 by substituting r 1 in the equation 43 c x t c 0

table 1 a it can be observed that the results of the mlpg rt and mws rt models are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution thereby verifying the proposed models for simulation of 1d contaminant transport with decay 4 1 2 reactions involving only sorption the governing eq 1 for contaminant transport in porous media with sorption can be written as van genuchten 1982 46 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c t a 25 m long aquifer domain is considered for this example as shown in fig 4 a the domain is divided into 51 nodes out of which 4 are mlpg nodes and 47 are rpcm nodes for the mws model as depicted in fig 4 b the initial and boundary conditions are similar to that in section 4 1 1 as described in eqs 40 41 and 42 with the left end being considered as a dirichlet boundary with a constant concentration of 100 ppm and a zero flux right boundary the retardation factor velocity and dispersion coefficient are assumed to be 1 5 0 3 m day and 0 2 m2 day the radius of support domain is considered to be 3l 2l and 3l for the mlpg rt model rpcm and mlpg nodes of the mws rt model respectively a constant sub domain radius of 0 6l is assumed throughout the problem the concentration after 45 days of simulation considering a time step of 0 5 days from mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with the analytical solution given by van genuchten 1982 47 c x t c 0 1 2 erfc rx vt 2 drt 1 2 1 2

is given by anshuman et al 2019 48 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c t λc the porous media defined in section 4 1 1 is used for validation a hypothetical contaminant of decay rate 2 day 1 is introduced at the left boundary the retardation factor is assumed as r 3 the nodal arrangement similar to fig 2 b is adopted the analytical solution is computed from eqs 43 44 and 45 the concentration obtained after 30 days of simulation from mlpg rt and mws rt models are compared with analytical solution considering a time step of 1 day and the results are presented in fig 6 and table 1 c the simulated solutions are similar to the analytical solution with low errors thereby validating mlpg rt and mws rt models for simulating combined sorption and decay reactions 4 2 two dimensional validation the two dimensional mlpg rt and mws rt are verified with a 100 m 50 m rectangular hypothetical aquifer as shown in fig 7 a the top and the bottom boundaries are considered to have a constant concentration of 0 the right boundary is a no flux derivative boundary on the left boundary a continuous line source of 30 m is introduced which releases the contaminant having a decay constant 0 034 day 1 at a constant concentration of 1 ppm a space step size of 10 m is used in both x and y vertical directions thus 66 nodes 18 mlpg and 48 rpcm nodes in the mws model are placed on the aquifer as depicted in fig 7 b pore velocity is assumed as 1 2 m d the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are assumed as 0 3 m2 d and 0 03 m2 d considering a retardation coefficient of 1 and assuming zero velocity in the y direction the governing eq 1 can be reduced to goltz and huang 2017 49 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 v x c x λc the mlpg rt and mws rt models are run for a simulation period of 15 days with a time step of 1 day with the source releasing the contaminant during the entire run time the results are validated with the semi analytical solution given by goltz and huang 2017 from the concentration plot depicted in fig 8 a and the breakthrough curves at the 4 observation points p1 p2 p3 and p4 depicted in fig 8 b it can be concluded that both mlpg and mws methods can simulate the reactive transport phenomenon with a great accuracy thereby validating the mlpg rt and mws rt models for two dimensional problems 4 3 sensitivity studies the model solution varies with the nodal density the shape and size of the sub and support domain and the shape function considered the mlpg model is highly sensitive to the sub and support domain radii and hence the proper selection of these parameters are absolutely necessary to obtain the desired accuracy in addition to these parameters the accuracy of the mws model is also dependent on the division of nodes as the mlpg and rpcm nodes in this study the l norm error e and the root mean square error rmse are used as the indicators of accuracy here e is the maximum absolute error calculated as 50 e max c analytical c meshless and the rmse can be estimated as 51 rmse j 1 n nodes c j analytical c j meshless 2 n nodes where cj analytical and cj meshless are the concentrations at jth node obtained from the analytical solution and meshless mlpg or mws solution canalytical and cmeshless are the vectors of analytical and meshless mlpg or mws solutions at all nodes and nnodes is the total number of nodes in the aquifer domain the sensitivity studies are applied to the one dimensional case studies given in section 4 1 by varying one parameter at a time the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 9 where two different plots are presented for each model each plot representing e or rmse 4 3 1 sensitivity of the mlpg and mws models with respect to nodal density the variation of the accuracy with respect to the nodal spacing is tested for the one dimensional validation problems as shown in fig 9 a b and c this analysis serves as a basis for convergence study of the mlpg and mws models the mlpg and mws models are more accurate for a larger number of nodes or a lower nodal spacing and the error tends to zero as the number of nodes increases proving that these models satisfy the convergence criteria of the numerical models of error approaching a fixed value with an increased refinement however the computational time increases if the number of nodes are high therefore the nodal spacing is selected in such a way that the desired accuracy and stability is obtained in a least computational time for example in fig 9 b representing the validation problem 4 1 2 the number of nodes is taken as 50 as there is no significant improvement in accuracy on a further increase in number of nodes also from fig 9 the mws model is observed to be more accurate than the mlpg model for all the three validation cases and for all nodal spacings 4 3 2 sensitivity of the mlpg and mws models with respect to sub domain radius one of the limitations of the mlpg method is that the solution is highly dependent on the model parameters such as the sub and support domain the variation of error in the mlpg rt and mws rt models with respect to the ratio of sub domain radius to nodal spacing is depicted in fig 9 d e and f in all the cases the least error or maximum accuracy is obtained for a radius of sub domain of 0 3 to 0 7 times the nodal spacing thus justifying the selection of this range in the present study the dependency of mws model on the sub domain is relatively less and even zero as indicated by flat variation of error in fig 9 e and f in contrast to the steep curves of errors of the mlpg model thus it can be inferred that another advantage of the mws model is a reduced dependency of the solution on the sub domain radius 4 3 3 sensitivity of the mlpg model with respect to support domain as illustrated in fig 9 g h and i the mlpg rt model gives the best results for a support domain of range 2 to 4 times the nodal spacing thus the model is tested with the support domain radii of this range by the trial and error method to obtain the best solutions in general a support domain radius of 2l to 3l can give accurate results 4 3 4 sensitivity of the mws model with respect to ratio of mlpg and rpcm nodes the number of rpcm and mlpg nodes varies with support domain size of the mlpg nodes of mws rt model greater the support domain radius of the mlpg nodes lower is the computational efficiency due to an increase in the integration process thus the ratio of mlpg nodes to rpcm nodes is selected in such a way that the maximum accuracy is obtained in a minimum computational time fig 9 j k and l depict the change in accuracy of the mws model with a change in percentage of mlpg nodes out of the total number of nodes it can be observed that the change in error with the number of mlpg nodes is relatively less and hence the support domain of the mlpg nodes of mws model has a less impact on the accuracy however generally a support domain radius of 2l to 3l can be considered for the mlpg nodes 5 case studies here the developed models are further applied to two case studies the solutions are compared with finite difference method fdm based rt3d clement 1999 model in the mt3dms module of the groundwater modelling system gms aquaveo 2017 the velocities and dispersion coefficient are obtained from the flow model discussed in section 2 2 using the eqs 8 and 9 these are given as inputs to the mlpg rt and mws rt transport models 5 1 case study 1 a square aquifer of dimensions 600 m 600 m fig 10 a and thickness 10 m is considered for the demonstration of the application of mlpg rt and mws rt models for the study of reactive transport the east and west boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with zero concentration and constant head of 20 m and 10 m respectively there is zero flow and zero flux over the north and south boundaries initially the aquifer is free of contamination two wells are considered at w1 180 m 300 m and w2 420 m 300 m which inject tritium 3h a radioactive isotope of hydrogen in its liquid form i e tritiated water at a rate of 50 mg l through a recharge of 100 m3 day tritium reacts with oxygen and also can disintegrate into helium usepa 1999 due to a moderately high half life of 12 3 years tritium used as an indicator of hydrologic processes usepa 1999 tritium has a low sorption and therefore a distribution coefficient of 0 07 ml g thibault et al 1990 is considered in this study the aquifer bulk density and porosity are assumed to be 1 5 g cc and 0 3 with the above mentioned data the retardation coefficient and the decay constant can be calculated as 1 35 and 0 0001544 day 1 respectively using the eqs 2 and 3 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity are taken as 5 m and 1 m using a constant transmissivity of 100 m2 day the head and further the velocities and dispersion coefficients are calculated the domain is discretized into 121 nodes out of which 62 are mlpg nodes and 59 are rpcm nodes in the mws rt model as illustrated in fig 10 b the support domain radius in mlpg rt model is taken as 3l and in the mws rt model it is considered as 2l for the rpcm as well as the mlpg nodes a constant sub domain of radius 0 3l and 0 45l is taken in the mlpg rt model and mlpg nodes of mws rt model the mlpg rt and mws rt models are simulated for 150 days with a time step of 3 days a cell centered grid with 30 cells each along x and y directions is used in the rt3d model for an accurate prediction of contamination the comparison of the concentration contours and the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 11 a and b and the concentrations at the injection wells after 150 days is presented in table 2 as can be seen from fig 11 and table 2 both mlpg rt and mws rt models are satisfactorily simulating the concentration and matching well with the rt3d solution however the required computational time for mws rt model is much smaller as shown in table 4 5 2 case study 2 the mlpg rt and mws rt models are applied to an irregular hypothetical heterogeneous unconfined aquifer as shown in fig 12 the thickness of the aquifer is 10 m the east and the west boundaries are constant head boundaries and all the other boundaries have zero flow using the data given in fig 12 the velocities and dispersivities were calculated using the mlpg and mws flow models as described by das and eldho 2022a and are given as inputs to the mlpg rt and mws rt models the transverse dispersivity is considered to be 0 1 times the longitudinal dispersivity all over the domain the initial contamination is assumed to be zero all over the domain the longitudinal dispersivities are as mentioned in fig 12 and the transverse dispersivity is taken as 0 1 times the longitudinal dispersivity there is a square pond in the domain fig 12 which recharges the aquifer at 0 001 m day and injects cobalt 60 60co at a rate of 1 ppm the soils exposed to high traffic near to industries or ore deposits may contain cobalt which enters groundwater through the leaching process when rainfall occurs on such soils 60co is a radioactive isotope of cobalt which is released to the environment from nuclear reactors radiation therapy manufacture of plastic and sterilization of medical equipment and has a half life of 5 3 years atsdr 2004 the retardation coefficient is taken as 70 khayyun 2018 exposure to 60co may cause cancer and may affect the bones liver and kidney usepa 2021 an example of groundwater contamination by 60co is discussed and modelled by khayyun 2018 the aquifer is discretized into 209 nodes for the mlpg rt and mws rt models based on sensitivity studies the sub domain radius is assumed to be 0 4 l and 0 6 l in mlpg rt and mlpg nodes of mws rt model for mlpg rt model the support domain radius is considered as 3 l and for mws rt model a radius of 2 l is taken for the mlpg and rpcm nodes resulting in 143 and 66 mlpg and rpcm nodes respectively as illustrated in fig 13 the problem is simulated for 10 years with a time step of 10 days and the resulting concentration is depicted in fig 14 the problem is simulated with rt3d model with cell centered mesh grid with cell length 500 m the comparison of concentrations at 6 observation points near to the contamination pond is summarized in table 3 the total simulation time required for the mlpg and mws models for both the case studies is given in table 4 as can be in fig 14 and table 3 both mlpg rt and mws rt models are satisfactorily simulating the concentration distribution and comparable to the rt3d model results as expected the mlpg model results were closer to rt3d results but with a higher computational time 6 discussion as observed from the validation problems the mlpg rt and mws rt can simulate the single species reactive transport phenomenon with a better accuracy the models are first validated for one dimensional cases considering the decay and sorption reactions one at a time and then a combination of both the reactions in all the three problems the solutions of the models are exactly matching with the analytical solutions as indicated by fig 3 fig 5 and fig 6 the models are further validated for a two dimensional problem with a line source contaminant and the solutions are matching with the semi analytical solution as indicated by fig 8 the solutions being highly dependent on the model parameters are tested by changing one parameter at a time the accuracy of the mlpg rt and mws rt models are observed to increase with a decrease in nodal spacing thereby satisfying the convergence criteria with the error approaching zero with the refinement the mlpg method is observed to give the most accurate results for a sub domain radius of 0 3 to 0 7 times nodal spacing and a support domain radius of 2 or 3 times the nodal spacing and thus this range is adopted in the mlpg rt and the mws rt models in the mws scheme the radius of support domain directly influences the number of nodes executed by the mlpg and rpcm methods in this study percentage of mlpg nodes corresponding to a mlpg support domain radius of 2l to 3l is observed to give the desired accuracy in a less simulation time where l is the nodal spacing further increase of mlpg nodes either decreases or do not impact the accuracy and increases the computational time and hence is not recommended in all the test cases used in the sensitivity analysis the errors are within the permissible limits thereby verifying the robustness of the proposed models the errors in the mws rt model is relatively less compared to the mlpg rt model for the validation problems which are simple problems the mlpg rt and mws rt are further applied to a hypothetical rectangular case study and compared with standard rt3d model from the contour plots shown in fig 11 a it can be observed that the prediction of the future contamination near to the source is almost similar to rt3d solution and there is a slight variation while moving away from the source such a change is due to the low contamination values considered the results of the models are similar to the rt3d solutions as depicted by breakthrough curves in fig 11 b and table 2 table 2 and table 4 indicate the advantage of mws rt over mlpg rt model as a higher accuracy is obtained in a less computational time the mws method do not require a special handling of both the derivative and the dirichlet boundaries thus justifying the improved accuracy moreover as the mws rt model converts to rpcm rt model if there are no derivative boundaries the computational efficiency of the mws rt model will be much higher for the problems with all essential boundaries when compared to the mlpg rt model extending the application of the developed models to complex field like situations a hypothetical irregular boundary aquifer is considered as a second case study the flux derivative boundaries are considered on nine boundaries of the domain to increase the complexity in such a case the number of mlpg nodes is high as these nodes spread near to almost all the boundaries thus leaving only the interior nodes and a few boundary nodes to be modelled by rpcm due to this the improvement in the computational efficiency by the mws rt model reduces as more number of nodes require integration both the models can estimate the contamination similar to rt3d model as observed from fig 14 however the mlpg rt model solution is nearer to the results of rt3d the irregularities observed in the concentration contours of the mws model may be due to nodes in the support domains of such nodes being of both the rpcm and mlpg type and the effect due to this dissimilarity is greater in complex cases thus in the case of complex aquifers with more number of derivative or neumann boundaries the mlpg rt model is more efficient thus the two proposed models can reliably simulate the reactive transport phenomenon each model being better than the other based on the complexity of the problem 7 conclusions in this paper two meshless based reactive transport simulation models are presented for the determination of the fate of the contaminants undergoing sorption and decay reactions along with advection and dispersion mechanisms the developed weak form based meshless local petrov galerkin reactive transport mlpg rt model can be considered as a reliable tool for modelling real aquifer problems with derivative boundaries the moving least squares mls scheme is used for the shape function approximation with respect to circular support domains crank nicolson scheme is used for the time discretization the complexity and the high computational efforts required in the mlpg rt model are reduced by coupling it with radial point collocation method rpcm to obtain meshless weak strong mws form model mws rt which can be applied to aquifers with dirichlet boundaries or fewer derivative boundaries the developed mlpg rt and mws rt models are validated with three one dimensional and one two dimensional problems and there is an excellent similarity with the analytical solutions in all the cases the mws rt model is observed to be more accurate than the mlpg rt model for the validation cases further the models are applied to a hypothetical rectangular aquifer with two derivative boundaries the results are in good agreement with the rt3d solutions and the mws rt model is observed to perform better for a hypothetical irregular boundary aquifer resembling a real aquifer the results of both the models are satisfactory however the results of mlpg rt model are observed to be closer to the rt3d solution thereby proving the advantage of weak form methods for complex real aquifers but with increased computational time mlpg rt and mws rt can be used as alternatives to the existing numerical reactive transport simulation models depending on the complexity of the aquifer and the available computational resources as the proposed models are stable and have a good accuracy credit
