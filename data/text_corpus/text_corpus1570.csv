7850,study region the conterminous united states study focus the noaa atlases have provided the standard precipitation frequency estimates pfes for over two decades in the united states but they are losing that status due to climate change this study evaluates the atlases compared to new pfes developed based on the automated surface observing system and regional frequency analysis asos rfa as a benchmark and examines a radar based precipitation product as a data source eligible for developing the post atlas new hydrological insights for the region the stationarity assumption of precipitation was highlighted as a significant factor in increasing the uncertainties in the atlases the atlases explicitly tended to underestimate pfes compared to the asos rfa the difference between the atlases and the asos rfa increases as the return period increases and the duration decreases the age of the atlases correlated with the difference suggesting that recent observations diverge from older estimates the radar based pfes are well matched with the asos rfa at frequent return periods but the uncertainties increased as the return period increased this is because the conventional bias correction was limited in improving the annual maximum series of precipitation lastly we need to pay careful attention to an increase in precipitation frequency estimates shorter than 12 hr durations graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood extreme precipitation precipitation frequency estimate noaa atlas nexrad stage iv radar based idf curve data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events have rapidly grown within the majority of the united states in the last two decades noaa u s climate extremes index 2016 wright et al 2019 the continuity of this trend is expected to continue and has been considered in projecting dynamic atmospheric phenomenons with many global climate models sillmann et al 2013 mallakpour and villarini 2015 there is a strong argument that flooding driven by extreme precipitation has already exceeded infrastructure design criteria primarily based on intensity duration frequency idf curves kunkel et al 2003 vu and mishra 2019 swain et al 2020 therefore consistently updating idf curves following an informed evaluation of the risk associated with a change in the trend of extreme weather events is essential to prevent substantial loss of life and property from catastrophic floods keifer and chu 1957 kidd et al 2017 degaetano and castellano 2018 sun et al 2019 this study aims to assess the standard idf curves and evaluate radar based precipitation data as the primary data for developing the post atlas in the united states an idf curve describes precipitation intensity e g precipitation frequency estimates hereafter pfe as a function of duration for a given return period which can be converted to a depth duration frequency ddf curve idf curves help to understand the tendency of extreme precipitation in a return period a map of pfes from idf curves is a tool to capture a change in the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation in both gauged and ungauged areas idf curves are commonly used for several purposes including the development of flood maps by representing occurrence probabilities of extreme scenarios dupont and allen 2000 elsebaie 2012 flood design and hydraulic infrastructure assessment mamo 2015 yan et al 2019 stormwater management chin 2004 engineering design and standard development resiliency evaluation and vulnerability assessment keifer and chu 1957 kidd et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the development of idf curves typically involves fitting historical precipitation observations to theoretical extreme value distributions and is heavily dependent on the length and quality of the record ghebreyesus et al 2021 many countries and local governments have developed standard idf curve data for their territories to support engineering and scientific fields akan 1993 martel et al 2021 the national weather service s hydrometeorological design studies center national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa developed a set of stationary idf curve maps under the project noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency atlas of the united states hereafter atlas 14 for the conterminous united states conus wright et al 2019 atlas 14 serves as the nation s standard for understanding site specific precipitation events and provides precipitation depth in various durations and return periods for a unit grid approx 1 km 1 km which are statistically derived from measurements collected at ground weather stations part of the national weather service nws cooperative observer program leathers et al 2020 eleven volumes of atlas 14 have been developed to aid in better informed decision making regarding infrastructure investment design and managing flood risks and water resources before atlas 14 atlas 2 was developed using observation records prior to 1970 for the northwestern u s region including washington oregon idaho montana and wyoming which atlas 14 does not cover atlases were developed based on the temporal stationarity of precipitation which assumes that the occurrence probability of extreme precipitations is not expected to change over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 however climate change has altered the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation over time and most climate models project that the features of extreme precipitation will continue to grow throughout the twenty first century ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 ning et al 2015 thus this has raised practical concerns about assuming stationarity of the annual maximum series ams of precipitation to design infrastructure with a life that extends well into the future degaetano and castellano 2018 there were many efforts to consider the nonstationarity of precipitation by adopting and developing various methods to address the expected change in extreme precipitation enhanced by climate change katz et al 2002 rodr√≠guez et al 2014 degaetano and castellano 2017 data used in the development of atlases are also disputed over time firstly the outdated climatic records of atlases are limited in their validity for application to future climate conditions unless updated to current and future trends guo 2006 mailhot and duchesne 2010 shrestha et al 2017 degaetano and castellano 2018 pointed out that the practice of including stations with a record of limited length that end several decades before the present should be avoided secondly the heterogeneity of the gauge data features is another concern since gauge data vary in the quality and quantity of the measurements the length of a gauge s record is significantly different from another and may be reported at varying time intervals leathers et al 2020 also there is inconsistency in the number of gauges used in developing idf curves for different durations e g 1 min sub daily and daily the locational distribution of gauges also varies considerably lacking reliable spatial coverage leathers et al 2020 sparse gauge coverage thus requires a large portion of data to rely on interpolation and extrapolation ghebreyesus et al 2021 which is problematic provided that the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation events and that the gauges are only small point measurements kidd et al 2017 gao et al 2018 kim et al 2020 even in some better situations adjacent gauges have surprisingly limited correlational ability habib et al 2001 many studies have attempted various methods by employing remote sensing data such as high resolution precipitation data from weather radars e g next generation weather radar hereafter nexrad a network of 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars operated by nws and satellites to address the limitations of idf curves developed based on gauge data radar based precipitation data i e quantitative precipitation estimation hereafter qpe derived from a radar reflectivity rain rate relationship have been utilized to develop a map of pfe using its ability to represent the spatial distribution of precipitation marra et al 2019 ghebreyesus et al 2021 wright et al 2020 demonstrated the utility of a qpe product in building storm catalogs as part of the stochastic storm transposition method for producing idf estimates a high resolution spatio temporal precipitation pattern of remote sensing data is used to improve estimates of areal reduction factors for transforming idf values from point based gauge data to areal estimates omranian et al 2018 transformations are based on the structure of precipitation s spatial correlation qiao et al 2014 and the development of a flood frequency analysis framework reliant on stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 the gridded format of these remote sensing data reduces the uncertainty introduced by interpolation methods required to develop a map of pfes from gauge data the common idea in the aforementioned studies employing remote sensing data is taking advantage of high resolutions representing better spatial patterns of precipitation than ground observations depending on the quality of remote sensing data they directly or indirectly used the remote sensing data to develop new pfes while there is ongoing advancement in sensors and algorithms used there is concern about the accuracy of the data as several validation efforts have noted their limitations in capturing heavy storm events prat and nelson 2015 a radar observation system is affected by geological factors that block radar reflectivities such as mountains and earth curvature also there are well known challenges e g precipitation classification vertical reflectivity profile correction and bias correction to improving qpe at the ground level wesson 2014 kim et al 2015 yoo et al 2016 satellite data typically can provide a longer record of data and at a larger scale than radar data however satellite data has a lower spatial resolution than radar data and is typically less accurate and sensitive to weather conditions kim et al 2020 kim and han 2021 employing the atlas may not be appropriate in some u s regions due to the limitations mentioned above and the current climate circumstances a few studies assessed the atlas only for selected states against the developed pfes and the studies evaluating the atlas over the conus with decent data are barely found wallis et al 2007 ghebreyesus et al 2021 since the ease of accessing remote sensing data has been approximately equivalent to that of collecting gauge data the use of remote sensing data is a technical advancement that should be further developed and it has various other benefits compared to gauge data such as the capability in representing spatial distributions of precipitation this study aims to answer questions that require explicit description before developing a remote sensing data based idf map at a continental scale the two questions are as follows 1 are the atlases able to represent the precipitation intensity of extreme storms under the current climate conditions 2 could the qpe driven idf curves be an appropriate alternative to the atlases the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces application data methods and research strategy section 3 presents mixed results that could provide insights and preliminary answers to the questions above including the atlases evaluation the radar qpe evaluation and correction and a comparison of idf curves from different sources section 4 discusses the potential uncertainties which may arise from the applied procedures and addresses the conclusion of the study all terminologies with its acronym mentioned in this study are listed in appendix a 2 material and method 2 1 data 2 1 1 study area and gauge data fig 1 shows the entire study domain the conus with the automated surface observing systems asos and the gauge locations hereafter atlas gauges used in the development of the atlas 14 asos is a well known weather observation system with more than 913 operational observation stations in the u s that provide high temporal resolution data a 60 minute precipitation measurement of asos is used as the primary data to develop the benchmark pfes evaluate atlases and correct biases in stage iv asos data from 2002 to 2021 are used we believe the period represents the current climate circumstances the asos data is available from the online site https mesonet agron iastate edu request asos 1 minphtml atlas gauges consist of various ground based observation systems operated by various agencies according to atlas volume 1 semiarid southwest the primary source of precipitation data is the national weather service cooperative observer program s daily and hourly stations as for the other sources precipitation data from county flood control districts the state department of water resources and the u s geological survey are employed for more detail the atlas public reports are available for each region https www weather gov owp hdsc currentpf this study used the ams data in the atlas gauges that the noaa provides the ams data is used to replicate the pfes under various conditions to validate the atlases also the locations of the atlas gauges are used as the sampling points to evaluate the atlases in comparison to asos rfa quantitatively 2 1 2 noaa atlas noaa developed a range of atlas pfes representing frequent and extreme precipitation scenarios in the united states the pfes for durations from 5 min to 60 day and annual exceedance probabilities from ¬Ω to 1 1000 corresponding to 2 to 1 000 year annual recurrence intervals are provided noaa atlas exists as either atlas 2 or 14 depending on the development years and regions atlas 2 the first version of noaa atlas was developed for 11 states montana wyoming colorado new mexico idaho utah nevada arizona washington oregon and california located west of 100 w longitude in atlas 2 noaa provides the gridded idf curve based on the ams approach for the northwestern u s region covering the states of washington oregon idaho montana and wyoming the primary data sources were climatological data for the u s by sections and hourly precipitation data the precipitation record used in the development of atlas 2 is outdated by over 50 years suggesting that atlas 2 might not be eligible to represent extreme storm events under current climate conditions due to the accelerated climate change the gridded idf curve data is available online https www weather gov owp hdsc noaa atlas2 the data is limited to two storm durations 6 and 24 h and two return periods 2 and 100 years since the early 2000s the noaa has been updating pfes for various regions of the united states and affiliated territories updated estimates with relevant supplementary information are published in noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency atlas of the united states atlas 14 updates are done in stages based on state boundaries the first volume of atlas 14 was released in 2004 and the latest volume for texas was finished in 2018 as it took around 20 years to develop atlas 14 for various regions the period of precipitation data used in each region is different volume 1 for the semiarid southwest region used precipitation records up to 2000 and volume 11 for the state of texas used up to 2017 this is a point that many previous studies are concerned about regarding the inconsistency of considered years and the absence of recent years except for texas of used precipitation records lopez cantu and samaras 2018 wright et al 2019 the cell size of atlas 14 is approximately 1 0 km 0 00833 degrees in the latest volume of atlas 14 for texas pfes have been derived for a range of frequencies and durations using a regional frequency analysis approach based on l moment statistics calculated from the ams in the development of atlas 14 the gev was selected for all regions in the conus the volumes 1 and 2 of the atlas provide the goodness of fit test result which generally recommends the gev as it showed the best fit to data for most regions than any other distributions since the volume 6 the third volume for the region in conus the gev was not the best fit distribution but acceptable and selected for consistency in frequency estimates over the conus including texas 2 1 3 nexrad stage iv the nws national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv is the qpe product used in this study stage iv is a near real time product that is generated at ncep separately based on the nexrad precipitation processing system fulton et al 1998 and the nws river forecast center rfc precipitation processing nelson et al 2016 the stage iv used in this study is based on the multi sensor hourly stage iii analyses on local 4 km polar stereographic grids produced by the 12 rfcs in conus ncep mosaics stage iii into a national product i e stage iv in addition stage iv differs from the ncep stage ii chiefly in that the ncep stage ii contains no manual quality control while stage iv benefits from manual quality control performed on the stage iii data at the rfcs for more information the stage iv precipitation processing details are well documented in nelson et al 2016 many studies have used stage iv as a reference and benchmark for analysis and comparison with comparable precipitation products based on remote sensing observation systems suggesting that the overall quality and accuracy of stage iv are acceptable for hydrological purposes especially stage iv showed a good performance at a high rain rate 90th percentile nelson et al 2016 however since the performance of stage iv varies with regions a part of this study includes the evaluation of stage iv against gauge observations 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 framework three analyses were mainly implemented to answer the two questions raised in the introduction 1 validation of the atlases from the data and methodology perspectives 2 evaluation of the atlases using a benchmark and 3 evaluation of the stage iv idf curves before the primary analyses the pre processing to fill missing data and detect remove outliers was implemented for asos and stage iv data a simple interpolation method using a time window as a parameter was employed to fill missing data outliers were detected using the inter quartile range iqr method to define outliers upper and lower bounds the iqr method has a scale factor to adjust the bounds and is 1 5 in general this study considered the scale factor for only the upper bound and determined it based on a sensitivity analysis scale factor 5 0 detected outliers were removed and replaced with the interpolated value 1 min precipitation of asos was accumulated and converted to 60 min duration precipitation to match the temporal resolution of stage iv in the validation of the atlases the ams used in the development of the atlas 14 in texas was employed since the latest period of ams data is available up to 2017 the last year of the data is 2018 but it is excluded due to the relatively few numbers of gauges fundamental analyses to understand a trend of the ams validate the selected probability distribution and examine the effect of precipitation nonstationarity on developing idf curves were mainly used the automated surface observing system and regional frequency analysis asos rfa was developed based on the recent 20 years of asos data from 796 gauge locations across the conus to evaluate the atlases asos was selected since the density as a single gauge observation system is comparable with the atlas gauge network and able to provide the latest precipitation data in the evaluation process the difference defined as the difference percentage between pfes from asos rfa and atlas was used as a criterion for measuring uncertainties in the atlas the atlas was paired with asos rfa by sampling pfes collocated with the selected asos gauges to examine the eligibility of stage iv for developing idf curves hourly stage iv precipitation data was evaluated against asos data using the bias correction factor bcf bcf was selected as it measures systematic errors against gauge data and can directly correct biases in the stage iv to improve the accuracy of ams bias correction was implemented to improve the accuracy of hourly precipitation data from stage iv using 60 min asos precipitation data to understand the accuracy of extreme precipitation estimates of stage iv the ams of the corrected and uncorrected stage iv were evaluated against asos data the corrected data were used to develop the stage iv based pfes the conus is the primary domain to develop new pfe assess the noaa atlas and answer the questions raised in the introduction texas is used to review and validate the methodology developed in the noaa atlas and this study as the state is the latest development i e the last volume of the noaa atlas 14 based on the recent period of record 2 2 2 frequency analysis regional frequency analysis rfa based on the index flood procedures was employed to develop new pfes from asos and stage iv precipitation data the rfa was developed to derive more reasonable idf curves by analyzing multi site sampling data in a homogeneous region rather than using single site data hosking and wallis 2002 the rfa is similar to the at site frequency analysis mainly consisting of the four steps the ams preprocessing fitting ams to theoretical distributions selecting a distribution and deriving pfes for a specific scenario of a storm e g duration and return period however the rfa requires a regionalization process by categorizing groups of gauges having statistical similarities in the general rfa process the quantile function of the frequency distribution at site i is defined as follows 1 q i f Œº i q f i 1 n where a Œº i is a scaling factor defined as the index flood b q f is the regional growth curve as a function of f ranging from 0 to 1 c f is an annual exceedance probability in precipitation frequency analysis and d n is the number of gauges in a homogeneous region a homogeneous region in this context is a group of gauges with similar statistics of selected variables such as l moments the l moments are an alternative system of representing the shape of distributions and they historically arose as modifications of the conventional probability weighted moments pwm hosking and wallis 2002 in the index flood procedures a regional growth curve was derived from multiple gauge data in a homogeneous region under the assumption that the probability distributions of n gauges are identical except for the scaling factor of each gauge hence this method is beneficial for reducing uncertainties arising from a short period of record and the shortage of various extreme cases to identify homogeneous regions k means was employed as a clustering method the clustering method seeks gauges with similar characteristics and groups them as homogeneous regions coordinates gauge altitude mean annual maximum precipitation and l moments ratios e g l cv and l skewness were used as variables to cluster groups a goodness fit test was implemented to choose the optimal probability distribution using the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic for various durations parameters of the selected probability distribution were estimated using the l moment and pwm methods for this process the l moments3 library in python was used in this study the four 3 parameters distributions gev glo gno and gpa were considered to validate the methodology of the noaa atlas for more details readers may care to refer to hosking and wallis 2002 as the rfa and the associated index procedures in this study are developed based on that reference 2 2 3 bias correction correcting biases of quantitative precipitation estimation from a weather radar is one of the most critical problems regarding radar precipitation products a bias correction factor bcf was used to evaluate stage iv and reduce biases in the stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates the g r ratio approach the ratio between a gauge measurement and radar precipitation estimate is the most typical form of the bcf indicating the extent of systematic errors however bias is intrinsically defined as the difference between the actual and sample means the fact that the bcf takes the form of the ratio between the gauge rate and the radar precipitation estimate instead of the difference between them indicates that both precipitation intensities follow the log normal distribution the logarithmic mean difference between the gauge and radar precipitation estimate is converted into the ratio between means yoo et al 2014 the other way of explaining the bcf is the regression analysis instead of employing the g r ratio the linear regression line can also be used as the bcf because the g r ratio can be interpreted as the slope of the line connecting the origin and the mass center of measurement pairs seo et al 1996 this approach is straightforward and has adequate performance for correcting bias in a time series of stage iv precipitation thus this study used a linear regression approach to estimate bcf bcf was estimated by calculating the slope of the well known linear regression line determined as follows 2 Œ≤ i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 where the precipitation values are recorded at the time i and at gauge x i with the collocated stage iv grid point y i and n is the length of the designed time window bias correction was implemented for individual storm events as it varies with the type of storm individual storm events used inter storm event duration time ietd to classify an individual storm event from a time series of precipitation yoo et al 2016 in this study 6 hrs of ietd were selected through a sensitivity analysis instead of considering all storm events with various durations a storm event of greater than 6 hr duration was considered for estimation as bcfs for storm events of a shorter duration especially in a case of storm events with less than 6 hr duration are abnormally high or low compared to its typical range e g 0 5 bcf 2 0 bias correction was implemented by pairing the extracted stage iv precipitation data with asos gauge data at the collocated sites the designed time window indicates a storm duration as bcf is calculated for each storm event 3 results 3 1 validation of the atlas in texas a fundamental analysis of the ams used in the development of atlas in texas is implemented fig 2 shows the analysis results of the spatial and temporal features of the ams the observation period is from 1887 to 2017 but considering variations in time series of precipitation and the number of gauges in fig 2 a a period of data since 1950 is considered for further analyses overall the nonstationarity of precipitation is observed from various perspectives in fig 2 b an increase in the mean value and variation of the ams is consistently observed until 2017 across all percentiles in fig 2 c the increase in the mean value was 22 at the 50th percentile and 28 at the 98th percentile for 1 h precipitation the increasing trend was dramatic in 24 h precipitation the increment in the 98th percentile was two times larger than that in the 50th percentile in fig 2 d the spatial distribution of the mean ams varied with the geographical locations of the gauge higher percentile groups are located in coastal areas while lower percentile groups are populated in the northwestern inland area collecting altogether the increment in the ams was proportional to its magnitude across the state and the ams in the coastal areas has been more developed than in the inland areas the goodness of fit test is implemented to validate the probability distribution selected in the atlas the four 3 parameters distributions gev glo gno and gpa which presented acceptable goodness of fit results over the state in the noaa atlas report were considered fig 3 shows the comparison result of the four probability distributions in fig 3 a gno has the most significant fraction 50 on average of the six durations from 1 to 48 h among the four probability distributions and then gev 31 and glo 11 are high in the order in fig 3 b gno is uniformly distributed while glo and gev are limited in some locations relatively the primary driver of uncertainty in regional frequency analysis is the choice of a probability distribution al kajbaf and bensi 2021 particularly it is significant for pfes with rare return periods which have a high possibility to occur flooding fig 3 c compares the pfes as a function of aeps derived from the four distributions all probability distributions provide quite similar pfes for the aeps of greater than 2 meaning that pfes for under 50 year return periods might have no significant differences depending on the distributions after that it was obvious that the difference increased as the aep decreased considering a period of the atlas gauge record shorter than 50 years 41 years on average in texas the uncertainty for over 50 year return periods is inevitable and understandable these results suggest that the choice of a probability distribution should be implemented from the technical and objective perspectives aiming to develop optimal pfes for extreme events lastly there is a possibility that the atlas in texas has provided overestimated pfes for the high return periods because the gno the best fit distribution presents smaller pfes for over a 50 year return period than that from the gev to examine the effect of a time window of record on deriving pfes under climate change the pfes derived from the three time windows 1958 1977 1978 1997 and 1998 2017 are compared in fig 4 from fig 4 a b the overall spatial patterns are fairly similar except for the magnitude of the pfes in the coastal area however the pfes derived from 1998 to 2017 in fig 4 c presented different features especially in a and b areas the cities of austin and houston respectively in fig 4 d comparing the median values the period of 1998 2017 is 25 5 and 21 1 higher than the two former time windows respectively in fig 4 e and f the pfes from the different time windows strongly correlated with each other as the correlation coefficients cc for both are above 0 95 the difference arising from the different time windows is because of the nonstationarity of precipitation it influences determining two factors in rfa the scale factor i e index flood and the shape of the probability distribution e g tails most previous studies including the atlas employed the mean value of the ams as the scale factor which varies with a time window as shown in fig 2 b the increasing trend of the ams over time is observed it is confirmed that 5 0 and 6 5 of the mean ams increased in 1978 1997 and 1998 2017 respectively compared to the former time window the right tail of the probability distribution is the most sensitive portion as it determines the pfes in lower aeps i e irregular events an increase in variation of ams is important since significant variation influences estimating parameters of the selected probability distribution in fig 5 intensity frequency if curves from different time windows are compared to examine the effect of changes in precipitation variation on pefs to minimize the effect of the difference in the mean amss on the analysis pfes are normalized with the mean amss for each time window the mean amss were bigger from 1998 to 2017 1958 2017 1978 2977 and 1958 1977 in order the difference increases as aep decreases meaning that the pfes at the high return periods have more uncertainty due to changes in precipitation variability in the extreme case corresponding to a 1 000 year return period i e 0 1 aep the pfe from 1998 to 2017 is over two times larger than that from older time windows also the atlas was smaller than pfes from 1998 to 2017 and it is suspected that it is due to a more extended period of data with minor precipitation variation compared to the recent 20 years the effect of interpolation on pfes is examined to understand the difference between pfes at a point and area fig 6 compares the 2 yr return period corresponding to 50 aep pfes and the mean amss in rfa the mean ams is employed as a scale factor representing the pfes corresponding to a 2 yr return period i e 50 aep hence the mean ams should significantly correlate with the pfe of a 2 yr return period overall they have a strong spatial correlation but some areas differ in magnitudes depending on the locations the spatial distribution of the atlas is relatively homogeneous and regionalized by an interpolation process while the mean ams has more spatial variation most areas with a difference between them are located around a high observation density and near the coast the dotted red circles in the figure considering significant differences associated with the coastal area the effect of interpolation on the atlas is substantial to the coastal area the scatter plot shows a relationship between the mean ams and pfes from atlas and asos rfa both pfes correlate highly with the mean ams as the c c s are over 0 95 atlas has an 11 bias against the mean ams regarded as the acceptable point to area reduction by regionalization the difference between the two datasets is systematic and consistent it is interpreted as the difference resulting from a point to area transferring process by interpolation the higher difference around 20 mm h of the mean ams was confirmed near the coastal area where the ams is higher than in the other regions the difference is over 11 suggesting that atlas in the coastal area provides more underestimated pfes than it should additionally rfa has no bias and a minor variation against the mean ams suggesting that the rfa method in this study is well developed and can create pfes very similar to the atlas pfes before the interpolation process in the evaluation section this bias analysis is implemented over the conus and considered in the comparison with asos rfa 3 2 evaluation of the atlas from a benchmark perspective a benchmark of pfes asos rfa was developed using the rfa method and asos data to evaluate the atlases a goodness fit test is implemented first to select the optimal probability distribution fig 7 compares the fractions of the best fit probability distributions for six durations glo was the highest fraction and gno gev and gpa increased in order considering the goodness fit test result and the trend of the increasing ams glo is selected as the best fit probability distribution for creating the benchmark pfes thus the asos rfa was developed across the conus based on that fig 8 compares the two pfes the atlas and asos rfa for various scenarios using the quantitative difference for the 1 hr duration scenarios the negative difference indicating that the atlas is smaller than asos rfa was spatially dominant over the conus as the return period increases the extent of negative differences increases especially in california houston in texas ohio river basin and surrounding states and most states in the northeastern region among the areas the significant negative differences less than 40 in the ohio river basin and surrounding states are consistently observed for higher scenarios corresponding to over a 100 yr return period suggesting that the regions have a notable change in extreme precipitation occurrences the results for a 24 h duration were quite different from the 1 hr duration cases in the 5 year return period a fraction of the moderate differences in 10 was dominant and significant differences were not found in 100 and 500 yr return periods significant negative differences were limitedly observed in some specific regions in west virginia tennessee and the east coastline from north carolina to new york compared to the 1 hr duration cases in the histograms variation increases as does the return period suggesting that moderate differences turn into significant differences which is the same pattern as the 1 hr duration results in fig 9 changes in the difference depending on the duration and return periods are compared a pattern of the change by a return period was consistent in all duration results from a to d the change in the return periods under 10 years was relatively constant and increased in the negative direction as the return period increased in all regions the same pattern was observed even if the level of the difference was slightly different the increasing trend was significant in ohio the results in the northwestern region associated with atlas 2 were similar to the ohio results which is understandable when considering the age of atlas 2 as developed in the 1970s the change by duration was consistent in all return periods and regions a change in differences from 1 to 12 hr durations was dramatic suggesting a high possibility that the atlases have relatively high uncertainties in pfes for the durations for the longer durations the differences converged to a specific level of difference depending on the regions as shown in fig 9 a relationship of the differences depending on the return periods is compared to examine a correlation of the pfes in different return periods in fig 10 as a result the pfes in different return periods are strongly correlated the relationship between 5 and 100 yr return periods has a cc of 0 80 and the direction of differences e g negative and positive are matched by 82 as expected the relationship between 100 and 500 yr return periods is more strongly correlated cc 0 96 since their annual exceedance probabilities are close the same results are also observed in the other cases with extreme return periods and longer durations collecting all together the findings suggest that the different levels and directions are highly consistent across the scenarios in a specific gauge location we have observed a significant difference in the pfes for a 1 h duration from fig 9 fig 11 compares the mean values of the 1 h annual precipitation series to analyze the difference since the observation networks used in atlas and asos are different gauges located within 2 km of each other are selected to reduce the sampling error resulting from gauges not collocated the mean value is used in the regional frequency analysis as the index flood i e scale factor that determines a scale of the pfes based on the selected probability distribution the mean value of atlas is calculated from a long term period of data depending on the region the mean period of record in atlas is over 60 years while asos is 16 years on average overall the mean value of the atlas was 22 less than that of asos across the conus notably the extent of the difference was distinct by region in the map the significant differences greater than 50 between the mean intensities from the noaa atlas and asos are confirmed in california semiarid and ohio regions the locations with the moderate difference within 10 are in midwestern and southeastern states in the region with the significant difference the mean value of asos was 66 higher than that of atlas these results are interpreted as the difference between atlas and asos arises from the different time windows the time window represents how long a period of records is used and under what climate conditions rfa is implemented a period of records is related to determining the extent of the mean values of the ams in developing atlas on average 40 50 years of records were used and some gauges provided over 100 years of records were used to calculate the mean value however as shown in fig 2 for texas for 68 years 1950 2017 the ams increased at least 20 thus using a long period of records enough to include the status of different climate change underestimates the mean value under the current acceleration of climate change and the fact directly links to underestimating the pfes notably the fraction of the latest records i e the recent 20 years used in developing atlas is associated with the extent of the differences fig 12 shows a relationship between the atlas development year and the difference between the amss from atlas and asos in the case of a 1 h duration the difference explicitly increased as the development year is outdated suggesting that the atlas age correlates with and contributes to the difference in the case of a 24 h duration the same trend was observed as the 1 hr duration but it was not significant 3 3 evaluation of the stage iv based precipitation frequency estimates stage iv is evaluated using the bcf fig 13 shows a map of the median value of the event based bcfs estimated using 1 h quantitative precipitation estimates from stage iv and 1 hr precipitation intensity from asos overall stage iv tended to underestimate quantitative precipitation estimates and the level of bias was within 20 see the probability distribution in the figure california and the northwestern regions with complicated geomorphological characteristics presented higher bias than the other regions also numerous missing data from stage iv are identified in the states of california and washington thus some sampling points in both states are excluded from developing a new idf curve based on stage iv correcting biases in stage iv is implemented as a pre processing of the idf curve development fig 14 compares 1 hr amss from asos uncorrected and corrected stage iv among all regions the northwestern region where the quality was relatively poor and the ohio region where the quality was fairly good are selected to show the comparison in the case of the northwestern region the effect of bias correction on improving ams was significant especially the uncorrected stage iv s ams mostly less than asos ams was improved and the improvement is confirmed from the probability distribution comparison and 1 1 scatter plot in ohio bias correction s effect was insignificant as stage iv s ams was relatively moderate compared to asos s ams this result was confirmed not only in ohio but also in all regions except california and the northwestern states idf curves based on the corrected stage iv were developed and pfes compared with asos rfa in fig 15 regardless of the duration both pfes are highly correlated with each other in a high frequency scenario i e 5 yr return period and the bias was small enough to ignore this is because the ams s mean value from stage iv is close to that of asos using a bias correction process from all results as the duration increased it is clear that the two estimates tended to agree well and the variation decreased as the return period increases the variation of the scatter gradually increases due to significant differences identified in some locations but a high correlation was maintained even in the case of a 500 year return period bias increases as the return period increases but we confirmed that it is derived from the significant differences identified in a portion of locations instead of from systematic differences in all locations however the variation tended to decrease at longer durations and this is the typical accumulation effect that an error decreases as temporal resolution increases in quantitative precipitation estimation it appears that stage iv could provide relatively better pfes in longer durations based on the bcf and stage iv based pfe results the meaningful results are found in tx mw se and oh suggesting that the stage iv is eligible to develop the idf curves in the regions in ca and nw where the stage iv performance was not as good as the other regions the conventional bias correction method is limited to improving stage iv to develop the idf curves comparable with the asos rfa in sa the correlation between the stage iv based pfes and asos rfa is high enough to conclude that they are strongly correlated but the stage iv tended to underestimate the pfes more than the asos rfa 4 discussion there are a few points that should be discussed as they might have effects on the results the first is the sampling errors from using two different ground observation systems the atlas gauge and asos the primary features occurring in the sampling errors are the gauge location and density depending on the regions precipitation measurement varies with gauge locations even in better situations adjacent gauges have surprisingly limited correlational ability kidd et al 2017 for example the correlation coefficient was less than 0 5 between adjacent gauges 4 km apart habib et al 2001 also the gauge density is related to the data population for calculating statistics such as the mean value from this perspective there is a distinct possibility that both features slightly affect estimating an index flood in rfa since the numbers of gauges in both observation systems are large enough to calculate reasonable and comparable statistics we assume that the effect of the sampling error on the results was not enough to change the conclusions the recent 20 years of data were considered in developing the new idf curves in this study the length of the record is shorter than what typical studies used in frequency analysis generally a 30 year of record thus there are several expected effects arising from the use of the shorter length of a record the first one is that an index flood could be estimated higher than the case from longer records this is because an index flood decreases as the fraction of older records increases due to nonstationarity of precipitation the second one is associated with building the probability distribution the record length indicates the maximum that the aep data could present and influences the fitting of a probability distribution to data for example asos could represent 5 as the maximum aep based on 20 years of a record and atlas gives 2 5 based on 40 years of a record on average however by employing the rfa in this study we believe the effect on the developed idf curves is minimized using randomly selected two stations in texas the pfes from 20 and 30 years of a record are compared in fig 16 the amp data provided by the noaa atlas 14 are used as expected the difference between the pfes from different record lengths increases as the return period increases suggesting that a pfe for an extreme catastrophe event e g over a 100 yr return period could have a significant uncertainty depending on data length however overall differences were not remarkable at the stations also many studies have used around 20 years of a record some cases considered shorter periods to establish reasonable idf curves and the fact suggests that the use of 20 years of record is reasonable and usable for implementing frequency analysis from various perspectives ombadi et al 2018 mcgraw et al 2019 ghebreyesus and sharif 2021 the effort to develop the post atlas is urgently needed using consistent data features with a reasonable period of data well representing the current climate circumstances and selecting an appropriate probability distribution that could reflect the acceleration of climate change and associated changes in an increasing trend of the ams should be high priorities in the development lastly considering a growing trend in the ams for an interval of less than 12 hrs an increase of interest in flash flooding and pluvial floods is projected 5 conclusions the noaa atlases and the stage iv were evaluated and validated based on the recent 20 years of the gauge record nonstationarity of precipitation resulting in an increase in the mean ams and a change in precipitation frequencies was the primary reason that the older atlases diverged from recent observations the nonstationarity influenced the choice of an appropriate probability distribution the gev used in developing the atlases might not be the best option for the last two decades of precipitation record especially for deriving the pfes at higher return periods instead considering glo which has similar characteristics to the pfes under 100 year return periods and provides slightly higher values for return periods greater than 100 year could be a way to reflect the nonstationarity in an alternative way in addition using a recent period of data that well represents the current climate circumstance could reduce uncertainties arising from the effect of nonstationarity especially for calculating the index flood in rfa overall atlases underestimated the pfes against the benchmark over the conus under the current climate condition notably the trend was significant in the ohio river basin and the surrounding states and coastal areas in texas and california the difference between the atlases and benchmark increased at higher return periods and decreased at longer durations also the difference was highly correlated with the age of atlas suggesting that the outdated data is the primary source that generates uncertainties in developing the pfes stage iv can potentially be a data source for developing the post atlas period that was shown by the pfes at high frequency return periods by bias correction resulting in the well matched mean ams with the benchmark however due to a difference between the ams and the exceedance probabilities the uncertainty in the pfes for return periods greater than 100 years increased more than did that of the lower return period s uncertainty as expected also numerous missing data from stage iv were identified in the states of california and washington and excluded from developing the idf curves this fact is not only the issue found in the radar qpe data but also in most remote sensing data suggesting that measuring the eligibility of remote sensing data for developing idf curves should be implemented by preliminarily detecting missing data answering the first question raised in the introduction the noaa atlas is diverging from the eligibility to represent standard pfes under the current climate conditions and the acceleration of climate change over the conus the uncertainty of altas will keep increasing due to the nonstationarity of the ams enhanced by climate change and older records used in its development for the second question the stage iv has a high potential to be one of the data sources for developing a seamless map of the pfes but several issues should be resolved including the nonhomogeneous quality of the stage iv before accounting it for frequency analysis objectively the bias correction method employed in this study is to remove systematic errors against reference data i g gauge instead of designed to improve the accuracy of the ams it was an essential process but for deriving the pfes comparable to the benchmark an additional process that could improve the ams considering annual exceedance probabilities is recommended in addition the multi radar and multi sensor

7850,study region the conterminous united states study focus the noaa atlases have provided the standard precipitation frequency estimates pfes for over two decades in the united states but they are losing that status due to climate change this study evaluates the atlases compared to new pfes developed based on the automated surface observing system and regional frequency analysis asos rfa as a benchmark and examines a radar based precipitation product as a data source eligible for developing the post atlas new hydrological insights for the region the stationarity assumption of precipitation was highlighted as a significant factor in increasing the uncertainties in the atlases the atlases explicitly tended to underestimate pfes compared to the asos rfa the difference between the atlases and the asos rfa increases as the return period increases and the duration decreases the age of the atlases correlated with the difference suggesting that recent observations diverge from older estimates the radar based pfes are well matched with the asos rfa at frequent return periods but the uncertainties increased as the return period increased this is because the conventional bias correction was limited in improving the annual maximum series of precipitation lastly we need to pay careful attention to an increase in precipitation frequency estimates shorter than 12 hr durations graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood extreme precipitation precipitation frequency estimate noaa atlas nexrad stage iv radar based idf curve data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events have rapidly grown within the majority of the united states in the last two decades noaa u s climate extremes index 2016 wright et al 2019 the continuity of this trend is expected to continue and has been considered in projecting dynamic atmospheric phenomenons with many global climate models sillmann et al 2013 mallakpour and villarini 2015 there is a strong argument that flooding driven by extreme precipitation has already exceeded infrastructure design criteria primarily based on intensity duration frequency idf curves kunkel et al 2003 vu and mishra 2019 swain et al 2020 therefore consistently updating idf curves following an informed evaluation of the risk associated with a change in the trend of extreme weather events is essential to prevent substantial loss of life and property from catastrophic floods keifer and chu 1957 kidd et al 2017 degaetano and castellano 2018 sun et al 2019 this study aims to assess the standard idf curves and evaluate radar based precipitation data as the primary data for developing the post atlas in the united states an idf curve describes precipitation intensity e g precipitation frequency estimates hereafter pfe as a function of duration for a given return period which can be converted to a depth duration frequency ddf curve idf curves help to understand the tendency of extreme precipitation in a return period a map of pfes from idf curves is a tool to capture a change in the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation in both gauged and ungauged areas idf curves are commonly used for several purposes including the development of flood maps by representing occurrence probabilities of extreme scenarios dupont and allen 2000 elsebaie 2012 flood design and hydraulic infrastructure assessment mamo 2015 yan et al 2019 stormwater management chin 2004 engineering design and standard development resiliency evaluation and vulnerability assessment keifer and chu 1957 kidd et al 2017 sun et al 2019 the development of idf curves typically involves fitting historical precipitation observations to theoretical extreme value distributions and is heavily dependent on the length and quality of the record ghebreyesus et al 2021 many countries and local governments have developed standard idf curve data for their territories to support engineering and scientific fields akan 1993 martel et al 2021 the national weather service s hydrometeorological design studies center national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa developed a set of stationary idf curve maps under the project noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency atlas of the united states hereafter atlas 14 for the conterminous united states conus wright et al 2019 atlas 14 serves as the nation s standard for understanding site specific precipitation events and provides precipitation depth in various durations and return periods for a unit grid approx 1 km 1 km which are statistically derived from measurements collected at ground weather stations part of the national weather service nws cooperative observer program leathers et al 2020 eleven volumes of atlas 14 have been developed to aid in better informed decision making regarding infrastructure investment design and managing flood risks and water resources before atlas 14 atlas 2 was developed using observation records prior to 1970 for the northwestern u s region including washington oregon idaho montana and wyoming which atlas 14 does not cover atlases were developed based on the temporal stationarity of precipitation which assumes that the occurrence probability of extreme precipitations is not expected to change over time cheng and aghakouchak 2014 however climate change has altered the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation over time and most climate models project that the features of extreme precipitation will continue to grow throughout the twenty first century ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 ning et al 2015 thus this has raised practical concerns about assuming stationarity of the annual maximum series ams of precipitation to design infrastructure with a life that extends well into the future degaetano and castellano 2018 there were many efforts to consider the nonstationarity of precipitation by adopting and developing various methods to address the expected change in extreme precipitation enhanced by climate change katz et al 2002 rodr√≠guez et al 2014 degaetano and castellano 2017 data used in the development of atlases are also disputed over time firstly the outdated climatic records of atlases are limited in their validity for application to future climate conditions unless updated to current and future trends guo 2006 mailhot and duchesne 2010 shrestha et al 2017 degaetano and castellano 2018 pointed out that the practice of including stations with a record of limited length that end several decades before the present should be avoided secondly the heterogeneity of the gauge data features is another concern since gauge data vary in the quality and quantity of the measurements the length of a gauge s record is significantly different from another and may be reported at varying time intervals leathers et al 2020 also there is inconsistency in the number of gauges used in developing idf curves for different durations e g 1 min sub daily and daily the locational distribution of gauges also varies considerably lacking reliable spatial coverage leathers et al 2020 sparse gauge coverage thus requires a large portion of data to rely on interpolation and extrapolation ghebreyesus et al 2021 which is problematic provided that the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation events and that the gauges are only small point measurements kidd et al 2017 gao et al 2018 kim et al 2020 even in some better situations adjacent gauges have surprisingly limited correlational ability habib et al 2001 many studies have attempted various methods by employing remote sensing data such as high resolution precipitation data from weather radars e g next generation weather radar hereafter nexrad a network of 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars operated by nws and satellites to address the limitations of idf curves developed based on gauge data radar based precipitation data i e quantitative precipitation estimation hereafter qpe derived from a radar reflectivity rain rate relationship have been utilized to develop a map of pfe using its ability to represent the spatial distribution of precipitation marra et al 2019 ghebreyesus et al 2021 wright et al 2020 demonstrated the utility of a qpe product in building storm catalogs as part of the stochastic storm transposition method for producing idf estimates a high resolution spatio temporal precipitation pattern of remote sensing data is used to improve estimates of areal reduction factors for transforming idf values from point based gauge data to areal estimates omranian et al 2018 transformations are based on the structure of precipitation s spatial correlation qiao et al 2014 and the development of a flood frequency analysis framework reliant on stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 the gridded format of these remote sensing data reduces the uncertainty introduced by interpolation methods required to develop a map of pfes from gauge data the common idea in the aforementioned studies employing remote sensing data is taking advantage of high resolutions representing better spatial patterns of precipitation than ground observations depending on the quality of remote sensing data they directly or indirectly used the remote sensing data to develop new pfes while there is ongoing advancement in sensors and algorithms used there is concern about the accuracy of the data as several validation efforts have noted their limitations in capturing heavy storm events prat and nelson 2015 a radar observation system is affected by geological factors that block radar reflectivities such as mountains and earth curvature also there are well known challenges e g precipitation classification vertical reflectivity profile correction and bias correction to improving qpe at the ground level wesson 2014 kim et al 2015 yoo et al 2016 satellite data typically can provide a longer record of data and at a larger scale than radar data however satellite data has a lower spatial resolution than radar data and is typically less accurate and sensitive to weather conditions kim et al 2020 kim and han 2021 employing the atlas may not be appropriate in some u s regions due to the limitations mentioned above and the current climate circumstances a few studies assessed the atlas only for selected states against the developed pfes and the studies evaluating the atlas over the conus with decent data are barely found wallis et al 2007 ghebreyesus et al 2021 since the ease of accessing remote sensing data has been approximately equivalent to that of collecting gauge data the use of remote sensing data is a technical advancement that should be further developed and it has various other benefits compared to gauge data such as the capability in representing spatial distributions of precipitation this study aims to answer questions that require explicit description before developing a remote sensing data based idf map at a continental scale the two questions are as follows 1 are the atlases able to represent the precipitation intensity of extreme storms under the current climate conditions 2 could the qpe driven idf curves be an appropriate alternative to the atlases the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces application data methods and research strategy section 3 presents mixed results that could provide insights and preliminary answers to the questions above including the atlases evaluation the radar qpe evaluation and correction and a comparison of idf curves from different sources section 4 discusses the potential uncertainties which may arise from the applied procedures and addresses the conclusion of the study all terminologies

surface observing systems asos and the gauge locations hereafter atlas gauges used in the development of the atlas 14 asos is a well known weather observation system with more than 913 operational observation stations in the u s that provide high temporal resolution data a 60 minute precipitation measurement of asos is used as the primary data to develop the benchmark pfes evaluate atlases and correct biases in stage iv asos data from 2002 to 2021 are used we believe the period represents the current climate circumstances the asos data is available from the online site https mesonet agron iastate edu request asos 1 minphtml atlas gauges consist of various ground based observation systems operated by various agencies according to atlas volume 1 semiarid southwest the primary source of precipitation data is the national weather service cooperative observer program s daily and hourly stations as for the other sources precipitation data from county flood control districts the state department of water resources and the u s geological survey are employed for more detail the atlas public reports are available for each region https www weather gov owp hdsc currentpf this study used the ams data in the atlas gauges that the noaa provides the ams data is used to replicate the pfes under various conditions to validate the atlases also the locations of the atlas gauges are used as the sampling points to evaluate the atlases in comparison to asos rfa quantitatively 2 1 2 noaa atlas noaa developed a range of atlas pfes representing frequent and extreme precipitation scenarios in the united states the pfes for durations from 5 min to 60 day and annual exceedance probabilities from ¬Ω to 1 1000 corresponding to 2 to 1 000 year annual recurrence intervals are provided noaa atlas exists as either atlas 2 or 14 depending on the development years and regions atlas 2 the first version of noaa atlas was developed for 11 states montana wyoming colorado new mexico idaho utah nevada arizona washington oregon and california located west of 100 w longitude in atlas 2 noaa provides the gridded idf curve based on the ams approach for the northwestern u s region covering the states of washington oregon idaho montana and wyoming the primary data sources were climatological data for the u s by sections and hourly precipitation data the precipitation record used in the development of atlas 2 is outdated by over 50 years suggesting that atlas 2 might not be eligible to represent extreme storm events under current climate conditions due to the accelerated climate change the gridded idf curve data is available online https www weather gov owp hdsc noaa atlas2 the data is limited to two storm durations 6 and 24 h and two return periods 2 and 100 years since the early 2000s the noaa has been updating pfes for various regions of the united states and affiliated territories updated estimates with relevant supplementary information are published in noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency atlas of the united states atlas 14 updates are done in stages based on state boundaries the first volume of atlas 14 was released in 2004 and the latest volume for texas was finished in 2018 as it took around 20 years to develop atlas 14 for various regions the period of precipitation data used in each region is different volume 1 for the semiarid southwest region used precipitation records up to 2000 and volume 11 for the state of texas used up to 2017 this is a point that many previous studies are concerned about regarding the inconsistency of considered years and the absence of recent years except for texas of used precipitation records lopez cantu and samaras 2018 wright et al 2019 the cell size of atlas 14 is approximately 1 0 km 0 00833 degrees in the latest volume of atlas 14 for texas pfes have been derived for a range of frequencies and durations using a regional frequency analysis approach based on l moment statistics calculated from the ams in the development of atlas 14 the gev was selected for all regions in the conus the volumes 1 and 2 of the atlas provide the goodness of fit test result which generally recommends the gev as it showed the best fit to data for most regions than any other distributions since the volume 6 the third volume for the region in conus the gev was not the best fit distribution but acceptable and selected for consistency in frequency estimates over the conus including texas 2 1 3 nexrad stage iv the nws national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv is the qpe product used in this study stage iv is a near real time product that is generated at ncep separately based on the nexrad precipitation processing system fulton et al 1998 and the nws river forecast center rfc precipitation processing nelson et al 2016 the stage iv used in this study is based on the multi sensor hourly stage iii analyses on local 4 km polar stereographic grids produced by the 12 rfcs in conus ncep mosaics stage iii into a national product i e stage iv in addition stage iv differs from the ncep stage ii chiefly in that the ncep stage ii contains no manual quality control while stage iv benefits from manual quality control performed on the stage iii data at the rfcs for more information the stage iv precipitation processing details are well documented in nelson et al 2016 many studies have used stage iv as a reference and benchmark for analysis and comparison with comparable precipitation products based on remote sensing observation systems suggesting that the overall quality and accuracy of stage iv are acceptable for hydrological purposes especially stage iv showed a good performance at a high rain rate 90th percentile nelson et al 2016 however since the performance of stage iv varies with regions a part of this study includes the evaluation of stage iv against gauge observations 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 framework three analyses were mainly implemented to answer the two questions raised in the introduction 1 validation of the atlases from the data and methodology perspectives 2 evaluation of the atlases using a benchmark and 3 evaluation of the stage iv idf curves before the primary analyses the pre processing to fill missing data and detect remove outliers was implemented for asos and stage iv data a simple interpolation method using a time window as a parameter was employed to fill missing data outliers were detected using the inter quartile range iqr method to define outliers upper and lower bounds the iqr method has a scale factor to adjust the bounds and is 1 5 in general this study considered the scale factor for only the upper bound and determined it based on a sensitivity analysis scale factor 5 0 detected outliers were removed and replaced with the interpolated value 1 min precipitation of asos was accumulated and converted to 60 min duration precipitation to match the temporal resolution of stage iv in the validation of the atlases the ams used in the development of the atlas 14 in texas was employed since the latest period of ams data is available up to 2017 the last year of the data is 2018 but it is excluded due to the relatively few numbers of gauges fundamental analyses to understand a trend of the ams validate the selected probability distribution and examine the effect of precipitation nonstationarity on developing idf curves were mainly used the automated surface observing system and regional frequency analysis asos rfa was developed based on the recent 20 years of asos data from 796 gauge locations across the conus to evaluate the atlases asos was selected since the density as a single gauge observation system is comparable with the atlas gauge network and able to provide the latest precipitation data in the evaluation process the difference defined as the difference percentage between pfes from asos rfa and atlas was used as a criterion for measuring uncertainties in the atlas the atlas was paired with asos rfa by sampling pfes collocated with the selected asos gauges to examine the eligibility of stage iv for developing idf curves hourly stage iv precipitation data was evaluated against asos data using the bias correction factor bcf bcf was selected as it measures systematic errors against gauge data and can directly correct biases in the stage iv to improve the accuracy of ams bias correction was implemented to improve the accuracy of hourly precipitation data from stage iv using 60 min asos precipitation data to understand the accuracy of extreme precipitation estimates of stage iv the ams of the corrected and uncorrected stage iv were evaluated against asos data the corrected data were used to develop the stage iv based pfes the conus is the primary domain to develop new pfe assess the noaa atlas and answer the questions raised in the introduction texas is used to review and validate the methodology developed in the noaa atlas and this study as the state is the latest development i e the last volume of the noaa atlas 14 based on the recent period of record 2 2 2 frequency analysis regional frequency analysis rfa based on the index flood procedures was employed to develop new pfes from asos and stage iv precipitation data the rfa was developed to derive more reasonable idf curves by analyzing multi site sampling data in a homogeneous region rather than using single site data hosking and wallis 2002 the rfa is similar to the at site frequency analysis mainly consisting of the four steps the ams preprocessing fitting ams to theoretical distributions selecting a distribution and deriving pfes for a specific scenario of a storm e g duration and return period however the rfa requires a regionalization process by categorizing groups of gauges having statistical similarities in the general rfa process the quantile function of the frequency distribution at site i is defined as follows 1 q i f Œº i q f i 1 n where a Œº i is a scaling factor defined as the index flood b q f is the regional growth curve as a function of f ranging from 0 to 1 c f is an annual exceedance probability in precipitation frequency analysis and d n is the number of gauges in a homogeneous region a homogeneous region in this context is a group of gauges with similar statistics of selected variables such as l moments the l moments are an alternative system of representing the shape of distributions and they historically arose as modifications of the conventional probability weighted moments pwm hosking and wallis 2002 in the index flood procedures a regional growth curve was derived from multiple gauge data in a homogeneous region under the assumption that the probability distributions of n gauges are identical except for the scaling factor of each gauge hence this method is beneficial for reducing uncertainties arising from a short period of record and the shortage of various extreme cases to identify homogeneous regions k means was employed as a clustering method the clustering method seeks gauges with similar characteristics and groups them as homogeneous regions coordinates gauge altitude mean annual maximum precipitation and l moments ratios e g l cv and l skewness were used as variables to cluster groups a goodness fit test was implemented to choose the optimal probability distribution using the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic for various durations parameters of the selected probability distribution were estimated using the l moment and pwm methods for this process the l moments3 library in python was used in this study the four 3 parameters distributions gev glo gno and gpa were considered to validate the methodology of the noaa atlas for more details readers may care to refer to hosking and wallis 2002 as the rfa and the associated index procedures in this study are developed based on that reference 2 2 3 bias correction correcting biases of quantitative precipitation estimation from a weather radar is one of the most critical problems regarding radar precipitation products a bias correction factor bcf was used to evaluate stage iv and reduce biases in the stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates the g r ratio approach the ratio between a gauge measurement and radar precipitation estimate is the most typical form of the bcf indicating the extent of systematic errors however bias is intrinsically defined as the difference between the actual and sample means the fact that the bcf takes the form of the ratio between the gauge rate and the radar precipitation estimate instead of the difference between them indicates that both precipitation intensities follow the log normal distribution the logarithmic mean difference between the gauge and radar precipitation estimate is converted into the ratio between means yoo et al 2014 the other way of explaining the bcf is the regression analysis instead of employing the g r ratio the linear regression line can also be used as the bcf because the g r ratio can be interpreted as the slope of the line connecting the origin and the mass center of measurement pairs seo et al 1996 this approach is straightforward and has adequate performance for correcting bias in a time series of stage iv precipitation thus this study used a linear regression approach to estimate bcf bcf was estimated by calculating the slope of the well known linear regression line determined as follows 2 Œ≤ i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 where the precipitation values are recorded at the time i and at gauge x i with the collocated stage iv grid point y i and n is the length of the designed time window bias correction was implemented for individual storm events as it varies with the type of storm individual storm events used inter storm event duration time ietd to classify an individual storm event from a time series of precipitation yoo et al 2016 in this study 6 hrs of ietd were selected through a sensitivity analysis instead of considering all storm events with various durations a storm event of greater than 6 hr duration was considered for estimation as bcfs for storm events of a shorter duration especially in a case of storm events with less than 6 hr duration are abnormally high or low compared to its typical range e g 0 5 bcf 2 0 bias correction was implemented by pairing the extracted stage iv precipitation data with asos gauge data at the collocated sites the designed time window indicates a storm duration as bcf is calculated for each storm event 3 results 3 1 validation of the atlas in texas a fundamental analysis of the ams used in the development of atlas in texas is implemented fig 2 shows the analysis results of the spatial and temporal features of the ams the observation period is from 1887 to 2017 but considering variations in time series of precipitation and the number of gauges in fig 2 a a period of data since 1950 is considered for further analyses overall the nonstationarity of precipitation is observed from various perspectives in fig 2 b an increase in the mean value and variation of the ams is consistently observed until 2017 across all percentiles in fig 2 c the increase in the mean value was 22 at the 50th percentile and 28 at the 98th percentile for 1 h precipitation the increasing trend was dramatic in 24 h precipitation the increment in the 98th percentile was two times larger than that in the 50th percentile in fig 2 d the spatial distribution of the mean ams varied with the geographical locations of the gauge higher percentile groups are located in coastal areas while lower percentile groups are populated in the northwestern inland area collecting altogether the increment in the ams was proportional to its magnitude across the state and the ams in the coastal areas has been more developed than in the inland areas the goodness of fit test is implemented to validate the probability distribution selected in the atlas the four 3 parameters distributions gev glo gno and gpa which presented acceptable goodness of fit results over the state in the noaa atlas report were considered fig 3 shows the comparison result of the four probability distributions in fig 3 a gno has the most significant fraction 50 on average of the six durations from 1 to 48 h among the four probability distributions and then gev 31 and glo 11 are high in the order in fig 3 b gno is uniformly distributed while glo and gev are limited in some locations relatively the primary driver of uncertainty in regional frequency analysis is the choice of a probability distribution al kajbaf and bensi 2021 particularly it is significant for pfes with rare return periods which have a high possibility to occur flooding fig 3 c compares the pfes as a function of aeps derived from the four distributions all probability distributions provide quite similar pfes for the aeps of greater than 2 meaning that pfes for under 50 year return periods might have no significant differences depending on the distributions after that it was obvious that the difference increased as the aep decreased considering a period of the atlas gauge record shorter than 50 years 41 years on average in texas the uncertainty for over 50 year return periods is inevitable and understandable these results suggest that the choice of a probability distribution should be implemented from the technical and objective perspectives aiming to develop optimal pfes for extreme events lastly there is a possibility that the atlas in texas has provided overestimated pfes for the high return periods because the gno the best fit distribution presents smaller pfes for over a 50 year return period than that from the gev to examine the effect of a time window of record on deriving pfes under climate change the pfes derived from the three time windows 1958 1977 1978 1997 and 1998 2017 are compared in fig 4 from fig 4 a b the overall spatial patterns are fairly similar except for the magnitude of the pfes in the coastal area however the pfes derived from 1998 to 2017 in fig 4 c presented different features especially in a and b areas the cities of austin and houston respectively in fig 4 d comparing the median values the period of 1998 2017 is 25 5 and 21 1 higher than the two former time windows respectively in fig 4 e and f the pfes from the different time windows strongly correlated with each other as the correlation coefficients cc for both are above 0 95 the difference arising from the different time windows is because of the nonstationarity of precipitation it influences determining two factors in rfa the scale factor i e index flood and the shape of the probability distribution e g tails most previous studies including the atlas employed the mean value of the ams as the scale factor which varies with a time window as shown in fig 2 b the increasing trend of the ams over time is observed it is confirmed that 5 0 and 6 5 of the mean ams increased in 1978 1997 and 1998 2017 respectively compared to the former time window the right tail of the probability distribution is the most sensitive portion as it determines the pfes in lower aeps i e irregular events an increase in variation of ams is important since significant variation influences estimating parameters of the selected probability distribution in fig 5 intensity frequency if curves from different time windows are compared to examine the effect of changes in precipitation variation on pefs to minimize the effect of the difference in the mean amss on the analysis pfes are normalized with the mean amss for each time window the mean amss were bigger from 1998 to 2017 1958 2017 1978 2977 and 1958 1977 in order the difference increases as aep decreases meaning that the pfes at the high return periods have more uncertainty due to changes in precipitation variability in the extreme case corresponding to a 1 000 year return period i e 0 1 aep the pfe from 1998 to 2017 is over two times larger than that from older time windows also the atlas was smaller than pfes from 1998 to 2017 and it is suspected that it is due to a more extended period of data with minor precipitation variation compared to the recent 20 years the effect of interpolation on pfes is examined to understand the difference between pfes at a point and area fig 6 compares the 2 yr return period corresponding to 50 aep pfes and the mean amss in rfa the mean ams is employed as a scale factor representing the pfes corresponding to a 2 yr return period i e 50 aep hence the mean ams should significantly correlate with the pfe of a 2 yr return period overall they have a strong spatial correlation but some areas differ in magnitudes depending on the locations the spatial distribution of the atlas is relatively homogeneous and regionalized by an interpolation process while the mean ams has more spatial variation most areas with a difference between them are located around a high observation density and near the coast the dotted red circles in the figure considering significant differences associated with the coastal area the effect of interpolation on the atlas is substantial to the coastal area the scatter plot shows a relationship between the mean ams and pfes from atlas and asos rfa both pfes correlate highly with the mean ams as the c c s are over 0 95 atlas has an 11 bias against the mean ams regarded as the acceptable point to area reduction by regionalization the difference between the two datasets is systematic and consistent it is interpreted as the difference resulting from a point to area transferring process by interpolation the higher difference around 20 mm h of the mean ams was confirmed near the coastal area where the ams is higher than in the other regions the difference is over 11 suggesting that atlas in the coastal area provides more underestimated pfes than it should additionally rfa has no bias and a minor variation against the mean ams suggesting that the rfa method in this study is well developed and can create pfes very similar to the atlas pfes before the interpolation process in the evaluation section this bias analysis is implemented over the conus and considered in the comparison with asos rfa 3 2 evaluation of the atlas from a benchmark perspective a benchmark of pfes asos rfa was developed using the rfa method and asos data to evaluate the atlases a goodness fit test is implemented first to select the optimal probability distribution fig 7 compares the fractions of the best fit probability distributions for six durations glo was the highest fraction and gno gev and gpa increased in order considering the goodness fit test result and the trend of the increasing ams glo is selected as the best fit probability distribution for creating the benchmark pfes thus the asos rfa was developed across the conus based on that fig 8 compares the two pfes the atlas and asos rfa for various scenarios using the quantitative difference for the 1 hr duration scenarios the negative difference indicating that the atlas is smaller than asos rfa was spatially dominant over the conus as the return period increases the extent of negative differences increases especially in california houston in texas ohio river basin and surrounding states and most states in the northeastern region among the areas the significant negative differences less than 40 in the ohio river basin and surrounding states are consistently observed for higher scenarios corresponding to over a 100 yr return period suggesting that the regions have a notable change in extreme precipitation occurrences the results for a 24 h duration were quite different from the 1 hr duration cases in the 5 year return period a fraction of the moderate differences in 10 was dominant and significant differences were not found in 100 and 500 yr return periods significant negative differences were limitedly observed in some specific regions in west virginia tennessee and the east coastline from north carolina to new york compared to the 1 hr duration cases in the histograms variation increases as does the return period suggesting that moderate differences turn into significant differences which is the same pattern as the 1 hr duration results in fig 9 changes in the difference depending on the duration and return periods are compared a pattern of the change by a return period was consistent in all duration results from a to d the change in the return periods under 10 years was relatively constant and increased in the negative direction as the return period increased in all regions the same pattern was observed even if the level of the difference was slightly different the increasing trend was significant in ohio the results in the northwestern region associated with atlas 2 were similar to the ohio results which is understandable when considering the age of atlas 2 as developed in the 1970s the change by duration was consistent in all return periods and regions a change in differences from 1 to 12 hr durations was dramatic suggesting a high possibility that the atlases have relatively high uncertainties in pfes for the durations for the longer durations the differences converged to a specific level of difference depending on the regions as shown in fig 9 a relationship of the differences depending on the return periods is compared to examine a correlation of the pfes in different return periods in fig 10 as a result the pfes in different return periods are strongly correlated the relationship between 5 and 100 yr return periods has a cc of 0 80 and the direction of differences e g negative and positive are matched by 82 as expected the relationship between 100 and 500 yr return periods is more strongly correlated cc 0 96 since their annual exceedance probabilities are close the same results are also observed in the other cases with extreme return periods and longer durations collecting all together the findings suggest that the different levels and directions are highly consistent across the scenarios in a specific gauge location we have observed a significant difference in the pfes for a 1 h duration from fig 9 fig 11 compares the mean values of the 1 h annual precipitation series to analyze the difference since the observation networks used in atlas and asos are different gauges located within 2 km of each other are selected to reduce the sampling error resulting from gauges not collocated the mean value is used in the regional frequency analysis as the index flood i e scale factor that determines a scale of the pfes based on the selected probability distribution the mean value of atlas is calculated from a long term period of data depending on the region the mean period of record in atlas is over 60 years while asos is 16 years on average overall the mean value of the atlas was 22 less than that of asos across the conus notably the extent of the difference was distinct by region in the map the significant differences greater than 50 between the mean intensities from the noaa atlas and asos are confirmed in california semiarid and ohio regions the locations with the moderate difference within 10 are in midwestern and southeastern states in the region with the significant difference the mean value of asos was 66 higher than that of atlas these results are interpreted as the difference between atlas and asos arises from the different time windows the time window represents how long a period of records is used and under what climate conditions rfa is implemented a period of records is related to determining the extent of the mean values of the ams in developing atlas on average 40 50 years of records were used and some gauges provided over 100 years of records were used to calculate the mean value however as shown in fig 2 for texas for 68 years 1950 2017 the ams increased at least 20 thus using a long period of records enough to include the status of different climate change underestimates the mean value under the current acceleration of climate change and the fact directly links to underestimating the pfes notably the fraction of the latest records i e the recent 20 years used in developing atlas is associated with the extent of the differences fig 12 shows a relationship between the atlas development year and the difference between the amss from atlas and asos in the case of a 1 h duration the difference explicitly increased as the development year is outdated suggesting that the atlas age correlates with and contributes to the difference in the case of a 24 h duration the same trend was observed as the 1 hr duration but it was not significant 3 3 evaluation of the stage iv based precipitation frequency estimates stage iv is evaluated using the bcf fig 13 shows a map of the median value of the event based bcfs estimated using 1 h quantitative precipitation estimates from stage iv and 1 hr precipitation intensity from asos overall stage iv tended to underestimate quantitative precipitation estimates and the level of bias was within 20 see the probability distribution in the figure california and the northwestern regions with complicated geomorphological characteristics presented higher bias than the other regions also numerous missing data from stage iv are identified in the states of california and washington thus some sampling points in both states are excluded from developing a new idf curve based on stage iv correcting biases in stage iv is implemented as a pre processing of the idf curve development fig 14 compares 1 hr amss from asos uncorrected and corrected stage iv among all regions the northwestern region where the quality was relatively poor and the ohio region where the quality was fairly good are selected to show the comparison in the case of the northwestern region the effect of bias correction on improving ams was significant especially the uncorrected stage iv s ams mostly less than asos ams was improved and the improvement is confirmed from the probability distribution comparison and 1 1 scatter plot in ohio bias correction s effect was insignificant as stage iv s ams was relatively moderate compared to asos s ams this result was confirmed not only in ohio but also in all regions except california and the northwestern states idf curves based on the corrected stage iv were developed and pfes compared with asos rfa in fig 15 regardless of the duration both pfes are highly correlated with each other in a high frequency scenario i e 5 yr return period and the bias was small enough to ignore this is because the ams s mean value from stage iv is close to that of asos using a bias correction process from all results as the duration increased it is clear that the two estimates tended to agree well and the variation decreased as the return period increases the variation of the scatter gradually increases due to significant differences identified in some locations but a high correlation was maintained even in the case of a 500 year return period bias increases as the return period increases but we confirmed that it is derived from the significant differences identified in a portion of locations instead of from systematic differences in all locations however the variation tended to decrease at longer durations and this is the typical accumulation effect that an error decreases as temporal resolution increases in quantitative precipitation estimation it appears that stage iv could provide relatively better pfes in longer durations based on the bcf and stage iv based pfe results the meaningful results are found in tx mw se and oh suggesting that the stage iv is eligible to develop the idf curves in the regions in ca and nw where the stage iv performance was not as good as the other regions the conventional bias correction method is limited to improving stage iv to develop the idf curves comparable with the asos rfa in sa the correlation between the stage iv based pfes and asos rfa is high enough to conclude that they are strongly correlated but the stage iv tended to underestimate the pfes more than the asos rfa 4 discussion there are a few points that should be discussed as they might have effects on the results the first is the sampling errors from using two different ground observation systems the atlas gauge and asos the primary features occurring in the sampling errors are the gauge location and density depending on the regions precipitation measurement varies with gauge locations even in better situations adjacent gauges have surprisingly limited correlational ability kidd et al 2017 for example the correlation coefficient was less than 0 5 between adjacent gauges 4 km apart habib et al 2001 also the gauge density is related to the data population for calculating statistics such as the mean value from this perspective there is a distinct possibility that both features slightly affect estimating an index flood in rfa since the numbers of gauges in both observation systems are large enough to calculate reasonable and comparable statistics we assume that the effect of the sampling error on the results was not enough to change the conclusions the recent 20 years of data were considered in developing the new idf curves in this study the length of the record is shorter than what typical studies used in frequency analysis generally a 30 year of record thus there are several expected effects arising from the use of the shorter length of a record the first one is that an index flood could be estimated higher than the case from longer records this is because an index flood decreases as the fraction of older records increases due to nonstationarity of precipitation the second one is associated with building the probability distribution the record length indicates the maximum that the aep data could present and influences the fitting of a probability distribution to data for example asos could represent 5 as the maximum aep based on 20 years of a record and atlas gives 2 5 based on 40 years of a record on average however by employing the rfa in this study we believe the effect on the developed idf curves is minimized using randomly selected two stations in texas the pfes from 20 and 30 years of a record are compared in fig 16 the amp data provided by the noaa atlas 14 are used as expected the difference between the pfes from different record lengths increases as the return period increases suggesting that a pfe for an extreme catastrophe event e g over a 100 yr return period could have a significant uncertainty depending on data length however overall differences were not remarkable at the stations also many studies have used around 20 years of a record some cases considered shorter periods to establish reasonable idf curves and the fact suggests that the use of 20 years of record is reasonable and usable for implementing frequency analysis from various perspectives ombadi et al 2018 mcgraw et al 2019 ghebreyesus and sharif 2021 the effort to develop the post atlas is urgently needed using consistent data features with a reasonable period of data well representing the current climate circumstances and selecting an appropriate probability distribution that could reflect the acceleration of climate change and associated changes in an increasing trend of the ams should be high priorities in the development lastly considering a growing trend in the ams for an interval of less than 12 hrs an increase of interest in flash flooding and pluvial floods is projected 5 conclusions the noaa atlases and the stage iv were evaluated and validated based on the recent 20 years of the gauge record nonstationarity of precipitation resulting in an increase in the mean ams and a change in precipitation frequencies was the primary reason that the older atlases diverged from recent observations the nonstationarity influenced the choice of an appropriate probability distribution the gev used in developing the atlases might not be the best option for the last two decades of precipitation record especially for deriving the pfes at higher return periods instead considering glo which has similar characteristics to the pfes under 100 year return periods and provides slightly higher values for return periods greater than 100 year could be a way to reflect the nonstationarity in an alternative way in addition using a recent period of data that well represents the current climate circumstance could reduce uncertainties arising from the effect of nonstationarity especially for calculating the index flood in rfa overall atlases underestimated the pfes against the benchmark over the conus under the current climate condition notably the trend was significant in the ohio river basin and the surrounding states and coastal areas in texas and california the difference between the atlases and benchmark increased at higher return periods and decreased at longer durations also the difference was highly correlated with the age of atlas suggesting that the outdated data is the primary source that generates uncertainties in developing the pfes stage iv can potentially be a data source for developing the post atlas period that was shown by the pfes at high frequency return periods by bias correction resulting in the well matched mean ams with the benchmark however due to a difference between the ams and the exceedance probabilities the uncertainty in the pfes for return periods greater than 100 years increased more than did that of the lower return period s uncertainty as expected also numerous missing data from stage iv were identified in the states of california and washington and excluded from developing the idf curves this fact is not only the issue found in the radar qpe data but also in most remote sensing data suggesting that measuring the eligibility of remote sensing data for developing idf curves should be implemented by preliminarily detecting missing data answering the first question raised in the introduction the noaa atlas is diverging from the eligibility to represent standard pfes under the current climate conditions and the acceleration of climate change over the conus the uncertainty of altas will keep increasing due to the nonstationarity of the ams enhanced by climate change and older records used in its development for the second question the stage iv has a high potential to be one of the data sources for developing a seamless map of the pfes but several issues should be resolved including the nonhomogeneous quality of the stage iv before accounting it for frequency analysis objectively the bias correction method employed in this study is to remove systematic errors against reference data i g gauge instead of designed to improve the accuracy of the ams it was an essential process but for deriving the pfes comparable to the benchmark an additional process that could improve the ams considering annual exceedance probabilities is recommended in addition the multi radar and multi sensor

7851,study region oil sands regions worldwide with emphasis on rapidly developing areas of western canada study focus this article introduces scientific contributions to the special issue paper collection focusing on water and environmental management in oil sands regions new hydrological insights for the region twenty one new studies highlight current advances in understanding of hydrological processes relevant to oil sands regions including 1 regional assessments of water balance and hydrochemistry in lakes wetlands and rivers 2 on lease investigations carried out at operating oil sands mines including mine circuits and reclaimed wetland and upland sites 3 off lease impact investigations including nitrogen emissions lake and wetland studies and groundwater monitoring and 4 a paleohydrologic investigation establishing a record of water balance chemistry lake productivity and temperature dating back prior to industrial development the collection emphasizes multi disciplinary field based approaches including use of physical chemical and isotopic methods several modelling programs are also shown to be informative for specific tasks the interplay of water quantity water quality and vegetation characteristics is a common finding for reclamation assessments that report sensitivity of wetland vegetation to observed salinity accumulation linked to contact with buried tailings material while all studies herein report results from the canadian oil sands region we posit that these investigations may provide insight into environmental challenges to be encountered worldwide given the similar geologic settings and bitumen properties noted graphical abstract ga1 keywords oil sands bitumen water environmental impact monitoring hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oil sands are unconventional petroleum deposits emplaced within loose or partially consolidated sandstones distinguished from conventional crude oil by its high viscosity high density and elevated concentrations of some metals such as s ni and v jasechko et al 2012 gosselin et al 2010 while oil sands are known to occur in many parts of the world including canada russia venezuela united states kazakhstan and china commercial development since the 1960 s has largely focused on oil sands located in canada although recent efforts are also noted within china liu et al 2019 despite being a controversial energy source owing to several widely publicized environmental and health issues gosselin et al 2010 oil sands and other unconventional oil deposits are expected to be a key source of energy into the second half of the 21st century wang et al 2015 current global reserves of unconventional heavy oil and bitumen are estimated at 5 9 trillion barrels 938 billion m3 bata et al 2017 roughly 5 6 times that of conventional reserves which are estimated at between 903 and 1242 billion barrels 143 and 197 billion m3 owen et al 2010 oil sands alone account for 2 7 times that of conventional reserves wec 2010 as will be described in more detail later on this special issue journal volume which includes a collection of 21 peer reviewed papers authored by government academic and industry scientists is dedicated to advances in understanding of key scientific issues that affect water resources and environmental management in oil sands regions the guest editors have spent more than 20 years carrying out research in and around the canadian oil sands region and noted that it was timely for the publication of a collection of high quality peer reviewed papers that highlight recent research identify research gaps and promote discussion of the topic within the international community while many environmental issues related to oil sands extend beyond the traditional domain of hydrology it is intended that this compilation of studies based mainly on hydrologic experiences gained from the canadian oil sands region will encourage wider dissemination and discussion of multi disciplinary challenges faced by resource development and perhaps serve as examples for establishing best practices for environmental monitoring and assessment for developing oil sands regions around the world while regional assessment of water cycle impacts is ongoing in the canadian oil sands region the work included in the special issue highlights advances made along several research pathways as an ensemble the studies contribute to greater hydrologic and hydrochemical understanding of lakes wetlands rivers and watersheds they highlight regional variations in surface groundwater interaction conditions and groundwater quality and establish that natural wetland complexes are highly structured through interdependence of vegetation water quality and surface subsurface hydrologic gradients however some specific knowledge gaps remain five new case studies demonstrate the primary challenges of reclamation i e that engineered reclamation landscapes need to mimic natural upland wetland complexes to recreate surface groundwater conditions advantageous for peat formation importantly the studies also reveal that success of constructed wetlands may require vigilant management of solutes due to intolerance of peat forming vegetation to salinity notably development and refinement of new investigative tools such as hydrologic modelling platforms and isotopic tracers are also highlighted as well as an overall need to consider the dual impacts of oil sands development under changing climate conditions 2 world reserves of oil sands bitumen for the purposes of this paper oil tar sands are considered to be natural bitumen deposits with high viscosity 10 000 cp and high density 10 api gravity api american petroleum institute which unlike heavy oil and most extra heavy oils prevent it from flowing to a well bore kashirtsev and hein 2012 and or cause it to exist in a solid state attanasi et al 2010 a similar definition has been widely adopted by the world energy council wec 2010 and others gosselin et al 2010 liu et al 2019 oil sands deposits differ from conventional oil deposits in that reservoirs typically occur at relatively shallow depths where the sealing capacity of cap rocks is poor allowing oxic surface waters to penetrate the oil and permitting biodegradation water washing oxidation evaporation and distillation leading to higher density oils with typically higher sulfur content and elevated trace metals concentrations liu et al 2019 oil sands deposits have been identified in over 70 countries worldwide hills 1974 and are expected to contain more than 3328 billion barrels 529 billion m3 wec 2010 p 140 or roughly 2 7 times the proven conventional oil reserves of the world estimated at 1240 billion barrels 197 billion m3 wec 2010 p 56 while 598 natural bitumen deposits have been identified worldwide demaison 1977 showed that just 16 of the largest oil sands deposits exceeded the conventional oil reserves at the time global distribution of oil sands deposits and a summary of reserve estimates are provided in fig 1 and table 1 respectively formation of petroleum deposits is generally considered a multi stage biogenic process requiring source rocks maturation migration pathways reservoir rocks traps and seals akramkhodzhayev and amirkhanov 1986 oil sands deposits have been shown to occur most often in structural foreland basins adjacent to mountain belts for example the alberta oil sands deposits which comprise 73 of the world bitumen reserves table 1 are situated in such a setting at the northeastern margin of the western canada sedimentary basin wcsb which has also hosted most of canada s conventional oil and gas deposits gosselin et al 2010 in 2022 87 of total oil production in the province of alberta was from oil sands regional structure of the wcsb is a west dipping homocline where maturation within organic rich marine shale source rocks and well developed fluid transport within a thick sedimentary wedge were created due to rocky mountain uplift during the late cretaceous laramide orogeny statigraphic emplacement of oil within shallow poorly consolidated sands of the cretaceous mcmurray formation was also aided by the presence of salt dome collapse structures and a regional shale cap rock demaison 1977 similar foreland settings have been noted for venezuelan orinco deposits the russian and kazakhstani deposits and several deposits in the united states less common structural settings include rift settings such as madagascar and melville island canada demaison 1977 direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits in the western canada sedimentary basin has suggested hydrocarbon ages to be 112 5 3 ma selby and creaser 2005 or mesozoic age 252 66 million years ago which is contemporaneous with formation of about 70 of world reserves halbouty et al 1970 in the case of oil sands it is generally thought that biodegradation and water washing occurred post emplacement causing light oil to become more viscous richer in sulfur resins asphaltenes and metals including nickel and vanadium shuqing et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 kazakhstan has the second largest oil sands reserves in the world 12 6 estimated at 420 billion barrels 67 billion m3 the main deposits are located in west kazakhstan in the aktobe atyrau and mangistau regions roughly situated between or close to the caspian and aral seas tileuberdi et al 2015 while exploratory development of kazakhstan s oil sands began as early as the 1980s commercial scale development using conventional hot water extraction techniques has been constrained by limited availability of local water resources russian deposits of natural bitumen account for 10 4 of the world reserves and are estimated at 346 billion barrels 55 billion m3 the main deposits include the siberian platform olenek uplift eastern siberia and the lena anabar basin although these deposits have not yet been brought into commercial production due to abundant conventional oil reserves as well as technical challenges associated with depth of emplacement remoteness and subarctic climate liu et al 2019 kashirtsev and hein 2012 the faja orinoco deposit in eastern venezuela is the world s single largest heavy oil accumulation with an estimated 310 billion barrels 49 3 billion m3 being technically recoverable at present with daily production estimated at 600 000 barrels day in 2017 bata et al 2017 while the deposit is primarily classified as extra heavy oil rather than oil sands there is at least one natural bitumen deposit guanoco lake located near the caribbean coast on the north side of the eastern venezuela basin wec 2010 p 149 based on the survey of liu et al 2019 the api of the orinoco deposits ranges from 7 to 20 api gravity so does not clearly fall into the category of oil sands and so is not included in table 1 a very early estimate of oil sands reserves for the region was 62 million barrels walters 1974 although this estimate appears to be very conservative the united states oil sands deposits include commercial extraction from two principal areas the san joaquin basin of central california and the north slope of alaska as well as noteworthy accumulations in alabama kentucky new mexico oklahoma texas utah and wyoming us reserves of oil sands in place are estimated at close to 54 billion barrels 8 5 billion m3 wec 2010 schenk et al 2006 china s oil sands deposits include the fengcheng oil sands in karamay xinjiang an occurrence which is transitional from heavy and light oil at greater depths some of the oil sands deposits are very shallow or surface occurrences huang et al 2020 currently testing is being carried out to develop open pit mining for shallow occurrences 75 m and steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or other in situ extraction tests are targeting bitumen at greater depths 150 m while china has limited oil sands reserves the national interest in global oil sands resources was clearly demonstrated in 2012 by purchase of a leading canadian owned insitu oil sands company nexen now cnooc petroleum north america 3 oil sands extraction and environmental impacts open pit mining techniques have typically been used when oil sands deposits occur within 75 m depth below surface whereas various in situ techniques including steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or cyclic steam stimulation css are used to extract oil from more deeply emplaced deposits birks et al 2022 mining processing and upgrading of oil sands potentially involves considerable environmental disturbance and reclamation much can be learned from 50 years of development of the athabasca oil sands deposit the most extensive deposit in canada and by far the leading development in the world bitumen underlies about 1 4 of alberta s boreal forest 142 000 km2 although the total footprint of approved mining projects as of dec 31 2020 under the environmental protection and enhancement act epea was 1599 6 km2 aep 2022 0 4 of alberta s boreal forest zone and comparable to the area of the cities of brisbane rio de janeiro or london city mayors 2022 however potential off lease impacts may affect watersheds over much wider regions kelly et al 2009 culp et al 2021 arciszewski et al 2022 mining involves exploration land clearing road and pipeline construction creation of large excavations and tailings ponds and construction of infrastructure such as processing plants and upgraders the primary environmental risks include i off lease migration of oil sands processed water ospw containing deleterious substances such as naphthenic acids the potential for which was described by ferguson et al 2009 and fennell and arciszewski 2019 ii emissions from vehicles upgraders and volatile contaminants outgassing from tailings ponds and mine pits which also include greenhouse gases liggio et al 2019 iii dewatering and well disposal of groundwater for pit development and abstraction of river water for hot water treatment reclamation of mining disturbances is required in all jurisdictions under large scale development i e canada in situ recovery accounts for 85 of global reserves and is expected to have a lower impact intensity than surface mining development of well pads and injection production galleries pipeline and roads and deep well disposal are the main causes of impact perhaps the principal environmental advantage of in situ methods is that bitumen is produced underground and pumped to surface avoiding a need for tailings ponds although thermal stimulation of aquifers is known to potentially cause mobilization of metals organics and gases moncur et al 2015 emissions while reduced substantially compared to open pit mining remain an important concern an informed and comprehensive review of the environmental and health issues associated with oil sands industry in canada was conducted by gosselin et al 2010 with subsequent syntheses of ecological and causal effects of oil sands activity impacts on river ecosystems by culp et al 2021 and historical overview and governance of environmental monitoring by dub√© et al 2022 oil sands development is a multi decadal industrial activity where oil sands environmental challenges should be considered regionally in the context of the lifecycle of operations fig 2 the low relief wetland dominated landscape of the canadian oil sands regions and cold continental climate in alberta have presented many challenges to application of conventional hydrologic methods firstly peat deposits are nearly ubiquitous across the region and may reach up to 10 m in thickness peat is difficult to monitor hydrologically and has significantly different properties than mineral soil including higher porosity variable hydraulic conductivity where it may vary from surface to 0 5 m by up to 5 orders of magnitude due to decomposition and compression as well as different soil water drainage characteristics and thermal properties letts et al 2000 peatlands retain enormous reserves of water serving to regulate low flows and floods they also perform indirect functions such as nutrient retention carbon storage and sediment retention often being interconnected to form wetland complexes with distinct plant communities and hydrologic properties due to low relief hydraulic gradients are challenging to measure accurately especially owing to irregularities such as hummocks and depressions on most wetland surfaces which commonly produce fill and spill type runoff during spring melt and rainfall events river gauging networks across the lower athabasca region are fairly effective at quantifying streamflow in the main river channels but gauging of smaller tributaries and lake outflows that perennially freeze to bottom has required these gauges to operate only seasonally generally the spring melt period is difficult to capture in these systems due to late melting of ice cover and resulting irregularity of channel configurations at this time of year other complications include permafrost degradation which has been occurring across the region since the little ice age permafrost largely restricted to bog plateaus in the region at present are potentially major sources of regional runoff but have been found to respond non monotonically to climate change contributing initially to higher annual water yields which are eventually exhausted leading to an overall reduction in water yield as permafrost is completely thawed according to the permafrost thaw cycle gibson et al 2019 abstraction of water from the athabasca river pumping of groundwater for pit dewatering or in situ water supply and deep well disposal have also played a role in altered surface and groundwater systems hydrogeological complexities also contribute to the challenge of working in canada s oil sands region as several generations of glacial till and an extensive network of buried channels occur above and incised within bedrock additional features such as saline springs found along river channels are widely attributed to glaciogenic waters that have originated from injection and westward migration of subglacial meltwater under kilometers thick ice sheets at the margins of the wcsb leading to dissolution of evaporitic beds and subsequent reflux of water once ice sheets melted leading to eastward and upward migration of these waters grasby and chen 2008 birks et al 2018 2019 in addition baseline conditions prior to development have been difficult to establish due to a 50 year history of resource development in the region including cutting of seismic lines for petroleum exploration and early development of natural gas which have both contributed to alteration of the natural state of surface runoff and groundwater levels reclamation the process of returning land used for oil sands mining back to its original natural state is another challenge of the oil sands industry in alberta where all mines are required to be post operationally restored and this task has only just begun in the last decade by 2020 only 74 km2 of terrestrial and 13 km2 wetlands aquatics landscape were permanently reclaimed aep 2022 the main challenge according to several of the studies presented herein has been to construct wetlands that are both sustainable and peat forming without mobilization or concentration of salinity that is present in residual tailings material and which is harmful to wetland vegetation as for other oil sands regions it is likely that the environmental challenges may take on completely different forms in kazakhstan for example commercial scale development using conventional hot water extraction techniques is not possible due to long distances to water sources making in situ approaches using solvent extraction a more attractive option 4 content of the water and environmental management collection the special issue includes 21 water and environmental case studies in four general topical areas 1 regional assessments 2 on lease investigations 3 off lease impact investigations and 4 paleohydrology as noted in table 2 below the studies contained in this special issue have addressed many of the issues described in the preceding sections and in many cases have integrated multi disciplinary approaches to address water quantity water quality and vegetation issues related to oil sands resource extraction activities several of the studies have been directly or indirectly funded by industry and or by government notably much of the research was initiated in response to public and environmental concerns and or executed as part of the joint oil sands monitoring josm plan developed by the government of canada and the province of alberta the main purpose of josm which has since transitioned to oil sands monitoring osm is to provide risk based assessments of impacts from oil sands activity on environmental health and to examine cause effect relationships environment canada and alberta environment 2011a 2011b an important distinction is made in our classification of studies between those conducted in on lease locations which reflect active or decommissioned mine sites with obvious development impacts versus off lease locations which are more likely to reflect natural systems or to have indirect impacts on lease investigations often reflect research carried out under regulatory requirements of the alberta energy regulator or through initiatives of individual operators or consortia such as canadian oil sands innovation alliance cosia a brief description of the contributions to the collection follows a map of the canadian oil sands region illustrates the regional extent of the oil sands deposits and the spatial distribution of the study locations described in this collection fig 3 4 1 regional assessments 4 1 1 lakes castrillon munoz et al 2022 assess geochemical processes contributing to ph increase in local lakes including carbonate dissolution and organic matter uptake and provide support for the hypothesis that permafrost thaw processes are releasing carbon to the lakes and alteration of lake ice characteristics may be affecting co2 dissolution ph increase was unexpected when observed as lakes were anticipated to acidify in response to increased acid deposition in the oil sands region downstream of the oil sands development neary et al 2021 provided new insight into hydrological processes that cause of lake level variation within the peace athabasca delta pad floodplains a ramsar wetland of international importance based on ice free period water levels in 50 sites the study develops a description and classification scheme which allows for differentiation of sites which may be more influenced by ice jam flooding and river flooding versus precipitation fed sites which are likely to be affected by wet dry deposition this information will be helpful in addressing impacts due to river regulation climate change as well as potential contaminant migration from both riverine and airborne pathways that have been suggested in prior work 4 1 2 wetlands vitt et al 2022 investigate the interplay between plant community distributions and water chemistry in a patterned rich fen located adjacent to a planned open pit oil sands mine and apply these characteristics including string flark size and orientation to delineate water source regions that support the fen the study is significant as it offers a practical basis for understanding the important source areas that support the patterned fen which despite its proximity to open pit mine development is required by the energy regulator to be preserved gibson et al 2022 report on an isotope mass balance study carried out on 1022 open water wetlands that are widely distributed across alberta including the oil sands regions the survey which spans grassland parkland foothills mountains and boreal regions was applied to quantify water balance and to classify and map sites according to degree of reliance on groundwater and other factors for the 3 alberta oil sands regions peace athabasca and cold lake the survey suggested that between 20 and 40 of wetlands within the bitumen zones are detectably groundwater reliant compared to 35 50 in the wider vicinity of the deposits such approaches are expected to provide tools for designing and monitoring wetland water balance and enable the identification of potential impacts related to development activities versus other factors 4 1 3 rivers sources properties and transport of dissolved organic matter dom in the lower athabasca river was investigated by xue et al 2022 providing significant new information on natural variations along an important reach with abundant oil sands development tributaries were found to be major sources of dissolved organic carbon doc with trends towards greater degrees of humification and aromaticity downstream the study also examined river mixing in detail and concluded that dom may be applied as a conservative tracer of riverine mixing for some applications ghotbizadeh et al 2022 examined trace element distributions along a similar 125 km reach of the lower athabasca river with abundant oil sands development a pca analysis was also used to identify specific tributary contributions to the athabasca river although a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic inputs were anticipated average trace element concentrations were found to be below the canadian surface water quality guidelines ccme 2022 thomas et al 2022 measured discharge and water quality parameters in select tributaries to the lower athabasca river to evaluate the importance of rain events in controlling nutrients and priority pollutants the study found that average daily loads were highly sensitive to changes occurring during rain events but overall that such perturbations during rain events had little effect on annual loadings calculations 4 1 4 watersheds holmes et al 2022 provide an analysis of hydrological processes influencing streamflow volume and timing in the athabasca river watershed by testing sensitivity to flow and isotopic performance metrics within an isotope enabled distributed hydrological model interestingly isotopic metrics were found to be more useful that flow metrics for improving the model representation of subsurface hydrological processes peters et al 2022 applied the cold regions hydrological indicators of change framework to examine the geography of flow generation to and within the lower athabasca river watershed a combined flow magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis yielded new insights open water low flows emanated from the upper regions and experienced a generally increasing tendency from the lower regions peak summer flows generally experienced decreases from the upper portions of the basin while contrary increasing tendencies emerged for the east bank of the lower athabasca river mainstem climate landscape and geology were considered as potential causal factors for the observed divergent runoff generation responses while contrast between east bank and west bank responses is consistent with prior streamflow assessments gibson et al 2016 bickerton et al 2018 4 2 on lease investigations 4 2 1 mine water circuits chad et al 2022 provide a water balance and isotope labelling study of recycle water circuit at a mine comprising open pit excavation of bituminous sands at two sites mildred lake and aurora north with a single hot water extraction circuit connecting extraction plants at each mine importantly the study identified unique evaporative effects of cooling towers and in addition provided the most recent precipitation data update used to refine the local meteoric water line of baer et al 2016 4 2 2 reclamation studies several contributions to the special issue present research carried out on pilot scale experimental wetland reclamation projects the nikanotee fen watershed 32 ha sandhill fen 52 ha are designed to guide decisions and strategies for commercial scale fen reclamation in the future ketcheson and price 2016 the nikanotee fen was constructed on an overburden dump and the sandhill fen was built upon sand capped soft tailings which are highly saline popoviƒá et al 2022 evaluated the initial performance of the nikanotee fen watershed using a functional based ecosystem scale approach focused on carbon dynamics and water use efficiency wue the study is fairly optimistic in that it suggests overall that conditions during early development are evolving towards a self sustaining carbon accumulating functional ecosystem also working at the nikanotee fen watershed yang et al 2022 described how elevated sodium na in the porewater of mine waste materials has been shown to migrate to the fen through groundwater likely influencing fen vegetation health and in particular impacting the rooting zone they suggest that salt tolerant vegetation may be required to maintain carbon accumulation in such constructed systems kessel et al 2021 report on the role of recharge basins for maintaining sufficient water availability at the nikanotee fen they showed that such basins enhance recharge within engineered landscapes and provide a consistent and focused supply of water to upland aquifers and importantly serve to supply relatively fresh groundwater to downgradient ecosystems biagi and carey 2022 report on 6 years of hydrochemical and isotopic studies carried out at the sandhill fen watershed which were used to evaluate salinity and ion patterns and provide insight on the fen s trajectory based on these findings a shift in design strategy is recommended replicating saline instead of freshwater peatlands to increase the success of these systems nagare et al 2022 describe use of an integrated surface subsurface water and solute modeling to evaluate conditions of a reclaimed in pit oil sands mine including freezing and thawing impacts transient simulations of wet and dry climate cycles suggest that the reclaimed landform will shed water only during wet years 4 3 off lease impact investigations a number of offsite investigations examined potential impacts of oil sands operations beyond the operators lease boundaries savage et al 2022 quantify enrichment of eight metals be cd cr cu ni pb v zn in aquatic biota relative to sediment based pre industrial baselines in 40 lakes potential for downstream delivery of contaminants via athabasca river floodwaters to lakes of the pad has raised local to international concern the study extending to 40 lakes showed that absence of marked metal enrichment in flooded delta lakes as well as the lack of difference in enrichment among lakes of different flood status provided evidence that oil sands industrial metal pollution is not detectable at the base of food webs in lakes of the downstream delta elmes et al 2022 describe impacts to hydrologic function of a channel fen following placement of an access road and below ground pipeline one of the important findings was that if possible pipelines should be oriented parallel to wetland flow direction and located along the central axis of the wetlands to minimize overall impacts lindenschmidt et al 2022 developed and applied a novel quasi two dimensional surface water quality modelling approach to simulate sediment and vanadium transport along the lower athabasca river where it traverses the oil sands region their conclusion regarding observed vanadium distributions was that it derives mainly from surficial aquifers and is present in muskeg dewatering water from the mine sites and possibly also enters the river via dust deposition and bank erosion based on their analysis contaminated sediment and or tailings water seepage do not seem as likely based on the available evidence wieder et al 2022 test the hypothesis that 15n in lichens from bogs can resolve the extent to which nitrogen deposition from oil sands may have affected the nitrogen cycle in area ecosystems their study concluded that at present a paucity of data on Œ¥15n signatures of oil sands related n sources precluded definitive interpretation of Œ¥15n in plant or lichen tissues with respect to oil sands n emissions birks et al 2022 describe an assessment of groundwater monitoring near oil sands development based on 546 water quality parameters measured in 5118 wells differentiated by hydrostratigraphic unit over the period 1958 2015 regionally baseline water quality conditions were found to vary significantly in the various subsurface units with wide ranges in total dissolved solids and geochemical facies reflecting variable lithology and geochemical processes data gaps and a number of spatial and temporal anomalies were identified described and recommendations for follow up 4 4 paleohydrology study zabel et al 2022 describe a paleolimnological assessment of mcclelland lake a shallow hardwater lake situated adjacent to an oil sands mine site under current development their study is particularly interesting as it establishes a record of water balance lake chemistry lake productivity and temperature dating prior to industrial development the study provides an approach to characterize natural range of variability of ecosystem conditions over extended time periods as compared to conventional monitoring 5 summary to date oil sands have reached an advanced stage of commercial scale development in canada although the large world reserves of oil sands bitumen which exceed current known conventional petroleum reserves by almost three times suggest that these deposits will form a significant component of the future energy profile of leading economies such as china russia and the americas while regional assessment of water cycle impacts is ongoing in the canadian oil sands region studies highlighted in the special issue provide new information novel tools and methods that may assist in strategic planning for future environmental investigations worldwide in particular the examples drawn from these case studies illustrate the importance of surface groundwater interaction and salinity management for successful reclamation of peat forming wetlands a wholistic approach considering that oil sands development is occurring under changing climate conditions is also shown to be required for improved hydrologic

7851,study region oil sands regions worldwide with emphasis on rapidly developing areas of western canada study focus this article introduces scientific contributions to the special issue paper collection focusing on water and environmental management in oil sands regions new hydrological insights for the region twenty one new studies highlight current advances in understanding of hydrological processes relevant to oil sands regions including 1 regional assessments of water balance and hydrochemistry in lakes wetlands and rivers 2 on lease investigations carried out at operating oil sands mines including mine circuits and reclaimed wetland and upland sites 3 off lease impact investigations including nitrogen emissions lake and wetland studies and groundwater monitoring and 4 a paleohydrologic investigation establishing a record of water balance chemistry lake productivity and temperature dating back prior to industrial development the collection emphasizes multi disciplinary field based approaches including use of physical chemical and isotopic methods several modelling programs are also shown to be informative for specific tasks the interplay of water quantity water quality and vegetation characteristics is a common finding for reclamation assessments that report sensitivity of wetland vegetation to observed salinity accumulation linked to contact with buried tailings material while all studies herein report results from the canadian oil sands region we posit that these investigations may provide insight into environmental challenges to be encountered worldwide given the similar geologic settings and bitumen properties noted graphical abstract ga1 keywords oil sands bitumen water environmental impact monitoring hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oil sands are unconventional petroleum deposits emplaced within loose or partially consolidated sandstones distinguished from conventional crude oil by its high viscosity high density and elevated concentrations of some metals such as s ni and v jasechko et al 2012 gosselin et al 2010 while oil sands are known to occur in many parts of the world including canada russia venezuela united states kazakhstan and china commercial development since the 1960 s has largely focused on oil sands located in canada although recent efforts are also noted within china liu et al 2019 despite being a controversial energy source owing to several widely publicized environmental and health issues gosselin et al 2010 oil sands and other unconventional oil deposits are expected to be a key source of energy into the second half of the 21st century wang et al 2015 current global reserves of unconventional heavy oil and bitumen are estimated at 5 9 trillion barrels 938 billion m3 bata et al 2017 roughly 5 6 times that of conventional reserves which are estimated at between 903 and 1242 billion barrels 143 and 197 billion m3 owen et al 2010 oil sands alone account for 2 7 times that of conventional reserves wec 2010 as will be described in more detail later on this special issue journal volume which includes a collection of 21 peer reviewed papers authored by government academic and industry scientists is dedicated to advances in understanding of key scientific issues that affect water resources and environmental management in oil sands regions the guest editors have spent more than 20 years carrying out research in and around the canadian oil sands region and noted that it was timely for the publication of a collection of high quality peer reviewed papers that highlight recent research identify research gaps and promote discussion of the topic within the international community while many environmental issues related to oil sands extend beyond the traditional domain of hydrology it is intended that this compilation of studies based mainly on hydrologic experiences gained from the canadian oil sands region will encourage wider dissemination and discussion of multi disciplinary challenges faced by resource development and perhaps serve as examples for establishing best practices for environmental monitoring and assessment for developing oil sands regions around the world while regional assessment of water cycle impacts is ongoing in the canadian oil sands region the work included in the special issue highlights advances made along several research pathways as an ensemble the studies contribute to greater hydrologic and hydrochemical understanding of lakes wetlands rivers and watersheds they highlight regional variations in surface groundwater interaction conditions and groundwater quality and establish that natural wetland complexes are highly structured through interdependence of vegetation water quality and surface subsurface hydrologic gradients however some specific knowledge gaps remain five new case studies demonstrate the primary challenges of reclamation i e that engineered reclamation landscapes need to mimic natural upland wetland complexes to recreate surface groundwater conditions advantageous for peat formation importantly the studies also reveal that success of constructed wetlands may require vigilant management of solutes due to intolerance of peat forming vegetation to salinity notably development and refinement of new investigative tools such as hydrologic modelling platforms and isotopic tracers are also highlighted as well as an overall need to consider the dual impacts of oil sands development under changing climate conditions 2 world reserves of oil sands bitumen for the purposes of this paper oil tar sands are considered to be natural bitumen deposits with high viscosity 10 000 cp and high density 10 api gravity api american petroleum institute which unlike heavy oil and most extra heavy oils prevent it from flowing to a well bore kashirtsev and hein 2012 and or cause it to exist in a solid state attanasi et al 2010 a similar definition has been widely adopted by the world energy council wec 2010 and others gosselin et al 2010 liu et al 2019 oil sands deposits differ from conventional oil deposits in that reservoirs typically occur at relatively shallow depths where the sealing capacity of cap rocks is poor allowing oxic surface waters to penetrate the oil and permitting biodegradation water washing oxidation evaporation and distillation leading to higher density oils with typically higher sulfur content and elevated trace metals concentrations liu et al 2019 oil sands deposits have been identified in over 70 countries worldwide hills 1974 and are expected to contain more than 3328 billion barrels 529 billion m3 wec 2010 p 140 or roughly 2 7 times the proven conventional oil reserves of the world estimated at 1240 billion barrels 197 billion m3 wec 2010 p 56 while 598 natural bitumen deposits have been identified worldwide demaison 1977 showed that just 16 of the largest oil sands deposits exceeded the conventional oil reserves at the time global distribution of oil sands deposits and a summary of reserve estimates are provided in fig 1 and table 1 respectively formation of petroleum deposits is generally considered a multi stage biogenic process requiring source rocks maturation migration pathways reservoir rocks traps and seals akramkhodzhayev and amirkhanov 1986 oil sands deposits have been shown to occur most often in structural foreland basins adjacent to mountain belts for example the alberta oil sands deposits which comprise 73 of the world bitumen reserves table 1 are situated in such a setting at the northeastern margin of the western canada sedimentary basin wcsb which has also hosted most of canada s conventional oil and gas deposits gosselin et al 2010 in 2022 87 of total oil production in the province of alberta was from oil sands regional structure of the wcsb is a west dipping homocline where maturation within organic rich marine shale source rocks and well developed fluid transport within a thick sedimentary wedge were created due to rocky mountain uplift during the late cretaceous laramide orogeny statigraphic emplacement of oil within shallow poorly consolidated sands of the cretaceous mcmurray formation was also aided by the presence of salt dome collapse structures and a regional shale cap rock demaison 1977 similar foreland settings have been noted for venezuelan orinco deposits the russian and kazakhstani deposits and several deposits in the united states less common structural settings include rift settings such as madagascar and melville island canada demaison 1977 direct radiometric dating of hydrocarbon deposits in the western canada sedimentary basin has suggested hydrocarbon ages to be 112 5 3 ma selby and creaser 2005 or mesozoic age 252 66 million years ago which is contemporaneous with formation of about 70 of world reserves halbouty et al 1970 in the case of oil sands it is generally thought that biodegradation and water washing occurred post emplacement causing light oil to become more viscous richer in sulfur resins asphaltenes and metals including nickel and vanadium shuqing et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 kazakhstan has the second largest oil sands reserves in the world 12 6 estimated at 420 billion barrels 67 billion m3 the main deposits are located in west kazakhstan in the aktobe atyrau and mangistau regions roughly situated between or close to the caspian and aral seas tileuberdi et al 2015 while exploratory development of kazakhstan s oil sands began as early as the 1980s commercial scale development using conventional hot water extraction techniques has been constrained by limited availability of local water resources russian deposits of natural bitumen account for 10 4 of the world reserves and are estimated at 346 billion barrels 55 billion m3 the main deposits include the siberian platform olenek uplift eastern siberia and the lena anabar basin although these deposits have not yet been brought into commercial production due to abundant conventional oil reserves as well as technical challenges associated with depth of emplacement remoteness and subarctic climate liu et al 2019 kashirtsev and hein 2012 the faja orinoco deposit in eastern venezuela is the world s single largest heavy oil accumulation with an estimated 310 billion barrels 49 3 billion m3 being technically recoverable at present with daily production estimated at 600 000 barrels day in 2017 bata et al 2017 while the deposit is primarily classified as extra heavy oil rather than oil sands there is at least one natural bitumen deposit guanoco lake located near the caribbean coast on the north side of the eastern venezuela basin wec 2010 p 149 based on the survey of liu et al 2019 the api of the orinoco deposits ranges from 7 to 20 api gravity so does not clearly fall into the category of oil sands and so is not included in table 1 a very early estimate of oil sands reserves for the region was 62 million barrels walters 1974 although this estimate appears to be very conservative the united states oil sands deposits include commercial extraction from two principal areas the san joaquin basin of central california and the north slope of alaska as well as noteworthy accumulations in alabama kentucky new mexico oklahoma texas utah and wyoming us reserves of oil sands in place are estimated at close to 54 billion barrels 8 5 billion m3 wec 2010 schenk et al 2006 china s oil sands deposits include the fengcheng oil sands in karamay xinjiang an occurrence which is transitional from heavy and light oil at greater depths some of the oil sands deposits are very shallow or surface occurrences huang et al 2020 currently testing is being carried out to develop open pit mining for shallow occurrences 75 m and steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or other in situ extraction tests are targeting bitumen at greater depths 150 m while china has limited oil sands reserves the national interest in global oil sands resources was clearly demonstrated in 2012 by purchase of a leading canadian owned insitu oil sands company nexen now cnooc petroleum north america 3 oil sands extraction and environmental impacts open pit mining techniques have typically been used when oil sands deposits occur within 75 m depth below surface whereas various in situ techniques including steam assisted gravity drainage sagd or cyclic steam stimulation css are used to extract oil from more deeply emplaced deposits birks et al 2022 mining processing and upgrading of oil sands potentially involves considerable environmental disturbance and reclamation much can be learned from 50 years of development of the athabasca oil sands deposit the most extensive deposit in canada and by far the leading development in the world bitumen underlies about 1 4 of alberta s boreal forest 142 000 km2 although the total footprint of approved mining projects as of dec 31 2020 under the environmental protection and enhancement act epea was 1599 6 km2 aep 2022 0 4 of alberta s boreal forest zone and comparable to the area of the cities of brisbane rio de janeiro or london city mayors 2022 however potential off lease impacts may affect watersheds over much wider regions kelly et al 2009 culp et al 2021 arciszewski et al 2022 mining involves exploration land clearing road and pipeline construction creation of large excavations and tailings ponds and construction of infrastructure such as processing plants and upgraders the primary environmental risks include i off lease migration of oil sands processed water ospw containing deleterious substances such as naphthenic acids the potential for which was described by ferguson et al 2009 and fennell and arciszewski 2019 ii emissions from vehicles upgraders and volatile contaminants outgassing from tailings ponds and mine pits which also include greenhouse gases liggio et al 2019 iii dewatering and well disposal of groundwater for pit development and abstraction of river water for hot water treatment reclamation of mining disturbances is required in all jurisdictions under large scale development i e canada in situ recovery accounts for 85 of global reserves and is expected to have a lower impact intensity than surface mining development of well pads and injection production galleries pipeline and roads and deep well disposal are the main causes of impact perhaps the principal environmental advantage of in situ methods is that bitumen is produced underground and pumped to surface avoiding a need for tailings ponds although thermal stimulation of aquifers is known to potentially cause mobilization of metals organics and gases moncur et al 2015 emissions while reduced substantially compared to open pit mining remain an important concern an informed and comprehensive review of the environmental and health issues associated with oil sands industry in canada was

permafrost thaw processes are releasing carbon to the lakes and alteration of lake ice characteristics may be affecting co2 dissolution ph increase was unexpected when observed as lakes were anticipated to acidify in response to increased acid deposition in the oil sands region downstream of the oil sands development neary et al 2021 provided new insight into hydrological processes that cause of lake level variation within the peace athabasca delta pad floodplains a ramsar wetland of international importance based on ice free period water levels in 50 sites the study develops a description and classification scheme which allows for differentiation of sites which may be more influenced by ice jam flooding and river flooding versus precipitation fed sites which are likely to be affected by wet dry deposition this information will be helpful in addressing impacts due to river regulation climate change as well as potential contaminant migration from both riverine and airborne pathways that have been suggested in prior work 4 1 2 wetlands vitt et al 2022 investigate the interplay between plant community distributions and water chemistry in a patterned rich fen located adjacent to a planned open pit oil sands mine and apply these characteristics including string flark size and orientation to delineate water source regions that support the fen the study is significant as it offers a practical basis for understanding the important source areas that support the patterned fen which despite its proximity to open pit mine development is required by the energy regulator to be preserved gibson et al 2022 report on an isotope mass balance study carried out on 1022 open water wetlands that are widely distributed across alberta including the oil sands regions the survey which spans grassland parkland foothills mountains and boreal regions was applied to quantify water balance and to classify and map sites according to degree of reliance on groundwater and other factors for the 3 alberta oil sands regions peace athabasca and cold lake the survey suggested that between 20 and 40 of wetlands within the bitumen zones are detectably groundwater reliant compared to 35 50 in the wider vicinity of the deposits such approaches are expected to provide tools for designing and monitoring wetland water balance and enable the identification of potential impacts related to development activities versus other factors 4 1 3 rivers sources properties and transport of dissolved organic matter dom in the lower athabasca river was investigated by xue et al 2022 providing significant new information on natural variations along an important reach with abundant oil sands development tributaries were found to be major sources of dissolved organic carbon doc with trends towards greater degrees of humification and aromaticity downstream the study also examined river mixing in detail and concluded that dom may be applied as a conservative tracer of riverine mixing for some applications ghotbizadeh et al 2022 examined trace element distributions along a similar 125 km reach of the lower athabasca river with abundant oil sands development a pca analysis was also used to identify specific tributary contributions to the athabasca river although a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic inputs were anticipated average trace element concentrations were found to be below the canadian surface water quality guidelines ccme 2022 thomas et al 2022 measured discharge and water quality parameters in select tributaries to the lower athabasca river to evaluate the importance of rain events in controlling nutrients and priority pollutants the study found that average daily loads were highly sensitive to changes occurring during rain events but overall that such perturbations during rain events had little effect on annual loadings calculations 4 1 4 watersheds holmes et al 2022 provide an analysis of hydrological processes influencing streamflow volume and timing in the athabasca river watershed by testing sensitivity to flow and isotopic performance metrics within an isotope enabled distributed hydrological model interestingly isotopic metrics were found to be more useful that flow metrics for improving the model representation of subsurface hydrological processes peters et al 2022 applied the cold regions hydrological indicators of change framework to examine the geography of flow generation to and within the lower athabasca river watershed a combined flow magnitude and relative flow contributions analysis yielded new insights open water low flows emanated from the upper regions and experienced a generally increasing tendency from the lower regions peak summer flows generally experienced decreases from the upper portions of the basin while contrary increasing tendencies emerged for the east bank of the lower athabasca river mainstem climate landscape and geology were considered as potential causal factors for the observed divergent runoff generation responses while contrast between east bank and west bank responses is consistent with prior streamflow assessments gibson et al 2016 bickerton et al 2018 4 2 on lease investigations 4 2 1 mine water circuits chad et al 2022 provide a water balance and isotope labelling study of recycle water circuit at a mine comprising open pit excavation of bituminous sands at two sites mildred lake and aurora north with a single hot water extraction circuit connecting extraction plants at each mine importantly the study identified unique evaporative effects of cooling towers and in addition provided the most recent precipitation data update used to refine the local meteoric water line of baer et al 2016 4 2 2 reclamation studies several contributions to the special issue present research carried out on pilot scale experimental wetland reclamation projects the nikanotee fen watershed 32 ha sandhill fen 52 ha are designed to guide decisions and strategies for commercial scale fen reclamation in the future ketcheson and price 2016 the nikanotee fen was constructed on an overburden dump and the sandhill fen was built upon sand capped soft tailings which are highly saline popoviƒá et al 2022 evaluated the initial performance of the nikanotee fen watershed using a functional based ecosystem scale approach focused on carbon dynamics and water use efficiency wue the study is fairly optimistic in that it suggests overall that conditions during early development are evolving towards a self sustaining carbon accumulating functional ecosystem also working at the nikanotee fen watershed yang et al 2022 described how elevated sodium na in the porewater of mine waste materials has been shown to migrate to the fen through groundwater likely influencing fen vegetation health and in particular impacting the rooting zone they suggest that salt tolerant vegetation may be required to maintain carbon accumulation in such constructed systems kessel et al 2021 report on the role of recharge basins for maintaining sufficient water availability at the nikanotee fen they showed that such basins enhance recharge within engineered landscapes and provide a consistent and focused supply of water to upland aquifers and importantly serve to supply relatively fresh groundwater to downgradient ecosystems biagi and carey 2022 report on 6 years of hydrochemical and isotopic studies carried out at the sandhill fen watershed which were used to evaluate salinity and ion patterns and provide insight on the fen s trajectory based on these findings a shift in design strategy is recommended replicating saline instead of freshwater peatlands to increase the success of these systems nagare et al 2022 describe use of an integrated surface subsurface water and solute modeling to evaluate conditions of a reclaimed in pit oil sands mine including freezing and thawing impacts transient simulations of wet and dry climate cycles suggest that the reclaimed landform will shed water only during wet years 4 3 off lease impact investigations a number of offsite investigations examined potential impacts of oil sands operations beyond the operators lease boundaries savage et al 2022 quantify enrichment of eight metals be cd cr cu ni pb v zn in aquatic biota relative to sediment based pre industrial baselines in 40 lakes potential for downstream delivery of contaminants via athabasca river floodwaters to lakes of the pad has raised local to international concern the study extending to 40 lakes showed that absence of marked metal enrichment in flooded delta lakes as well as the lack of difference in enrichment among lakes of different flood status provided evidence that oil sands industrial metal pollution is not detectable at the base of food webs in lakes of the downstream delta elmes et al 2022 describe impacts to hydrologic function of a channel fen following placement of an access road and below ground pipeline one of the important findings was that if possible pipelines should be oriented parallel to wetland flow direction and located along the central axis of the wetlands to minimize overall impacts lindenschmidt et al 2022 developed and applied a novel quasi two dimensional surface water quality modelling approach to simulate sediment and vanadium transport along the lower athabasca river where it traverses the oil sands region their conclusion regarding observed vanadium distributions was that it derives mainly from surficial aquifers and is present in muskeg dewatering water from the mine sites and possibly also enters the river via dust deposition and bank erosion based on their analysis contaminated sediment and or tailings water seepage do not seem as likely based on the available evidence wieder et al 2022 test the hypothesis that 15n in lichens from bogs can resolve the extent to which nitrogen deposition from oil sands may have affected the nitrogen cycle in area ecosystems their study concluded that at present a paucity of data on Œ¥15n signatures of oil sands related n sources precluded definitive interpretation of Œ¥15n in plant or lichen tissues with respect to oil sands n emissions birks et al 2022 describe an assessment of groundwater monitoring near oil sands development based on 546 water quality parameters measured in 5118 wells differentiated by hydrostratigraphic unit over the period 1958 2015 regionally baseline water quality conditions were found to vary significantly in the various subsurface units with wide ranges in total dissolved solids and geochemical facies reflecting variable lithology and geochemical processes data gaps and a number of spatial and temporal anomalies were identified described and recommendations for follow up 4 4 paleohydrology study zabel et al 2022 describe a paleolimnological assessment of mcclelland lake a shallow hardwater lake situated adjacent to an oil sands mine site under current development their study is particularly interesting as it establishes a record of water balance lake chemistry lake productivity and temperature dating prior to industrial development the study provides an approach to characterize natural range of variability of ecosystem conditions over extended time periods as compared to conventional monitoring 5 summary to date oil sands have reached an advanced stage of commercial scale development in canada although the large world reserves of oil sands bitumen which exceed current known conventional petroleum reserves by almost three times suggest that these deposits will form a significant component of the future energy profile of leading economies such as china russia and the americas while regional assessment of water cycle impacts is ongoing in the canadian oil sands region studies highlighted in the special issue provide new information novel tools and methods that may assist in strategic planning for future environmental investigations worldwide in particular the examples drawn from these case studies illustrate the importance of surface groundwater interaction and salinity management for successful reclamation of peat forming wetlands a wholistic approach considering that oil sands development is occurring under changing climate conditions is also shown to be required for improved hydrologic

7852,study region mixed and tall grass prairies in the southern great plains usa study focus estimates of evapotranspiration et are widely available from remote sensing and commonly used for water management however this approach is limited by prolonged satellite revisit periods and prominent algorithm induced bias we compared et estimates from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products and those based on the biophysically based soil and water assessment tool swat to measurements using the eddy covariance ec technique for a subhumid tall grass prairie site near stillwater oklahoma ok and a semiarid mixed grass prairie site near clinton ok in the southern great plains usa new hydrological insights for the region swat and modis produced et estimates closer to ec measurements for the tall grass prairie calibration site than for the mixed grass prairie validation site with a better performance from swat for the tall grass prairie the r2 values were relatively high and comparable 0 77 and 0 87 and the biases were relatively small 0 40 and 5 04 for the swat and modis comparisons to ec swat performed much better than modis for the mixed grass prairie with r2 values of 0 68 vs 0 13 and bias of 1 87 vs 45 71 respectively the swat simulation also reproduced better estimates of aboveground net primary productivity than the modis products this study suggests that site specific swat simulations can produce better et estimates than modis products especially in the water limited mixed grass prairie graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resources southern great plains vegetation productivity swat modis abbreviations swat soil and water assessment tool modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et the loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration is essentially a passive response of ecosystems to climate soil moisture and vegetation grass dominated ecosystems such as the prairies represent a major land cover type globally and provide essential ecosystem services such as clean water forage wildlife habitat and drought and flood mitigation diego et al 2016 lu et al 2011 norris et al 2001 van auken 2000 weltz et al 2011 most grass dominated ecosystems are in water limited environments where water availability is central to the ecosystem services provided it is imperative to improve et estimates to support effective water resource management and decision making for water security and ecosystem sustainability in these systems studies estimating et dynamics for grass dominated ecosystems have used different approaches e g kurc and small 2007 scott et al 2006a and 2006b yepez et al 2005 canopy chamber and lysimetric methods have been used for et measurement at the plot scale alfieri et al 2009 johnson et al 2003 todd et al 2000 kurc et al 2004 although relatively accurate these methods are unable to provide the needed data for water resources management and conservation practice implementation at larger ecosystem or landscape scales currently eddy covariance ec and remote sensing are two common techniques to estimate et at the ecosystem scale the ec method is the most direct approach for measuring vertical water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and atmospheric boundary layer at the small watershed scale hundred meters in radius however this method has been primarily used in research to understand land use change impact on carbon and water fluxes brunsell et al 2008 fischer et al 2012 wagle and kakani 2014 because it is still cost prohibitive for et estimates at broad scales applicable to water resource management remote sensing using geostationary and polar orbiting satellite imagery is the most efficient approach for assessing et over large spatial areas allen et al 2011 2007 anderson et al 2011 mu et al 2011 however this approach is limited by time elapse between satellite images making et data using remote sensing typically available only a few days per week or month for example the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor provides 8 day et products generated with the algorithms of mu et al 2011 in addition the coarse spatial resolutions 500 1000 m of satellite imagery impede et estimation and water resource management and research at the field or small watershed scale landsat imagery provides higher spatial resolution et data up to 30 m utilizing algorithms such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and internalized calibration metric and has the potential to improve et estimates for field scale applications but currently landsat et products are mostly available and applicable for growing seasons of the irrigated crops allen et al 2011 the mechanistic framework of using biophysical models for simulating and scaling et has proven effective for a range of scales from the field to the region bohn and vivoni 2016 used the variable infiltration capacity model which produced the most realistic et patterns for agricultural and forested mountain areas in the north american monsoon region in comparison to several remote sensing based products yang and zhang 2016 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat to improve the et and carbon assimilation simulations for north american forest ecosystems based on the ameriflux tower network alemayehu et al 2017 modified swat to simulate vegetation growth in tropical ecosystems where rainfall rather than temperature is the dominant plant growth controlling factor utilizing intensively monitored experimental watersheds qiao et al 2015 parameterized swat to simulate the distinct ecohydrological processes and vegetation impacts of native grasses and woody plants in the southern great plains sgp although comparing et estimates from remote sensing products has been carried out for different spatial temporal scales worldwide abiodun et al 2018 dile et al 2020 khan et al 2020 odusanya et al 2019 those using hydrological models for grassland dominated ecosystems are relatively scarce at finer scales for upland areas of the southern great plains sgp the sgp is a relatively water limited region food production and environmental sustainability face increasing pressures from water shortage due to increasing climate variability and extensive human activities e g extensive irrigation and ogallala aquifer depletion much of the sgp has been transformed into different land use and land cover types and today is composed of a high percentage of croplands e g wheat cotton and corn and some urban areas e g dallas tx and oklahoma city ok the physiographic setting includes higher and drier western high plains and lower and wetter central and eastern plains allred et al 2015 qiao et al 2017 a and b engle et al 2008 here we mechanistically simulated et for a tall grass prairie and a mixed grass prairie watershed using the biophysically based swat model by incorporating soil moisture energy balance and available biomass production then we used modis et products to obtain separate et estimates for the pixels representing the same tall grass prairie and the mixed grass prairie watersheds finally we compared the swat and modis estimates to the baseline ec data and discussed the potential sources of errors from swat and modis and how climate and site specific ecohydrological processes may have contributed to those errors our study is broadly applicable the tall grass and mixed grass prairie biomes are the largest grassland ecosystems in the southern great plains historically representing 246 560 km2 out of 961 105 km2 callan et al 2016 additionally our study is relevant to analogous grassland systems that occur worldwide 2 study sites data and methods 2 1 study sites and upland watershed description the tall grass prairie site was located at the cross timbers experimental range cter near stillwater oklahoma 36 0556 n 97 1912 w which is managed by the oklahoma agricultural experiment station fig 1 this study site was initially cultivated in the 1930 s and reverted back to grassland when cultivation ceased zou et al 2022 the vegetation is dominated by tall grass prairie species composed of approximately 85 graminoid and 15 forb schmidt et al 2021 woody vegetation started to encroach into the grassland in the 1970 s and formed scattered woodland patches in some areas woody encroachment has been mostly controlled in the experimental watershed fig 1 the main soil series in the watershed were the stephenville darnell complex 64 and the coyle loam 20 the slopes of the watershed range from 0 to 5 the average soil depth is less than 1 m underlain by sandstone substrates zou et al 2022 the mixed grass prairie was located at the neon national ecological observatory network klemme range research station us xae nearby clinton oklahoma 35 4106 n 99 0588 w fig 1 the most prominent grasses on the study site were buÔ¨Äalo grass bouteloua dactyloides and purple three awn arisda purpurea the woody species included broom snakeweed guerrezia sarothrae and small stature oaks as indicated by the terrestrial observation system tos 2018 the watershed at this site has 1 5 slopes and its predominant soil series is cordell silty clay loam eroded from the bedrock of shales soil survey geographic database ssurgo https data nal usda gov dataset soil survey geographic database ssurgo 2 2 meteorological variables and soil moisture data the meteorological variables were collected daily for the two sites from the oklahoma mesonet an environmental monitoring network with approximately 120 stations across oklahoma mcpherson et al 2007 the nearest mesonet stations were 1 9 km and 1 1 km from the cter and us xae sites respectively meteorological data used in the study included precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature wind speed at 2 m above the ground solar radiation and relative humidity for the period of 1998 2021 https www mesonet org index php weather category past data files according to the data the long term mean annual precipitation for the cter site was about 890 mm with average daily maximum and minimum temperatures of 22 3 c and 9 3 c respectively the long term mean annual precipitation for the us xae site was about 770 mm with average daily maximum and minimum temperatures of 23 1 c and 9 3 c respectively soil moisture measurements are very important for validating water balance simulations in swat soil moisture at the cter site was directly measured with ech2o soil moisture sensors decagon pullman wa usa three soil moisture stations were distributed at the upper middle and bottom locations across the study watershed each station had four ec 5 sensors throughout the soil profile at depths of 5 20 45 and 80 cm which were placed at the middle point of each of the four soil zones 0 10 10 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm to calculate the total soil water storage depth mm in the upper 1 meter soil profile zou et al 2014 soil moisture data for the us xae site were acquired from ameriflux http ameriflux lbl gov associated with ec measurements neon 2021 the data were measured at the upper and lower layers of the soil profile at the flux tower site for both sites soil water storage in the top 1 m was calculated 2 3 eddy covariance et measurements at the ecosystem scale et estimates from ec methods are considered the most accurate and as such were used as baseline et estimates in this study the ec system at cter was installed in 2015 to collect carbon and water fluxes in the tall grass prairie these data were processed through a series of quality assurance quality control measures and data gap filling methods published by sun et al 2019 the ec data for the us xae site neon 2021 were available for 2017 2021 from the ameriflux network http ameriflux lbl gov however we only selected the highest quality daily data from us xae site which had at least 18 hours of valid measurements resulting in 204 daily points we then grouped daily points into 8 day data starting from the first day of the year only groups with at least 4 valid daily points were used to calculate 8 day points the average of the daily points this resulted in 31 valid 8 day points during the period 2017 2021 2 4 remote sensing et and net primary productivity the updated remote sensing et product mod16a2 version 6 1 mod16 running et al 2017 was selected for our study mod16 provides an 8 day composite estimate of et with a spatial resolution of 500 m the mod16 data were produced using the penman monteith equation considering the daily meteorological data together with data for fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar leaf area index lai albedo and land cover based on modis sensors onboard nasa s terra aqua satellites mu et al 2011 biomass data were also updated from the latest mod17a2h version 6 1 mod17 gross primary productivity gpp product which is also a cumulative 8 day composite of values with a 500 m spatial resolution running et al 2015 this product is based on the radiation use efficiency concept that shares information from several common bands used to calculate et by mod16 zhao et al 2005 zhao and running 2010 we converted the gpp to total net primary productivity npp according to zhao et al 2005 2 5 biophysical swat model the swat model is a biophysical and hydrological model with capacities to simulate water carbon and nutrient dynamics from areas ranging from small watersheds to larger river basins for agricultural management land use and land cover change analysis and climate change impact assessment abbaspour et al 2015 arnold and allen 1999 arnold et al 2012 qiao et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2007 zou et al 2015 the swat model in this study for the cter site was initially configured and calibrated for runoff and soil water data for upland watersheds 2 5 ha in the subhumid area of the sgp qiao et al 2015 since our swat model simulation was designed to estimate field scale ecohydrological processes fine resolution soil data from ssurgo and light detection and ranging lidar 1 4 m elevation data were obtained to define the hydrological response units hrus river reaches and watershed boundaries the usgs national land cover database nlcd was used to determine land cover classes in the model configuration using raster datasets having a spatial resolution of 30 m this swat model was further tested for a broader region across the climate gradient zone of the sgp and had an acceptable performance for the semiarid and arid regions with even better performance than a similar model calibrated with streamflow measured at the river basin scales zou et al 2015 the swat model for the us xae site was configured for this study using the same types of nlcd land use and ssurgo soil datasets mentioned above however the basins and hrus were defined by usgs 30 m digital elevation model dem since we initially targeted a broad semiarid grassland in the sgp the site locations and watershed boundaries along with their climate and land cover were shown in fig 1 leveraging the swat model s existing capacities for assessing runoff and soil water dynamics we further improved the et biomass and carbon component simulations by adjusting the parameters of maximum canopy storage canmx lai and stomatal conductance gsi in addition to runoff and soil water controlling parameters we used the penman monteith equation to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet actual et was then partitioned into plant canopy evaporation plant transpiration and soil evaporation the other series of important parameters such as radiation use efficiency bio e optimal temperature t opt and base temperature t base for plant growth were calibrated for optimal grass growth and carbon assimilation these are also sensitive parameters for plant growth biomass production and water use in biofuel crops and trees trybula et al 2015 guo et al 2019 both swat models for cter and us xae sites were run for 1998 2016 with mesonet meteorological data the period 1998 2005 was used as a warming up period to sufficiently minimize the effects of initial state variables on model outputs the model outputs from 2016 to 2021 were used as the final dataset to compare with on site et measurement ec data at the cter site was only available for 2016 so the entire dataset was used for model calibration validation was carried out with the data available at the us xae site there were 5 years of ec data 2017 2021 for the us xae site but with a significant number of low quality data points that means we only selected the daily data point with measurements for more than 18 h each day as described in section 2 3 table 1 shows the parameter ranges and optimal parameter values identified with the spuci shuffled complex evolution with principal component analysis algorithm chu et al 2010 a global parameter optimization method for high dimensional and complex problems 2 6 evaluation metrics r2 squared pearson correlation coefficient and percent bias were used to identify the et prediction accuracies from swat and modis compared to flux tower measurements r2 can help us see the dynamic correlation if the two variables are closely scattered to the 1 1 ratio line while percent bias can tell how much overestimates underestimates are there 3 results 3 1 aridity index for the two sites for the period 2016 2021 annual precipitation was consistently higher at the subhumid cter site 740 1370 mm than at the semiarid us xae site 660 950 mm fig 2a the minimum precipitation occurred in 2021 for both sites and the maximum precipitation occurred in 2019 which was an exceptionally wet year 480 mm higher than long term annual average at the cter site potential evapotranspiration pet was consistently lower at the subhumid cter site 1170 1370 mm than at the semiarid us xae site 1500 1650 mm during the analysis period fig 2b as a result the aridity index ai the ratio of annual precipitation to annual pet was consistently higher at the cter 0 6 1 2 than at the us xae 0 3 0 6 the ai value of 0 45 separates subhumid above 0 45 and semiarid below 0 45 climate zones during the study period the cter site was always in the subhumid condition while us xae was in the semi arid condition for four of the six years 3 2 et estimates from three different sources all of the three different et sources ec flux tower et tower swat simulation et swat and modis remote sensing products et mod16 measured or simulated higher actual evapotranspiration et at the cter site than at the us xae site during 2016 2021 fig 3 et tower and et swat were originally available at half hour and daily scales respectively but the comparison was made at the 8 day temporal scale since the et mod16 was only available at that temporal resolution the maximum et each year was above 30 mm 8 day at the cter site while it was mostly below 30 mm 8 day at the us xae site from all three sources compared to the available et tower data there were relatively small biases 0 40 and 5 04 for the cter site from et swat and et mod16 respectively for 2016 however the et swat had much less bias than the et mod16 for the us xae site with 1 78 versus 45 71 during 2016 2021 the modis et product tended to overestimate et for the subhumid area and underestimate et for the semiarid area throughout the study period especially for the peak water use seasons regardless of the relative wetness or dryness of the year one way anova tests showed p 0 924 and 0 0004 for the cter and the us xae site respectively suggesting that the three et sources were not significantly different for the cter site but significantly different for the us xae site table 2 showed the specific p values following the anova test for each pair of the three et sources which showed no significant difference between et tower and et swat p 0 9954 at the same time there was a significant difference between et tower and et mod16 p 0 0015 the scatter plots and regression lines between et tower and the two sources of et swat and et mod16 also showed promising et simulations for the cter site with comparable r2 values 0 77 and 0 87 but a much better performance of et swat than et mod16 with r2 values of 0 68 and 0 13 for the us xae site fig 4 all regression lines in the figure are statistically significant p 0 05 using f statistic test 3 3 soil moisture comparison between swat and in situ observations the daily soil water storage anomalies during 2016 2021 for the cter and us xae sites were shown in fig 5 for both field observations and swat simulations anomalies were identified when the daily soil moisture deviated from the multiple year average exceptionally dry soils usually appeared during the summer season from june to august at both sites in addition the semiarid us xae region also experienced prolonged dry soil conditions in 2020 and 2021 which were not prominent in the subhumid prairies of the cter site the swat model captured the soil water dynamics better for the cter site with r2 of 0 50 for 2016 compared to the us xae site with r2 of 0 30 for the years 2019 2020 this could be partly ascribed to better soil moisture representation at the cter site than at the us xae site as more stations 3 vs 1 were measured at the former than at the latter site 3 4 npp estimates from swat and modis products npp estimates during peak growth periods were lower from the swat simulation than from the remote sensing estimation mod17 for the cter site while they were generally higher in swat simulation than the mod17 estimation for the us xae site fig 6 for both sites mod17 had much greater npp estimates than swat during the dormant period of late fall to early spring driving the total annual npp from mod17 to be substantially higher conversely swat exhibited a significant number of dormant days without any npp overall only weak correlations were observed between swat and mod17 npp estimates during the peak growth periods with r2 values of 0 46 for both the cter and us xae sites 4 discussion most et estimations for the sgp focus on remote sensing approaches using statistical models linking vegetation indices with plant growth and water use e g wagle and kakani 2014 modis products in this study provided slight et overestimation 5 for the subhumid site but with considerable underestimation over 40 for the semiarid site suggesting that the vegetation indices based approach has limitations in this region many studies have indicated that misclassification of land cover and land use greatly contributes to errors in mod16 algorithms ruhoff et al 2013 this could be the case for both the semiarid and subhumid grasslands in the sgp where grasses shrubs and trees frequently coexist within a small area i e less than the pixel size of 500 m which could cause misrepresentation of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar leaf area index leaf phenology and albedo for the grasslands fig 1 modis estimates of et and npp are based on these biophysical parameters making classification variability a primary source of error in this study swat better reflected the biophysical mechanisms driving et for the sgp grasslands outperforming the modis products in various aspects of water and productivity dynamics et flux measured with ec towers usually has 10 bias moorhead et al 2019 and the swat model s bias is within close to this range the swat model also performed well in simulating the soil water storage dynamics for the tall grass prairie subhumid region the soil water storage anomalies of field observations and swat simulations for the mixed grass prairie semiarid region were much greater than for the tall grass prairie fig 5 a possible reason is that only one soil moisture field observation was available and used for comparison for the mixed grass prairie while no empirical intra annual estimates of npp were available annual calculations of npp based on clip plots were much closer to swat based than mod17 based annual estimates for the subhumid grassland sites fig 7 compares the swat based npp estimates from the subhumid site from 2014 to 2016 with direct measurements of npp based on aboveground npp anpp using clip plots schmidt et al 2021 because the clip plot was only for aboveground production we converted these to total npp by assuming that anpp is 46 of the total xu et al 2012 after doing so the swat based estimates of npp were much closer to estimates from clip plots while the modis products overestimated npp by almost 100 there were robust linear correlations between the modis estimates of et and npp fig 8a with r2 mostly greater than 0 60 each year for both sites compared to the swat estimates npp peaks were slightly overestimated by the modis product of mod17 fig 6a which corresponded to a slightly higher et estimation of mod16 fig 3a for the subhumid site the peaks of npp were considerably underestimated when estimated by mod17 for the semiarid site fig 6b which corresponded to a much lower et estimation in the product fig 3b in swat simulations et and npp were weakly correlated with r2 mostly lower than 0 30 for each year from 2016 to 2021 fig 8b at the cter site the ratio of transpiration and et t et ranged from 0 84 to 0 92 during the 2016 growing season sun et al 2021 we did not have t et data for the us xae site but scott et al 2005 reported a ratio of 0 84 for the growing season in the semiarid grasslands of arizona and moran et al 2009 reported a ratio of 0 76 based on a different estimation approach using diurnal soil temperature measurements for a longer time period 2004 2006 the high t et ratios should result in a strong correlation between et and npp at least during the growing season for both sites it remains unknown why the correlation between et and npp from swat simulation was so weak fig 8b one explanation would be that the swat model parameterization did not represent the right proportion of evaporation and transpiration even though the total et quantity was correctly simulated models with a large number of parameters tend to experience non uniqueness problems that models can be fit equally well by a multitude of parameter vectors abbaspour et al 2007 leta et al 2015 here we targeted the total et quantity and did not explicitly consider transpiration and evaporation separately so that compensation could happen between them swat uses soil water compensation factor plant uptake compensation factor root density and depth and other biophysical parameters as mentioned in table 1 in addition to soil water dynamics and atmospheric conditions due to model structure and parameter uncertainty it is still challenging to properly partition et into transpiration and evaporation in swat and other ecohydrological models another explanation would be that transpiration may not dominate the total et for sgp grasslands some studies found that evaporation may account for a greater percentage of et in many semiarid subhumid settings huxman et al 2005 kurc et al 2004 the reasoning is that direct evaporation is only contributed by the top 20 cm of soil which accumulates most rainfall inputs in dry climates boulet et al 1997 yamanaka and yonetani 1999 more efforts are needed to clarify this issue in future studies soil moisture is the primary limiting factor driving ecohydrological processes in water limited systems the overall better performance of the swat model may be attributed to its inclusion of soil moisture information in the simulation while modis algorithms do not include soil moisture information more consistent and better representation of soil moisture conditions for the subhumid region may explain why et was better simulated for the subhumid region than for the semiarid region by the hydrological model and modis remote sensing products in this study the cter site is located in the ecosystem transition zone with very high annual climate variabilities however the rainfall regime in the semiarid region is characterized by even greater spatial and temporal variabilities the more sporadic and infrequent rainfall in the drier grasslands and the vertical distribution of soil moisture along the rooting zone is usually quite variable and the soil water storage term is subject to greater errors fig 5 which will increase the uncertainty and errors of estimates of et and npp from both hydrological models and remote sensing products the mechanistic framework of using biophysical models simulating et has been proven effective from the field to regional scales bohn and vivoni 2016 yang and zhang 2016 remote sensing et of modis requires relatively less input information to cover a rather large spatial scale due to its availability many hydrological models have used remote sensing et as their calibration inputs for model improvement amatya et al 2016 immerzeel and droogers 2008 parajuli et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 tobin and bennett 2017 zhang et al 2017 this study suggests that a more thorough evaluation of the remote sensing et product would be beneficial before its application since it could provide different accuracies for different climate and vegetation conditions 5 conclusions hydrological models and remote sensing are two common tools to estimate evapotranspiration at the ecosystem scale both swat simulation and modis products produced relatively accurate et estimates in the subhumid tall grass prairie of the southern great plains sgp in contrast the swat simulation performed better than the modis products for the semiarid mixed grass prairie where the modis products considerably underestimated et over 40 mechanistically simulated et utilizing the biophysical swat model shows higher potential to approximate the evapotranspiration and biomass growth processes than the modis remote sensing approaches in both subhumid and semiarid grasslands of the sgp however it is still not validated for partitioning evaporation and transpiration in the swat model due to parameter uncertainties caused by complicated water flows in the soil plant continuum in the swat though e is domonating suggested by the model for the grass praries this study provides a more accurate et estimation approach it adds new insights into the upscaling of spatially distributed et soil water plant

7852,study region mixed and tall grass prairies in the southern great plains usa study focus estimates of evapotranspiration et are widely available from remote sensing and commonly used for water management however this approach is limited by prolonged satellite revisit periods and prominent algorithm induced bias we compared et estimates from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products and those based on the biophysically based soil and water assessment tool swat to measurements using the eddy covariance ec technique for a subhumid tall grass prairie site near stillwater oklahoma ok and a semiarid mixed grass prairie site near clinton ok in the southern great plains usa new hydrological insights for the region swat and modis produced et estimates closer to ec measurements for the tall grass prairie calibration site than for the mixed grass prairie validation site with a better performance from swat for the tall grass prairie the r2 values were relatively high and comparable 0 77 and 0 87 and the biases were relatively small 0 40 and 5 04 for the swat and modis comparisons to ec swat performed much better than modis for the mixed grass prairie with r2 values of 0 68 vs 0 13 and bias of 1 87 vs 45 71 respectively the swat simulation also reproduced better estimates of aboveground net primary productivity than the modis products this study suggests that site specific swat simulations can produce better et estimates than modis products especially in the water limited mixed grass prairie graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resources southern great plains vegetation productivity swat modis abbreviations swat soil and water assessment tool modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et the loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration is essentially a passive response of ecosystems to climate soil moisture and vegetation grass dominated ecosystems such as the prairies represent a major land cover type globally and provide essential ecosystem services such as clean water forage wildlife habitat and drought and flood mitigation diego et al 2016 lu et al 2011 norris et al 2001 van auken 2000 weltz et al 2011 most grass dominated ecosystems are in water limited environments where water availability is central to the ecosystem services provided it is imperative to improve et estimates to support effective water resource management and decision making for water security and ecosystem sustainability in these systems studies estimating et dynamics for grass dominated ecosystems have used different approaches e g kurc and small 2007 scott et al 2006a and 2006b yepez et al 2005 canopy chamber and lysimetric methods have been used for et measurement at the plot scale alfieri et al 2009 johnson et al 2003 todd et al 2000 kurc et al 2004 although relatively accurate these methods are unable to provide the needed data for water resources management and conservation practice implementation at larger ecosystem or landscape scales currently eddy covariance ec and remote sensing are two common techniques to estimate et at the ecosystem scale the ec method is the most direct approach for measuring vertical water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and atmospheric boundary layer at the small watershed scale hundred meters in radius however this method has been primarily used in research to understand land use change impact on carbon and water fluxes brunsell et al 2008 fischer et al 2012 wagle and kakani 2014 because it is still cost prohibitive for et estimates at broad scales applicable to water resource management remote sensing using geostationary and polar orbiting satellite imagery is the most efficient approach for assessing et over large spatial areas allen et al 2011 2007 anderson et al 2011 mu et al 2011 however this approach is limited by time elapse between satellite images making et data using remote sensing typically available only a few days per week or month for example the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor provides 8 day et products generated with the algorithms of mu et al 2011 in addition the coarse spatial resolutions 500 1000 m of satellite imagery impede et estimation and water resource management and research at the field or small watershed scale landsat imagery provides higher spatial resolution et data up to 30 m utilizing algorithms such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and internalized calibration metric and has the potential to improve et estimates for field scale applications but currently landsat et products are mostly available and applicable for growing seasons of the irrigated crops allen et al 2011 the mechanistic framework of using biophysical models for simulating and scaling et has proven effective for a range of scales from the field to the region bohn and vivoni 2016 used the variable infiltration capacity model which produced the most realistic et patterns for agricultural and forested mountain areas in the north american monsoon region in comparison to several remote sensing based products yang and zhang 2016 applied the soil and water assessment tool swat to improve the et and carbon assimilation simulations for north american forest ecosystems based on the ameriflux tower network alemayehu et al 2017 modified swat to simulate vegetation growth in tropical ecosystems where rainfall rather than temperature is the dominant plant growth controlling factor utilizing intensively monitored experimental watersheds qiao et al 2015 parameterized swat to simulate the distinct ecohydrological processes and vegetation impacts of native grasses and woody plants in the southern great plains sgp although comparing et estimates from remote sensing products has been carried out for different spatial temporal scales worldwide abiodun et al 2018 dile et al 2020 khan et al 2020 odusanya et al 2019 those using hydrological models for grassland dominated ecosystems are relatively scarce at finer scales for upland areas of the southern great plains sgp the sgp is a relatively water limited region food production and environmental sustainability face increasing pressures from water shortage due to increasing climate variability and extensive human activities e g extensive irrigation and ogallala aquifer depletion much of the sgp has been transformed into different land use and land cover types and today is composed of a high percentage of croplands e g wheat cotton and corn and some urban areas e g dallas tx and oklahoma city ok the physiographic setting includes higher and drier western high plains and lower and wetter central and eastern plains allred et al 2015 qiao et al 2017 a and b engle et al 2008 here we mechanistically simulated et for a tall grass prairie and a mixed grass prairie watershed using the biophysically based swat model by incorporating soil moisture energy balance and available biomass production then we used modis et products to obtain separate et estimates for the pixels representing the same tall grass prairie and the mixed grass prairie watersheds finally we compared the swat and modis estimates to the baseline ec data and discussed the potential sources of errors from swat and modis and how climate and site specific ecohydrological processes may have contributed to those errors our study is broadly applicable the tall grass and mixed grass prairie biomes are the largest grassland ecosystems in the southern great plains historically representing 246 560 km2 out of 961 105 km2 callan et al 2016 additionally our study is relevant to analogous grassland systems that occur worldwide 2 study sites data and methods 2 1 study sites and upland watershed description the tall grass prairie site was located at the cross timbers experimental range cter near stillwater oklahoma 36 0556 n 97 1912 w which is managed by the oklahoma agricultural experiment station fig 1 this study site was initially cultivated in the 1930 s and reverted back to grassland when cultivation ceased zou et al 2022 the vegetation is dominated by tall grass prairie species composed of approximately 85 graminoid and 15 forb schmidt et al 2021 woody vegetation started to encroach into the grassland in the 1970 s and formed scattered woodland patches in some areas woody encroachment has been mostly controlled in the experimental watershed fig 1 the main soil series in the watershed were the stephenville darnell complex 64 and the coyle loam 20 the slopes of the watershed range from 0 to 5 the average soil depth is less than 1 m underlain by sandstone substrates zou et al 2022 the mixed grass prairie was located at the neon national ecological observatory network klemme range research station us xae nearby clinton oklahoma 35 4106 n 99 0588 w fig 1 the most prominent grasses on the study site were buÔ¨Äalo grass bouteloua dactyloides and purple three awn arisda purpurea the woody species included broom snakeweed guerrezia sarothrae and small stature oaks as indicated by the terrestrial observation system tos 2018 the watershed at this site has 1 5 slopes and its predominant soil series is cordell silty clay loam eroded from the bedrock of shales soil survey geographic database ssurgo https data nal usda gov dataset soil survey geographic database ssurgo 2 2 meteorological variables and soil moisture data the meteorological variables were collected daily for the two sites from the oklahoma mesonet an environmental monitoring network with approximately 120 stations across oklahoma mcpherson et al 2007 the nearest mesonet stations were 1 9 km and 1 1 km from the cter and us xae sites respectively meteorological data used in the study included precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature wind speed at 2 m above the ground solar radiation and relative humidity for the period of 1998 2021 https www mesonet org index php weather category past data files according to the data the long term mean annual precipitation for the cter site was about 890 mm with average daily maximum and minimum temperatures of 22 3 c and 9 3 c respectively the long term mean annual precipitation for the us xae site was about 770 mm with average daily maximum and minimum temperatures of 23 1 c and 9 3 c respectively soil moisture measurements are very important for validating water balance simulations in swat soil moisture at the cter site was directly measured with ech2o soil moisture sensors decagon pullman wa usa three soil moisture stations were distributed at the upper middle and bottom locations across the study watershed each station had four ec 5 sensors throughout the soil profile at depths of 5 20 45 and 80 cm which were placed at the middle point of each of the four soil zones 0 10 10 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm to calculate the total soil water storage depth mm in the upper 1 meter soil profile zou et al 2014 soil moisture data for the us xae site were acquired from ameriflux http ameriflux lbl gov associated with ec measurements neon 2021 the data were measured at the upper and lower layers of the soil profile at the flux tower site for both sites soil water storage in the top 1 m was calculated 2 3 eddy covariance et measurements at the ecosystem scale et estimates from ec methods are considered the most accurate and as such were used as baseline et estimates in this study the ec system at cter was installed in 2015 to collect carbon and water fluxes in the tall grass prairie these data were processed through a series of quality assurance quality control measures and data gap filling methods published by sun et al 2019 the ec data for the us xae site neon 2021 were available for 2017 2021 from the ameriflux network http ameriflux lbl gov however we only selected the highest quality daily data from us xae site which had at least 18 hours of valid measurements resulting in 204 daily points we then grouped daily points into 8 day data starting from the first day of the year only groups with at least 4 valid daily points were used to calculate 8 day points the average of the daily points this resulted in 31 valid 8 day points during the period 2017 2021 2 4 remote sensing et and net primary productivity the updated remote sensing et product mod16a2 version 6 1 mod16 running et al 2017 was selected for our study mod16 provides an 8 day composite estimate of et with a spatial resolution of 500 m the mod16 data were produced using the penman monteith equation considering the daily meteorological data together with data for fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar leaf area index lai albedo and land cover based on modis sensors onboard nasa s terra aqua satellites mu et al 2011 biomass data were also updated from the latest mod17a2h version 6 1 mod17 gross primary productivity gpp product which is also a cumulative 8 day composite of values with a 500 m spatial resolution running et al 2015 this product is based on the radiation use efficiency concept that shares information from several common bands used to calculate et by mod16 zhao et al 2005 zhao and running 2010 we converted the gpp to total net primary productivity npp according to zhao et al 2005 2 5 biophysical swat model the swat model is a biophysical and hydrological model with capacities to simulate water carbon and nutrient dynamics from areas ranging from small watersheds to larger river basins for agricultural management land use and land cover change analysis and climate change impact assessment abbaspour et al 2015 arnold and allen 1999 arnold et al 2012 qiao et al 2014 2015 zhang et al 2007 zou et al 2015 the swat model in this study for the cter site was initially configured and calibrated for runoff and soil water data for upland watersheds 2 5 ha in the subhumid area of the sgp qiao et al 2015 since our swat model simulation was designed to estimate field scale ecohydrological processes fine resolution soil data from ssurgo and light detection and ranging lidar 1 4 m elevation data were obtained to define the hydrological response units hrus river reaches and watershed boundaries the usgs national land cover database nlcd was used to determine land cover classes in the model configuration using raster datasets having a spatial resolution of 30 m this swat model was further tested for a broader region across the climate gradient zone of the sgp and had an acceptable performance for the semiarid and arid regions with even better performance than a similar model calibrated with streamflow measured at the river basin scales zou et al 2015 the swat model for the us xae site was configured for this study using the same types of nlcd land use and ssurgo soil datasets mentioned above however the basins and hrus were defined by usgs 30 m digital elevation model dem since we initially targeted a broad semiarid grassland in the sgp the site locations and watershed boundaries along with their climate and land cover were shown in fig 1 leveraging the swat model s existing capacities for assessing runoff and soil water dynamics we further improved the et biomass and carbon component simulations by adjusting the parameters of maximum canopy storage canmx lai and stomatal conductance gsi in addition to runoff and soil water controlling parameters we used the penman monteith equation to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet actual et was then partitioned into plant canopy evaporation plant transpiration and soil evaporation the other series of important parameters such as radiation use efficiency bio e optimal temperature t opt and base temperature t base for plant growth were calibrated for optimal grass growth and carbon assimilation these are also sensitive parameters for plant growth biomass production and water use in biofuel crops and trees trybula et al 2015 guo et al 2019 both swat models for cter and us xae sites were run for 1998 2016 with mesonet meteorological data the period 1998 2005 was used as a warming up period to sufficiently minimize the effects of initial state variables on model outputs the model outputs from 2016 to 2021 were used as the final dataset to compare with on site et measurement ec data at the cter site was only available for 2016 so the entire dataset was used for model calibration validation was carried out with the data available at the us xae site there were 5 years of ec data 2017 2021 for the us xae site but with a significant number of low quality data points that means we only selected the daily data point with measurements for more than 18 h each day as described in section 2 3 table 1 shows the parameter ranges and optimal parameter values identified with the spuci shuffled complex evolution with principal component analysis algorithm chu et al 2010 a global parameter optimization method for high dimensional and complex problems 2 6 evaluation metrics r2 squared pearson correlation coefficient and percent bias were used to identify the et prediction accuracies from swat and modis compared to flux tower measurements r2 can help us see the dynamic correlation if the two variables are closely scattered to the 1 1 ratio line while percent bias can tell how much overestimates underestimates are there 3 results 3 1 aridity index for the two sites for the period 2016 2021 annual precipitation was consistently higher at the subhumid cter site 740 1370 mm than at the semiarid us xae site 660 950 mm fig 2a the minimum precipitation occurred in 2021 for both sites and the maximum precipitation occurred in 2019 which was an exceptionally wet year 480 mm higher than long term annual average at the cter site potential evapotranspiration pet was consistently lower at the subhumid cter site 1170 1370 mm than at the semiarid us xae site 1500 1650 mm during the analysis period fig 2b as a result the aridity index ai the ratio of annual precipitation to annual pet was consistently higher at the cter 0 6 1 2 than at the us xae 0 3 0 6 the ai value of 0 45 separates subhumid above 0 45 and semiarid below 0 45 climate zones during the study period the cter site was always in the subhumid condition while us xae was in the semi arid condition for four of the six years 3 2 et estimates from three different sources all of the three different et sources ec flux tower et tower swat simulation et swat and modis remote sensing products et mod16 measured or simulated higher actual evapotranspiration et at the cter site than at the us xae site during 2016 2021 fig 3 et tower and et swat were originally available at half hour and daily scales respectively but the comparison was made at the 8 day temporal scale since the et mod16 was only available at that temporal resolution the maximum et each year was above 30 mm 8 day at the cter site while it was mostly below 30 mm 8 day at the us xae site from all three sources compared to the available et tower data there were relatively small biases 0 40 and 5 04 for the cter site from et swat and et mod16 respectively for 2016 however the et swat had much less bias than the et mod16 for the us xae site with 1 78 versus 45 71 during 2016 2021 the modis et product tended to overestimate et for the subhumid area and underestimate et for the semiarid area throughout the study period especially for the peak water use seasons regardless of the relative wetness or dryness of the year one way anova tests showed p 0 924 and 0 0004 for the cter and the us xae site respectively suggesting that the three et sources were not significantly different for the cter site but significantly different for the us xae site table 2 showed the specific p values following the anova test for each pair of the three et sources which showed no significant difference between et tower and et swat p 0 9954 at the same time there was a significant difference between et tower and et mod16 p 0 0015 the scatter plots and regression lines between et tower and the two sources of et swat and et mod16 also showed promising et simulations for the cter site with comparable r2 values 0 77 and 0 87 but a much better performance of et swat than et mod16 with r2 values of 0 68 and 0 13 for the us xae site fig 4 all regression lines in the figure are statistically significant p 0 05 using f statistic test 3 3 soil moisture comparison between swat and in situ observations the daily soil water storage anomalies during 2016 2021 for the cter and us xae sites were shown in fig 5 for both field observations and swat simulations anomalies were identified when the daily soil moisture deviated from the multiple year average exceptionally dry soils usually appeared during the summer season from june to august at both sites in addition the semiarid us xae region also experienced prolonged dry soil conditions in 2020 and 2021 which were not prominent in the subhumid prairies of the cter site the swat model captured the soil water dynamics better for the cter site with r2 of 0 50 for 2016 compared to the us xae site with r2 of 0 30 for the years 2019 2020 this could be partly ascribed to better soil moisture representation at the cter site than at the us xae site as more stations 3 vs 1 were measured at the former than at the latter site 3 4 npp estimates from swat and modis products npp estimates during peak growth periods were lower from the swat simulation than from the remote sensing estimation mod17 for the cter site while they were generally higher in swat simulation than the mod17 estimation for the us xae site fig 6 for both sites mod17 had much greater npp estimates than swat during the dormant period of late fall to early spring driving the total annual npp from mod17 to be substantially higher conversely swat exhibited a significant number of dormant days without any npp overall only weak correlations were observed between swat and mod17 npp estimates during the peak growth periods with r2 values of 0 46 for both the cter and us xae sites 4 discussion most et estimations for the sgp focus on remote sensing approaches using statistical models linking vegetation indices with plant growth and water use e g wagle and kakani 2014 modis products in this study provided slight et overestimation 5 for the subhumid site but with considerable underestimation over 40 for the semiarid site suggesting that the vegetation indices based approach has limitations in this region many studies have indicated that misclassification of land cover and land use greatly contributes to errors in mod16 algorithms ruhoff et al 2013 this could be the case for both the semiarid and subhumid grasslands in the sgp where grasses shrubs and trees frequently coexist within a small area i e less than the pixel size of 500 m which could cause misrepresentation of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar leaf area index leaf phenology and albedo for the grasslands fig 1 modis estimates of et and npp are based on these biophysical parameters making classification variability a primary source of error in this study swat better reflected the biophysical mechanisms driving et for the sgp grasslands outperforming the modis products in various aspects of water and productivity dynamics et flux measured with ec towers usually has 10 bias moorhead et al 2019 and the swat model s bias is within close to this range the swat model also performed well in simulating the soil water storage dynamics for the tall grass prairie subhumid region the soil water storage anomalies of field observations and swat simulations for the mixed grass prairie semiarid region were much greater than for the tall grass prairie fig 5 a possible reason is that only one soil moisture field observation was available and used for comparison for the mixed grass prairie while no empirical intra annual estimates of npp were available annual calculations of npp based on clip plots were much closer to swat based than mod17 based annual estimates for the subhumid grassland sites fig 7 compares the swat based npp estimates from the subhumid site from 2014 to 2016 with direct measurements of npp based on aboveground npp anpp using clip plots schmidt et al 2021 because the clip plot was only for aboveground production we converted these to total npp by assuming that anpp is 46 of the total xu et al 2012 after doing so the swat based estimates of npp were much closer to estimates from clip plots while the modis products overestimated npp by almost 100 there were robust linear correlations between the modis estimates of et and npp fig 8a with r2 mostly greater than 0 60 each year for both sites compared to the swat estimates npp peaks were slightly overestimated by the modis product of mod17 fig 6a which corresponded to a slightly higher et estimation of mod16 fig 3a for the subhumid site the peaks of npp were considerably underestimated when estimated by mod17 for the semiarid site fig 6b which corresponded to a much lower et estimation in the product fig 3b in swat simulations et and npp were weakly correlated with r2 mostly lower than 0 30 for each year from 2016 to 2021 fig 8b at the cter site the ratio of transpiration and et t et ranged from 0 84 to 0 92 during the 2016 growing season sun et al 2021 we did not have t et data for the us xae site but scott et al 2005 reported a ratio of 0 84 for the growing season in the semiarid grasslands of arizona and moran et al 2009 reported a ratio of 0 76 based on a different estimation approach using diurnal soil temperature measurements for a longer time period 2004 2006 the high t et ratios should result in a strong correlation between et and npp at least during the growing season for both sites it remains unknown why the correlation between et and npp from swat simulation was so weak fig 8b one explanation would be that the swat model parameterization did not represent the right proportion of evaporation and transpiration even though the total et quantity was correctly simulated models with a large number of parameters tend to experience non uniqueness problems that models can be fit equally well by a multitude of parameter vectors abbaspour et al 2007 leta et al 2015 here we targeted the total et quantity and did not explicitly consider transpiration and evaporation separately so that compensation could happen between them swat uses soil water compensation factor plant uptake compensation factor root density and depth and other biophysical parameters as mentioned in table 1 in addition to soil water dynamics and atmospheric conditions due to model structure and parameter uncertainty it is still challenging to properly partition et into transpiration and evaporation in swat and other ecohydrological models another explanation would be that transpiration may not dominate the total et for sgp grasslands some studies found that evaporation may account for a greater percentage of et in many semiarid subhumid settings huxman et al 2005 kurc et al 2004 the reasoning is that direct evaporation is only contributed by the top 20 cm of soil which accumulates most rainfall inputs in dry climates boulet et al 1997 yamanaka and yonetani 1999 more efforts are needed to clarify this issue in future studies soil moisture is the primary limiting factor driving ecohydrological processes in water limited systems the overall better performance of the swat model may be attributed to its inclusion of soil moisture information in the simulation while modis algorithms do not include soil moisture information more consistent and better representation of soil moisture conditions for the subhumid region may explain why et was better simulated for the subhumid region than for the semiarid region by the hydrological model and modis remote sensing products in this study the cter site is located in the ecosystem transition zone with very high annual climate variabilities however the rainfall regime in the semiarid region is characterized by even greater spatial and temporal variabilities the more sporadic and infrequent rainfall in the drier grasslands and the vertical distribution of soil moisture along the rooting zone is usually quite variable and the soil water storage term is subject to greater errors fig 5 which will increase the uncertainty and errors of estimates of et and npp from both hydrological models and remote sensing products the mechanistic framework of using biophysical models simulating et has been proven effective from the field to regional scales bohn and vivoni 2016 yang and zhang 2016 remote sensing et of modis requires relatively less input information to cover a rather large spatial scale due to its availability many hydrological models have used remote sensing et as their calibration inputs for model improvement amatya et al 2016 immerzeel and droogers 2008 parajuli et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 tobin and bennett 2017 zhang et al 2017 this study suggests that a more thorough evaluation of the remote sensing et product would be beneficial before its application since it could provide different accuracies for different climate and vegetation conditions 5 conclusions hydrological models and remote sensing are two common tools to estimate evapotranspiration at the ecosystem scale both swat simulation and modis products produced relatively accurate et estimates in the subhumid tall grass prairie of the southern great plains sgp in contrast the swat simulation performed better than the modis products for the semiarid mixed grass prairie where the modis products considerably underestimated et over 40 mechanistically simulated et utilizing the biophysical swat model shows higher potential to approximate the evapotranspiration and biomass growth processes than the modis remote sensing approaches in both subhumid and semiarid grasslands of the sgp however it is still not

7853,study region the yellow river basin yrb in china study focus global warming potentially accentuates risks of extreme precipitation and floods that afflict regional socioeconomy however spatiotemporally coupled relations between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb are not properly understood here we used the coupled coordination degree model ccdm to evaluate the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb china new hydrological insights for the region the regions with flood hazard along the mainstream of the yrb and decreasing flood hazard in the direction from southeast to northwest of the yrb high hazard and higher hazard areas accounted for 10 39 meanwhile overall flood exposure and vulnerability are decreasing from southeast to northwest yrb higher socioeconomic restorability highly alleviates the risk of flood disasters in central and northern shandong northern henan central shaanxi southern shanxi provinces and parts of inner mongolia relations between socioeconomic development and flood disaster risk are varying across the yrb the lower yrb is dominated by developed socioeconomy but higher flood disaster risk the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flood disasters the transitional zone in the middle yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk overall socioeconomic development has a weak relation with flood disaster risk in the upper yrb graphical abstract ga1 keywords

anthropogenic global warming potentially intensifies floods at regional and global scales zhang et al 2013 tabari 2020 it is predicted that global warming will increase the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events in china which will lead to a gradual increase of about 10 30 in the future flood risk in mainland china yin et al 2021 furthermore under the influence of climate change and human activities such as africa north america and the republic of south asia will face severe floods winsemius et al 2016 kirchmeier young et al 2020 meanwhile at the global scale the occurrence rate of floods flood induced mortality and flood affected population were generally increasing hu et al 2018 in the backdrop of global warming the flood disaster risk will be rising and flood disaster induced loss will be projected to increase by 160 240 under an additional temperature increase of 1 5 c guo 2017 dottori et al 2018 in the 20th century flood disasters caused about 7 million death tolls worldwide doocy et al 2013 disaster related mortality is up to 20 000 people per year and the people displaced by disasters can reach roughly 25 million accounting for approximately 1 5 of the global natural disaster induced losses kellens et al 2013 china is one of the countries heavily afÔ¨Çicted by severe Ô¨Çood disasters in the world and statistical analysis shows that flood damaged areas reached 9 35 104 km2 annually from 1951 to 2000 yang et al 2013 at the river basin scale flood disasters are intensifying specifically severe flood disasters have caused more than 1 500 breaches and at least 26 large diversion events over the yrb heavily constraining the economic development of the yrb wang 2013 in this sense it is theoretically and practically critical to develop linkages between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy flood disasters due to extreme weather and climate have been increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide exerting tremendous influences on human lives and health properties infrastructure and the environment mahmood et al 2017 what s more the development of a resilient city calls for an in depth understanding of interactions between flood risk and socioeconomy hammond et al 2015 therefore the evaluation of flood risk and relevant linkages with socioeconomy will greatly be valuable in seeking for flood disaster risk management scheme aerts et al 2018 however interactions between flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development at the regional and basin scales are poorly understood understanding interactions between flood hazard risk and socioeconomy is critical to flood hazard prevention in theory and practice previous studies evaluated flood risk using historical disaster data benito et al 2004 rodda 2005 black et al 2002 scenario simulation prudhomme et al 2010 feyen et al 2012 bisht et al 2016 li et al 2016 and indicator system hu et al 2017 stefanidis et al 2013 flood risk analysis using the index system has been widely used based on the comprehensive analysis of regional geographical factors with an analytic hierarchy process stefanidis et al 2013 saaty 2008 entropy weight method liu et al 2019 and neural network liu et al 2016 together with 3 s technology lyu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 developed a disaster risk assessment model based on information content to evaluate the risk of flood and drought disasters in the yangtze river basin besides liu et al 2016 proposed a spatial framework integrating bayes and geographic information system gis to evaluate Ô¨Çood hazard in the bowen basin in australia according to the recorded data lyu et al 2018 evaluated and verified the flood risk of the guangzhou metropolitan though these researches included socio economic variables in flood risk evaluation the relationship between flood disaster risk and regional socio economic response is poorly understood recent decades have witnessed booming socioeconomy and intensifying flood disasters and hence interactions between socioeconomy and flood disasters have aroused widespread concerns ward et al 2015 dottori et al 2018 hu et al 2018 ward et al 2017 proposed a framework for flood risk management investment and showed that effective economic investment can reduce future flood risk to below current levels winsemius et al 2016 proposed a global future river flood risk prediction model that combines climate change and socioeconomic development pointing out the response relationship between socioeconomic changes and flood disaster risk liu et al 2019 did an integrated risk assessment for agricultural drought and flood disasters based on the entropy information diffusion theory in the middle and lower yangtze river basin wu et al 2015 developed a model to evaluate food risk based on gis and disaster risk theory across the huai river basin although these studies incorporate socioeconomic variables into the study of flood disasters the specific interaction mechanism between flood disaster risk at the basin scale and regional socioeconomics is not clear here we attempted to address interactions between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy across the yrb providing a theoretical background for mitigation of flood disaster at the river basin scale the yrb 95 88 119 07 e 32 16 41 86 n fig 1 is known for its heavy sediment load and severe drought and flood disasters while flood disaster is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in the yrb upstream erosion and downstream embankment continuously raised the riverbed and gave rise to an 800 km long confined and super elevated channel belt rising around 10 m above the surrounding ground chen et al 2012 global warming potentially drives higher risk of extreme precipitation and floods tabari 2020 similarly the frequency of extreme precipitation in the middle and lower yrb has increased significantly visser et al 2014 and human socioeconomic development is closely related to flooding ward et al 2017 which will cause great hidden dangers to the safety of the basin against the background of this issue the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb is poorly understood clarifying the relationship between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy is a worthwhile studying scientific issue that can help enhance the mitigation of flood disasters and sustainable socioeconomy over the yrb most studies focused only on natural aspects of flood disasters and few reports address the interaction mechanism between flood disaster risks and socioeconomic development across the yrb this point constitutes the motivation and significance of this current study therefore we selected 18 indicators to assess the flood risk in the yrb in terms of hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability using the entropy value method we also assessed the socioeconomic development of the yrb in terms of economy population and construction then we used the ccdm to quantify the coupled relationship between flood disaster risk and social and economic development in the yrb this study can help to enhance the mitigation of flood disasters and sustainable socioeconomic development over the yrb and can also provide a typical reference study for other river basins of the world 2 data and methods 2 1 data to analyze the flood disaster risk of the yrb and its coupling relationship with the socioeconomy we have established the following data sets the flood disaster risk dataset and the socioeconomic dataset table 1 the gpm l3 precipitation data is a grid data at daily scale with spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 from january 2001 to december 2020 http disc gsfc nasa gov we used the precipitation data to calculate 20 year storm 25 mm days and 20 year average rainfall in the yrb the dem data are from nasa in 2020 with an accuracy of 30 m https earthdata nasa gov esds competitive programs measures nasadem the river network density was extracted from the national glacier permafrost and desert science data center http www ncdc ac cn portal metadata meanwhile we analyzed population density gdp per land number of industrial enterprises above designated size gross agricultural product administrative district area grain cultivation area total grain production urban road area per capita primary school students drain pipe length gdp per capita local general public budget revenue per capita disposable income of rural residents number of health care workers city wide gdp total retail sales of consumer good gross industrial output value above designated size the data in 2016 urban construction land area urban road area urbanization rate and resident population these datasets were sourced from the 2019 china urban statistical yearbook national bureau of urban social and economic investigation division 2019 and the 2017 china urban statistical yearbook national bureau of urban social and economic investigation division 2017 2 2 methods 2 2 1 evaluation models for flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development we put a restorability assessment module lummen et al 2014 guo et al 2014 into the hazard exposure vulnerability disaster risk system ipcc 2014 and evaluated flood disaster risk using the hazard exposure vulnerability restorability h e v r framework with consideration of flood disasters and socioeconomic factors pandey et al 2010 the hazard h of the disaster causing factor characterizes the susceptibility to flooding which is considered as the disaster causing factor and the disaster forming environment of flood disasters extreme precipitation has a direct relation with flood disasters guo et al 2014 therefore we decided 20 year rainstorm 25 mm days and the 20 year average annual rainfall as the disaster causing factors of flood disaster and the dem and river network density were adopted as the disaster forming environmental indicators of flood disasters guo et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 ji et al 2013 zou et al 2013 wu et al 2015 exposure e of the disaster affected bodies characterizes the social system and natural environment exposed to flood disasters floods may lead to the loss of human life industrial and agricultural economic losses and environmental damage guo et al 2014 zou et al 2013 hu et al 2018 evidenced that population density and gdp per unit area had a significant positive correlation with the number of flood related victims per unit area number of deaths and economic losses except in low income countries thus the population density gdp per land number of industrial enterprises above designated size gross agricultural product and administrative district area were selected as the indicators of exposure guo et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 ji et al 2013 zou et al 2013 vulnerability v refers to the potential degree of losses and or resilience of disaster affected bodies to flood disasters floods negatively impact agricultural production guo et al 2014 sun et al 2017 gan et al 2021 so the larger the grain cultivation area the larger the total grain production and hence the greater the vulnerability of agriculture to flood disasters the road network density and the education level can also reflect the potential losses caused by flood disasters given the occurrence of flood events guo et al 2014 zou et al 2013 here we chose the urban road area per capita ji et al 2013 and the primary school students to characterize the vulnerability of society to flood disasters besides urban drainage pipes wu et al 2015 can help mitigate flood hazards so we also selected the reverse indicator of drain pipe length to characterize the vulnerability of flood disasters restorability r can describe the recovery ability of the disaster affected bodies to its conditions before the occurrence of natural disasters here we chose the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue per capita disposable income of rural residents and the number of health care workers to characterize the recovery of disaster affected bodies guo et al 2014 the flood disaster risk evaluation model of the yrb selected 18 indicators from four dimensions i e hazard vulnerability exposure and recovery we used the entropy method to determine the weight of indicators table 2 the entropy method is a kind of objective empowerment method which has been widely used in flood risk assessment in recent years chen et al 2021 meng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in a multi index system the smaller the entropy weight of an index the larger the variance which indicates that the index has a high inÔ¨Çuence on the evaluation objective hence larger weight will be given according to the fuzzy evaluation matrix using eq 1 the entropy of factor i is expressed as eq 2 1 r r ij m n 2 h i 1 ln n j 1 n f i j ln f i j 3 f i j u i j j 1 n u i j in eq 1 m is the number of indicators and n is the number of data in the study area in eq 2 h i is the entropy of the i th indicator n is the number of data f i j denotes the frequency of factor i and u i j refers to the standardized index value of the j th evaluation object under the i th index in eq 3 however when f i j 0 ln f i j is not allowed mathematically therefore we suppose f i j ln f i j 0 when f i j 0 thus the objective weight of factor i is calculated using eq 4 in eq 4 w i is the weight of the indicator and 0 w i 1 4 w i 1 h i i 1 m h i the assessment of socioeconomic development in the yrb included eight indicators from three dimensions i e economy demography and construction table 3 the higher the level of socioeconomic development of the city the more social consumption industrial production and fiscal revenue will increase the regional gdp meanwhile the city will increase construction and thus the built up area and urban road area will increase attracting population and increasing urbanization we use the same data processing method to obtain the weight of each indicator 2 2 2 calculation of flood risk and socioeconomic development indices we first developed an evaluation index system for flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development then we conducted positive and negative treatments and standardization of each indicator using eq 5 and eq 6 and used the entropy method to calculate the weight of each indicator we evaluated the flood disaster hazard exposure vulnerability restorability and socioeconomic development indices using eq 7 then we calculated the flood disaster risk index using eq 8 fig 2 table 4 5 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 6 x ij max x j x ij max x j min x j 7 c i i 1 n x ij w ij 8 fi h w h v w v e w e r w r where c i refers to the flood hazard index exposure index vulnerability index restorability index and socioeconomic development index and the interval lies within 0 1 higher c i indicates higher values of hazard exposure vulnerability restorability and socioeconomic development x ij is the indicator after standardized post processing and positive and negative treatments of the indicator and w ij is the weight of the indicator fi is the flood disaster risk index h v e and r represent the index of hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability and w h w v w e and w r are the weights of each index 2 2 3 coupled coordination degree model ccdm a multitude of studies addressed relationships between ecology environment and social economy based on coupled coordination degree models gan et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 the degree of coupling coordination refers to the degree of coordination of interactive coupling between systems which is used to reveal the synchronization and orderliness between economic development and ecological environment systems and also reflects the state of dynamic balance development between systems based on the two systems of flood risk and socioeconomic development we used a coupled coordination degree model to evaluate the overall harmony of the interaction between economic development and flood disaster and further reveal the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb we first calculated the coupled degree c using eq 9 then we used eq 10 to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index t of the coupled coordination development level finally we calculated the coupled coordination degree d using eq 11 9 c ds d s 2 2 10 t Œ± d Œ≤ s 11 d c t where d is the flood risk index and s is the socioeconomic development index Œ± andŒ≤ are the coefficients indicating the importance of the two systems and Œ± Œ≤ 1 since the principle of consistent development between systems we assumed equal importance of these two systems so Œ± Œ≤ 1 2 we analyzed interactions between flood risk and socioeconomic development and the degree to which they influenced each other we divide the coupled coordination into five levels table 5 the smaller the value represents the poorer the level of coupled coordination and vice versa 3 results 3 1 flood disaster risk evaluation 3 1 1 flood hazard assessment flood hazard indicators considered in this study included 20 year rainstorm 25 mm days fig 3 a 20 year average rainfall fig 3 b dem fig 3 c and river network density fig 3 d 20 year storm days and 20 year average rainfall showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest yrb the elevation of the yrb is high in the west and the downstream area in the east yrb is particularly flat in terrain this terrain conditions render these regions vulnerable to flooding and hence higher flood disaster risk the dense river network can be found along the main stem of the yrb we calculated the hazard index using the raster calculation tool in gis river network density 20 year rainstorm days and 20 year average rainfall contributed more to the weight of the hazard index accounting for 46 28 and 19 of the hazard weight respectively there was a strong spatial correlation between river network density and hazard index distribution the flood hazard index was classified into 5 levels using the natural intermittency method low 0 0 06 slightly low 0 07 0 09 medium 0 10 0 13 slightly high 0 14 0 20 and high 0 21 0 50 from fig 3 e the distribution of flood hazard in the yrb follows the following spatial pattern i e i dense distribution of the flood hazard along the main stream of the yrb ii an overall decreasing trend of flood hazard from the southeast to the northwest yrb regions with high and higher flood disaster hazard covered 10 39 of the yrb and were observed mainly in the lower yrb specifically in the north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province and southern shanxi province the flat terrain abundant rainfall and dense river networks in these areas constitute factors for high flood disaster risks triggering potential outburst in the lower yrb and hence the above ground riverbed and larger possibility of mega floods in the lower yrb in the ningxia inner mongolia section of the middle yrb the dense river network and distinct topographies are the main causes behind frequent flooding inundation causing soil loss serious soil erosion and scouring as well as high sediment load of the loess plateau these factors are the reasons behind the above ground riverbeds in the middle and lower yrb in addition sichuan qinghai and gansu provinces are affected by rainstorms at the junction of the three places and the hazard of flood disasters is high 3 1 2 exposure evaluation indicators for the exposure of flood disaster included population density fig 4 a per land gdp fig 4 b number of industrial enterprises above designated size fig 4 c gross agricultural product fig 4 d and administrative district area fig 4 e with the exception of the administrative district area all other indicators showed an overall decreasing trend from southeast to northwest yrb the administrative area showed a decreasing trend from the middle to the upper and lower sides of the yrb the exposure index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis the number of industrial enterprises above designated size and the gdp per land made higher contributions to the weight of the exposure index accounting for 29 and 23 of the total weight of exposure indicators respectively population density gross agricultural product and administrative area exposure shared similar weights of 17 16 and 15 respectively the distribution of the number of larger than medium industrial enterprises is in line with that of the exposure index the flood exposure index was classified into five grades using the natural interval method low 0 04 0 08 slightly low 0 09 0 13 medium 0 14 0 21 slightly high 0 22 0 34 and high 0 35 0 62 fig 4 f shows the areas with high and higher exposure to flood disaster account for 13 77 of the yrb specifically these regions were mainly in the north central shandong province central shaanxi province and northern henan province the dense population density industrial development and agricultural development in these areas are more developed than those in the west yrb which will directly increase the direct losses caused by flooding due to the large administrative district area the regions with high exposure to flood disasters are mainly distributed in the inner mongolia section of the middle yellow river 3 1 3 vulnerability evaluation vulnerability indicators considered in this study involved the grain cultivation area fig 5 a total grain production fig 5 b urban road area per capita fig 5 c primary school students fig 5 d and drainage pipe length fig 5 e except for the urban road area per capita all other indicators showed an overall decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest yrb and the urban road area per capita showed the opposite trend the vulnerability index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis fig 5 f urban road area per capita primary school students total grain production and grain cultivation area contributed more to the vulnerability of flood disasters accounting for 31 25 22 and 19 of the vulnerability weight respectively while the drainage pipe length accounted for only 3 of the vulnerability weight the flood vulnerability index was classified into 5 levels low 0 06 0 11 slightly low 0 12 0 14 medium 0 15 0 20 slightly high 0 21 0 27 and high 0 28 0 26 using the natural interval method fig 5 f shows that the area with high and higher vulnerability accounted for 39 14 of the yrb area and was mainly distributed in north central shandong province northern henan province and central and northern shaanxi province where agricultural production coupled with the high number of elementary school students and other vulnerable components caused a high degree of vulnerability in these regions which would greatly aggravate the direct losses caused by flood disasters the ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi section of the middle yrb had a large degree of vulnerability due to the large urban construction such as urban road area per capita and the large grain production and cultivation area 3 1 4 restorability assessment the restorability indicators considered in this study included gdp per capita fig 6 a local general public budget revenue fig 6 b per capita disposable income of rural residents fig 6 c and the number of health care workers fig 6 d the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents are mainly concentrated in the lower yrb and the inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi section of the middle yrb and the number of health care workers is densely distributed in the lower yrb the restorability index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis fig 6 f the local general public budget revenue and the number of health care workers contributed more to the weight of the restorability index accounting for 41 and 29 of the weight respectively the restorability index was classified into five levels low 0 03 0 09 slightly low 0 10 0 20 medium 0 21 0 29 slightly high 0 29 0 37 and high 0 38 0 91 using the natural interval method fig 5 e indicates that areas with high and higher restorability accounted for 32 06 of the entire yrb and these regions were distributed mainly within the inner mongolia shaanxi section in the middle yrb the higher gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents in this region would enhance the regional restorability level and would also greatly reduce the region s flood disaster risk besides in the lower yrb and specifically the north central shandong province northern henan province and central shanxi province the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents also played a considerable role in the enhancement of restorability 3 1 5 flood disaster risk assessment flood hazard exposure vulnerability and flood risk were positively correlated and restorability was negatively related to flood disaster risk the flood hazard index exposure index vulnerability index and restorability index were integrated and weighted to obtain the integrated flood risk index for the yrb the exposure index had the largest weight contribution of 39 10 to flood risk and the lowest weight contribution of 13 38 to the flood hazard index the flood risk index was classified into 5 levels low 0 02 0 05 slightly low 0 06 0 09 medium 0 10 0 14 slightly high 0 15 0 18 and high 0 19 0 27 based on the natural interval method fig 7 illustrates that the regions with high and higher flood risk were mainly located in the lower yrb liu et al 2018 specifically the north central shandong province northern henan province and central shaanxi province and the area accounted for 4 46 of the yrb the high hazard exposure and vulnerability of flood disasters caused high flood risks while higher restorability reduced the flood risk in the north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province southern shanxi province and the middle yrb in the inner mongolia section 3 2 socioeconomic development assessment the assessment of socioeconomic development of the yrb covered eight indicators divided into three categories economy demography and construction economic indicators included city wide gdp fig 8 a local general public budget revenue fig 8 b total retail sales of consumer goods fig 8 c and gross industrial output value above designated size fig 8 d construction indicators included urban construction land area fig 8 e and urban road area fig 8 f population indicators included urbanization rate fig 8 g and resident population fig 8 h the spatial distribution of the regions with high values of each index mostly followed a bipolar distribution pattern i e one polar region was located in the lower yrb and another polar region was located in the inner mongolia shaanxi section of the middle yrb the socioeconomic development index was calculated using the weighted composite tool in gis the economic indicators had the largest weight contribution of 59 99 to the socioeconomic development index while the lowest weight contribution of population indicators was only 12 88 the spatial distribution of each indicator had an extremely strong spatial consistency with that of the socioeconomic development index the socioeconomic development index was classified into 5 levels based on the natural interval method low 0 02 0 07 slightly low 0 08 0 13 medium 0 14 0 20 slightly high 0 21 0 46 and high 0 47 0 79 fig 8 i demonstrates that the overall distribution of the socioeconomic development index in the yrb followed a bipolar distribution pattern some cities in central and northern shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province and inner mongolia are dominated by high levels of social and economic development which are closely related to the dense population high infrastructure and economic development 3 3 interaction between flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development based on the flood risk and socioeconomic development index we used the coupled coordination degree model to calculate the coupled coordination degree of these two systems according to table 5 we subdivided the coupled coordination degree into 5 levels fig 9 we find that the coupled coordination degree of the flood disaster risk index and the socioeconomic development index in the yrb shows gradually decreases from downstream to upstream along the mainstream generally speaking the lower yrb mainly shandong and henan with high coupled coordination degree and the middle yrb mainly henan shaanxi and shanxi is transitional areas the upper yrb mainly inner mongolia ningxia gansu sichuan and qinghai with low coupled coordination values fig 9 the coupled coordination values are high in the lower yrb with most of the areas mainly in the high coordination and moderate coordination the high values occur because of their high economic development index and disaster risk index taking the provincial capitals in the lower yrb as examples jinan the capital of shandong province has a socioeconomic index of 5 31 times the basin average and a flood risk index of 4 07 times the basin average the socioeconomic index of zhengzhou the capital of henan province is 5 76 times the basin average and the flood risk index is 2 12 times the basin average the socioeconomic index of xi an the capital of shaanxi province is 5 72 times the basin average and the flood risk index is 3 48 times the basin average this indicates that rapid economic development has not attached substantial importance to flooding prevention and control the economically developed downstream areas of the yrb whose economic development index far exceeds that of other prefecture level cities and the high exposure and vulnerability of disaster bearing bodies will greatly exacerbate the risk of flooding in the lower yrb therefore the lower yrb should increase the prevention and control of floods and the protection of the ecological environment otherwise economic development will be slowed down the middle yrb is the transitional area of coupled coordination degree values and then it shows a decreasing trend from xi an shaanxi to the north in the transitional area the economic development index and disaster risk index are also higher which indicates that flood prevention and control and economic development in these cities can barely be coordinated therefore coordinated development is still their top priority and socioeconomic development should be taken into account while flood prevention and control how to deal with the contradiction between economy and flood risk is a thorny issue facing these regions the upper yrb is the area of the low coupling coordination value since both the flood risk index and the socio economic development index are small resulting in a low degree of coupling coordination due to the low level of economic development the current economic impact on flooding is small and does not yet pose a threat therefore the upper yrb is encouraged to accelerate socioeconomic development without damaging the environment in conclusion the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flooding and requires special attention the transitional zone in the middle yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomics is weak in the upper yrb 4 discussions 4 1 flood disaster risk distribution in the yrb and its relationship with the socioeconomy at present there are few studies on the risk assessment of flood disasters in the yrb and its relationship with socioeconomy this paper systematically clarifies the relationship between flood disasters and socioeconomy within the yrb which can enhance risk management and control of flood disasters song et al 2022 identified the lower and middle yrb as high risk areas for future floods which is in good line with the findings of this current study in addition the recent flood disasters in the lower yrb also corroborated the findings of this paper such as the rainstorm and flood disasters that occurred in zhengzhou and surrounding areas on july 20 2021 jin et al 2022 the socioeconomy in zhengzhou is relatively developed which has certain support for disaster prevention and mitigation but the high exposure and vulnerability of disaster bearing bodies increases the risk of flood disasters 4 2 uncertainty evaluation the flood disaster risk system involves many factors and is a complex system the selection of evaluation indicators and their weights are the keys to whether the evaluation results are correct or not the lack of data in the yrb makes the selection of indicators not comprehensive enough when conducting flood disaster risk analysis second the dataset in this study only covers the period 2001 2020 and most severe flooding events before this time cannot be considered all of the above factors will increase the uncertainty of disaster assessment results at the same time the availability of high precision data has a great impact on the results of flood assessment the study area in this paper is large with various data types and different resolutions when assessing flood disaster risk the data are unified to a resolution of 1 km 1 km there will be certain statistical errors in the process of projection transformation etc which may lead to small deviations in the evaluation results due to the large error of the daily precipitation data of meteorological stations the spatial resolution of the gpml3 precipitation data used in this paper is low and the use of daily precipitation data with higher precision can make the evaluation results more accurate the socioeconomic data in this paper are comprehensive and accurate with high representativeness in this paper the entropy weight method is used to obtain the results which avoids the subjectivity of the indicators and makes the research results more real and reliable although this paper is limited by the lack of data in the western part of the yrb it provides an effective and feasible method for clarifying the relationship between flood disasters and socioeconomy in the yrb and provides necessary information and scientific and technological support for the high quality development of the yrb 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed flood risks in the yrb in four dimensions hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability and evaluated the urban socioeconomic development across the yrb from in dimensions economic population and construction based on the flood risk index and the socioeconomic development index the coupled coordination degree model revealed the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb based on the aforementioned analyses we obtained the following findings 1 the main stem of the yrb is dominated by high flood risks with an overall decreasing trend from southeast to northwest yrb areas with high and higher flood risks account for 10 39 of the yrb meanwhile overall flood exposure and vulnerability are decreasing from southeast to northwest yrb 2 higher values of hazard exposure and vulnerability of flood disasters are detected mainly in the lower yrb the higher restorability mitigates flood risk in north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province southern shanxi province and the inner mongolia section of the middle yrb and causes medium flood risks in these regions 3 the spatial pattern of the coupled coordination relationship between flood risk and socio economic development over the yrb is quite different the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flooding and requires special attention the transitional zone in the middle reaches of the yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomics is weak in the upper reaches of the yrb credit authorship contribution statement lei hua conceptualization methodology software investigation

7853,study region the yellow river basin yrb in china study focus global warming potentially accentuates risks of extreme precipitation and floods that afflict regional socioeconomy however spatiotemporally coupled relations between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb are not properly understood here we used the coupled coordination degree model ccdm to evaluate the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb china new hydrological insights for the region the regions with flood hazard along the mainstream of the yrb and decreasing flood hazard in the direction from southeast to northwest of the yrb high hazard and higher hazard areas accounted for 10 39 meanwhile overall flood exposure and vulnerability are decreasing from southeast to northwest yrb higher socioeconomic restorability highly alleviates the risk of flood disasters in central and northern shandong northern henan central shaanxi southern shanxi provinces and parts of inner mongolia relations between socioeconomic development and flood disaster risk are varying across the yrb the lower yrb is dominated by developed socioeconomy but higher flood disaster risk the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flood disasters the transitional zone in the middle yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk overall socioeconomic development has a weak relation with flood disaster risk in the upper yrb graphical abstract ga1 keywords

anthropogenic global warming potentially intensifies floods at regional and global scales zhang et al 2013 tabari 2020 it is predicted that global warming will increase the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events in china which will lead to a gradual increase of about 10 30 in the future flood risk in mainland china yin et al 2021 furthermore under the influence of climate change and human activities such as africa north america and the republic of south asia will face severe floods winsemius et al 2016 kirchmeier young et al 2020 meanwhile at the global scale the occurrence rate of floods flood induced mortality and flood affected population were generally increasing hu et al 2018 in the backdrop of global warming the flood disaster risk will be rising and flood disaster induced loss will be projected to increase by 160 240 under an additional temperature increase of 1 5 c guo 2017 dottori et al 2018 in the 20th century flood disasters caused about 7 million death tolls worldwide doocy et al 2013 disaster related mortality is up to 20 000 people per year and the people displaced by disasters can reach roughly 25 million accounting for approximately 1 5 of the global natural disaster induced losses kellens et al 2013 china is one of the countries heavily afÔ¨Çicted by severe Ô¨Çood disasters in the world and statistical analysis shows that flood damaged areas reached 9 35 104 km2 annually from 1951 to 2000 yang et al 2013 at the river basin scale flood disasters are intensifying specifically severe flood disasters have caused more than 1 500 breaches and at least 26 large diversion events over the yrb heavily constraining the economic development of the yrb wang 2013 in this sense it is theoretically and practically critical to develop linkages between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy flood disasters due to extreme weather and climate have been increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide exerting tremendous influences on human lives and health properties infrastructure and the environment mahmood et al 2017 what s more the development of a resilient city calls for an in depth understanding of interactions between flood risk and socioeconomy hammond et al 2015 therefore the evaluation of flood risk and relevant linkages with socioeconomy will greatly be valuable in seeking for flood disaster risk management scheme aerts et al 2018 however interactions between flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development at the regional and basin scales are poorly understood understanding interactions between flood hazard risk and socioeconomy is critical to flood hazard prevention in theory and practice previous studies evaluated flood risk using historical disaster data benito et al 2004 rodda 2005 black et al 2002 scenario simulation prudhomme et al 2010 feyen et al 2012 bisht et al 2016 li et al 2016 and indicator system hu et al 2017 stefanidis et al 2013 flood risk analysis using the index system has been widely used based on the comprehensive analysis of regional geographical factors with an analytic hierarchy process stefanidis et al 2013 saaty 2008 entropy weight method liu et al 2019 and neural network liu et al 2016 together with 3 s technology lyu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 developed a disaster risk assessment model based on information content to evaluate the risk of flood and drought disasters in the yangtze river basin besides liu et al 2016 proposed a spatial framework integrating bayes and geographic information system gis to evaluate Ô¨Çood hazard in the bowen basin in australia according to the recorded data lyu et al 2018 evaluated and verified the flood risk of the guangzhou metropolitan though these researches included socio economic variables in flood risk evaluation the relationship between flood disaster risk and regional socio economic response is poorly understood recent decades have witnessed booming socioeconomy and intensifying flood disasters and hence interactions between socioeconomy and flood disasters have aroused widespread concerns ward et al 2015 dottori et al 2018 hu et al 2018 ward et al 2017 proposed a framework for flood risk management investment and showed that effective economic investment can reduce future flood risk to below current levels winsemius et al 2016 proposed a global future river flood risk prediction model that combines climate change and socioeconomic development pointing out the response relationship between socioeconomic changes and flood disaster risk liu et al 2019 did an integrated risk assessment for agricultural drought and flood disasters based on the entropy information diffusion theory in the middle and lower yangtze river basin wu et al 2015 developed a model to evaluate food risk based on gis and disaster risk theory across the huai river basin although these studies incorporate socioeconomic variables into the study of flood disasters the specific interaction mechanism between flood disaster risk at the basin scale and regional socioeconomics is not clear here we attempted to address interactions between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy across the yrb providing a theoretical background for mitigation of flood disaster at the river basin scale the yrb 95 88 119 07 e 32 16 41 86 n fig 1 is known for its heavy sediment load and severe drought and flood disasters while flood disaster is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in the yrb upstream erosion and downstream embankment continuously raised the riverbed and gave rise to an 800 km long confined and super elevated channel belt rising around 10 m above the surrounding ground chen et al 2012 global warming potentially drives higher risk of extreme precipitation and floods tabari 2020 similarly the frequency of extreme precipitation in the middle and lower yrb has increased significantly visser et al 2014 and human socioeconomic development is closely related to flooding ward et al 2017 which will cause great hidden dangers to the safety of the basin against the background of this issue the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb is poorly understood clarifying the relationship between flood disaster risk and socioeconomy is a worthwhile studying scientific issue that can help enhance the mitigation of flood disasters and sustainable socioeconomy over the yrb most studies focused only on natural aspects of flood disasters and few reports address the interaction mechanism between flood disaster risks and socioeconomic development across the yrb this point constitutes the motivation and significance of this current study therefore we selected 18 indicators to assess the flood risk in the yrb in terms of hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability using the entropy value method we also assessed the socioeconomic development of the yrb in terms of economy population and construction then we used the ccdm to quantify the coupled relationship between flood disaster risk and social and economic development in the yrb this study can help to enhance the mitigation of flood disasters and sustainable socioeconomic development over the yrb and can also provide a typical reference study for other river basins of the world 2 data and methods 2 1 data to analyze the flood disaster risk of the yrb and its coupling relationship with the socioeconomy we have established the following data sets the flood disaster risk dataset and the socioeconomic dataset table 1 the gpm l3 precipitation data is a grid data at daily scale with spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 from january 2001 to december 2020 http disc gsfc nasa gov we used the precipitation data to calculate 20 year storm 25 mm days and 20 year average rainfall in the yrb the dem data are from nasa in 2020 with an accuracy of 30 m https earthdata nasa gov esds competitive programs measures nasadem the river network density was extracted from the national glacier permafrost and desert science data center http www ncdc ac cn portal metadata meanwhile we analyzed population density gdp per land number of industrial enterprises above designated size gross agricultural product administrative district area grain cultivation area total grain production urban road area per capita primary school students drain pipe length gdp per capita local general public budget revenue per capita disposable income of rural residents number of health care workers city wide gdp total retail sales of consumer good gross industrial output value above designated size the data in 2016 urban construction land area urban road area urbanization rate and resident population these datasets were sourced from the 2019 china urban statistical yearbook national bureau of urban social and economic investigation division 2019 and the 2017 china urban statistical yearbook national bureau of urban social and economic investigation division 2017 2 2 methods 2 2 1 evaluation models for flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development we put a restorability assessment module lummen et al 2014 guo et al 2014 into the hazard exposure vulnerability disaster risk system ipcc 2014 and evaluated flood disaster risk using the hazard exposure vulnerability restorability h e v r framework with consideration of flood disasters and socioeconomic factors pandey et al 2010 the hazard h of the disaster causing factor characterizes the susceptibility to flooding which is considered as the disaster causing factor and the disaster forming environment of flood disasters extreme precipitation has a direct relation with flood disasters guo et al 2014 therefore we decided 20 year rainstorm 25 mm days and the 20 year average annual rainfall as the disaster causing factors of flood disaster and the dem and river network density were adopted as the disaster forming environmental indicators of flood disasters guo et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 ji et al 2013 zou et al 2013 wu et al 2015 exposure e of the disaster affected bodies characterizes the social system and natural environment exposed to flood disasters floods may lead to the loss of human life industrial and agricultural economic losses and environmental damage guo et al 2014 zou et al 2013 hu et al 2018 evidenced that population density and gdp per unit area had a significant positive correlation with the number of flood related victims per unit area number of deaths and economic losses except in low income countries thus the population density gdp per land number of industrial enterprises above designated size gross agricultural product and administrative district area were selected as the indicators of exposure guo et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 ji et al 2013 zou et al 2013 vulnerability v refers to the potential degree of losses and or resilience of disaster affected bodies to flood disasters floods negatively impact agricultural production guo et al 2014 sun et al 2017 gan et al 2021 so the larger the grain cultivation area the larger the total grain production and hence the greater the vulnerability of agriculture to flood disasters the road network density and the education level can also reflect the potential losses caused by flood disasters given the occurrence of flood events guo et al 2014 zou et al 2013 here we chose the urban road area per capita ji et al 2013 and the primary school students to characterize the vulnerability of society to flood disasters besides urban drainage pipes wu et al 2015 can help mitigate flood hazards so we also selected the reverse indicator of drain pipe length to characterize the vulnerability of flood disasters restorability r can describe the recovery ability of the disaster affected bodies to its conditions before the occurrence of natural disasters here we chose the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue per capita disposable income of rural residents and the number of health care workers to characterize the recovery of disaster affected bodies guo et al 2014 the flood disaster risk evaluation model of the yrb selected 18 indicators from four dimensions i e hazard vulnerability exposure and recovery we used the entropy method to determine the weight of indicators table 2 the entropy method is a kind of objective empowerment method which has been widely used in flood risk assessment in recent years chen et al 2021 meng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in a multi index system the smaller the entropy weight of an index the larger the variance which indicates that the index has a high inÔ¨Çuence on the evaluation objective hence larger weight will be given according to the fuzzy evaluation matrix using eq 1 the entropy of factor i is expressed as eq 2 1 r r ij m n 2 h i 1 ln n j 1 n f i j ln f i j 3 f i j u i j j 1 n u i j in eq 1 m is the number of indicators and n is the number of data in the study area in eq 2 h i is the entropy of the i th indicator n is the number of data f i j denotes the frequency of factor i and u i j refers to the standardized index value of the j th evaluation object under the i th index in eq 3 however when f i j 0 ln f i j is not allowed mathematically therefore we suppose f i j ln f i j 0 when f i j 0 thus the objective weight of factor i is calculated using eq 4 in eq 4 w i is the weight of the indicator and 0 w i 1 4 w i 1 h i i 1 m h i the assessment of socioeconomic development in the yrb included eight indicators from three dimensions i e economy demography and construction table 3 the higher the level of socioeconomic development of the city the more social consumption industrial production and fiscal revenue will increase the regional gdp meanwhile the city will increase construction and thus the built up area and urban road area will increase attracting population and increasing urbanization we use the same data processing method to obtain the weight of each indicator 2 2 2 calculation of flood risk and socioeconomic development indices we first developed an evaluation index system for flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development then we conducted positive and negative treatments and standardization of each indicator using eq 5 and eq 6 and used the entropy method to calculate the weight of each indicator we evaluated the flood disaster hazard exposure vulnerability restorability and socioeconomic development indices using eq 7 then we calculated the flood disaster risk index using eq 8 fig 2 table 4 5 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 6 x ij max x j x ij max x j min x j 7 c i i 1 n x ij w ij 8 fi h w h v w v e w e r w r where c i refers to the flood hazard index exposure index vulnerability index restorability index and socioeconomic development index and the interval lies within 0 1 higher c i indicates higher values of hazard exposure vulnerability restorability and socioeconomic development x ij is the indicator after standardized post processing and positive and negative treatments of the indicator and w ij is the weight of the indicator fi is the flood disaster risk index h v e and r represent the index of hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability and w h w v w e and w r are the weights of each index 2 2 3 coupled coordination degree model ccdm a multitude of studies addressed relationships between ecology environment and social economy based on coupled coordination degree models gan et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 the degree of coupling coordination refers to the degree of coordination of interactive coupling between systems which is used to reveal the synchronization and orderliness between economic development and ecological environment systems and also reflects the state of dynamic balance development between systems based on the two systems of flood risk and socioeconomic development we used a coupled coordination degree model to evaluate the overall harmony of the interaction between economic development and flood disaster and further reveal the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb we first calculated the coupled degree c using eq 9 then we used eq 10 to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index t of the coupled coordination development level finally we calculated the coupled coordination degree d using eq 11 9 c ds d s 2 2 10 t Œ± d Œ≤ s 11 d c t where d is the flood risk index and s is the socioeconomic development index Œ± andŒ≤ are the coefficients indicating the importance of the two systems and Œ± Œ≤ 1 since the principle of consistent development between systems we assumed equal importance of these two systems so Œ± Œ≤ 1 2 we analyzed interactions between flood risk and socioeconomic development and the degree to which they influenced each other we divide the coupled coordination into five levels table 5 the smaller the value represents the poorer the level of coupled coordination and vice versa 3 results 3 1 flood disaster risk evaluation 3 1 1 flood hazard assessment flood hazard indicators considered in this study included 20 year rainstorm 25 mm days fig 3 a 20 year average rainfall fig 3 b dem fig 3 c and river network density fig 3 d 20 year storm days and 20 year average rainfall showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest yrb the elevation of the yrb is high in the west and the downstream area in the east yrb is particularly flat in terrain this terrain conditions render these regions vulnerable to flooding and hence higher flood disaster risk the dense river network can be found along the main stem of the yrb we calculated the hazard index using the raster calculation tool in gis river network density 20 year rainstorm days and 20 year average rainfall contributed more to the weight of the hazard index accounting for 46 28 and 19 of the hazard weight respectively there was a strong spatial correlation between river network density and hazard index distribution the flood hazard index was classified into 5 levels using the natural intermittency method low 0 0 06 slightly low 0 07 0 09 medium 0 10 0 13 slightly high 0 14 0 20 and high 0 21 0 50 from fig 3 e the distribution of flood hazard in the yrb follows the following spatial pattern i e i dense distribution of the flood hazard along the main stream of the yrb ii an overall decreasing trend of flood hazard from the southeast to the northwest yrb regions with high and higher flood disaster hazard covered 10 39 of the yrb and were observed mainly in the lower yrb specifically in the north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province and southern shanxi province the flat terrain abundant rainfall and dense river networks in these areas constitute factors for high flood disaster risks triggering potential outburst in the lower yrb and hence the above ground riverbed and larger possibility of mega floods in the lower yrb in the ningxia inner mongolia section of the middle yrb the dense river network and distinct topographies are the main causes behind frequent flooding inundation causing soil loss serious soil erosion and scouring as well as high sediment load of the loess plateau these factors are the reasons behind the above ground riverbeds in the middle and lower yrb in addition sichuan qinghai and gansu provinces are affected by rainstorms at the junction of the three places and the hazard of flood disasters is high 3 1 2 exposure evaluation indicators for the exposure of flood disaster included population density fig 4 a per land gdp fig 4 b number of industrial enterprises above designated size fig 4 c gross agricultural product fig 4 d and administrative district area fig 4 e with the exception of the administrative district area all other indicators showed an overall decreasing trend from southeast to northwest yrb the administrative area showed a decreasing trend from the middle to the upper and lower sides of the yrb the exposure index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis the number of industrial enterprises above designated size and the gdp per land made higher contributions to the weight of the exposure index accounting for 29 and 23 of the total weight of exposure indicators respectively population density gross agricultural product and administrative area exposure shared similar weights of 17 16 and 15 respectively the distribution of the number of larger than medium industrial enterprises is in line with that of the exposure index the flood exposure index was classified into five grades using the natural interval method low 0 04 0 08 slightly low 0 09 0 13 medium 0 14 0 21 slightly high 0 22 0 34 and high 0 35 0 62 fig 4 f shows the areas with high and higher exposure to flood disaster account for 13 77 of the yrb specifically these regions were mainly in the north central shandong province central shaanxi province and northern henan province the dense population density industrial development and agricultural development in these areas are more developed than those in the west yrb which will directly increase the direct losses caused by flooding due to the large administrative district area the regions with high exposure to flood disasters are mainly distributed in the inner mongolia section of the middle yellow river 3 1 3 vulnerability evaluation vulnerability indicators considered in this study involved the grain cultivation area fig 5 a total grain production fig 5 b urban road area per capita fig 5 c primary school students fig 5 d and drainage pipe length fig 5 e except for the urban road area per capita all other indicators showed an overall decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest yrb and the urban road area per capita showed the opposite trend the vulnerability index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis fig 5 f urban road area per capita primary school students total grain production and grain cultivation area contributed more to the vulnerability of flood disasters accounting for 31 25 22 and 19 of the vulnerability weight respectively while the drainage pipe length accounted for only 3 of the vulnerability weight the flood vulnerability index was classified into 5 levels low 0 06 0 11 slightly low 0 12 0 14 medium 0 15 0 20 slightly high 0 21 0 27 and high 0 28 0 26 using the natural interval method fig 5 f shows that the area with high and higher vulnerability accounted for 39 14 of the yrb area and was mainly distributed in north central shandong province northern henan province and central and northern shaanxi province where agricultural production coupled with the high number of elementary school students and other vulnerable components caused a high degree of vulnerability in these regions which would greatly aggravate the direct losses caused by flood disasters the ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi section of the middle yrb had a large degree of vulnerability due to the large urban construction such as urban road area per capita and the large grain production and cultivation area 3 1 4 restorability assessment the restorability indicators considered in this study included gdp per capita fig 6 a local general public budget revenue fig 6 b per capita disposable income of rural residents fig 6 c and the number of health care workers fig 6 d the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents are mainly concentrated in the lower yrb and the inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi section of the middle yrb and the number of health care workers is densely distributed in the lower yrb the restorability index was calculated using the raster calculation tool in gis fig 6 f the local general public budget revenue and the number of health care workers contributed more to the weight of the restorability index accounting for 41 and 29 of the weight respectively the restorability index was classified into five levels low 0 03 0 09 slightly low 0 10 0 20 medium 0 21 0 29 slightly high 0 29 0 37 and high 0 38 0 91 using the natural interval method fig 5 e indicates that areas with high and higher restorability accounted for 32 06 of the entire yrb and these regions were distributed mainly within the inner mongolia shaanxi section in the middle yrb the higher gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents in this region would enhance the regional restorability level and would also greatly reduce the region s flood disaster risk besides in the lower yrb and specifically the north central shandong province northern henan province and central shanxi province the gdp per capita local general public budget revenue and per capita disposable income of rural residents also played a considerable role in the enhancement of restorability 3 1 5 flood disaster risk assessment flood hazard exposure vulnerability and flood risk were positively correlated and restorability was negatively related to flood disaster risk the flood hazard index exposure index vulnerability index and restorability index were integrated and weighted to obtain the integrated flood risk index for the yrb the exposure index had the largest weight contribution of 39 10 to flood risk and the lowest weight contribution of 13 38 to the flood hazard index the flood risk index was classified into 5 levels low 0 02 0 05 slightly low 0 06 0 09 medium 0 10 0 14 slightly high 0 15 0 18 and high 0 19 0 27 based on the natural interval method fig 7 illustrates that the regions with high and higher flood risk were mainly located in the lower yrb liu et al 2018 specifically the north central shandong province northern henan province and central shaanxi province and the area accounted for 4 46 of the yrb the high hazard exposure and vulnerability of flood disasters caused high flood risks while higher restorability reduced the flood risk in the north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province southern shanxi province and the middle yrb in the inner mongolia section 3 2 socioeconomic development assessment the assessment of socioeconomic development of the yrb covered eight indicators divided into three categories economy demography and construction economic indicators included city wide gdp fig 8 a local general public budget revenue fig 8 b total retail sales of consumer goods fig 8 c and gross industrial output value above designated size fig 8 d construction indicators included urban construction land area fig 8 e and urban road area fig 8 f population indicators included urbanization rate fig 8 g and resident population fig 8 h the spatial distribution of the regions with high values of each index mostly followed a bipolar distribution pattern i e one polar region was located in the lower yrb and another polar region was located in the inner mongolia shaanxi section of the middle yrb the socioeconomic development index was calculated using the weighted composite tool in gis the economic indicators had the largest weight contribution of 59 99 to the socioeconomic development index while the lowest weight contribution of population indicators was only 12 88 the spatial distribution of each indicator had an extremely strong spatial consistency with that of the socioeconomic development index the socioeconomic development index was classified into 5 levels based on the natural interval method low 0 02 0 07 slightly low 0 08 0 13 medium 0 14 0 20 slightly high 0 21 0 46 and high 0 47 0 79 fig 8 i demonstrates that the overall distribution of the socioeconomic development index in the yrb followed a bipolar distribution pattern some cities in central and northern shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province and inner mongolia are dominated by high levels of social and economic development which are closely related to the dense population high infrastructure and economic development 3 3 interaction between flood disaster risk and socioeconomic development based on the flood risk and socioeconomic development index we used the coupled coordination degree model to calculate the coupled coordination degree of these two systems according to table 5 we subdivided the coupled coordination degree into 5 levels fig 9 we find that the coupled coordination degree of the flood disaster risk index and the socioeconomic development index in the yrb shows gradually decreases from downstream to upstream along the mainstream generally speaking the lower yrb mainly shandong and henan with high coupled coordination degree and the middle yrb mainly henan shaanxi and shanxi is transitional areas the upper yrb mainly inner mongolia ningxia gansu sichuan and qinghai with low coupled coordination values fig 9 the coupled coordination values are high in the lower yrb with most of the areas mainly in the high coordination and moderate coordination the high values occur because of their high economic development index and disaster risk index taking the provincial capitals in the lower yrb as examples jinan the capital of shandong province has a socioeconomic index of 5 31 times the basin average and a flood risk index of 4 07 times the basin average the socioeconomic index of zhengzhou the capital of henan province is 5 76 times the basin average and the flood risk index is 2 12 times the basin average the socioeconomic index of xi an the capital of shaanxi province is 5 72 times the basin average and the flood risk index is 3 48 times the basin average this indicates that rapid economic development has not attached substantial importance to flooding prevention and control the economically developed downstream areas of the yrb whose economic development index far exceeds that of other prefecture level cities and the high exposure and vulnerability of disaster bearing bodies will greatly exacerbate the risk of flooding in the lower yrb therefore the lower yrb should increase the prevention and control of floods and the protection of the ecological environment otherwise economic development will be slowed down the middle yrb is the transitional area of coupled coordination degree values and then it shows a decreasing trend from xi an shaanxi to the north in the transitional area the economic development index and disaster risk index are also higher which indicates that flood prevention and control and economic development in these cities can barely be coordinated therefore coordinated development is still their top priority and socioeconomic development should be taken into account while flood prevention and control how to deal with the contradiction between economy and flood risk is a thorny issue facing these regions the upper yrb is the area of the low coupling coordination value since both the flood risk index and the socio economic development index are small resulting in a low degree of coupling coordination due to the low level of economic development the current economic impact on flooding is small and does not yet pose a threat therefore the upper yrb is encouraged to accelerate socioeconomic development without damaging the environment in conclusion the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flooding and requires special attention the transitional zone in the middle yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomics is weak in the upper yrb 4 discussions 4 1 flood disaster risk distribution in the yrb and its relationship with the socioeconomy at present there are few studies on the risk assessment of flood disasters in the yrb and its relationship with socioeconomy this paper systematically clarifies the relationship between flood disasters and socioeconomy within the yrb which can enhance risk management and control of flood disasters song et al 2022 identified the lower and middle yrb as high risk areas for future floods which is in good line with the findings of this current study in addition the recent flood disasters in the lower yrb also corroborated the findings of this paper such as the rainstorm and flood disasters that occurred in zhengzhou and surrounding areas on july 20 2021 jin et al 2022 the socioeconomy in zhengzhou is relatively developed which has certain support for disaster prevention and mitigation but the high exposure and vulnerability of disaster bearing bodies increases the risk of flood disasters 4 2 uncertainty evaluation the flood disaster risk system involves many factors and is a complex system the selection of evaluation indicators and their weights are the keys to whether the evaluation results are correct or not the lack of data in the yrb makes the selection of indicators not comprehensive enough when conducting flood disaster risk analysis second the dataset in this study only covers the period 2001 2020 and most severe flooding events before this time cannot be considered all of the above factors will increase the uncertainty of disaster assessment results at the same time the availability of high precision data has a great impact on the results of flood assessment the study area in this paper is large with various data types and different resolutions when assessing flood disaster risk the data are unified to a resolution of 1 km 1 km there will be certain statistical errors in the process of projection transformation etc which may lead to small deviations in the evaluation results due to the large error of the daily precipitation data of meteorological stations the spatial resolution of the gpml3 precipitation data used in this paper is low and the use of daily precipitation data with higher precision can make the evaluation results more accurate the socioeconomic data in this paper are comprehensive and accurate with high representativeness in this paper the entropy weight method is used to obtain the results which avoids the subjectivity of the indicators and makes the research results more real and reliable although this paper is limited by the lack of data in the western part of the yrb it provides an effective and feasible method for clarifying the relationship between flood disasters and socioeconomy in the yrb and provides necessary information and scientific and technological support for the high quality development of the yrb 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed flood risks in the yrb in four dimensions hazard vulnerability exposure and restorability and evaluated the urban socioeconomic development across the yrb from in dimensions economic population and construction based on the flood risk index and the socioeconomic development index the coupled coordination degree model revealed the coupled relationship between flood risk and socioeconomic development in the yrb based on the aforementioned analyses we obtained the following findings 1 the main stem of the yrb is dominated by high flood risks with an overall decreasing trend from southeast to northwest yrb areas with high and higher flood risks account for 10 39 of the yrb meanwhile overall flood exposure and vulnerability are decreasing from southeast to northwest yrb 2 higher values of hazard exposure and vulnerability of flood disasters are detected mainly in the lower yrb the higher restorability mitigates flood risk in north central shandong province northern henan province central shaanxi province southern shanxi province and the inner mongolia section of the middle yrb and causes medium flood risks in these regions 3 the spatial pattern of the coupled coordination relationship between flood risk and socio economic development over the yrb is quite different the high socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability of the lower yrb will increase the risk of flooding and requires special attention the transitional zone in the middle reaches of the yrb needs to properly handle the contradiction between economy and flood risk to avoid increased risk the relationship between flood risk and socioeconomics is weak in the upper reaches of the yrb credit authorship contribution statement lei hua conceptualization methodology software investigation

7854,study region tibetan plateau tp study focus lakes in the tp that are subject to low human activity serve as an important indicator for quantitative assessment of regional climate change however previous studies have mainly focused on annual changes in lake area level and storage because of limited monitoring stations and long term lake level reconstruction at monthly resolution remains challenging we propose a conceptual hydrological model guided monthly lake level reconstruction wbm svr approach that incorporates water balance models wbms and support vector regression svr to improve the training and testing sets compared with svr alone through consideration of the hydrological process the wbm svr approach integrates wbms to select input factors sub process control equations to quantify the contributions of input factors empirical parameters to characterize catchment uniqueness and svr for water level modelling new hydrological insights for the region physically guided wbm svr is more accurate than svr in reconstructing monthly lake water levels wbms can quantify the hydrological process in the lake catchment area with efficient quasi physical mechanisms and refine the input output factors within lake hydrometeorology the reconstructability generalization capability and transferability of wbm svr are validated for three different types of lakes glacier free inflow lake glacier free outflow lake and glacier fed inflow lake and the reconstruction results indicate significant improvements in wbm svr compared with svr the wbm svr approach shows great promise for achieving monthly lake level reconstruction graphical abstract ga1 keywords data reconstruction method theory guided data science tgds machine learning ml model conceptual hydrological model lake level data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp contains the world s largest and highest group of alpine lakes with approximately 1400 lakes larger than 1 km2 these lakes are subject to low human activity and contain information on climate variability the hydrological cycle and earth systems which is of value in understanding regional climate change and land atmosphere interactions and informing water resources management and planning yu 2011 in recent decades the tp lake regime has experienced dramatic changes with an expansion in lake areas rising water levels and increasing water storages as one of the consequences of the rapid warming in the tp 0 36 c per decade which is almost twice that of the global average 0 19 c per decade this change to the lake regime brings both opportunities for hydropower production and the risk of lake hazards in particular outburst floods caused by a sudden release of lake water pose a severe threat to regional infrastructure ecosystems and the downstream communities immerzeel et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 therefore the changes in tp lake water regimes including area water level and water storage have received extensive attention and research because of the harsh environment and inaccessibility of the tp lake shoreline investigations lei et al 2018 water level monitoring cui and li 2016 and bathymetric surveys liu and song 2022 often lack adequate temporal frequency and spatial resolution remote sensing provides an alternative strategy to obtaining lake water parameters and determining large scale lake changes which can overcome the limitations of sparse gauge networks rodell et al 2018 for example the lake area determined based on multi spectral optical images is available as continuous annual data i e 1991 2018 zhao et al 2022 or at large time intervals over longer time spans i e 1920 2020 zhang et al 2021a water storage can be approximated through the integration of digital elevation models and optical imagery laser satellite data or lidar cheng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b in contrast lake levels can be obtained with radar or laser altimeters for discontinuous daily scale data traditional radar altimeters e g topex poseidon envisat and jason 1 2 etc have provided long term lake level observations with accuracy from centimeters to decimeters since their launch in the 1990 s but the large size footprints make them usable only for large water bodies advancements in remote sensing technology satellites such as cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and icesat 2 have made it possible to visit relatively small water bodies in particular icesat 2 with its 17 m individual laser footprints and dense operational orbits theoretically achieves the monitoring of lakes smaller than 1 km2but is limited by revisit intervals and time spans luo et al 2021 combined altimetry datasets are the only means of maximizing the acquisition of long term water level observations under the current technical conditions such as lake level monitoring datasets for the tp li et al 2019 xu et al 2022 global reservoirs and lakes monitor g realm https ipad fas usda gov cropexplorer global reservoir database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de en and hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr however integrated altimeter based lake level monitoring is the discontinuous record of water levels over a specific time span available only after 1992 and is insufficient truly to reflect the long term variations and heterogeneous characteristics of water levels on the tp which may mislead our understanding of the driving mechanisms behind the lake level changes therefore a reconstruction method applicable to monthly scale lake levels needs to be developed to bridge the missing long term water level records on the tp prior to 1992 lake level reconstruction can be categorized into three main temporal categories first short term reconstruction e g 1 2 months can be conducted by interpolation techniques to maintain the continuity of the observations lischeid et al 2010 second millennial time scale reconstruction can be achieved based on techniques such as pollen an et al 2012 and paleo shoreline hou et al 2021 analyses but these approaches are limited to a few accessible lakes and are time consuming and labor intensive third mid and long term reconstruction e g years to decades is critical in understanding the lake level response to global warming in the future and can be achieved through the application of statistical hydrological and machine learning ml models several studies have introduced statistical models for reconstructing lake levels by constructing empirical relationships such as exponential and logarithm functions between area and water level song et al 2013 however this is a rough extrapolation of the water level that does not take into account catchments with large spatial heterogeneity and strongly intervening climatic conditions this is because these complex climatic conditions are clearly beyond the operating conditions input data parameterizations of the statistical model messager et al 2016 yang et al 2018 in general hydrological models are considered the most reliable means of capturing the lake level changes within the catchment as they operate based on the processes of energy conservation and water balance biskop et al 2016 for example the annual water level changes of the siling co the second largest lake in the tp from 1972 to 2013 were reconstructed by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model the reconstruction result of siling co with the additional inclusion of the glacier melt module is more consistent with the in situ observation than the vic model which does not take into account glacier melt tong et al 2016 however hydrological models are still rarely used for the simulation of water levels in tp lakes which is directly related to the availability and quality of the necessary data addor and melsen 2019 beven 2020 based on simple hydrological assumptions and relatively easily accessible empirical parameters conceptual hydrological models are routinely used for hydrological simulations compared to fixed conceptual hydrological models such as stanford sacramento hec 1 tank and hbv model which require the addition of dedicated modules to adjust the control equations the water balance model has a more flexible architecture that can incorporate modules representing the main hydrological processes in different catchments fenicia et al 2011 yang et al 2018 developed a water balance model applicable to annual scale lake level simulation on the tp to further improve the temporal resolution of water level reconstruction an improved monthly scale water balance model was successfully used for the water level reconstruction of nam co the third largest lake on the tp wu et al 2014 advances in computing have facilitated the widespread application of ml models in catchment scale hydrological simulation the typical method is based on determining the response relationships between observed hydrometeorological elements inputs and hydrological variables outputs thus exploring new patterns and insights hidden in the historical data feng et al 2021 shen 2018 reasonable simulation accuracy is achieved by attempting different ml models or hybrid models combined with time series decomposition methods especially for catchment rainfall runoff relationships chu et al 2020 2021 ml models have relatively few applications in lake level reconstruction and have a coarse reconstructed resolution for example fan et al 2021a reconstructed annual scale water storage changes 1910 2019 for lake hulun located in inner mongolia and the fifth largest lake in china based on the extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost supported by bathymetry satellite altimetry data and meteorological variables liu et al 2022 used the xgboost model for reconstructing tp lake bathymetry based on the known water depths and the topographic variables average slope elevation difference and elevation gradient of the lake shore the need for only one or two paths to measure water depth greatly reduces the cost of field surveys but it is difficult to cover all tp lakes as most are in complex terrain environments with poor accessibility recent experiments have shown that ml models outperform hydrological models in terms of reconstruction accuracy ham et al 2019 jing et al 2020 however ml models are heavily criticized for their poor interpretability and physical consistency reichstein et al 2019 limited samples especially for poorly gauged tp are often unrepresentative of the mechanisms underlying changes in the lake regime exhibiting spuriously good relationships on training and testing sets that do not generalize well to unseen instances ke et al 2022 lazer et al 2014 a new approach is needed to address the problems with ml models based on progressively integrating the strengths of domain knowledge and data science the emerging paradigm theory guided data science tgds maintains the accuracy and interpretability of the hydrological simulation karpatne et al 2017 in this system domain knowledge provides strong extrapolation and interpretability and ai models offer a high degree of flexibility and the ability to easily extract patterns of data features reichstein et al 2019 the application of tgds is reflected throughout the ml modelling chains including data input initialization model architecture design loss function optimization and output data refinement the completeness quality and representativeness of the inputs must each be considered when considering how to solve time series modelling problems inadequate initialization is likely to lead to poorly learned models zhao et al 2019 for example subject to physical constraints khandelwal et al 2015 improved the dynamics of surface water bodies by introducing bathymetry information xie et al 2021 used three synthetic samples with physical mechanisms i e extreme heavy rainfall events long duration rainless events and the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff to improve the performance of long short term memory lstm in rainfall runoff simulations under limited ground based observations pre training of hydrological model has also been used to augment the amount of data available for lake temperature jia et al 2019 and runoff prediction farf√°n et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the availability and representativeness of the model input data are the main obstacles to the monthly water level reconstruction in tp lakes vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 first governed by a complex set of hydrological sub processes in the catchment the limited information available does not support long term modelling of monthly lake levels on the tp as additional sub processes such as baseflow groundwater storage and soil water storage need to be quantified this could be achieved with an improved monthly scale water balance model wu et al 2014 which is not considered in the annual scale reconstruction cui and li 2016 fan et al 2021a improved monthly scale water balance models are not satisfactory for reconstructed lake levels as they are only applicable to a very few lakes with relatively good field monitoring such as nam co furthermore lake level changes typically exhibit a high degree of complexity non linearity and stochasticity at the catchment scale zhang et al 2020 each of the observed hydrometeorological elements can somewhat reflect the changing pattern of the historical lake level however model inputs for ml models that only include historical water levels or observed hydrometeorological elements cannot produce valid information that is representative of the sub processes with catchment characteristics for example temperature affects glacier melting which in turn leads to lake level changes but using only temperature as the influence factor of lake level changes ignores the effect of the catchment area substratum conditions and empirical parameters which would result in a poor reconstruction accuracy and weak factor correlations gou et al 2021 kratzert et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a in addition the uniqueness of catchments often limits our ability to develop generalizable water level reconstructions the hydrologic response of each catchment under seemingly similar climatic conditions on tp varies greatly which is attributed to the unique process information within the catchment to address the problems that limited hydrometeorological information can hardly represent the main characteristics of lake level changes in the catchment area we consider the following two aspects 1 how to quantify the transformation relationship between observed hydrometeorological elements hydrological processes and lake level 2 how to reflect the uniqueness of a particular catchment guided by a framework of tgds the objective of this study is to develop a new approach for reconstructing long term monthly scale water levels in different types of lakes on the tp where data availability is low namely the water balance model guided support vector regression wbm svr model the wbm svr is designed to incorporate sub process control equations affecting lake level changes and empirical parameters representing the uniqueness of the catchment into the data initialization of the ml model the performance of the wbm svr model for reconstructing the monthly water level was tested for a glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake in the northeast tp and compared with the svr model the generalization ability and transferability of the wbm svr model are further discussed where the generalization ability is proved based on different proportions of training samples 50 60 and 70 of total samples the transferability is tested in ngoring lake a glacier free and outflow lake and nam co a glacier fed and inflow lake and is further validated in six tp lakes with different area sizes two groups 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 the wbm svr model proposed in this study is expected to be an important basis for the future development of robust and rigorous physically guided ml models 2 methodology 2 1 water balance model guided svr model a conceptual hydrological model guided svr approach is proposed for monthly scale lake level reconstruction as changes in lake levels reflect the combined results of multiple sub processes nested in the catchment a flexible conceptual hydrological model should be chosen that can be adapted to any specific catchment by combining different sub process modules e g glacier snow permafrost etc a simplified water balance model based on the assumption of mass conservation although not a rigorous formulation can effectively express the variation of multiple sub processes in alpine catchments over time through simplified mathematical equations fan et al 2021b it is therefore used as a control equation to guide the input of ml model as shown in eqs 1 3 1 Œ¥ h l p l e l r o r Œ± 2 r r p r s r g 3 Œ± g i g o Œ¥ o where h l is the relative change in lake water level at the lake scale the main influencing factors are precipitation p l evaporation e l and possibly surface outflow r o at the catchment scale surface runoff r formed by precipitation r p snow r s glaciers r g and subsurface runoff Œ± formed by groundwater discharge inflow g i outflow g o and some other factors Œ¥ o e g permafrost degradation enter the lake notably groundwater discharge g i g o is mostly inferred from differences in lake water balance zhou et al 2013 although some studies give relevant equations li et al 2017 g i g o was not examined in this study due to the lack of available data and the weakening effect of lake sediments or perennial permafrost seen as the impermeable layer jiang et al 2017 fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram of the inner workings of the wbm svr model analogous to the traditional lake level simulations the observed hydrometeorological elements fig 1a were selected according to eq 1 guided by time series pre processing techniques these elements can be placed into the svr model fig 1d described in section 2 3 the difference between the wbm svr model and traditional lake level simulations is the conversion of observed hydrometeorological elements into physical meaning factors through sub process control equations and empirical parameters fig 1a sub process control equations represent the quantification of physical meaningfulness for different sub processes and the empirical parameters represent regional characteristics to improve the transferability of the model in different catchments described in section 2 2 to explain how the sub process control equations and empirical parameters work we unfold the process for each factor in fig 1 b which includes not only catchment scale factors but also lake scale factors a more visual depiction of which is provided in fig 1 c these seven physically meaningful sub processes act together to influence hydrological behavior at the same time the different types of lake water balance equations give the framework the flexibility required to obtain the applicable input factors 2 2 factor quantification we would like to highlight three points of factor quantification in the wbm svr model as follows 1 the sub process control equations enable a shift from observed hydrometeorological elements to factors that act directly on lake level changes 2 the empirical parameters consider catchment uniqueness and the transformation from catchment scale to lake scale 3 the water balance equations for different lake types realize the selection of input factors for the wbm svr model taking into account recharge conditions and discharge patterns 2 2 1 sub process control equation first the complex hydrological processes in the catchment that act directly on lake level changes are decomposed into a series of sub processes then the transformation from hydrometeorological observations the input of the control equation to the representative lake level change the output is achieved by introducing the control equation that characterizes the changing pattern of the sub processes which would be particularly useful for the weakly informed sub processes for example permafrost is usually neglected in lake level simulations because of a lack of local information however the combined effect of the air freezing index and catchment temperature would make it possible to represent permafrost degradation on a monthly scale according to fig 1 ii the control equations corresponding to each sub process were calculated as follows precipitation runoff in the catchment r p was estimated by the following equation 4 r p p c c r where p c is the catchment precipitation mm which can be calculated in the same method as lake surface precipitation see in eq 7 and c r is the runoff coefficient within the catchment the degree day factor model a semi empirical model is thought to be a relatively good method for quantifying snowpack r s and glacier meltwater r g in plateau regions the statistical relationship between air temperature and material balance established by simple parameter input only is a simplification of the catchment scale energy balance hock 2003 in a particular period the melting of glacier or snow r g s was calculated as follows 5 r g s d d f g s p d d p d d 0 0 p d d 0 where ddf g s is the degree day factor for glacier or snow mm d 1 c 1 and pdd is the cumulative positive temperature c of the glacier t g or snow t c a more detailed explanation of the calculation of glacier and snow equilibrium is given in zhang et al 2013 the impact of permafrost degradation on lake water level change Œ¥ o was calculated by the air freezing index ddf a wang et al 2018 because ddf a can account for more than 90 of the variation in the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground peng et al 2017 6 d d f a j 1 n f t j t j 0 c where n f is the number of days that the air temperature is below 0 c j 1 2 n f and t j represents the average temperature c for a specific day j weighted averaging was used to obtain lake surface precipitation p l from raster data in reanalysis or satellite products as follows 7 p l s 1 p 1 s 2 p 2 s n p n s where s 1 s 2 s n are the control areas of each grid km2 p 1 p 2 p n are the observed precipitation of each grid mm and s is the lake area km2 the penman monteith method can be used to predict lake evaporation e l during a non frozen period as follows penman 1948 8 e l Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g Œª Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ e a where Œ¥ is the saturated water vapor pressure curve slope at the mean daily temperature kpa c 1 r n is the net solar radiation at the lake surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 Œª is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 and e a is the wind induced evaporation which can be used to calculate the lake surface evaporation during the freezing period mm day 1 lake temperature t l wind speed w l sunshine duration s l and relative humidity rh l were used to calculate the above sub processes the details of which can be found in mcmahon et al 2013 because lake outflow r o monitoring is limited it was calculated as follows from nearby downstream runoff stations in the catchment that have the same underlying surface 9 r o s r gau 10 s s ungau s gau where r o is the runoff from the lake outlet r gau is the runoff from the downstream adjacent hydrological station s is the area proportionality coefficient s ungau is the catchment area above the lake outlet and s gau is the catchment area above the hydrological station 2 2 2 empirical parameters when the control equations of the research problem are known we introduced empirical parameters that can represent the uniqueness of catchment sub processes in the wbm svr model to achieve the transformation from catchment scale to lake scale behavior because each catchment can be treated as unique by the model the parameters can be adjusted to match its characteristics fig 1b for example c r can be used to measure the spatial and temporal variability of landscape characteristics sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 while ddf g s can reflect the relationship between the ablation of regional hydrological factors glacier and snow and air temperature zhang et al 2006 precipitation glacier ablation and snowmelt within the catchment are then transformed into factors affecting lake level changes under the quantification of sub process control equations 2 2 3 selection of input factors for different lake types lake type recharge conditions and discharge patterns is the main basis for analyzing the intensity and form of water level changes lake recharge conditions are applied to evaluate whether the lakes are replenished by glacial meltwater and allow to classiy them as glacier fed or non glacier fed lakes lu et al 2020 in contrast discharge patterns are based on the hydrological network and allow to classify them as inflow or outflow lakes yan et al 2019 therefore different types of lake water balance equations were used in this study to select input factors for the svr model to make it suitable for a wider range of lakes 2 3 svr model 2 3 1 selection of the svr model many ml models have been promoted to meet the expected task requirements for modelling water levels in different lakes e g artificial neural network artificial neuro fuzzy inference system support vector regression evolutionary model and deep learning as a supervised learning algorithm vapnik 2000 the svr model has been widely used in the reconstruction and prediction of hydrological time series essam et al 2022 the svr model is chosen not only for its ability to separate input vectors in a multidimensional space with a maximum distance hyperplane avoiding dimensional catastrophes paryani et al 2022 but also because it is a revolutionary small sample learning method with a strong theoretical base al anazi and gates 2012 the basic idea behind the svr model is to identify correlations by transferring the data into a high dimensional space according to eq s1 the tendency of over fitting is reduced by introducing a …õ insensitive loss function resulting in a better approximation between the target variable f x and the actual output variable y e g lake level this is equivalent to constructing an interval band of width 2Œµ centered on f x and if the training samples fall into this interval band they are considered to be predicted correctly finally the optimized model is derived by minimizing and maximizing the total loss and the interval using eq s2 and eq s3 text s1 contains detailed details on the svr model 2 3 2 time series pre processing techniques diverse variations in lake water level at various time scales including long term trends seasonal cycles short term deviations or transients may be more closely associated with some hydrometeorological drivers at each temporal scale for example a sudden rise in lake levels may be controlled by extreme rainfall a seasonal trend decomposition based on the loess procedure stl was utilized to extract the sub signal temporal components as follows 11 y t t r e n d t s e a s o n a l t r e s i d u a l t where y t trend t seasonal t and residual t represent the original signal trend seasonal and residual components of period t respectively stl has been described in detail in previous publications cleveland et al 1990 luo et al 2019 the procedure was implemented using the pyssa https github com aj cloete pssa package which is powered by a python application in addition data that had been standardized based on the z score and had a sufficient lag time were fed into the svr model for the duration of the training period 2 3 3 performance evaluation metrics lake level reconstruction performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient cc text s2 describes the detailed calculation procedures 3 application of wbm svr 3 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp 26 00 n 39 47 n 73 19 e 104 47 e is one of the highest regions in the world and is the home to a large quantity of lakes whose area accounts for more than 57 2 of china s total it was estimated that there were approximately 1424 lakes larger than 1 km2 5 0 104 791 4 km2 on the tp in 2018 showing a strong growth trend compared to 1080 lakes 4 0 104 766 5 km2 in 1976 zhang et al 2019 the climate on the tp is dominated by the indian monsoon in summer and mid latitude westerlies in winter which is strongly influenced by precipitation patterns yao et al 2012 over the past decades the climate of the tp has become warmer and wetter sun et al 2020 driving the long term evolution and seasonal cycles of lake regimes according to the dataset of tp lake recharge conditions and discharge patterns gao et al 2018 three typical lakes were selected to test the capabilities of the proposed wbm svr model qinghai lake ngoring lake and nam co represent glacier free and inflow lakes glacier free and outflow lakes glacier fed and inflow lakes respectively fig 2 three types of lake water balance equations and conceptual diagrams are provided in fig s1 these three lakes were chosen mainly for the following reasons 1 all three lakes are important for the study of regional water balance qinghai lake the largest lake 4530 38 km2 and located in the northeast tp has experienced dramatic water level changes in past decades with a seesaw pattern ngoring lake the largest outflow lake 657 08 km2 and located in the eastern tp is the source of the yellow river nam co the third largest lake 2021 29 km2 and located in the south central tp is close to nyainqen tanglha mountains where there are a large number of glaciers and meltwater pours into the lake rapidly 2 the hydrological model has been successfully applied to three lakes which can provide a reference for the selection of empirical parameters 3 all three lakes have in situ observations of a certain time series length which are important for calibrating and verifying the monthly scale water level reconstruction more detailed descriptions of the three lakes are provided in fan et al 2021b li et al 2015 and zhong et al 2020 in addition six lakes of different area sizes with fewer in situ observations were selected to test the transferability of the wbm svr model the location of six lakes were shown in fig 2 and detailed information can be found in table s4 3 2 workflow of the wbm svr model the application of the wbm svr model consists of four steps fig 3 a data preparation b water balance factor processing c model development and d performance evaluation and wbm svr transferability 3 2 1 data preparation the forcing data runoff data and lake level data selected for the monthly water level reconstruction are described in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 after extracting these data referred to in this paper as extracted raw data possess the attributes of different spatial scales catchment scale and lake scale and uniform temporal resolution in which the precipitation and temperature data in the reanalysis products were linearly corrected using the in situ observations lake levels from laboratoire d √©tudes en g√©ophysique et oc√©anographie spatiales legos and in situ observations were used to fill internal gaps by linear interpolation 3 2 2 water balance factors processing using the conceptual hydrological model eqs 1 3 sub process control equations eqs 4 10 and the empirical parameters the extracted raw data from a above were further transformed into wbm guided data henceforth a1 which are described in sections 2 1 2 2 and 3 3 3 to highlight the advantages of the wbm svr model for monthly lake level reconstruction we also set up an svr model with equivalent input data henceforth a2 to the wbm svr model additional datasets b1 and b2 were applied to analyze whether the four meteorological factors t l w l rh l and s l used to calculate the lake evaporation e l had an impact on the reconstruction results see section 4 1 and the other input factors remain consistency with a1 and a2 respectively 3 2 3 model development the water balance equations and input factors for the three types of lakes were selected by applying eqs s8 s10 subsequently with the help of time series preprocessing techniques such as stl decomposition described in sections 2 3 and 3 3 3 different combinations of input factors were used to form the wbm svr model based on a1 and a2 and svr model based on b1 and b2 where the training set represented 70 of the total samples 3 2 4 performance evaluation and wbm svr transferability a glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake was used to validate the ability of the wbm svr model to reconstruct the monthly lake level see section 3 4 shorter training sample proportions 60 and 50 were used at qinghai lake to demonstrate the generalization ability of the wbm svr model see section 4 2 the transferability of the wbm svr model was validated in the extension of the water level reconstruction for two typical lakes ngoring lake and nam co and six lakes with different area sizes as detailed in section 4 3 3 3 data preparation 3 3 1 observed hydrometeorological elements the underlying dataset for our study is the chinese meteorological forcing dataset cmfd http data tpdc ac cn zh hans and the daily china surface climate dataset version 3 0 http data cma cn the cmfd was developed by he et al 2020 and was generated based on observations reanalysis datasets and satellite products covering a monthly scale from 1979 to 2018 we used two variables precipitation and temperature from cmfd as a basis for calculating the lake and catchment averages because of their high spatial grid resolution 0 1 across china daily meteorological data on precipitation temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were collected from ten chinese national meteorological stations surrounding the selected lakes all of these data were strictly quality controlled by the china meteorological administration of these precipitation and temperature were used to evaluate the performances of cmfd data fig 4 fig s2 and fig s3 and showed a good correlation accuracy cc of 087 0 99 the linear correction was used to further reduce the difference between the observations and the cmfd data sperna weiland et al 2010 the maximum and minimum temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were used to calculate the lake evaporation table s1 contains all general information about the meteorological stations for lakes on the tp far from meteorological stations kriging interpolation eq 8 and data from all meteorological stations were used to calculate evaporation for the entire tp and then the lake evaporation could be obtained from interpolation qiao and zhu 2019 lake outflow can be calculated from the nearest hydrological station downstream for example outflow from ngoring lake was calculated using monthly average runoff data from the nearby huangheyan station ma et al 2021 when in situ runoff data are not available for the study lakes global runoff reanalysis data g run ensemble can be used as the substitute product with a temporal resolution of 1902 2019 and a spatial resolution of 0 5 ghiggi et al 2021 in addition the lake boundary delineation method and dataset can be found in liu et al 2020a and liu

et al 2011 which showed a high cc and rmse value with measured monthly water level data fig 5 after aggregating the legos dataset to its monthly mean value some data gaps remained to address this linear interpolation was implemented using the imputets package which was powered by rstudio a sample construction strategy applicable to the tp was further developed to reduce the influence of the legos dataset on the reconstruction results 1 lakes with complete in situ observation can be used directly for model training e g qinghai lake 2 lakes with partial in situ observation can be extended based on the legos dataset e g ngoring lake 3 lakes with sparse and poor quality in situ observations such as nam co the water gauge is destroyed by lake ice each winter and re erected each summer only relative water level data between may to october from 2007 to 2012 is available zhou et al 2013 legos can be used as a recommended dataset as long as the gap filling has been finished the simulated water level data for nam co using the water balance model li et al 2017 was chosen for comparison table 1 contains information about the multiple source dataset used in this study 3 3 3 parameters required for model development table 2 shows the empirical parameters c r ddf g s selected for the three lakes when the wbm svr model is used to reconstruct water levels in other lakes on the tp c r and ddf g s can be selected from liu et al 2020b and zhang et al 2006 respectively we separate the dataset into two portions during the time series pre processing step one for model training 70 of the total samples and the other for model testing 30 of the total samples this approach has been shown to be the optimal choice in prior lake water simulations ghorbani et al 2018 zhu et al 2020b the lengths of the model training and testing sets were determined based on the length of the water level data provided by legos table 1 the choice of three months for the lag was made by the autocorrelation test vaheddoost and aksoy 2021 3 4 results the performance of the wbm svr model in qinghai lake a glacier free and inflow lake was evaluated by cc rmse and nse fig 6a b the cc values for the testing and reconstruction periods were 0 983 and 0 824 demonstrating that the wbm svr model was largely successful in reproducing the historical water level trend in qinghai lake the rmse indicates a relatively low level of dispersion between reconstruction results and in situ observations with values of 0 032 and 0 147 in the testing and reconstruction period respectively nse skill scores greater than 0 6 are acceptable in the tp li et al 2014 fig 7 a shows that the shape and amplitude of water levels in qinghai lake during the testing period are very close to the in situ observations the long term trend during the reconstruction period is largely reproduced as shown by the interannual signal fig s4 seasonal fluctuations show good cycle agreement with a cc of 0 66 during the reconstruction period in this study monthly water level changes less than 0 1 m after 1979 were the characteristics used to define the low amplitude fluctuation features fan et al 2021b the wbm svr model captured low amplitude fluctuation features which occupy a high proportion of the training samples more successfully than the svr model alone high anomalous fluctuation characteristics particularly the amplitude or phase of extreme hydrological events seem to be difficult for the wbm svr model to reproduce well for example the wbm svr model appeared to respond to the extreme water level values in the hydrological contexts of the qinghai lake catchment in 1989 i e the high precipitation and low evaporation peaks but the timing and magnitude of the response were inadequate cui and li 2016 similar highly anomalous fluctuation characteristics e g deviations from the extreme maxima value in 1983 and the extreme minima value in 1981 can also be expected it is worth noting that our goal was not to obtain the best reconstruction results but to provide ideas for achieving long series reconstructions of lake water levels with limited information 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the wbm svr model and svr model using equivalent input datasets we compare the modelling ability of the wbm svr model and the svr model with the equivalent input factors as t l w l s l and rh l are the necessary data to calculate lake evaporation their individual or combined effects can affect lake level changes correspondingly two sets of input factor strategies were created fig 8a differing in that the first set used the e l processed by the control equation a1 for the wbm svr model and a2 for the svr model whereas the second set used raw data for calculating evaporation b1 for the wbm svr model and b2 for the svr model in the testing period rmse values for a1 a2 b1 and b2 were all less than 0 1 during the testing period the box plots in fig 8 b show that the wbm svr model performs better in all quartiles than the svr model especially for the second set 0 96 corresponding to 0 81 in the first set and 0 94 corresponding to 0 77 in the second set as a result the first set of sample strategies in fig 8 a was chosen to examine the differences between the wbm svr and svr models during the reconstruction period and the reconstruction results can be found in fig 7 a the svr model appears to exhibit similar interannual trends to the wbm svr with a change rate of 0 034 m yr and 0 025 m yr respectively however the svr model underestimated the historical water level with cc rmse and nse values of 0 547 0 477 and 2 87 respectively nse 0 indicates that the water level reconstructed result based on the svr model is not credible and that the better performance in the test period was probably due to overfitting in contrast the wbm svr model appears to be more consistent with the long term water level trend during the reconstruction period and shows a smaller error with corresponding metrics of 0 824 0 147 and 0 632 respectively this clearly demonstrates the strength of the wbm svr model since the water level changes in the glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake were correctly reproduced despite its complex climate driven mechanisms fan et al 2021b table s3 shows that the cc value between water level and r c was 0 74 in the wbm svr model and 0 136 in the svr model the large differences in cc values can be explained by the good insight of the wbm svr model into the relationship between precipitation runoff and lake levels in the catchment while this relationship was not accounted for in the svr model the svr model cannot directly understand the principle of lake water balance in as much detail as the control equations of each hydrological transformation process and can only rely on learning these physical principles as much as possible from the data during the training process therefore we attempted to explain how the input factors guided by the conceptual hydrological model could be better learned by the svr model based on the differences in the internal parameters of the wbm svr model and the svr model for water level reconstruction in qinghai lake fig 9 the svr model based on the radial basis function rbf has three adjustable parameters which are the kernel function coefficient interval width …õ and penalty parameter c as shown in fig 9 when the kernel function is constant the kernel function coefficient of the two models are very similar i e they share a similar support vector influence region the smaller …õ of the wbm svr model 0 0017 compared with the svr model 0 087 demonstrates that the conceptual hydrological model guided input factors can contain more support vectors allowing for better generalization capability the penalty coefficient is the key to optimizing the svr model and a larger c value will produce better fitting accuracy and also the risk of overfitting the penalty coefficient of the wbm svr model 122 is much larger than that of the svr model 76 however the reconstruction results in fig 7 show that the input factors guided by the wbm svr model can learn the pattern of lake level changes better than svr alone 4 2 impact of training sample size on the generalization ability of the wbm svr model the input factors governed by the water balance equation in the wbm svr model remain consistent across different types of lakes therefore we investigated the impact of different training sample sizes on lake level reconstruction results to demonstrate the generalization capability of the wbm svr model moosavi et al 2022 this is based on the fact that more than 20 years of water level data are available for only a small number of lakes on the tp and only about 10 15 years of water level data are available for a substantial number of lakes li et al 2019 the 60 and 50 of the total training sample proportions considered were taken based on existing lake level studies zhu et al 2020a as expected the accuracy of the lake level reconstruction gradually decreased as the training sample size decreased fig 10 this was further quantified by the change rate of 0 059 m yr 60 training set in fig 10a and 0 109 m yr 50 training set in fig 10b compared with 0 034 m yr 70 training set in fig 7a the general trends for the low amplitude frequency fluctuation characteristics during the reconstruction period seem to be acceptable cc values in fig 10 range from 0 49 to 0 95 the performance of the reconstruction period deteriorated in high amplitude fluctuations for example in the extreme event in 1989 only 60 of the total sample proportions tried to respond similarly and 50 of the training sample proportions simply ignored this extreme change and instead showed a slowly increasing trend a simple explanation for this issue is that the svr model s working mechanism is to extract and duplicate the spatio temporal patterns seen in the training set shen et al 2021 shorter training sample proportions may not provide the model with sufficient information on the hydrological variability in the tp but this varies by region for example in the lake level simulation using 50 yuanyang lake taiwan and close to 60 urmia lake iran of the total sample proportions can yield satisfactory results kakahaji et al 2013 young et al 2015 these two lakes have one thing in common a large and high quality dataset vaheddoost and aksoy 2021 4 3 transferability of the wbm svr model we also tested the wbm svr model on other types of lakes ngoring lake and nam co to ensure that it accurately represents the relationships between hydrological functions and physical attributes of various catchments wagener et al 2007 fig 11 a and b show that the reconstruction results of the wbm svr model on ngoring lake a glacier free and inflow lake performed well during the testing cc 0 887 rmse 0 146 and nse 0 776 and reconstruction period cc 0 779 rmse 0 113 and nse 0 599 the water level reconstruction of nam co a glacier fed and inflow lake performed well in the testing period with cc of 0 972 rmse of 0 193 and nse of 0 936 fig 11c there is a statistically significant difference between the results of the wbm svr model and the li et al 2017 reconstruction during the reconstruction period with rmse of 0 348 and nse of 0 199 fig 11d in fact training against the wbm svr model improves the overall reconstruction result 0 793 especially in terms of monthly variation as compared with training against the li et al 2017 reconstruction fig 7 c shows that we can expect a good reproduction of monthly fluctuations of the wbm svr model as the monthly variation in water levels of the wbm svr model during the training period is similar to those of in situ observations zhou et al 2013 compared with the small monthly fluctuations in water levels during the training period of the li et al 2017 which results in poor performance during the reconstruction period fig 7 b and c show the significant differences between the wbm svr model and the svr model for the water level reconstructions in ngoring lake and nam co the reconstructed water level of ngoring lake based on the svr model showed a decreasing trend 0 032 m year while that of the wbm svr model showed an increasing trend 0 021 m year fig 7b the relatively poor modelling effect of the svr model may be expected but it is worth explaining table s3 shows the cc values between water level and input factors for ngoring lake based on the svr model and wbm svr model the cc of the wbm svr model 0 756 for r p and 0 855 for r o improved compared with the svr model 0 735 for p c and 0 835 for r gau which does not consider the hydrological knowledge and water balance model it is worth noting that this is not the only reason that ngoring lake showed improved reconstruction accuracy the most significant difference is the cc between Œ¥ o and water level in the wbm svr model of 0 849 while 0 582 was achieved by the svr model with the t c Œ¥ o is quantified by the air freezing index summing up the mean daily air temperatures for days below 0 c and therefore Œ¥ o shows a negative correlation with the water level this is important because inland water bodies in the yellow river source region are significantly affected by permafrost with permafrost degradation accounting for 14 4 of the annual streamflow at huangheyan station ma et al 2019 which is useful in our case for understanding catchment uniqueness fig 7 c shows that the monthly variation of nam co in the reconstruction period can be captured by the svr model however the change rate of the svr model 0 133 m yr is higher than that of the wbm svr model 0 044 m yr for a more detailed description table s3 shows that the cc of catchment temperature t c in the svr model was 0 624 whereas t c was quantified by the sub process control equation for the Œ¥ o 0 859 and r s 0 746 in the wbm svr model the increase in cc value indicates that the water level change in nam co can be explained by the impact of the variability of temperature on the permafrost thawing process which is strongly favored by song et al 2015 it has been observed that increased precipitation runoff r p of the catchment was a major factor in the rapid rise of water level in nam co with a cc of 0 57 for r p in the wbm svr model compared with 0 476 for pc in the svr model ren et al 2020 suggest that accelerated retreating glaciers were thought to have a significant impact on the water level of nam co but this has been more pronounced since 2013 therefore glacial meltwater r g was not the critical factor for the long term water level reconstruction in nam co with a cc of 0 246 all three of the above lakes qinghai lake ngoring lake nam co are larger than 500 km2 and have relatively good input conditions to further illustrate the transferability of the wbm svr model to lakes with different area sizes on the tp we divided the lakes smaller than 500 km2 into two groups according to their type and size 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 three types of lakes were selected for each group to validate the transferability of the wbm svr model table s4 shows that the wbm svr model successfully reproduced the water level changes in the six lakes the cc for the testing period ranges from 0 725 to 0 960 proving that the wbm svr model captures the trends in lake level dynamics well the model performed relatively poorly for donggei cuona lake and xuelian lake with nse of 0 803 and 0 765 respectively and the corresponding rmse also exhibited relatively large degrees of dispersion 0 214 and 0 292 this deviation is mainly due to the incorrect runoff reanalysis records for these two outflow lakes we attempted to improve the representativeness of the input data for monthly lake level reconstruction on the tp to extend the transferability of the wbm svrm model however we still could not address the impact of inherent uncertainties in observed hydrometeorological elements and ml models on the accuracy of the reconstruction which could be helpful in a more detailed analysis with advancements in computing remote sensing and the availability of more in situ observations we aim to advance this research in the future by assessing the uncertainty and reliability in reconstruction results introduced by different hydrometeorological products multiple lake boundary delineations in the same catchment etc also the impact on the accuracy of ml model reconstruction results is analyzed when the laws or relationships of various sub hydrological processes change for example the effects on reconstructed water levels caused by the disappearance of glaciers evaporation and infiltration after lake expansion 5 conclusion in this study a novel conceptual hydrological model guided svr model wbm svr model was developed for monthly lake level reconstruction over long term series it used the svr model as the basic framework with catchment water balance equations for input factors selection sub process control equations for factor quantification and empirical parameters for representing regional uniqueness including glacier and snowmelt rates and runoff coefficients reflecting basin surface properties the wbm svr model was shown to be superior to svr alone because 1 based on the water balance model the wbm svr model naturally transforms the catchment s hydrological processes into input factors that can represent lake level changes this apparent invisibility of specific control equations and empirical parameters well integrated the hydrological knowledge into the historical big data 2 the wbm svr model can be flexibly applied to monthly water level reconstruction over long term series in lakes as it takes into account catchment uniqueness e g runoff coefficients and the degree day factor and lake type recharge conditions and drainage patterns 3 the wbm svr model was greatly improved for the monthly water level reconstruction in the tp with limited historical observations alleviating the dependence of traditional ml models on large samples the application of monthly water level reconstruction in qinghai lake a glacier free and inflow lake in the northeast tp showed that the performance of the wbm svr model matched more closely to the in situ observations than the svr model the generalization ability of the proposed wbm svr model can be validated with different training sample proportions 50 60 and 70 of the total samples as the wbm svr model was shown to enhance the representativeness of the change patterns of the training sample which in turn helps to improve the ability to recreate water level fluctuations during the reconstruction period in addition robust reconstruction findings with the wbm svr model on the glacier free and outflow lake ngoring lake the glacier fed and inflow lake nam co and six lakes of different area sizes two groups 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 demonstrate a high degree of transferability the wbm svr model provides a modular modeling architecture that can be integrated with other ml models to accomplish the task of reconstructing monthly lake water levels in areas with limited in situ observations regarding future development of lake level reconstruction at the monthly scale as a deluge of remote sensing and in situ observations become available we can add additional hydrological processes e g groundwater discharge or complex control equations e g glacial meltwater introduces material and energy exchange to the conceptual hydrological model to guide ml model simulations building wbm svr models applicable to different types of lakes can be used in more complex scenarios such as transferring the wbm svr model from monitored lakes to unmonitored lakes credit authorship contribution statement minglei hou investigation methodology software formal analysis

7854,study region tibetan plateau tp study focus lakes in the tp that are subject to low human activity serve as an important indicator for quantitative assessment of regional climate change however previous studies have mainly focused on annual changes in lake area level and storage because of limited monitoring stations and long term lake level reconstruction at monthly resolution remains challenging we propose a conceptual hydrological model guided monthly lake level reconstruction wbm svr approach that incorporates water balance models wbms and support vector regression svr to improve the training and testing sets compared with svr alone through consideration of the hydrological process the wbm svr approach integrates wbms to select input factors sub process control equations to quantify the contributions of input factors empirical parameters to characterize catchment uniqueness and svr for water level modelling new hydrological insights for the region physically guided wbm svr is more accurate than svr in reconstructing monthly lake water levels wbms can quantify the hydrological process in the lake catchment area with efficient quasi physical mechanisms and refine the input output factors within lake hydrometeorology the reconstructability generalization capability and transferability of wbm svr are validated for three different types of lakes glacier free inflow lake glacier free outflow lake and glacier fed inflow lake and the reconstruction results indicate significant improvements in wbm svr compared with svr the wbm svr approach shows great promise for achieving monthly lake level reconstruction graphical abstract ga1 keywords data reconstruction method theory guided data science tgds machine learning ml model conceptual hydrological model lake level data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp contains the world s largest and highest group of alpine lakes with approximately 1400 lakes larger than 1 km2 these lakes are subject to low human activity and contain information on climate variability the hydrological cycle and earth systems which is of value in understanding regional climate change and land atmosphere interactions and informing water resources management and planning yu 2011 in recent decades the tp lake regime has experienced dramatic changes with an expansion in lake areas rising water levels and increasing water storages as one of the consequences of the rapid warming in the tp 0 36 c per decade which is almost twice that of the global average 0 19 c per decade this change to the lake regime brings both opportunities for hydropower production and the risk of lake hazards in particular outburst floods caused by a sudden release of lake water pose a severe threat to regional infrastructure ecosystems and the downstream communities immerzeel et al 2010 zheng et al 2021 therefore the changes in tp lake water regimes including area water level and water storage have received extensive attention and research because of the harsh environment and inaccessibility of the tp lake shoreline investigations lei et al 2018 water level monitoring cui and li 2016 and bathymetric surveys liu and song 2022 often lack adequate temporal frequency and spatial resolution remote sensing provides an alternative strategy to obtaining lake water parameters and determining large scale lake changes which can overcome the limitations of sparse gauge networks rodell et al 2018 for example the lake area determined based on multi spectral optical images is available as continuous annual data i e 1991 2018 zhao et al 2022 or at large time intervals over longer time spans i e 1920 2020 zhang et al 2021a water storage can be approximated through the integration of digital elevation models and optical imagery laser satellite data or lidar cheng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b in contrast lake levels can be obtained with radar or laser altimeters for discontinuous daily scale data traditional radar altimeters e g topex poseidon envisat and jason 1 2 etc have provided long term lake level observations with accuracy from centimeters to decimeters since their launch in the 1990 s but the large size footprints make them usable only for large water bodies advancements in remote sensing technology satellites such as cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and icesat 2 have made it possible to visit relatively small water bodies in particular icesat 2 with its 17 m individual laser footprints and dense operational orbits theoretically achieves the monitoring of lakes smaller than 1 km2but is limited by revisit intervals and time spans luo et al 2021 combined altimetry datasets are the only means of maximizing the acquisition of long term water level observations under the current technical conditions such as lake level monitoring datasets for the tp li et al 2019 xu et al 2022 global reservoirs and lakes monitor g realm https ipad fas usda gov cropexplorer global reservoir database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de en and hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr however integrated altimeter based lake level monitoring is the discontinuous record of water levels over a specific time span available only after 1992 and is insufficient truly to reflect the long term variations and heterogeneous characteristics of water levels on the tp which may mislead our understanding of the driving mechanisms behind the lake level changes therefore a reconstruction method applicable to monthly scale lake levels needs to be developed to bridge the missing long term water level records on the tp prior to 1992 lake level reconstruction can be categorized into three main temporal categories first short term reconstruction e g 1 2 months can be conducted by interpolation techniques to maintain the continuity of the observations lischeid et al 2010 second millennial time scale reconstruction can be achieved based on techniques such as pollen an et al 2012 and paleo shoreline hou et al 2021 analyses but these approaches are limited to a few accessible lakes and are time consuming and labor intensive third mid and long term reconstruction e g years to decades is critical in understanding the lake level response to global warming in the future and can be achieved through the application of statistical hydrological and machine learning ml models several studies have introduced statistical models for reconstructing lake levels by constructing empirical relationships such as exponential and logarithm functions between area and water level song et al 2013 however this is a rough extrapolation of the water level that does not take into account catchments with large spatial heterogeneity and strongly intervening climatic conditions this is because these complex climatic conditions are clearly beyond the operating conditions input data parameterizations of the statistical model messager et al 2016 yang et al 2018 in general hydrological models are considered the most reliable means of capturing the lake level changes within the catchment as they operate based on the processes of energy conservation and water balance biskop et al 2016 for example the annual water level changes of the siling co the second largest lake in the tp from 1972 to 2013 were reconstructed by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model the reconstruction result of siling co with the additional inclusion of the glacier melt module is more consistent with the in situ observation than the vic model which does not take into account glacier melt tong et al 2016 however hydrological models are still rarely used for the simulation of water levels in tp lakes which is directly related to the availability and quality of the necessary data addor and melsen 2019 beven 2020 based on simple hydrological assumptions and relatively easily accessible empirical parameters conceptual hydrological models are routinely used for hydrological simulations compared to fixed conceptual hydrological models such as stanford sacramento hec 1 tank and hbv model which require the addition of dedicated modules to adjust the control equations the water balance model has a more flexible architecture that can incorporate modules representing the main hydrological processes in different catchments fenicia et al 2011 yang et al 2018 developed a water balance model applicable to annual scale lake level simulation on the tp to further improve the temporal resolution of water level reconstruction an improved monthly scale water balance model was successfully used for the water level reconstruction of nam co the third largest lake on the tp wu et al 2014 advances in computing have facilitated the widespread application of ml models in catchment scale hydrological simulation the typical method is based on determining the response relationships between observed hydrometeorological elements inputs and hydrological variables outputs thus exploring new patterns and insights hidden in the historical data feng et al 2021 shen 2018 reasonable simulation accuracy is achieved by attempting different ml models or hybrid models combined with time series decomposition methods especially for catchment rainfall runoff relationships chu et al 2020 2021 ml models have relatively few applications in lake level reconstruction and have a coarse reconstructed resolution for example fan et al 2021a reconstructed annual scale water storage changes 1910 2019 for lake hulun located in inner mongolia and the fifth largest lake in china based on the extreme gradient boosting tree xgboost supported by bathymetry satellite altimetry data and meteorological variables liu et al 2022 used the xgboost model for reconstructing tp lake bathymetry based on the known water depths and the topographic variables average slope elevation difference and elevation gradient of the lake shore the need for only one or two paths to measure water depth greatly reduces the cost of field surveys but it is difficult to cover all tp lakes as most are in complex terrain environments with poor accessibility recent experiments have shown that ml models outperform hydrological models in terms of reconstruction accuracy ham et al 2019 jing et al 2020 however ml models are heavily criticized for their poor interpretability and physical consistency reichstein et al 2019 limited samples especially for poorly gauged tp are often unrepresentative of the mechanisms underlying changes in the lake regime exhibiting spuriously good relationships on training and testing sets that do not generalize well to unseen instances ke et al 2022 lazer et al 2014 a new approach is needed to address the problems with ml models based on progressively integrating the strengths of domain knowledge and data science the emerging paradigm theory guided data science tgds maintains the accuracy and interpretability of the hydrological simulation karpatne et al 2017 in this system domain knowledge provides strong extrapolation and interpretability and ai models offer a high degree of flexibility and the ability to easily extract patterns of data features reichstein et al 2019 the application of tgds is reflected throughout the ml modelling chains including data input initialization model architecture design loss function optimization and output data refinement the completeness quality and representativeness of the inputs must each be considered when considering how to solve time series modelling problems inadequate initialization is likely to lead to poorly learned models zhao et al 2019 for example subject to physical constraints khandelwal et al 2015 improved the dynamics of surface water bodies by introducing bathymetry information xie et al 2021 used three synthetic samples with physical mechanisms i e extreme heavy rainfall events long duration rainless events and the monotonic relationship between rainfall and runoff to improve the performance of long short term memory lstm in rainfall runoff simulations under limited ground based observations pre training of hydrological model has also been used to augment the amount of data available for lake temperature jia et al 2019 and runoff prediction farf√°n et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the availability and representativeness of the model input data are the main obstacles to the monthly water level reconstruction in tp lakes vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 first governed by a complex set of hydrological sub processes in the catchment the limited information available does not support long term modelling of monthly lake levels on the tp as additional sub processes such as baseflow groundwater storage and soil water storage need to be quantified this could be achieved with an improved monthly scale water balance model wu et al 2014 which is not considered in the annual scale reconstruction cui and li 2016 fan et al 2021a improved monthly scale water balance models are not satisfactory for reconstructed lake levels as they are only applicable to a very few lakes with relatively good field monitoring such as nam co furthermore lake level changes typically exhibit a high degree of complexity non linearity and stochasticity at the catchment scale zhang et al 2020 each of the observed hydrometeorological elements can somewhat reflect the changing pattern of the historical lake level however model inputs for ml models that only include historical water levels or observed hydrometeorological elements cannot produce valid information that is representative of the sub processes with catchment characteristics for example temperature affects glacier melting which in turn leads to lake level changes but using only temperature as the influence factor of lake level changes ignores the effect of the catchment area substratum conditions and empirical parameters which would result in a poor reconstruction accuracy and weak factor correlations gou et al 2021 kratzert et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a in addition the uniqueness of catchments often limits our ability to develop generalizable water level reconstructions the hydrologic response of each catchment under seemingly similar climatic conditions on tp varies greatly which is attributed to the unique process information within the catchment to address the problems that limited hydrometeorological information can hardly represent the main characteristics of lake level changes in the catchment area we consider the following two aspects 1 how to quantify the transformation relationship between observed hydrometeorological elements hydrological processes and lake level 2 how to reflect the uniqueness of a particular catchment guided by a framework of tgds the objective of this study is to develop a new approach for reconstructing long term monthly scale water levels in different types of lakes on the tp where data availability is low namely the water balance model guided support vector regression wbm svr model the wbm svr is designed to incorporate sub process control equations affecting lake level changes and empirical parameters representing the uniqueness of the catchment into the data initialization of the ml model the performance of the wbm svr model for reconstructing the monthly water level was tested for a glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake in the northeast tp and compared with the svr model the generalization ability and transferability of the wbm svr model are further discussed where the generalization ability is proved based on different proportions of training samples 50 60 and 70 of total samples the transferability is tested in ngoring lake a glacier free and outflow lake and nam co a glacier fed and inflow lake and is further validated in six tp lakes with different area sizes two groups 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 the wbm svr model proposed in this study is expected to be an important basis for the future development of robust and rigorous physically guided ml models 2 methodology 2 1 water balance model guided svr model a conceptual hydrological model guided svr approach is proposed for monthly scale lake level reconstruction as changes in lake levels reflect the combined results of multiple sub processes nested in the catchment a flexible conceptual hydrological model should be chosen that can be adapted to any specific catchment by combining different sub process modules e g glacier snow permafrost etc a simplified water balance model based on the assumption of mass conservation although not a rigorous formulation can effectively express the variation of multiple sub processes in alpine catchments over time through simplified mathematical equations fan et al 2021b it is therefore used as a control equation to guide the input of ml model as shown in eqs 1 3 1 Œ¥ h l p l e l r o r Œ± 2 r r p r s r g 3 Œ± g i g o Œ¥ o where h l is the relative change in lake water level at the lake scale the main influencing factors are precipitation p l

inflow g i outflow g o and some other factors Œ¥ o e g permafrost degradation enter the lake notably groundwater discharge g i g o is mostly inferred from differences in lake water balance zhou et al 2013 although some studies give relevant equations li et al 2017 g i g o was not examined in this study due to the lack of available data and the weakening effect of lake sediments or perennial permafrost seen as the impermeable layer jiang et al 2017 fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram of the inner workings of the wbm svr model analogous to the traditional lake level simulations the observed hydrometeorological elements fig 1a were selected according to eq 1 guided by time series pre processing techniques these elements can be placed into the svr model fig 1d described in section 2 3 the difference between the wbm svr model and traditional lake level simulations is the conversion of observed hydrometeorological elements into physical meaning factors through sub process control equations and empirical parameters fig 1a sub process control equations represent the quantification of physical meaningfulness for different sub processes and the empirical parameters represent regional characteristics to improve the transferability of the model in different catchments described in section 2 2 to explain how the sub process control equations and empirical parameters work we unfold the process for each factor in fig 1 b which includes not only catchment scale factors but also lake scale factors a more visual depiction of which is provided in fig 1 c these seven physically meaningful sub processes act together to influence hydrological behavior at the same time the different types of lake water balance equations give the framework the flexibility required to obtain the applicable input factors 2 2 factor quantification we would like to highlight three points of factor quantification in the wbm svr model as follows 1 the sub process control equations enable a shift from observed hydrometeorological elements to factors that act directly on lake level changes 2 the empirical parameters consider catchment uniqueness and the transformation from catchment scale to lake scale 3 the water balance equations for different lake types realize the selection of input factors for the wbm svr model taking into account recharge conditions and discharge patterns 2 2 1 sub process control equation first the complex hydrological processes in the catchment that act directly on lake level changes are decomposed into a series of sub processes then the transformation from hydrometeorological observations the input of the control equation to the representative lake level change the output is achieved by introducing the control equation that characterizes the changing pattern of the sub processes which would be particularly useful for the weakly informed sub processes for example permafrost is usually neglected in lake level simulations because of a lack of local information however the combined effect of the air freezing index and catchment temperature would make it possible to represent permafrost degradation on a monthly scale according to fig 1 ii the control equations corresponding to each sub process were calculated as follows precipitation runoff in the catchment r p was estimated by the following equation 4 r p p c c r where p c is the catchment precipitation mm which can be calculated in the same method as lake surface precipitation see in eq 7 and c r is the runoff coefficient within the catchment the degree day factor model a semi empirical model is thought to be a relatively good method for quantifying snowpack r s and glacier meltwater r g in plateau regions the statistical relationship between air temperature and material balance established by simple parameter input only is a simplification of the catchment scale energy balance hock 2003 in a particular period the melting of glacier or snow r g s was calculated as follows 5 r g s d d f g s p d d p d d 0 0 p d d 0 where ddf g s is the degree day factor for glacier or snow mm d 1 c 1 and pdd is the cumulative positive temperature c of the glacier t g or snow t c a more detailed explanation of the calculation of glacier and snow equilibrium is given in zhang et al 2013 the impact of permafrost degradation on lake water level change Œ¥ o was calculated by the air freezing index ddf a wang et al 2018 because ddf a can account for more than 90 of the variation in the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground peng et al 2017 6 d d f a j 1 n f t j t j 0 c where n f is the number of days that the air temperature is below 0 c j 1 2 n f and t j represents the average temperature c for a specific day j weighted averaging was used to obtain lake surface precipitation p l from raster data in reanalysis or satellite products as follows 7 p l s 1 p 1 s 2 p 2 s n p n s where s 1 s 2 s n are the control areas of each grid km2 p 1 p 2 p n are the observed precipitation of each grid mm and s is the lake area km2 the penman monteith method can be used to predict lake evaporation e l during a non frozen period as follows penman 1948 8 e l Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g Œª Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ e a where Œ¥ is the saturated water vapor pressure curve slope at the mean daily temperature kpa c 1 r n is the net solar radiation at the lake surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 Œª is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 and e a is the wind induced evaporation which can be used to calculate the lake surface evaporation during the freezing period mm day 1 lake temperature t l wind speed w l sunshine duration s l and relative humidity rh l were used to calculate the above sub processes the details of which can be found in mcmahon et al 2013 because lake outflow r o monitoring is limited it was calculated as follows from nearby downstream runoff stations in the catchment that have the same underlying surface 9 r o s r gau 10 s s ungau s gau where r o is the runoff from the lake outlet r gau is the runoff from the downstream adjacent hydrological station s is the area proportionality coefficient s ungau is the catchment area above the lake outlet and s gau is the catchment area above the hydrological station 2 2 2 empirical parameters when the control equations of the research problem are known we introduced empirical parameters that can represent the uniqueness of catchment sub processes in the wbm svr model to achieve the transformation from catchment scale to lake scale behavior because each catchment can be treated as unique by the model the parameters can be adjusted to match its characteristics fig 1b for example c r can be used to measure the spatial and temporal variability of landscape characteristics sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 while ddf g s can reflect the relationship between the ablation of regional hydrological factors glacier and snow and air temperature zhang et al 2006 precipitation glacier ablation and snowmelt within the catchment are then transformed into factors affecting lake level changes under the quantification of sub process control equations 2 2 3 selection of input factors for different lake types lake type recharge conditions and discharge patterns is the main basis for analyzing the intensity and form of water level changes lake recharge conditions are applied to evaluate whether the lakes are replenished by glacial meltwater and allow to classiy them as glacier fed or non glacier fed lakes lu et al 2020 in contrast discharge patterns are based on the hydrological network and allow to classify them as inflow or outflow lakes yan et al 2019 therefore different types of lake water balance equations were used in this study to select input factors for the svr model to make it suitable for a wider range of lakes 2 3 svr model 2 3 1 selection of the svr model many ml models have been promoted to meet the expected task requirements for modelling water levels in different lakes e g artificial neural network artificial neuro fuzzy inference system support vector regression evolutionary model and deep learning as a supervised learning algorithm vapnik 2000 the svr model has been widely used in the reconstruction and prediction of hydrological time series essam et al 2022 the svr model is chosen not only for its ability to separate input vectors in a multidimensional space with a maximum distance hyperplane avoiding dimensional catastrophes paryani et al 2022 but also because it is a revolutionary small sample learning method with a strong theoretical base al anazi and gates 2012 the basic idea behind the svr model is to identify correlations by transferring the data into a high dimensional space according to eq s1 the tendency of over fitting is reduced by introducing a …õ insensitive loss function resulting in a better approximation between the target variable f x and the actual output variable y e g lake level this is equivalent to constructing an interval band of width 2Œµ centered on f x and if the training samples fall into this interval band they are considered to be predicted correctly finally the optimized model is derived by minimizing and maximizing the total loss and the interval using eq s2 and eq s3 text s1 contains detailed details on the svr model 2 3 2 time series pre processing techniques diverse variations in lake water level at various time scales including long term trends seasonal cycles short term deviations or transients may be more closely associated with some hydrometeorological drivers at each temporal scale for example a sudden rise in lake levels may be controlled by extreme rainfall a seasonal trend decomposition based on the loess procedure stl was utilized to extract the sub signal temporal components as follows 11 y t t r e n d t s e a s o n a l t r e s i d u a l t where y t trend t seasonal t and residual t represent the original signal trend seasonal and residual components of period t respectively stl has been described in detail in previous publications cleveland et al 1990 luo et al 2019 the procedure was implemented using the pyssa https github com aj cloete pssa package which is powered by a python application in addition data that had been standardized based on the z score and had a sufficient lag time were fed into the svr model for the duration of the training period 2 3 3 performance evaluation metrics lake level reconstruction performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient cc text s2 describes the detailed calculation procedures 3 application of wbm svr 3 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp 26 00 n 39 47 n 73 19 e 104 47 e is one of the highest regions in the world and is the home to a large quantity of lakes whose area accounts for more than 57 2 of china s total it was estimated that there were approximately 1424 lakes larger than 1 km2 5 0 104 791 4 km2 on the tp in 2018 showing a strong growth trend compared to 1080 lakes 4 0 104 766 5 km2 in 1976 zhang et al 2019 the climate on the tp is dominated by the indian monsoon in summer and mid latitude westerlies in winter which is strongly influenced by precipitation patterns yao et al 2012 over the past decades the climate of the tp has become warmer and wetter sun et al 2020 driving the long term evolution and seasonal cycles of lake regimes according to the dataset of tp lake recharge conditions and discharge patterns gao et al 2018 three typical lakes were selected to test the capabilities of the proposed wbm svr model qinghai lake ngoring lake and nam co represent glacier free and inflow lakes glacier free and outflow lakes glacier fed and inflow lakes respectively fig 2 three types of lake water balance equations and conceptual diagrams are provided in fig s1 these three lakes were chosen mainly for the following reasons 1 all three lakes are important for the study of regional water balance qinghai lake the largest lake 4530 38 km2 and located in the northeast tp has experienced dramatic water level changes in past decades with a seesaw pattern ngoring lake the largest outflow lake 657 08 km2 and located in the eastern tp is the source of the yellow river nam co the third largest lake 2021 29 km2 and located in the south central tp is close to nyainqen tanglha mountains where there are a large number of glaciers and meltwater pours into the lake rapidly 2 the hydrological model has been successfully applied to three lakes which can provide a reference for the selection of empirical parameters 3 all three lakes have in situ observations of a certain time series length which are important for calibrating and verifying the monthly scale water level reconstruction more detailed descriptions of the three lakes are provided in fan et al 2021b li et al 2015 and zhong et al 2020 in addition six lakes of different area sizes with fewer in situ observations were selected to test the transferability of the wbm svr model the location of six lakes were shown in fig 2 and detailed information can be found in table s4 3 2 workflow of the wbm svr model the application of the wbm svr model consists of four steps fig 3 a data preparation b water balance factor processing c model development and d performance evaluation and wbm svr transferability 3 2 1 data preparation the forcing data runoff data and lake level data selected for the monthly water level reconstruction are described in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 after extracting these data referred to in this paper as extracted raw data possess the attributes of different spatial scales catchment scale and lake scale and uniform temporal resolution in which the precipitation and temperature data in the reanalysis products were linearly corrected using the in situ observations lake levels from laboratoire d √©tudes en g√©ophysique et oc√©anographie spatiales legos and in situ observations were used to fill internal gaps by linear interpolation 3 2 2 water balance factors processing using the conceptual hydrological model eqs 1 3 sub process control equations eqs 4 10 and the empirical parameters the extracted raw data from a above were further transformed into wbm guided data henceforth a1 which are described in sections 2 1 2 2 and 3 3 3 to highlight the advantages of the wbm svr model for monthly lake level reconstruction we also set up an svr model with equivalent input data henceforth a2 to the wbm svr model additional datasets b1 and b2 were applied to analyze whether the four meteorological factors t l w l rh l and s l used to calculate the lake evaporation e l had an impact on the reconstruction results see section 4 1 and the other input factors remain consistency with a1 and a2 respectively 3 2 3 model development the water balance equations and input factors for the three types of lakes were selected by applying eqs s8 s10 subsequently with the help of time series preprocessing techniques such as stl decomposition described in sections 2 3 and 3 3 3 different combinations of input factors were used to form the wbm svr model based on a1 and a2 and svr model based on b1 and b2 where the training set represented 70 of the total samples 3 2 4 performance evaluation and wbm svr transferability a glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake was used to validate the ability of the wbm svr model to reconstruct the monthly lake level see section 3 4 shorter training sample proportions 60 and 50 were used at qinghai lake to demonstrate the generalization ability of the wbm svr model see section 4 2 the transferability of the wbm svr model was validated in the extension of the water level reconstruction for two typical lakes ngoring lake and nam co and six lakes with different area sizes as detailed in section 4 3 3 3 data preparation 3 3 1 observed hydrometeorological elements the underlying dataset for our study is the chinese meteorological forcing dataset cmfd http data tpdc ac cn zh hans and the daily china surface climate dataset version 3 0 http data cma cn the cmfd was developed by he et al 2020 and was generated based on observations reanalysis datasets and satellite products covering a monthly scale from 1979 to 2018 we used two variables precipitation and temperature from cmfd as a basis for calculating the lake and catchment averages because of their high spatial grid resolution 0 1 across china daily meteorological data on precipitation temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were collected from ten chinese national meteorological stations surrounding the selected lakes all of these data were strictly quality controlled by the china meteorological administration of these precipitation and temperature were used to evaluate the performances of cmfd data fig 4 fig s2 and fig s3 and showed a good correlation accuracy cc of 087 0 99 the linear correction was used to further reduce the difference between the observations and the cmfd data sperna weiland et al 2010 the maximum and minimum temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity were used to calculate the lake evaporation table s1 contains all general information about the meteorological stations for lakes on the tp far from meteorological stations kriging interpolation eq 8 and data from all meteorological stations were used to calculate evaporation for the entire tp and then the lake evaporation could be obtained from interpolation qiao and zhu 2019 lake outflow can be calculated from the nearest hydrological station downstream for example outflow from ngoring lake was calculated using monthly average runoff data from the nearby huangheyan station ma et al 2021 when in situ runoff data are not available for the study lakes global runoff reanalysis data g run ensemble can be used as the substitute product with a temporal resolution of 1902 2019 and a spatial resolution of 0 5 ghiggi et al 2021 in addition the lake boundary delineation method and dataset can be found in liu et al 2020a and liu et al 2022 3 3 2 lake level the duration of the in situ observations had not been consistently recorded for the selected lakes monthly water level wl data for qinghai lake have been kept for more than 40 years and were collected from the hydrological bureau of qinghai province monthly water level data for ngoring lake was obtained from duan et al 2015 and there were data gaps due to technical or maintenance problems table 2 general information about the hydrological stations is given in table s2 hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr a legos project was used as a complementary dataset cr√©taux et al 2011 which showed a high cc and rmse value with measured monthly water level data fig 5 after aggregating the legos dataset to its monthly mean value some data gaps remained to address this linear interpolation was implemented using the imputets package which was powered by rstudio a sample construction strategy applicable to the tp was further developed to reduce the influence of the legos dataset on the reconstruction results 1 lakes with complete in situ observation can be used directly for model training e g qinghai lake 2 lakes with partial in situ observation can be extended based on the legos dataset e g ngoring lake 3 lakes with sparse and poor quality in situ observations such as nam co the water gauge is destroyed by lake ice each winter and re erected each summer only relative water level data between may to october from 2007 to 2012 is available zhou et al 2013 legos can be used as a recommended dataset as long as the gap filling has been finished the simulated water level data for nam co using the water balance model li et al 2017 was chosen for comparison table 1 contains information about the multiple source dataset used in this study 3 3 3 parameters required for model development table 2 shows the empirical parameters c r ddf g s selected for the three lakes when the wbm svr model is used to reconstruct water levels in other lakes on the tp c r and ddf g s can be selected from liu et al 2020b and zhang et al 2006 respectively we separate the dataset into two portions during the time series pre processing step one for model training 70 of the total samples and the other for model testing 30 of the total samples this approach has been shown to be the optimal choice in prior lake water simulations ghorbani et al 2018 zhu et al 2020b the lengths of the model training and testing sets were determined based on the length of the water level data provided by legos table 1 the choice of three months for the lag was made by the autocorrelation test vaheddoost and aksoy 2021 3 4 results the performance of the wbm svr model in qinghai lake a glacier free and inflow lake was evaluated by cc rmse and nse fig 6a b the cc values for the testing and reconstruction periods were 0 983 and 0 824 demonstrating that the wbm svr model was largely successful in reproducing the historical water level trend in qinghai lake the rmse indicates a relatively low level of dispersion between reconstruction results and in situ observations with values of 0 032 and 0 147 in the testing and reconstruction period respectively nse skill scores greater than 0 6 are acceptable in the tp li et al 2014 fig 7 a shows that the shape and amplitude of water levels in qinghai lake during the testing period are very close to the in situ observations the long term trend during the reconstruction period is largely reproduced as shown by the interannual signal fig s4 seasonal fluctuations show good cycle agreement with a cc of 0 66 during the reconstruction period in this study monthly water level changes less than 0 1 m after 1979 were the characteristics used to define the low amplitude fluctuation features fan et al 2021b the wbm svr model captured low amplitude fluctuation features which occupy a high proportion of the training samples more successfully than the svr model alone high anomalous fluctuation characteristics particularly the amplitude or phase of extreme hydrological events seem to be difficult for the wbm svr model to reproduce well for example the wbm svr model appeared to respond to the extreme water level values in the hydrological contexts of the qinghai lake catchment in 1989 i e the high precipitation and low evaporation peaks but the timing and magnitude of the response were inadequate cui and li 2016 similar highly anomalous fluctuation characteristics e g deviations from the extreme maxima value in 1983 and the extreme minima value in 1981 can also be expected it is worth noting that our goal was not to obtain the best reconstruction results but to provide ideas for achieving long series reconstructions of lake water levels with limited information 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the wbm svr model and svr model using equivalent input datasets we compare the modelling ability of the wbm svr model and the svr model with the equivalent input factors as t l w l s l and rh l are the necessary data to calculate lake evaporation their individual or combined effects can affect lake level changes correspondingly two sets of input factor strategies were created fig 8a differing in that the first set used the e l processed by the control equation a1 for the wbm svr model and a2 for the svr model whereas the second set used raw data for calculating evaporation b1 for the wbm svr model and b2 for the svr model in the testing period rmse values for a1 a2 b1 and b2 were all less than 0 1 during the testing period the box plots in fig 8 b show that the wbm svr model performs better in all quartiles than the svr model especially for the second set 0 96 corresponding to 0 81 in the first set and 0 94 corresponding to 0 77 in the second set as a result the first set of sample strategies in fig 8 a was chosen to examine the differences between the wbm svr and svr models during the reconstruction period and the reconstruction results can be found in fig 7 a the svr model appears to exhibit similar interannual trends to the wbm svr with a change rate of 0 034 m yr and 0 025 m yr respectively however the svr model underestimated the historical water level with cc rmse and nse values of 0 547 0 477 and 2 87 respectively nse 0 indicates that the water level reconstructed result based on the svr model is not credible and that the better performance in the test period was probably due to overfitting in contrast the wbm svr model appears to be more consistent with the long term water level trend during the reconstruction period and shows a smaller error with corresponding metrics of 0 824 0 147 and 0 632 respectively this clearly demonstrates the strength of the wbm svr model since the water level changes in the glacier free and inflow lake qinghai lake were correctly reproduced despite its complex climate driven mechanisms fan et al 2021b table s3 shows that the cc value between water level and r c was 0 74 in the wbm svr model and 0 136 in the svr model the large differences in cc values can be explained by the good insight of the wbm svr model into the relationship between precipitation runoff and lake levels in the catchment while this relationship was not accounted for in the svr model the svr model cannot directly understand the principle of lake water balance in as much detail as the control equations of each hydrological transformation process and can only rely on learning these physical principles as much as possible from the data during the training process therefore we attempted to explain how the input factors guided by the conceptual hydrological model could be better learned by the svr model based on the differences in the internal parameters of the wbm svr model and the svr model for water level reconstruction in qinghai lake fig 9 the svr model based on the radial basis function rbf has three adjustable parameters which are the kernel function coefficient interval width …õ and penalty parameter c as shown in fig 9 when the kernel function is constant the kernel function coefficient of the two models are very similar i e they share a similar support vector influence region the smaller …õ of the wbm svr model 0 0017 compared with the svr model 0 087 demonstrates that the conceptual hydrological model guided input factors can contain more support vectors allowing for better generalization capability the penalty coefficient is the key to optimizing the svr model and a larger c value will produce better fitting accuracy and also the risk of overfitting the penalty coefficient of the wbm svr model 122 is much larger than that of the svr model 76 however the reconstruction results in fig 7 show that the input factors guided by the wbm svr model can learn the pattern of lake level changes better than svr alone 4 2 impact of training sample size on the generalization ability of the wbm svr model the input factors governed by the water balance equation in the wbm svr model remain consistent across different types of lakes therefore we investigated the impact of different training sample sizes on lake level reconstruction results to demonstrate the generalization capability of the wbm svr model moosavi et al 2022 this is based on the fact that more than 20 years of water level data are available for only a small number of lakes on the tp and only about 10 15 years of water level data are available for a substantial number of lakes li et al 2019 the 60 and 50 of the total training sample proportions considered were taken based on existing lake level studies zhu et al 2020a as expected the accuracy of the lake level reconstruction gradually decreased as the training sample size decreased fig 10 this was further quantified by the change rate of 0 059 m yr 60 training set in fig 10a and 0 109 m yr 50 training set in fig 10b compared with 0 034 m yr 70 training set in fig 7a the general trends for the low amplitude frequency fluctuation characteristics during the reconstruction period seem to be acceptable cc values in fig 10 range from 0 49 to 0 95 the performance of the reconstruction period deteriorated in high amplitude fluctuations for example in the extreme event in 1989 only 60 of the total sample proportions tried to respond similarly and 50 of the training sample proportions simply ignored this extreme change and instead showed a slowly increasing trend a simple explanation for this issue is that the svr model s working mechanism is to extract and duplicate the spatio temporal patterns seen in the training set shen et al 2021 shorter training sample proportions may not provide the model with sufficient information on the hydrological variability in the tp but this varies by region for example in the lake level simulation using 50 yuanyang lake taiwan and close to 60 urmia lake iran of the total sample proportions can yield satisfactory results kakahaji et al 2013 young et al 2015 these two lakes have one thing in common a large and high quality dataset vaheddoost and aksoy 2021 4 3 transferability of the wbm svr model we also tested the wbm svr model on other types of lakes ngoring lake and nam co to ensure that it accurately represents the relationships between hydrological functions and physical attributes of various catchments wagener et al 2007 fig 11 a and b show that the reconstruction results of the wbm svr model on ngoring lake a glacier free and inflow lake performed well during the testing cc 0 887 rmse 0 146 and nse 0 776 and reconstruction period cc 0 779 rmse 0 113 and nse 0 599 the water level reconstruction of nam co a glacier fed and inflow lake performed well in the testing period with cc of 0 972 rmse of 0 193 and nse of 0 936 fig 11c there is a statistically significant difference between the results of the wbm svr model and the li et al 2017 reconstruction during the reconstruction period with rmse of 0 348 and nse of 0 199 fig 11d in fact training against the wbm svr model improves the overall reconstruction result 0 793 especially in terms of monthly variation as compared with training against the li et al 2017 reconstruction fig 7 c shows that we can expect a good reproduction of monthly fluctuations of the wbm svr model as the monthly variation in water levels of the wbm svr model during the training period is similar to those of in situ observations zhou et al 2013 compared with the small monthly fluctuations in water levels during the training period of the li et al 2017 which results in poor performance during the reconstruction period fig 7 b and c show the significant differences between the wbm svr model and the svr model for the water level reconstructions in ngoring lake and nam co the reconstructed water level of ngoring lake based on the svr model showed a decreasing trend 0 032 m year while that of the wbm svr model showed an increasing trend 0 021 m year fig 7b the relatively poor modelling effect of the svr model may be expected but it is worth explaining table s3 shows the cc values between water level and input factors for ngoring lake based on the svr model and wbm svr model the cc of the wbm svr model 0 756 for r p and 0 855 for r o improved compared with the svr model 0 735 for p c and 0 835 for r gau which does not consider the hydrological knowledge and water balance model it is worth noting that this is not the only reason that ngoring lake showed improved reconstruction accuracy the most significant difference is the cc between Œ¥ o and water level in the wbm svr model of 0 849 while 0 582 was achieved by the svr model with the t c Œ¥ o is quantified by the air freezing index summing up the mean daily air temperatures for days below 0 c and therefore Œ¥ o shows a negative correlation with the water level this is important because inland water bodies in the yellow river source region are significantly affected by permafrost with permafrost degradation accounting for 14 4 of the annual streamflow at huangheyan station ma et al 2019 which is useful in our case for understanding catchment uniqueness fig 7 c shows that the monthly variation of nam co in the reconstruction period can be captured by the svr model however the change rate of the svr model 0 133 m yr is higher than that of the wbm svr model 0 044 m yr for a more detailed description table s3 shows that the cc of catchment temperature t c in the svr model was 0 624 whereas t c was quantified by the sub process control equation for the Œ¥ o 0 859 and r s 0 746 in the wbm svr model the increase in cc value indicates that the water level change in nam co can be explained by the impact of the variability of temperature on the permafrost thawing process which is strongly favored by song et al 2015 it has been observed that increased precipitation runoff r p of the catchment was a major factor in the rapid rise of water level in nam co with a cc of 0 57 for r p in the wbm svr model compared with 0 476 for pc in the svr model ren et al 2020 suggest that accelerated retreating glaciers were thought to have a significant impact on the water level of nam co but this has been more pronounced since 2013 therefore glacial meltwater r g was not the critical factor for the long term water level reconstruction in nam co with a cc of 0 246 all three of the above lakes qinghai lake ngoring lake nam co are larger than 500 km2 and have relatively good input conditions to further illustrate the transferability of the wbm svr model to lakes with different area sizes on the tp we divided the lakes smaller than 500 km2 into two groups according to their type and size 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 three types of lakes were selected for each group to validate the transferability of the wbm svr model table s4 shows that the wbm svr model successfully reproduced the water level changes in the six lakes the cc for the testing period ranges from 0 725 to 0 960 proving that the wbm svr model captures the trends in lake level dynamics well the model performed relatively poorly for donggei cuona lake and xuelian lake with nse of 0 803 and 0 765 respectively and the corresponding rmse also exhibited relatively large degrees of dispersion 0 214 and 0 292 this deviation is mainly due to the incorrect runoff reanalysis records for these two outflow lakes we attempted to improve the representativeness of the input data for monthly lake level reconstruction on the tp to extend the transferability of the wbm svrm model however we still could not address the impact of inherent uncertainties in observed hydrometeorological elements and ml models on the accuracy of the reconstruction which could be helpful in a more detailed analysis with advancements in computing remote sensing and the availability of more in situ observations we aim to advance this research in the future by assessing the uncertainty and reliability in reconstruction results introduced by different hydrometeorological products multiple lake boundary delineations in the same catchment etc also the impact on the accuracy of ml model reconstruction results is analyzed when the laws or relationships of various sub hydrological processes change for example the effects on reconstructed water levels caused by the disappearance of glaciers evaporation and infiltration after lake expansion 5 conclusion in this study a novel conceptual hydrological model guided svr model wbm svr model was developed for monthly lake level reconstruction over long term series it used the svr model as the basic framework with catchment water balance equations for input factors selection sub process control equations for factor quantification and empirical parameters for representing regional uniqueness including glacier and snowmelt rates and runoff coefficients reflecting basin surface properties the wbm svr model was shown to be superior to svr alone because 1 based on the water balance model the wbm svr model naturally transforms the catchment s hydrological processes into input factors that can represent lake level changes this apparent invisibility of specific control equations and empirical parameters well integrated the hydrological knowledge into the historical big data 2 the wbm svr model can be flexibly applied to monthly water level reconstruction over long term series in lakes as it takes into account catchment uniqueness e g runoff coefficients and the degree day factor and lake type recharge conditions and drainage patterns 3 the wbm svr model was greatly improved for the monthly water level reconstruction in the tp with limited historical observations alleviating the dependence of traditional ml models on large samples the application of monthly water level reconstruction in qinghai lake a glacier free and inflow lake in the northeast tp showed that the performance of the wbm svr model matched more closely to the in situ observations than the svr model the generalization ability of the proposed wbm svr model can be validated with different training sample proportions 50 60 and 70 of the total samples as the wbm svr model was shown to enhance the representativeness of the change patterns of the training sample which in turn helps to improve the ability to recreate water level fluctuations during the reconstruction period in addition robust reconstruction findings with the wbm svr model on the glacier free and outflow lake ngoring lake the glacier fed and inflow lake nam co and six lakes of different area sizes two groups 200 500 km2 and smaller than 200 km2 demonstrate a high degree of transferability the wbm svr model provides a modular modeling architecture that can be integrated with other ml models to accomplish the task of reconstructing monthly lake water levels in areas with limited in situ observations regarding future development of lake level reconstruction at the monthly scale as a deluge of remote sensing and in situ observations become available we can add additional hydrological processes e g groundwater discharge or complex control equations e g glacial meltwater introduces material and energy exchange to the conceptual hydrological model to guide ml model simulations building wbm svr models applicable to different types of lakes can be used in more complex scenarios such as transferring the wbm svr model from monitored lakes to unmonitored lakes credit authorship contribution statement minglei hou investigation methodology software formal analysis
