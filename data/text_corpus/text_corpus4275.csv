21375,strain softening is a major feature of marine clay that plays an important role in offshore geotechnical problems one of the widely used strain softening models is introducing an exponential relation of the undrained strength to the accumulated shear strain into a simple constitutive model the strain softening model of seabed sediments can be obtained by the resistance degradation with cyclic full flow penetration tests however for structured soils the normally used exponential relation failed to reflect the brittleness of the soil under small strain this paper proposed an optimized exponential strain softening model by adding a parameter β the fitting results of 20 cyclic penetration tests on different soils show that the proposed model can reflect both the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state well based on the ldfe analysis on the process of pipe penetration a maximum difference of 22 8 on the pipe resistance may be caused by the value of β for the estimation of ductility parameter n 95 in the strain softening model a new method is proposed by the percentage of strength degradation p su n which can improve the accuracy of n 95 up to 58 8 for the

optimized exponential strain softening model respectively 1 introduction strain softening is a typical behavior for marine clay as the elements of soil change their relative positions in large deformation problems the soil strength progressively decreases with the increase of the accumulated plastic strains until reaching its residual strength the strain softening behavior of marine clay has significant influences on such marine structures as pipelines chatterjee et al 2012 cheuk and white 2011 cocjin et al 2018 and offshore foundations koh et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 various constitutive models have been developed to strictly reflect the strain softening behaviour of soil examples include the elastoplastic model vatsala et al 2001 and the cosserat model arslan and sture 2008 however as most of those strict constitutive models are derived according to the stress strain relations obtained by triaxial tests in the laboratory the deformation of soil is generally within a small strain range within 20 abdulhadi et al 2012 kurz et al 2016 while for the analysis of geotechnical problems featuring large displacements such as t bar penetration and offshore foundation installation the accumulated shear strain may exceed 100 therefore einav and randolph 2005 proposed a strain softening model by decreasing the undrained shear strength of soil according to the accumulated shear strain different from the strength degradation of soil caused by cyclic loading in dynamic problem such as waves storm surges and earthquakes paramasivam and banerjee 2017 wang et al 2019 the strain softening model proposed by einav and randolph 2005 can be obtained from the measured resistance degradation of the penetrometer under pseudo static condition cyclic penetration and extraction with low velocity according to such a strain softening model a simple constitutive model such as the mohr coulomb model can be used to simulate the large deformation behaviors in offshore geomechanics problems dutta et al 2018 hossain et al 2016 koh et al 2016 meng et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the full flow penetrometer t bar or ball bar is being used increasingly commonly as a key tool in marine geotechnical research dejong et al 2010a lunne et al 2011 white et al 2010 plasticity solutions of full flow penetrometers have been developed to estimate resistance to penetration einav and randolph 2005 martin and randolph 2006 randolph and houlsby 1984 cyclic penetration tests are an important method to obtain the strain softening model of soil cheuk and white 2011 lunne et al 2011 randolph et al 2011 taukoor and rutherford 2016 however some researchers have claimed that previously proposed models are somewhat idealized because they cannot predict the real penetration resistance pinkert and klar 2015 zhou and randolph 2009a thus strain softening model should be further studied using cyclic penetration tests in this paper the strain softening models from cyclic penetration tests are summarized and compared by the results of four cyclic penetration tests on marine clay from the south china sea scs and amherst massachusetts united states based on the results of the cyclic penetration tests on 20 marine clays 14 cyclic penetration tests were conducted on clays from scs a strain softening model is proposed that can adequately represent the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state the procedure to estimate the parameters of strain softening is also detailed for the proposed model 2 overview of existing strain softening models using cyclic penetration tests 2 1 the existing strain softening models three major strain softening models have been proposed in the literature based on the results of cyclic penetration tests einav and randolph 2005 pinkert and klar 2015 randolph et al 2007 a simple overview is given below 2 1 1 one stage strain softening model the strain softening model for the degradation of shear strength s u with accumulated shear strain ξ was firstly proposed by einav and randolph 2005 and has been widely used for the analysis of penetration problems associated with marine structures chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 zhou and randolph 2009a b the strain softening model is given by 1 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where ξ 95 is the accumulated absolute shear strain corresponding to a 95 reduction in soil strength δ rem is the inverse of soil sensitivity s u0 represents the undrained shear strength of soil without any disturbance strength of intact soil this simple but clear exponential relation is termed one stage strain softening model in this paper the above relation of the degradation in clay strength can be conveniently estimated from cyclic penetration tests by using the similar exponential function of eq 1 the resistance degradation model reflecting the resistance variation in penetrations or extractions can be described by 2 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m where q n is the net resistance at each penetration or extraction n is the number of cycles n 0 25 for the first penetration n 0 75 for the first extraction randolph et al 2007 n 95 rem is the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 degradation in penetration resistance δ rem cyc denotes the ratio of the resistance to the penetrometer in the fully remolded q rem and initial penetration q in that is 3 δ r e m c y c q r e m q i n the value of s t represents the ratio of the soil strength in the intact state s u0 to that in the fully remolded state s u rem and is appropriate only when the flow mechanism of soil is identical in both conditions as shown in eq 4 based on the cyclic penetration tests the degradation in the undrained shear strength of soil with the number of cycles is shown in fig 1 obviously the value of s u0 cannot be directly measured from the cyclic penetration test because the soil strength measured at initial penetration s u ini with n 0 25 is with a certain disturbance however based on the cyclic penetration tests the value of s t can be extrapolated by the curves of resistance degradation given by 4 s t s u 0 s u r e m q i n t a c t q r e m where q intact is the theoretical penetration resistance of soil without any strain history intact soil n 0 the value of q intact is greater than q in for the disturbance during initial penetration and cannot be directly measured from full flow penetrometer tests however by substituting n 0 into eq 2 the resistance ratio r 1 of q intact q in can be estimated by 5 q i n t a c t q i n r 1 δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 0 75 n 95 r e m the ratio of resistance during initial penetration to that in the fully remolded state q in q rem is inherently related to the sensitivity of soil but it is always less than its empirically calculated sensitivity for a given history of strain during initial penetration liyanapathirana 2016 by combining eqs 4 and 5 the sensitivity of soil can be rewritten as 6 s t 1 r 1 q i n q r e m 2 1 2 two stage strain softening model for structured or cemented soil the intact strength is brittle and only a small plastic shear strain is enough to destroy its initial strength given that the one stage strain softening model may underestimate the structural characteristics of soil within small shear strain range a new model was proposed by randolph et al 2007 according to it only a small plastic shear strain is needed to reduce part of the intact strength of soil while the remainder requires much larger strains to be fully remoulded zhou and randolph 2009a their strain softening model is given by 7 s u δ r e m δ s t r 1 e 3 ξ ξ 95 s t r 1 δ s t r δ r e m 1 e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where δ str is structural component of soil strength related to its intact strength and ξ 95 str is the accumulated absolute shear strain corresponding to the structural component of the soil strength by the two new parameters δ str and ξ 95 str the previous one stage exponential model is separated into two parts and thus the initial brittleness and the fully remoulded state can be both considered the model of eq 7 is termed two stage strain softening model in this paper this model was verified by hodder et al 2009 and has been used to analyze the embedment process of offshore pipelines westgate et al 2013 the two stage resistance degradation model can be developed using the decay function of eq 7 8 q n q i n δ r e m c y c δ s t r c y c 1 e 3 n 0 25 n 95 s t r 1 δ s t r c y c δ r e m c y c 1 e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m where δ str cyc is the structural component of the resistance degradation model and n 95 str is the ductility parameter of this component of soil n 95 str 0 75 was used by hodder et al 2009 the value of δ str cyc can be estimated by 9 δ s t r c y c 1 q e x t q i n where q ext is the resistance of full flow penetrometer during first extraction by reversely extending the two stage resistance degradation model the resistance ratio r 2 of q intact q in is given by 10 q i n t a c t q i n r 2 δ r e m c y c δ s t r c y c 1 e 0 75 n 95 s t r 1 δ s t r c y c δ r e m c y c 1 e 0 75 n 95 r e m based on eqs 4 and 10 the sensitivity of soil can be estimated by 11 s t 2 r 2 q i n q r e m 2 1 3 enhanced exponential strain softening model as the initial slope in the one stage strain softening model is too moderate to adequately reflect the results of field tests the enhanced exponential strain softening model was proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 its strain softening model is given by 12 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 2 3 s u 0 based on the decay function of eq 12 the relation of resistance degradation can be written as 13 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 as a limitation of the functional form of eq 13 q intact q in cannot be directly estimated by extending the curves of resistance degradation pinkert and klar 2015 however based on the decay function of eq 12 the value of q in n 0 25 can be written as 14 q i n q r e m q i n t a c t q r e m e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 as a result the resistance ratio r e of q intact q in can be given by 15 q i n t a c t q i n r e δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 based on eqs 4 and 15 the sensitivity of soil is estimated as 16 s t e r e q i n q r e m 2 2 comparison of strain softening models compared to one stage strain softening model the two stage model was proposed for soil undergoing a relatively large disturbance owing to initial penetration of full flow penetrometer the enhanced exponential strain softening model adds a parameter 2 3 to regulate the slope of the degradation in strength pinkert and klar 2015 to compare the existing strain softening models the results of four cyclic penetration tests on different soils were selected three sets of data were the results of cyclic t bar tests on marine clay from scs ren et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and the another one was from the results of cyclic ball bar tests in amherst massachusetts pinkert and klar 2015 to intuitively estimate the value of n 95 rem an intermediate parameter p resis n percentage of resistance degradation with number of cycles n is proposed to reflect the rate of resistance degradation the value of p resis n can be given by 17 p r e s i s n q i n q n q i n q r e m 100 the percentage of resistance degradation for the results of different tests are shown in fig 2 the horizontal dashed line represents a 95 reduction in resistance and the estimated values of n 95 rem are summarized in table 1 comparisons between different relations of resistance degradation and the test results are shown in fig 3 a d in general different models had particular soils to which they were applicable for the test results of amherst soil as shown in fig 3 a the one stage model cannot well predict the resistances during the first few penetration and extraction cycles this is because its initial slope is too moderate pinkert and klar 2015 zhou and randolph 2009a on the contrary for the clay from the scs shown in fig 3 b d the one stage resistance degradation model compared better to the test results than the two stage model or the exponential model a similar results exists in the other two models the structural parameters in the two stage model not well reflect the soil with slow rate of strain softening in fig 3 b d the enhanced exponential model featured higher softening rate and was appropriate for the selected clays in fig 3 a however as this model does not build a connection between the initial structure of soil such as in terms of the parameter δ str cyc in the two stage strain softening model and the state near fully remoulded the rate of strain softening still be overestimated for the clay from the scs as a result finding a strain softening model that can be applied to all soils is worth further investigation based on different strain softening models the estimated values of q intact q in and s t are shown in table 1 the case of amherst soil is the only one to have a directly measured s t the estimated sensitivities from the three models are obviously different the enhanced exponential model gives the best prediction of the value of s t the one stage strain softening model was underestimated the value of s t whereas the two stage model overestimated it while for scs clays soil sensitivities were overestimated both by the two stage model and the enhanced exponential strain softening model this is because the rate of strain softening is overestimated shown in fig 3 b d 3 optimized exponential strain softening model as analyzed above the three prevalent models can reflect the strain softening behavior of soil to some extent but still have problems in balancing the initial brittleness and the fully remoulded state for some soils based on the basic parameters q in q rem q ext and n 95 cyc from cyclic penetration tests the purpose is to build a novel strain softening model which can better reflects the strain softening characteristic of marine clays the proposed optimized exponential strain softening model is similar to the enhance exponential model given by 18 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 β s u 0 where parameter β is used to reflect the structural component of soil strength the value of β is related to the values of q ext q in and q rem q in during cyclic penetration tests the degradation in penetration resistance can be represented by the decay function of eq 18 19 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m β 3 1 selected cyclic penetration tests to verify the model to investigate the performance of the optimized exponential strain softening model 20 cyclic penetration tests from different clays were selected the selected test data are shown in table 2 of them to avoid the influence of the shape of the probe t bar or ball bar 16 sets of data were from cyclic t bar tests cheuk and white 2011 nian et al 2017 ren et al 2019 sahdi et al 2014 wang et al 2018 and four from cyclic ball bar tests yafrate et al 2009 most of the cyclic t bar tests 14 results were on marine clays from the scs nian et al 2017 ren et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the remaining two sets of data one was from the centrifuge test on kaolin clay at the university of western australia denoted by uwa kl sahdi et al 2014 the other was from the results of tests on high plasticity marine clay from west africa denoted by wa hp cheuk and white 2011 3 2 estimation of the parameter β by introducing the parameter β the optimized exponential strain softening model can reflect both the initial brittleness of soil by q ext q in and its fully remolded state by δ rem cyc the optimized values of β for each test result are shown in fig 4 based on the results of the 20 cyclic penetration tests a relation was built to estimate β using q ext q in and q rem q in i e δ rem cyc and is given by 20 β 0 89 q e x t q i n 0 41 δ r e m c y c 0 23 the estimated values of β in a range of 0 5 0 92 for selected soils according to eq 20 were consistent with the optimal solutions for each test result r2 0 856 based on the results of the selected cyclic penetration test results the parameters used in the proposed relations of resistance degradation are summarized in table 2 of these parameters the value of n 95 rem was directly estimated by eq 17 comparisons between the optimized exponential resistance degradation model by eq 19 and the test results are shown in fig 5 a d it can be seen that the proposed model was satisfactorily consistent with all test results 3 3 estimating strain softening parameters of clay while the relations of resistance degradation can reflect the strain softening of soil to some extent some prominent difference as shown in fig 6 still occurs in the relation between the strain softening corrected curve and the resistance degradation due to the disturbance in the first penetration of a penetrometer the rate of the strength degradation would be underestimated if directly estimated by the relation of resistance degradation the values of δ rem cyc and n 95 rem in the resistance degradation model were usually larger than those of δ rem and ξ 95 in the strain softening model therefore the relations of resistance degradation need to be modified to reflect the real strain softening behaviour for the proposed model the parameters requiring further modification include s t ξ 95 and s u0 3 3 1 estimating soil sensitivity s t based on the proposed model the estimation of soil sensitivity is similar to that in the enhanced exponential strain softening model in eq 15 accordingly the resistance ratio r 0 of q intact q in is given by 21 q i n t a c t q i n r o δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m β as a result based on eqs 4 and 21 the sensitivity of soil is estimated by 22 s t o r o q i n q r e m the estimated values of s t for all the selected data are summarized in table 2 for the results of cyclic penetration tests from the sets in onsoy novato amherst and gloucester the sensitivities of soil the value in brackets in table 2 were measured by field vane tests fvts dejong et al 2010b by comparison it is easy to see that the estimated values of s t by eq 22 were close to the empirical values except for the soil in gloucester that was highly sensitive s t 68 measured by fvt therefore the estimated sensitivities were reliable for marine clay for which are usually less than 20 0 nian et al 2017 wang et al 2018 3 3 2 estimating ductility parameter the ductility parameter ξ 95 can be theoretically estimated by the average shear strain per passage of the penetrometer einav and randolph 2005 and is given by 23 ξ 95 2 n 95 ξ p where n 95 represents the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 reduction in soil strength and ξ p is the theoretical average shear strain per passage of the penetrometer based on the analysis by pinkert and klar 2015 the value of ξ p can be estimated by 24 ξ p t b a r 0 83 log s t 3 09 25 ξ p b a l l b a r 1 1 log s t 2 62 to directly estimate the value of n 95 an intermediate parameter p su n the percentage of strength degradation in the nth cycle is proposed combined with eq 21 the value of p su n is described by 26 p s u n q i n t a c t q n q i n t a c t q r e m r o q n q i n r o q r e m q i n the value of n 95 can be easily obtained just by drawing a curve between p su n by eq 26 and n the estimated values of n 95 for different soils are also summarized in table 2 by comparison with the value of n 95 rem estimated from the resistance degradation used in pinkert and klar 2015 and yafrate et al 2009 the rate of strain softening may be underestimated in previous studies the study found that the estimated values of n 95 have 8 0 80 0 difference the average value was 27 2 smaller than n 95 rem for the selected soils the maximum difference for the value of n 95 smaller than n 95 rem was 2 5 i e 58 8 for marine clay in the set scs s8 2 to estimate the value of n 95 yafrate et al 2009 proposed a relation between the value of n 95 and the sensitivity of soil that is 27 n 95 9 6 s t 0 27 as the value of n 95 is related to both the initial ductility q ext q in and fully state q rem q in of the soil the method estimated by soil sensitivities s t alone i e eq 27 proposed by yafrate et al 2009 may not applicable to all soils especially for those soil with small ductility parameter n 95 a comparison between the estimated values of n 95 from eq 27 and the results by the proposed method eq 26 are shown in fig 7 as a result eq 26 is suggested in the field tests which have a certain physical meaning i e the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 strength degradation taking two test results from the soil in south china sea as example the comparison between the model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 and the optimized exponential strain softening model is shown in fig 8 as depicted in fig 8 a the degradation of resistance might be slightly underestimated like scs s7a 3 soil or overestimated like scs rem 4 soil for the model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 as a result the soil sensitivity and ductility parameter n 95 would be overestimated scs rem 4 soil or underestimated scs s7a 3 soil the proposed model in this study has better fitting results comparison for the least square error lse in fig 8 a by pinkert and klar 2015 and this study the value of lse decreased from 0 011 to 0 004 for soil from scs s7a 3 and 0 035 to 0 005 for soil from scs rem 4 the difference for the obtained strain softening models are shown in fig 8 b for the cyclic penetration test results from different clays the strain softening models are shown in fig 9 a d from which it is clear that the optimized exponential strain softening model agreed well with the test results 3 3 3 estimating intact undrained shear strength s u0 the estimation of the intact soil strength is important for sensitive clay in most cases the value of s u0 is roughly estimated through dividing the initial penetration resistance by a consistent bearing factor n c such as in boylan et al 2011 hossain et al 2011 however it may lead to an underestimation of the soil strength for sensitive clay from eq 21 under the conditions of strain softening s u0 can be estimated by the value of q intact as 28 s u 0 q i n t a c t n c r o q in n c for the t bar penetrometer according to the closed form expression of the exact plasticity solutions martin and randolph 2006 the value of n c t can be estimated by 29 n c t π 2 δ 2 cos δ 4 cos δ 2 sin δ 2 where δ sin 1 α α is the friction ratio of the t bar or ball bar penetrometer and α δ rem 1 s t for the ball bar penetrometer based on the results of ldfe analysis zhou et al 2013 the bearing factor n c ball can be estimated as 30 n c b a l l 10 65 4 5 α depending on the friction ratio of the t bar or ball bar penetrometer the value of n c t ranges from 9 14 to 11 99 and that of n c ball ranges from 11 to 15 3 boylan et al 2011 martin and randolph 2006 constant values of 10 5 n c t bar and 13 n c ball bar were used based on past work taukoor and rutherford 2016 4 an application of the optimized exponential strain softening model on predicting pipe penetration behavior based on the formulas proposed and discussed previously the parameters δ rem ξ 95 and s u0 in the proposed optimized exponential strain softening model can be obtained from the cyclic penetration tests the parameter β can be estimated by the directly measured values of δ rem cyc i e q rem q in and q ext q in the value of β in the proposed strain softening model may have an obvious effect on the soil structure interaction behavior focus on this point a large deformation finite element ldfe model is built to simulate the process of pipe penetration considering the strain softening of clay as shown in fig 10 the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique in abaqus explicit is used in the analysis to solve the large soil deformation during the pipe penetration the diameter of the pipe used in the numerical simulation is 0 5 m due to symmetry half of the pipe model is built and set as a lagrangian rigid body the soil is set as eulerian deformable body one element is taken in the thickness direction the entire mesh extends downward to a distance of 14d a void layer is set above the soil surface to allow the soil to flow into the empty euler elements two in plane faces are fixed in the thickness directions the bottom boundary nodes are constrained against moving in three directions the lateral boundary nodes are constrained against moving in the lateral direction the upper soil surface is set as free the penetration velocity of the pipe is set as d 20 s i e 0 025 m s a frictionless contact is defined for the interaction between the pipe and the soil four cases are investigated case i is under the condition of no strain softening as the value of β in a range of 0 5 1 0 from the above study cases ii iv correspond to β 1 0 one stage strain softening model proposed by einav and randolph 2005 2 3 enhanced exponential strain softening model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 and 0 5 in the optimized strain softening model eq 18 the strain softening relations are shown by fig 11 a and are implemented into abaqus by user defined subroutine vusdfld written in fortran typical values of δ rem 0 2 ξ 95 15 are used for all the cases with strain softening the value of undrained young s modulus and poisson s ratio are e u 300s u and μ 0 495 respectively the soil strength is set as s u0 3 kpa based on a constant value of γ 6 kn m3 the initially stress field is applied on the soil domain at the first step of the analysis based on the numerical simulation results the bearing factors q pipe s u0 with the normalized penetration depth z d are shown in fig 11 b for case i under no strain softening the value of q pipe s u0 from the numerical simulation has a good agreement with that in randolph and houlsby 1984 as the cases ii iv are with strain softening the value of q pipe s u0 are obviously smaller than that in case i up to 46 9 under β 0 5 compared with the widely used one stage strain softening model β 1 0 the value of q pipe s u0 under β 2 3 and β 0 5 is smaller than that with β 1 0 about 12 3 and 22 8 respectively the softening coefficient s u s u0 for the different cases are shown in fig 12 the degree of strain softening for the soil increases with the decrease of β which may explain the effect of β on the pipe penetration resistance as a result a constant value of β may overestimate the bearing resistance of the pipeline in the field if consider the strain softening of clay estimating an appropriate value of β from cyclic penetration tests eq 20 is of practical significances 5 conclusions the study presents the results of a refinement on well established strength degradation models for sensitive marine clays that are used in connection with full flow penetrometers three earlier strain softening models were used to fit the 20 cyclic penetration test results from different clays and the results show that the existing models have difficulties in balancing the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state therefore an optimized exponential strain softening model was proposed which features a parameter β in a range of 0 5 0 92 for selected soils to reflect both the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state the fitting results on the 20 cyclic penetration tests indicated that the optimized exponential model showed good coincidence with all test results the novel strain softening model provide significant improvements over existing models in modeling the decay of undrained shear strength in sensitive soils the estimated values of s t coincided well with the results from fvt for the ductility parameter n 95 of soil in the strain softening model a new method by the percentage of strength degradation p su n in eq 26 was proposed to better estimate the value of n 95 the research showed that n 95 was usually overestimated by the relations of resistance degradation an average difference was 27 2 for the selected 20 test soils and the maximum difference was 58 8 for marine clay from south china sea this would lead to an underestimation of the rate of strain softening finally based on the cyclic penetration test results a detailed procedure to estimate the parameters s t ξ 95 and s u0 in the optimized exponential strain softening model was presented which may be of some values for engineering practices the ldfe method was used to investigate the value of β in the optimized exponential strain softening model on the process of pipe penetration for the value of β in a range of 0 5 1 0 a maximum difference of 22 8 was founded between the proposed strain softening and that widely used one stage strain softening model during the estimation of the pipe resistance as a result estimating an appropriate value of β from cyclic penetration tests is of practical significances credit authorship contribution statement yunrui han conceptualization

21375,strain softening is a major feature of marine clay that plays an important role in offshore geotechnical problems one of the widely used strain softening models is introducing an exponential relation of the undrained strength to the accumulated shear strain into a simple constitutive model the strain softening model of seabed sediments can be obtained by the resistance degradation with cyclic full flow penetration tests however for structured soils the normally used exponential relation failed to reflect the brittleness of the soil under small strain this paper proposed an optimized exponential strain softening model by adding a parameter β the fitting results of 20 cyclic penetration tests on different soils show that the proposed model can reflect both the initial brittleness

optimized exponential strain softening model respectively 1 introduction strain softening is a typical behavior for marine clay as the elements of soil change their relative positions in large deformation problems the soil strength progressively decreases with the increase of the accumulated plastic strains until reaching its residual strength the strain softening behavior of marine clay has significant influences on such marine structures as pipelines chatterjee et al 2012 cheuk and white 2011 cocjin et al 2018 and offshore foundations koh et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 various constitutive models have been developed to strictly reflect the strain softening behaviour of soil examples include the elastoplastic model vatsala et al 2001 and the cosserat model arslan and sture 2008 however as most of those strict constitutive models are derived according to the stress strain relations obtained by triaxial tests in the laboratory the deformation of soil is generally within a small strain range within 20 abdulhadi et al 2012 kurz et al 2016 while for the analysis of geotechnical problems featuring large displacements such as t bar penetration and offshore foundation installation the accumulated shear strain may exceed 100 therefore einav and randolph 2005 proposed a strain softening model by decreasing the undrained shear strength of soil according to the accumulated shear strain different from the strength degradation of soil caused by cyclic loading in dynamic problem such as waves storm surges and earthquakes paramasivam and banerjee 2017 wang et al 2019 the strain softening model proposed by einav and randolph 2005 can be obtained from the measured resistance degradation of the penetrometer under pseudo static condition cyclic penetration and extraction with low velocity according to such a strain softening model a simple constitutive model such as the mohr coulomb model can be used to simulate the large deformation behaviors in offshore geomechanics problems dutta et al 2018 hossain et al 2016 koh et al 2016 meng et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the full flow penetrometer t bar or ball bar is being used increasingly commonly as a key tool in marine geotechnical research dejong et al 2010a lunne et al 2011 white et al 2010 plasticity solutions of full flow penetrometers have been developed to estimate resistance to penetration einav and randolph 2005 martin and randolph 2006 randolph and houlsby 1984 cyclic penetration tests are an important method to obtain the strain softening model of soil cheuk and white 2011 lunne et al 2011 randolph et al 2011 taukoor and rutherford 2016 however some researchers have claimed that previously proposed models are somewhat idealized because they cannot predict the real penetration resistance pinkert and klar 2015 zhou and randolph 2009a thus strain softening model should be further studied using cyclic penetration tests in this paper the strain softening models from cyclic penetration tests are summarized and compared by the results of four cyclic penetration tests on marine clay from the south china sea scs and amherst massachusetts united states based on the results of the cyclic penetration tests on 20 marine clays 14 cyclic penetration tests were conducted on clays from scs a strain softening model is proposed that can adequately represent the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state the procedure to estimate the parameters of strain softening is also detailed for the proposed model 2 overview of existing strain softening models using cyclic penetration tests 2 1 the existing strain softening models three major strain softening models have been proposed in the literature based on the results of cyclic penetration tests einav and randolph 2005 pinkert and klar 2015 randolph et al 2007 a simple overview is given below 2 1 1 one stage strain softening model the strain softening model for the degradation of shear strength s u with accumulated shear strain ξ was firstly proposed by einav and randolph 2005 and has been widely used for the analysis of penetration problems associated with marine structures chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 zhou and randolph 2009a b the strain softening model is given by 1 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where ξ 95 is the accumulated absolute shear strain corresponding to a 95 reduction in soil strength δ rem is the inverse of soil sensitivity s u0 represents the undrained shear strength of soil without any disturbance strength of intact soil this simple but clear exponential relation is termed one stage strain softening model in this paper the above relation of the degradation in clay strength can be conveniently estimated from cyclic penetration tests by using the similar exponential function of eq 1 the resistance degradation model reflecting the resistance variation in penetrations or extractions can be described by 2 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m where q n is the net resistance at each penetration or extraction n is the number of cycles n 0 25 for the first penetration n 0 75 for the first extraction randolph et al 2007 n 95 rem is the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 degradation in penetration resistance δ rem cyc denotes the ratio of the resistance to the penetrometer in the fully remolded q rem and initial penetration q in that is 3 δ r e m c y c q r e m q i n the value of s t represents the ratio of the soil strength in the intact state s u0 to that in the fully remolded state s u rem and is appropriate only when the flow mechanism of soil is identical in both conditions as shown in eq 4 based on the cyclic penetration tests the degradation in the undrained shear strength of soil with the number of cycles is shown in fig 1 obviously the value of s u0 cannot be directly measured from the cyclic penetration test because the soil strength measured at initial penetration s u ini with n 0 25 is with a certain disturbance however based on the cyclic penetration tests the value of s t can be extrapolated by the curves of resistance degradation given by 4 s t s u 0 s u r e m q i n t a c t q r e m where q intact is the theoretical penetration resistance of soil without any strain history intact soil n 0 the value of q intact is greater than q in for the disturbance during initial penetration and cannot be directly measured from full flow penetrometer tests however by substituting n 0 into eq 2 the resistance ratio r 1 of q intact q in can be estimated by 5 q i n t a c t q i n r 1 δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 0 75 n 95 r e m the ratio of resistance during initial penetration to that in the fully remolded state q in q rem is inherently related to the sensitivity of soil but it is always less than its empirically calculated sensitivity for a given history of strain during initial penetration liyanapathirana 2016 by combining eqs 4 and 5 the sensitivity of soil can be rewritten as 6 s t 1 r 1 q i n q r e m 2 1 2 two stage strain softening model for structured or cemented soil the intact strength is brittle and only a small plastic shear strain is enough to destroy its initial strength given that the one stage strain softening model may underestimate the structural characteristics of soil within small shear strain range a new model was proposed by randolph et al 2007 according to it only a small plastic shear strain is needed to reduce part of the intact strength of soil while the remainder requires much larger strains to be fully remoulded zhou and randolph 2009a their strain softening model is given by 7 s u δ r e m δ s t r 1 e 3 ξ ξ 95 s t r 1 δ s t r δ r e m 1 e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where δ str is structural component of soil strength related to its intact strength and ξ 95 str is the accumulated absolute shear strain corresponding to the structural component of the soil strength by the two new parameters δ str and ξ 95 str the previous one stage exponential model is separated into two parts and thus the initial brittleness and the fully remoulded state can be both considered the model of eq 7 is termed two stage strain softening model in this paper this model was verified by hodder et al 2009 and has been used to analyze the embedment process of offshore pipelines westgate et al 2013 the two stage resistance degradation model can be developed using the decay function of eq 7 8 q n q i n δ r e m c y c δ s t r c y c 1 e 3 n 0 25 n 95 s t r 1 δ s t r c y c δ r e m c y c 1 e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m where δ str cyc is the structural component of the resistance degradation model and n 95 str is the ductility parameter of this component of soil n 95 str 0 75 was used by hodder et al 2009 the value of δ str cyc can be estimated by 9 δ s t r c y c 1 q e x t q i n where q ext is the resistance of full flow penetrometer during first extraction by reversely extending the two stage resistance degradation model the resistance ratio r 2 of q intact q in is given by 10 q i n t a c t q i n r 2 δ r e m c y c δ s t r c y c 1 e 0 75 n 95 s t r 1 δ s t r c y c δ r e m c y c 1 e 0 75 n 95 r e m based on eqs 4 and 10 the sensitivity of soil can be estimated by 11 s t 2 r 2 q i n q r e m 2 1 3 enhanced exponential strain softening model as the initial slope in the one stage strain softening model is too moderate to adequately reflect the results of field tests the enhanced exponential strain softening model was proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 its strain softening model is given by 12 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 2 3 s u 0 based on the decay function of eq 12 the relation of resistance degradation can be written as 13 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 as a limitation of the functional form of eq 13 q intact q in cannot be directly estimated by extending the curves of resistance degradation pinkert and klar 2015 however based on the decay function of eq 12 the value of q in n 0 25 can be written as 14 q i n q r e m q i n t a c t q r e m e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 as a result the resistance ratio r e of q intact q in can be given by 15 q i n t a c t q i n r e δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m 2 3 based on eqs 4 and 15 the sensitivity of soil is estimated as 16 s t e r e q i n q r e m 2 2 comparison of strain softening models compared to one stage strain softening model the two stage model was proposed for soil undergoing a relatively large disturbance owing to initial penetration of full flow penetrometer the enhanced exponential strain softening model adds a parameter 2 3 to regulate the slope of the degradation in strength pinkert and klar 2015 to compare the existing strain softening models the results of four cyclic penetration tests on different soils were selected three sets of data were the results of cyclic t bar tests on marine clay from scs ren et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and the another one was from the results of cyclic ball bar tests in amherst massachusetts pinkert and klar 2015 to intuitively estimate the value of n 95 rem an intermediate parameter p resis n percentage of resistance degradation with number of cycles n is proposed to reflect the rate of resistance degradation the value of p resis n can be given by 17 p r e s i s n q i n q n q i n q r e m 100 the percentage of resistance degradation for the results of different tests are shown in fig 2 the horizontal dashed line represents a 95 reduction in resistance and the estimated values of n 95 rem are summarized in table 1 comparisons between different relations of resistance degradation and the test results are shown in fig 3 a d in general different models had particular soils to which they were applicable for the test results of amherst soil as shown in fig 3 a the one stage model cannot well predict the resistances during the first few penetration and extraction cycles this is because its initial slope is too moderate pinkert and klar 2015 zhou and randolph 2009a on the contrary for the clay from the scs shown in fig 3 b d the one stage resistance degradation model compared better to the test results than the two stage model or the exponential model a similar results exists in the other two models the structural parameters in the two stage model not well reflect the soil with slow rate of strain softening in fig 3 b d the enhanced exponential model featured higher softening rate and was appropriate for the selected clays in fig 3 a however as this model does not build a connection between the initial structure of soil such as in terms of the parameter δ str cyc in the two stage strain softening model and the state near fully remoulded the rate of strain softening still be overestimated for the clay from the scs as a result finding a strain softening model that can be applied to all soils is worth further investigation based on different strain softening models the estimated values of q intact q in and s t are shown in table 1 the case of amherst soil is the only one to have a directly measured s t the estimated sensitivities from the three models are obviously different the enhanced exponential model gives the best prediction of the value of s t the one stage strain softening model was underestimated the value of s t whereas the two stage model overestimated it while for scs clays soil sensitivities were overestimated both by the two stage model and the enhanced exponential strain softening model this is because the rate of strain softening is overestimated shown in fig 3 b d 3 optimized exponential strain softening model as analyzed above the three prevalent models can reflect the strain softening behavior of soil to some extent but still have problems in balancing the initial brittleness and the fully remoulded state for some soils based on the basic parameters q in q rem q ext and n 95 cyc from cyclic penetration tests the purpose is to build a novel strain softening model which can better reflects the strain softening characteristic of marine clays the proposed optimized exponential strain softening model is similar to the enhance exponential model given by 18 s u δ r e m 1 δ r e m e 3 ξ ξ 95 β s u 0 where parameter β is used to reflect the structural component of soil strength the value of β is related to the values of q ext q in and q rem q in during cyclic penetration tests the degradation in penetration resistance can be represented by the decay function of eq 18 19 q n q i n δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 n 0 25 n 95 r e m β 3 1 selected cyclic penetration tests to verify the model to investigate the performance of the optimized exponential strain softening model 20 cyclic penetration tests from different clays were selected the selected test data are shown in table 2 of them to avoid the influence of the shape of the probe t bar or ball bar 16 sets of data were from cyclic t bar tests cheuk and white 2011 nian et al 2017 ren et al 2019 sahdi et al 2014 wang et al 2018 and four from cyclic ball bar tests yafrate et al 2009 most of the cyclic t bar tests 14 results were on marine clays from the scs nian et al 2017 ren et al 2019 wang et al 2018 the remaining two sets of data one was from the centrifuge test on kaolin clay at the university of western australia denoted by uwa kl sahdi et al 2014 the other was from the results of tests on high plasticity marine clay from west africa denoted by wa hp cheuk and white 2011 3 2 estimation of the parameter β by introducing the parameter β the optimized exponential strain softening model can reflect both the initial brittleness of soil by q ext q in and its fully remolded state by δ rem cyc the optimized values of β for each test result are shown in fig 4 based on the results of the 20 cyclic penetration tests a relation was built to estimate β using q ext q in and q rem q in i e δ rem cyc and is given by 20 β 0 89 q e x t q i n 0 41 δ r e m c y c 0 23 the estimated values of β in a range of 0 5 0 92 for selected soils according to eq 20 were consistent with the optimal solutions for each test result r2 0 856 based on the results of the selected cyclic penetration test results the parameters used in the proposed relations of resistance degradation are summarized in table 2 of these parameters the value of n 95 rem was directly estimated by eq 17 comparisons between the optimized exponential resistance degradation model by eq 19 and the test results are shown in fig 5 a d it can be seen that the proposed model was satisfactorily consistent with all test results 3 3 estimating strain softening parameters of clay while the relations of resistance degradation can reflect the strain softening of soil to some extent some prominent difference as shown in fig 6 still occurs in the relation between the strain softening corrected curve and the resistance degradation due to the disturbance in the first penetration of a penetrometer the rate of the strength degradation would be underestimated if directly estimated by the relation of resistance degradation the values of δ rem cyc and n 95 rem in the resistance degradation model were usually larger than those of δ rem and ξ 95 in the strain softening model therefore the relations of resistance degradation need to be modified to reflect the real strain softening behaviour for the proposed model the parameters requiring further modification include s t ξ 95 and s u0 3 3 1 estimating soil sensitivity s t based on the proposed model the estimation of soil sensitivity is similar to that in the enhanced exponential strain softening model in eq 15 accordingly the resistance ratio r 0 of q intact q in is given by 21 q i n t a c t q i n r o δ r e m c y c 1 δ r e m c y c e 3 0 25 n 95 r e m β as a result based on eqs 4 and 21 the sensitivity of soil is estimated by 22 s t o r o q i n q r e m the estimated values of s t for all the selected data are summarized in table 2 for the results of cyclic penetration tests from the sets in onsoy novato amherst and gloucester the sensitivities of soil the value in brackets in table 2 were measured by field vane tests fvts dejong et al 2010b by comparison it is easy to see that the estimated values of s t by eq 22 were close to the empirical values except for the soil in gloucester that was highly sensitive s t 68 measured by fvt therefore the estimated sensitivities were reliable for marine clay for which are usually less than 20 0 nian et al 2017 wang et al 2018 3 3 2 estimating ductility parameter the ductility parameter ξ 95 can be theoretically estimated by the average shear strain per passage of the penetrometer einav and randolph 2005 and is given by 23 ξ 95 2 n 95 ξ p where n 95 represents the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 reduction in soil strength and ξ p is the theoretical average shear strain per passage of the penetrometer based on the analysis by pinkert and klar 2015 the value of ξ p can be estimated by 24 ξ p t b a r 0 83 log s t 3 09 25 ξ p b a l l b a r 1 1 log s t 2 62 to directly estimate the value of n 95 an intermediate parameter p su n the percentage of strength degradation in the nth cycle is proposed combined with eq 21 the value of p su n is described by 26 p s u n q i n t a c t q n q i n t a c t q r e m r o q n q i n r o q r e m q i n the value of n 95 can be easily obtained just by drawing a curve between p su n by eq 26 and n the estimated values of n 95 for different soils are also summarized in table 2 by comparison with the value of n 95 rem estimated from the resistance degradation used in pinkert and klar 2015 and yafrate et al 2009 the rate of strain softening may be underestimated in previous studies the study found that the estimated values of n 95 have 8 0 80 0 difference the average value was 27 2 smaller than n 95 rem for the selected soils the maximum difference for the value of n 95 smaller than n 95 rem was 2 5 i e 58 8 for marine clay in the set scs s8 2 to estimate the value of n 95 yafrate et al 2009 proposed a relation between the value of n 95 and the sensitivity of soil that is 27 n 95 9 6 s t 0 27 as the value of n 95 is related to both the initial ductility q ext q in and fully state q rem q in of the soil the method estimated by soil sensitivities s t alone i e eq 27 proposed by yafrate et al 2009 may not applicable to all soils especially for those soil with small ductility parameter n 95 a comparison between the estimated values of n 95 from eq 27 and the results by the proposed method eq 26 are shown in fig 7 as a result eq 26 is suggested in the field tests which have a certain physical meaning i e the number of cycles corresponding to a 95 strength degradation taking two test results from the soil in south china sea as example the comparison between the model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 and the optimized exponential strain softening model is shown in fig 8 as depicted in fig 8 a the degradation of resistance might be slightly underestimated like scs s7a 3 soil or overestimated like scs rem 4 soil for the model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 as a result the soil sensitivity and ductility parameter n 95 would be overestimated scs rem 4 soil or underestimated scs s7a 3 soil the proposed model in this study has better fitting results comparison for the least square error lse in fig 8 a by pinkert and klar 2015 and this study the value of lse decreased from 0 011 to 0 004 for soil from scs s7a 3 and 0 035 to 0 005 for soil from scs rem 4 the difference for the obtained strain softening models are shown in fig 8 b for the cyclic penetration test results from different clays the strain softening models are shown in fig 9 a d from which it is clear that the optimized exponential strain softening model agreed well with the test results 3 3 3 estimating intact undrained shear strength s u0 the estimation of the intact soil strength is important for sensitive clay in most cases the value of s u0 is roughly estimated through dividing the initial penetration resistance by a consistent bearing factor n c such as in boylan et al 2011 hossain et al 2011 however it may lead to an underestimation of the soil strength for sensitive clay from eq 21 under the conditions of strain softening s u0 can be estimated by the value of q intact as 28 s u 0 q i n t a c t n c r o q in n c for the t bar penetrometer according to the closed form expression of the exact plasticity solutions martin and randolph 2006 the value of n c t can be estimated by 29 n c t π 2 δ 2 cos δ 4 cos δ 2 sin δ 2 where δ sin 1 α α is the friction ratio of the t bar or ball bar penetrometer and α δ rem 1 s t for the ball bar penetrometer based on the results of ldfe analysis zhou et al 2013 the bearing factor n c ball can be estimated as 30 n c b a l l 10 65 4 5 α depending on the friction ratio of the t bar or ball bar penetrometer the value of n c t ranges from 9 14 to 11 99 and that of n c ball ranges from 11 to 15 3 boylan et al 2011 martin and randolph 2006 constant values of 10 5 n c t bar and 13 n c ball bar were used based on past work taukoor and rutherford 2016 4 an application of the optimized exponential strain softening model on predicting pipe penetration behavior based on the formulas proposed and discussed previously the parameters δ rem ξ 95 and s u0 in the proposed optimized exponential strain softening model can be obtained from the cyclic penetration tests the parameter β can be estimated by the directly measured values of δ rem cyc i e q rem q in and q ext q in the value of β in the proposed strain softening model may have an obvious effect on the soil structure interaction behavior focus on this point a large deformation finite element ldfe model is built to simulate the process of pipe penetration considering the strain softening of clay as shown in fig 10 the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel technique in abaqus explicit is used in the analysis to solve the large soil deformation during the pipe penetration the diameter of the pipe used in the numerical simulation is 0 5 m due to symmetry half of the pipe model is built and set as a lagrangian rigid body the soil is set as eulerian deformable body one element is taken in the thickness direction the entire mesh extends downward to a distance of 14d a void layer is set above the soil surface to allow the soil to flow into the empty euler elements two in plane faces are fixed in the thickness directions the bottom boundary nodes are constrained against moving in three directions the lateral boundary nodes are constrained against moving in the lateral direction the upper soil surface is set as free the penetration velocity of the pipe is set as d 20 s i e 0 025 m s a frictionless contact is defined for the interaction between the pipe and the soil four cases are investigated case i is under the condition of no strain softening as the value of β in a range of 0 5 1 0 from the above study cases ii iv correspond to β 1 0 one stage strain softening model proposed by einav and randolph 2005 2 3 enhanced exponential strain softening model proposed by pinkert and klar 2015 and 0 5 in the optimized strain softening model eq 18 the strain softening relations are shown by fig 11 a and are implemented into abaqus by user defined subroutine vusdfld written in fortran typical values of δ rem 0 2 ξ 95 15 are used for all the cases with strain softening the value of undrained young s modulus and poisson s ratio are e u 300s u and μ 0 495 respectively the soil strength is set as s u0 3 kpa based on a constant value of γ 6 kn m3 the initially stress field is applied on the soil domain at the first step of the analysis based on the numerical simulation results the bearing factors q pipe s u0 with the normalized penetration depth z d are shown in fig 11 b for case i under no strain softening the value of q pipe s u0 from the numerical simulation has a good agreement with that in randolph and houlsby 1984 as the cases ii iv are with strain softening the value of q pipe s u0 are obviously smaller than that in case i up to 46 9 under β 0 5 compared with the widely used one stage strain softening model β 1 0 the value of q pipe s u0 under β 2 3 and β 0 5 is smaller than that with β 1 0 about 12 3 and 22 8 respectively the softening coefficient s u s u0 for the different cases are shown in fig 12 the degree of strain softening for the soil increases with the decrease of β which may explain the effect of β on the pipe penetration resistance as a result a constant value of β may overestimate the bearing resistance of the pipeline in the field if consider the strain softening of clay estimating an appropriate value of β from cyclic penetration tests eq 20 is of practical significances 5 conclusions the study presents the results of a refinement on well established strength degradation models for sensitive marine clays that are used in connection with full flow penetrometers three earlier strain softening models were used to fit the 20 cyclic penetration test results from different clays and the results show that the existing models have difficulties in balancing the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state therefore an optimized exponential strain softening model was proposed which features a parameter β in a range of 0 5 0 92 for selected soils to reflect both the initial brittleness of soil and its fully remolded state the fitting results on the 20 cyclic penetration tests indicated that the optimized exponential model showed good coincidence with all test results the novel strain softening model provide significant improvements over existing models in modeling the decay of undrained shear strength in sensitive soils the estimated values of s t coincided well with the results from fvt for the ductility parameter n 95 of soil in the strain softening model a new method by the percentage of strength degradation p su n in eq 26 was proposed to better estimate the value of n 95 the research showed that n 95 was usually overestimated by the relations of resistance degradation an average difference was 27 2 for the selected 20 test soils and the maximum difference was 58 8 for marine clay from south china sea this would lead to an underestimation of the rate of strain softening finally based on the cyclic penetration test results a detailed procedure to estimate the parameters s t ξ 95 and s u0 in the optimized exponential strain softening model was presented which may be of some values for engineering practices the ldfe method was used to investigate the value of β in the optimized exponential strain softening model on the process of pipe penetration for the value of β in a range of 0 5 1 0 a maximum difference of 22 8 was founded between the proposed strain softening and that widely used one stage strain softening model during the estimation of the pipe resistance as a result estimating an appropriate value of β from cyclic penetration tests is of practical significances credit authorship contribution statement yunrui han conceptualization

21376,some artificial reefs ars have experienced an initial settlement primarily owing to their collision to the seabed during an installation process particularly by a free fall this study presents a numerical estimation of the seabed settlement of a box type artificial reef during the initial installation for the purpose the following works were implemented first a cube type ar was selected because of its typical free fall installation procedure its facilitate volume 67 4 in korean coastal waters and accumulated statistics showing severe seabed settlement second numerical flow analyses were carried out to estimate the terminal velocities and distances of the ar in water in this stage four different incident angles were considered to calculate drag coefficients of the ar finally numerical collision analyses were conducted to investigate the settlement characteristics of the seabed soils for the analyses three seabed soils saturated sand saturated sand and gravel and saturated sand and clay were considered from the collision analysis it is the saturated sand and clay composition to invoke higher settlement and accordingly higher loss of the effective useable volume up to 25 5 at 45 therefore it is recommended to avoid the seabed of any clay composition when we install artificial reefs during the free fall installation keywords artificial reefs initial installation seabed settlement flow analysis collision analysis 1 introduction artificial reefs ars have been installed on the seabed to facilitate their intended purposes such as reducing beach erosion protecting marine habitats and providing recreational fishing and diving sites bortone 2011 kim et al 2008b 2019 becker et al 2020 le et al 2020 lee et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 recently the sizes of ars become bigger and their structural types become more complicated primarily owing to the increase in material development project scale and budget baine 2001 woo et al 2014 lee et al 2018 lemoine et al 2019 owing to the large geometrical scales the current ars especially constructed by steel frames and plates have structural issues e g stress concentration in the joints in addition to the conventional stability issues such as sliding overturning scour and settlement harris 2009 manoukian et al 2011 yoon et al 2016 yun and kim 2018 those engineering issues above are mainly concerned for the ars which are well fabricated in a systematic engineering aspect in some asian countries e g china japan and korea because of their relatively expensive fabrication cost however those issues are not closely concerned for ars made of wasting materials unless relevant environmental issues are not invoked a representative environmental issue associated with sliding horizontal movement occurred to the ars constructed by the un ballasted tire bundles which were deployed at approximately 1 8 km offshore of florida sherman and spieler 2006 the tires failed lost their substrates by even normal currents have since moved extensively traveling kilometers from their original locations to beaches and deeper waters offshore and accordingly have physically damaged benthic reef fauna on natural reefs lindberg and seaman 2011 thus the stability of ars and their environmental impact on marine flora and fauna have been considered the major issues in the ar society and community most ars are installed on the seabed using a free fall or a guided way such as divers wires and cables korea fisheries resources agency fira recommends the use of cables when ars are installed yoon et al 2016 however relatively cheap or small ars e g 2 m 2 m 2 m box type ar can be installed by a free fall procedure from a vessel in both cases the installation procedure is important because the ars usually settle down into the seabed owing to their weights kim et al 2010 manoukian et al 2011 this initial and then following long term settlement becomes clear in an intensively stacked placement of ars with multiple layers kim et al 2014a 2014b moreover initial settlement becomes more evident if ars are installed via intensive stacking thus featuring collisions between an already installed ar and a new falling ar these collisions accelerate the settlement of ars yoon et al 2016 the settlement of ars has not been widely reported because of the lack of interest and recognition of the serious yoon et al 2016 reported the buried depths from 0 to 1 0 m of nine cube type ars inspected by divers in coastal waters near busan the second largest city in south korea by proposing effective useable and burial volume of ars they emphasized the buried depth of each ar set and their effects on the loss of effective useable volume which is not desirable to recruit marine flora and fauna kim et al 2010 also reported that the cube type ars on soft seafloors have been settled down 1 9 m or 2 4 m in coastal waters near goheung in south korea and estimated that those ars have lost 50 of their roles other studies e g kim 2001 yoon and kim 2001 investigated the effect of water flows and waves on ar settlement but these did not indicate the actual settlement of the target ars the previous studies are all concerned with the long term settlement of ars however as mentioned earlier some ars experience an initial settlement primarily owing to their collision to the seabed during an installation process particularly by a free fall in this case collision analysis should be carried out to estimate the settlement this analysis can be done by a field test lab scale experiment and numerical work the first case should be the most desirable to investigate the phenomenon but it is hard and expensive to carry out a collision in water the second one is relatively reasonable but it is also difficult to not only idealize a seabed condition but also facilitate a deep water depth the experimental result is solely dependent on how the seabed soil and water depth are simulated the last one is relatively easy to simulate however it is not easy to obtain a reasonable seabed material model this study presents a numerical estimation of seabed settlement during the initial installation of a box type artificial reef for the purpose the following works are implemented first a cube type ar was selected because it has been installed through a free fall procedure from a vessel on the water near 139 413 ha 1394 km2 in korean coastal water from 1971 to 2013 kim et al 2017 which account for 64 5 of the total area and 67 4 of the total facility volume kim et al 2016b these statistics illustrates the popularity of the cube type ars in south korea primarily due to their simple shape good workability and relatively low cost in addition as reported by kim et al 2010 and yoon et al 2016 these ars have experienced settlements in coastal waters in south korea hence it is worthy to investigate how the initial settlement comes out owing to the free fall process second numerical flow analyses were carried out to estimate terminal velocities and distances of the ar in water in this stage four different incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 of the ar were considered to calculate their drag coefficients for the flow analyses the so called element based finite volume method ebfvm was used and a general purpose cfd software package ansys cfx was facilitated once obtained the drag coefficients which are dependent on the incident angle of the target ar the terminal velocities were obtained by solving the equation of motion then these terminal velocities were used in collision analyses finally numerical collision analyses were conducted to investigate the settlement characteristics of the seabed soils in this stage along with the four different incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 of the ar and accordingly the four different terminal velocities three seabed soils saturated sand saturated sand and gravel and saturated sand and clay were considered for the collision analyses a general purpose collision analysis software package ansys autodyn was facilitated the scope and method of this study are summarized in fig 1 the hypotheses and limitations of this study are as follows first because the material models of the seabed soils are the most critical for the collision analysis we selected the cu arl clemson university army research lab sand model grujicic and bell 2011 and its extension for sandy clay grujicic et al 2009 and sandy gravel soils grujicic et al 2008a which have been validated used by several other applications in other words only three seabed soils which are composed of saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 were considered for the numerical collision analyses second because of the primary concern of the study estimating the initial settlement of the seabed soils under the free fall installation procedure with the three different incident angles it is not a major concern of the material model of the target structure cube type ar and accordingly its failure thus we only pinpointed the high stressed structural members of the ar which was modeled by the rht concrete model according to the collision third the terminal velocities and distances of the cube type ar were obtained by only considering three longitudinal external forces such as the weight of the cube type ar buoyancy and drag force in other words the other forces such as current water flow to the transverse directions were not considered to obtain the terminal values finally to get the drag coefficients we only considered pressure form drag because of the blunt shape of the target structure it was assumed that the friction drag is negligible in comparison to the pressure drag 2 materials and methods 2 1 cube type ar fig 2 shows the cube type ar considered in this study the ars are made from concrete and steel reinforcing bars with a size of 2 m l 2 m b 2 m h an apparent facility volume of 8 m3 and a weight of 33 34 kn 3 4 ton jung et al 2016 the thickness of the horizontal and vertical members is all 0 25 m it is known that these ars are suitable for fisheries and the protection of migratory fish due to the relatively large void at each surface kim et al 2014a to facilitate a convenient analysis without affecting the settlement results the original ar shape is modified by excluding the four triangular corners at each side as shown in fig 2b 2 2 drag coefficient pressure drag and friction drag are significant in determining the total drag force acting on the underwater body hasanloo et al 2012 woo et al 2014 woo and na 2014 such as ars considering an example of the pressure drag flow over a flat plate normal to the flow the total drag is equal to the pressure drag because the wall shear stress is perpendicular to the flow direction and therefore does not contribute to the drag force in the case the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 1 here p is the pressure caused by flow a is the frontal area or projected area of the object ρ w is the water density and v is the flow velocity in general the drag coefficient is a function of reynolds number re 1 c d s u r f a c e p d a 1 2 ρ w v 2 for this geometry the flow separates from the edges of the plate and there is back flow recirculating flow in the low energy wake of the plate this recirculating flow is important to ars because it generates the so called wake region usually behind of the ars and a larger wake region can better provide a larger spreading area of seaweed spores and an energy saving sheltering feeding stopover and or spawning space for fish and shellfish lee et al 2020 it should be noted that the drag coefficient for all objects with a sharp edge is essentially independent of reynolds number for re 1000 because of the separation points and accordingly the size of the wake is fixed by the geometry of the object fox et al 2004 therefore we assumed that the drag coefficients of the box type ar are independent of reynolds number according to the sharp edges relevant works also showed that drag coefficients of ars with sharp edges did not vary with respect to inlet velocities and accordingly reynolds numbers e g kim et al 2014a woo et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 to verify this assumption we considered several inlet velocities in the following flow analysis section in addition because the ar is installing normally to the flow direction we assumed that pressure drag is the major one contributing drag coefficient thus eq 1 is used in the study for the geometry of the box type ar the flow separates from the edges of the members there is backflow in the low energy wake of each member although the pressure over the rear surface of each member is essentially constant its magnitude may not be determined analytically fox et al 2004 thus the numerical flow analysis is resorted to determine the drag coefficients of the cube type ar with several incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 woo et al 2014 carried out similar flow analyses to obtain the drag coefficients of 24 ars that are already installed on the seabed as illustrated in fig 3 a consider the free fall installation procedure of the ar in the study the procedure obtaining the pressure drag can be illustrated in fig 3b 2 3 terminal velocities and terminal distances the motion of the object cube type ar can be described as eq 2 by newton s second law of motion here w is the gravitational force applied to the cube type ar f b is the buoyant force f d is the drag force m s is the mass of the ar g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and v is the velocity of the cube type ar accordingly eq 2 becomes eq 3 here m w is the water mass ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient of the ar and a is the projected area of the ar which depends on the incident angle θ see fig 3b terminal velocity is the highest velocity which is attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid in fluid dynamics an object is moving at its terminal velocity when its speed is constant due to the restraining force exerted when the velocity remains constant i e the acceleration d v d t is zero in eq 3 the terminal velocity can be obtained as shown in eq 4 here ρ s is the density of the ar 2314 kg m 3 and v is the volume 1 25 m3 of the ar 2 f y w f b f d m s d v d t 3 m s g m w g 1 2 c d ρ w a v 2 m s d v d t 4 v t ρ s ρ w ρ w 2 g v c d a eq 3 is a nonlinear nonhomogeneous constant coefficients and first order ordinary differential equation this equation can be solved by the separation of variables with the initial velocity i e v 0 0 which indicates free fall thus the falling collision velocity v t of the ar can be expressed as eq 5 5 v t v t tanh ρ s ρ w ρ s g v t t considering the initial distance i e y 0 0 and integrating eq 5 the falling collision distance can be obtained as shown in eq 6 6 y t ρ s ρ s ρ w v t 2 g ln cosh ρ s ρ w ρ s g v t t 2 4 methods in flow analyses to obtain the terminal velocities of the target ar with the incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 their drag coefficients are required thus flow analyses were carried out to obtain pressure field around the ar using the so called ebfvm a cfd method which has been effective in various engineering applications such as airplanes pipelines and artificial reefs gylys et al 2012 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b to facilitate the ebfvm ansys cfx was used ansys inc 2012 the flow field domain was constructed as 20 m l 20 m b 20 m h and the ar was located at the center of the domain as shown in fig 4 the domain size was determined to be 10 times the ar size so that enough spaces were assigned between the boundaries and ar surfaces the boundary conditions as also shown in fig 4 are an inlet outlet and symmetry at the inlet we considered several inlet velocities e g 1 2 and 3 m s 1 and found no significant variation in cd values within the range as other studies also found e g kim et al 2014a woo et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 this is because fully developed turbulent regimes begun at the initial stage i e the reynolds numbers of these reefs are in the self modeling region jiang et al 2016 at the outlet a zero pressure gradient was applied to get the inflow fluid flow out through the outlet the side faces x and z planes were assumed to be symmetric planes to minimize the boundary effect on the flow domain to precise the flow analysis results hexahedrons with 8 nodes were used as the elements the maximum element size near the ar was determined as 0 044 m and the maximum element size far from the ar was controlled as 0 22 m to ensure the elements quality we calculated orthogonal quality oq and skewness skw of the elements ansys inc 2012 and found that the average oq was very good 0 75 0 95 and the average skw was excellent 0 00 0 25 through the flow analysis the following hypotheses are made first the water is incompressible viscous and newtonian second the water temperature is 25 c water density is 1000 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity is 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 finally sst shear stress transport k ω model proposed by menter 1994 is applicable to express the turbulence here sst k ω model combines the k ω and k ε models the first is used to model the inner region of the boundary layer and the second to model the region of free shear flow 2 5 ar material model as mentioned earlier the cube type ar is made from concrete and steel reinforcing bars this study focuses on the seabed settlement during the ar installation and accordingly it is a reasonable simplicity not to consider steel reinforcing bars in the ar model in general concrete has a non linear compression behavior owing to the inhomogeneity and porosity of the material thus we considered the rht concrete model which was proposed by riedel et al 1999 the rht concrete model has been widely used for damage analysis of concrete in events of transient dynamic forces such as collision and explosion riedel et al 1999 2009 ding et al 2013 hu et al 2016 abdel kader 2019 in transient dynamic analysis an equation of state strength equation failure equation and erosion criteria are required to express a material characteristic the rht concrete model is composed of a p α equation of state rht strength equation rht failure equation and erosion criteria based on geometric distortion tu and lu 2009 in the rht failure model damage level d is expressed in terms of the accumulated plastic strain and the equivalent plastic strain at failure thus the fracture strength is interpolated from the strength values for the undamaged material d 0 at failure surface and the completely damaged material d 1 table 1 shows the associated material properties and constants which were adapted from woo et al 2015 2 6 seabed material model the seabed soil is composed of a variety of materials such as sand clay silt gravel etc the seabed soil is a very complicated material because of the profound effect of particle sizes particle size distributions and the water content on the soil properties a compaction model was proposed by laine and sandvik 2001 to represent a material with porosity for collision analysis however this model was developed fundamentally for dry sand thus the compaction model cannot represent the effect of moisture clay and gravel in soil grujicic and bell 2011 to solve the problem clemson university cu and army research laboratory arl of the usa developed parameterized a new sand model that was named the cu arl sand model to parameterize the cu arl sand model several researchers carried out experiments for obtaining dynamic responses of sand at different saturation e g chapman et al 2006 bragov et al 2008 grujicic et al 2008c grujicic and bell 2011 this sand model is capable of capturing the effect of moisture on the dynamic behavior of sand it should be emphasized here that the cu arl model has been widely used in estimating high strain rate material behavior including the structure and mine installed in the ground grujicic et al 2007 2008a 2008b 2009 grujicic and bell 2011 the accuracy of the model was demonstrated by comparing the experimental values with the numerical analysis results grujicic and bell 2011 consequently the cu arl sand model and its extensions to sandy clay and sandy gravel were facilitated in this study it should be emphasized here that the cu arl sand model contains all the basic components needed in a soil model and the cu arl clay laden sand and cu arl sandy gravel models are merely extensions of the cu arl sand model by accounting for the effects of the clay and gravel respectively because those cu arl models are well explained in the literature e g grujicic and bell 2011 we give a brief overview of the cu arl sand model here the cu arl sand model is composed of four components a sand equation of state b sand strength model c sand failure model p m i n failure model and d sand erosion model based on geometric distortion grujicic and bell 2011 based on those components piece wise linear representations of the three material relations are given in tables 2 4 for the saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 respectively grujicic and bell 2011 in the tables the mo granular strength model is an extension of the drucker prager model that takes into account effects associated with granular materials such as sand ansys inc 2020 the model represents pressure hardening density hardening and variations in the shear modulus with density the descriptions above the cu arl sand model deal with essentially clay free and gravel free sand and the contents incorporate the effect of moisture grujicic and bell 2011 also described the extensions of this model to account for the effects of clay and gravel i e the cu arl clay laden sand model grujicic et al 2009 and the cu arl sandy gravel model grujicic et al 2008a these extensions maintain the basic mathematical formulations of the equation of state the strength failure and erosion models while making some of the key cu arl functions of the clay and gravel contents and their average particle sizes 2 7 methods in collision analyses an experimental approach provides a relatively accurate response of a structure in the event of a collision yoon and na 2013 however to obtain a reasonable experimental result the velocity of the falling structure the cub type ar relating with the water environment e g water depth should be well simulated and the response of the seabed occurring within a very short time should be well measured consequently an explicit dynamic finite element analysis is another option to get the response and collision characteristic however it is also not easy to get a reasonable result because of the ambiguous material properties of the target seabed soils moreover the material model of the target structure should be well established han 2016 to get reasonable explicit dynamic analysis results as described in the previous sections we used the rht concrete model for the ar and cu arl sand model and its extensions clay laden sand model and sandy gavel model for the seabed soils these models were facilitated by ansys autodyn ansys inc 2020 fig 5 shows the geometrical models of the cube type ar the seabed and their initial and boundary conditions for collision analyses except for those material models the ar geometrical model for the collision analyses proceeded in the same standard as the flow analysis mesh size was determined 0 05 m in the hexahedron elements the length l width w and height h of the seabed were selected as 8 m 8m and 2 m respectively for the seabed model the maximum element size in the internal space which occupies the space of 1 5 m 1 5 m with respect to the centerline was determined by 0 05 m and the other elements were constructed as 0 2 m the boundaries left right and bottom of the seabed are restrained as u x 0 u y 0 and u z 0 which means the horizontal vertical and out of plane displacements are zero in addition the initial velocity was assumed the terminal velocity v t 0 v t and the initial position of the ar is assumed 0 03 m above the seabed y t 0 0 3 m to save the computational time the first assumption might be reasonable if the terminal distances critical water depths to reach the terminal velocities are smaller than the water depths usually 28 32 m for the box type ar kim et al 2008a 2008b at the target sites fig 6 shows the gauge points for the settlement measurement of the seabed the gauge points when the ar collides on the seabed without any inclination i e θ 0 fig 6a and the gauge points when the ar collides on the seabed with the incident angles i e θ 15 30 or 45 fig 6b because the first model fig 6a is symmetric with respect to the centerline the settlement is expected to be symmetric and accordingly only 8 gauge points are allocated in contrast the second model fig 6b is not symmetric with respect to the centerline hence 12 gauge points are prepared it should be noted here that the gauge points all locate in the x y midplane of the ar and the vertical values y 0 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m indicate the distances below the baseline y 0 0 m respectively 3 analysis results 3 1 flow analysis results from the flow analysis results it is found that the drag coefficients c d are 1 40 1 14 1 13 and 1 29 respectively when the ar is being installed at the incident angles θ 0 15 30 and 45 the corresponding terminal velocities are calculated as 3 627 m s 1 θ 0 c d 1 40 3 048 m s 1 θ 15 c d 1 14 2 890 m s 1 θ 30 c d 1 13 and 2 881 m s 1 θ 45 c d 1 29 respectively see fig 7 the terminal velocity v t vs time curve the corresponding terminal distances come out 9 680 m θ 0 6 708 m θ 15 5 984 m θ 30 and 5 939 m θ 45 respectively 3 2 collision analysis results for settlement estimation fig 8 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 100 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 9 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point among the four incident angles the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 m s 1 the seabed protuberates at the center of the ar fig 8a and the maximum settlement is 0 107 m at g5 fig 9a in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 m s 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 8b and the maximum displacement is 0 208 m at g9 fig 9b at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements dy are almost zero at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and finally become constant it is also shown that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 22 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 066 m and the settlement at g9 decreases to 0 203 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 m s 1 the seabed is pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence and it protuberates at the center of the seabed fig 8c and each settlement remains constant after 0 4 s and the maximum settlement is 0 369 m at g9 fig 9c in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 m s 1 the seabed is also pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence fig 8d because of the symmetric geometry of the ar colliding into the seabed this case also shows the symmetric dy patterns as shown in fig 8d and some vertical displacement histories overlap as shown in fig 9d the maximum settlement is 0 51 m at g1 as illustrated in fig 9d fig 10 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is also observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 11 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point among the four cases the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 m s 1 the seabed protuberates at the center of the ar fig 10a and the maximum settlement is 0 016 m at g5 at g4 and g8 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements are almost zero indicating that the collision does not have a considerable effect on the gauge points fig 11a in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 m s 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 10b and the maximum displacement is 0 135 m at g9 at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline the displacements are almost negligible i e less effect from the collision fig 11b at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and then become constant it is also shown that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 22 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 047 m and the settlement at g9 decreases to 0 133 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 m s 1 the seabed is pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence and it protuberates at the center of the seabed fig 10c it is found that the angle between the ar and seabed decreases after the collision in other words the initial colliding angle decreases owing to the interaction between the ar and the seabed according to the corresponding time history fig 11c the maximum settlement is 0 183 m at g9 we can observe the secondary collision approximately at 0 59 s at g5 accordingly the settlement increases to 0 013 m in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 m s 1 the initial colliding angle 45 is maintained after the collision fig 10d the seabed around the ar protuberates slightly and the maximum protrusion is 0 021 m at g5 and g9 fig 11d it is found that the maximum settlement is 0 258 m at g1 it should be noted that the settlements at g5 g6 g7 and g8 are overlapped with those at g9 g10 g11 and g12 as shown in fig 11d because of the colliding geometry 45 and accordingly the symmetric response to the collision fig 12 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 85 and clay 15 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is also observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 13 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point these displacements are larger than those of the other soil compositions i e the saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 composition and saturated sand 100 composition among the four angles the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 ms 1 the seabed slightly rises at the center of the ar fig 12a and the maximum settlement is 0 436 m at g5 fig 13a at g4 and g8 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements are relatively negligible i e no significant influence from the collision scenario in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 ms 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 12b and the maximum displacement is 0 576 m at g9 fig 13b at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline the vertical displacements dy are relatively negligible i e less effect from the collision at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and then become constant it is also observed that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 17 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 283 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 ms 1 the angle between the ar and seabed is maintained fig 12c unlike the case in fig 10c it is shown that the protrusion occurs at the center of the seabed however the protrusion settles down slightly after 0 40 s as shown in fig 13c in other words the seabed rises at g5 g6 g7 and g8 until 0 4 s due to the first or primary collision then after 0 4 s the seabed settles down owing to the second collision the maximum settlement is 0 85 m at g9 in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 ms 1 as well the initial colliding angle 45 is maintained after the collision fig 12d it is shown from the displacement history fig 13d that the soils at g9 or g5 and g12 or g8 protuberate until 0 4 s due to the primary collision and then the rises slightly settle down it is found that the maximum settlement is 1 01 m at g1 it should be noted that the displacements at g5 g6 g7 and g8 are overlapped with those at g9 g10 g11 and g12 as shown in fig 13d because of the colliding geometry 45 and accordingly symmetric response to the collision 3 3 correlation between the seabed settlements and ar stresses fig 14 shows the maximum von mises stresses of the cube type ar according to the colliding angles and soil compositions and their correlations with the corresponding displacements dy of the seabed soils fig 15 shows the von mises stress contours of the ar according to the total of 12 combinations it is observed from fig 14a i e θ 0 that the maximum von mises stresses are 30 8 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 33 8 mpa saturated sand 100 and 38 2 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the left and right corners as shown in fig 15a in the case of θ 15 fig 14b the maximum von mises stresses are 13 3 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 15 8 mpa saturated sand 100 and 19 7 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the contact area as shown in fig 15b in the case of θ 30 fig 14c that the maximum von mises stresses are 15 5 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 17 6 mpa saturated sand 100 and 22 3 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively these maximum stresses occur at the contact area as shown in fig 15c in the case of θ 45 fig 14d the maximum von mises stresses are 6 1 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 8 2 mpa saturated sand 100 and 16 1 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the contact or adjacent areas as shown in fig 15d these observations illustrate that the sandy gravel composition causes larger maximum stresses from 16 1 to 38 2 mpa in the ar followed by the sand only 8 2 33 8 mpa and sandy clay composition 6 1 30 8 mpa and consequently a negative correlation is generated between the stresses and displacements i e a larger displacement of the seabed gives smaller stress in the ar besides it is found in fig 14 that the displacement of the seabed increases but the von mises stress of the ar decreases as the colliding angle increases it should be emphasized here that the von mises stresses were not obtained for the damage assessment of the ar but instead acquired to pinpoint the region of higher stresses in general it is known that the von mises stresses are not applicable for damage assessment of brittle material such as concrete besides as mentioned earlier this study focuses on the seabed settlement during the ar installation and accordingly the rht concrete model without reinforcing bars was considered in the material model of the ar nevertheless it is found that from the rht concrete model the damage levels d of all the cases are much smaller than the completely damaged level d 1 hence the primary concern as the study planned should be the initial settlement of the ar under the installation stage 4 discussions the terminal distances indicate the water depths in which the ars reach their terminal velocities it should be noted that the average installation depth of an ar designed for fish should be at least 15 m korean fisheries resources agency 2020 and the actual installation depths range between 28 and 32 m kim et al 2008a 2008b hence the terminal distances 5 939 9 680 m guarantee that the ars reach the terminal velocities when they are installed in the coastal waters if the ars do not reach the terminal velocities the corresponding impact energies and settlements become smaller than the cases reaching the terminal velocities an initial settlement of the seabed is related to the efficiency and stability of an ar to predict the efficiency of the ar yoon et al 2016 proposed the concept of an effective useable volume by defining it as the volume including void and thickness of the cube type ar hence the effective useable volume of the cube type ar 2 m 2 m 2 m is 8 m3 however during ar installation the effective useable volume decreases owing to the initial settlement of the seabed as illustrated in fig 16 thus in this study it is considered the reduction rate of the effective useable volume when the cube type ar is being installed in this estimation the volume constructed by the protuberant is ignored seabed because this space is relatively small in comparison with the space created by the settlement as shown in fig 17 when θ 0 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes with respect to the seabed types are 0 9 sandy gravel 6 86 sand only 22 56 sandy clay respectively in the case of θ 15 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes are 5 35 sandy gravel 8 38 sand only 20 43 sandy clay respectively considering θ 30 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes are 6 08 sandy gravel 9 52 sand only 18 40 sandy clay respectively in the case of the maximum colliding angle θ 45 the reduction ratios are 1 66 sandy gravel 6 5 sand only 25 50 sandy clay respectively from these results the reduction ratios of the effective useable volume become significant around 20 if the seabed is the sandy clay composition i e sand 85 and clay 15 the other ratios are relatively small less than 10 0 9 9 52 the 20 reduction of the effective useable volume is about 1 6 m3 which is a significant loss at the earliest life of the cube type ar according to yoon et al 2016 nine cube type ar sets installed in coastal waters near busan south korea were investigated by divers the bottom conditions are classified into hard soils gravel and sand with rock and soft soils sandy mud muddy sand and mud and accordingly the buried depths are significant e g 0 5 and 1 0 m in the cases of the soft seabed soils the maximum buried depths 1 0 m at three sites are primarily owing to the seabed conditions muddy sand and mud an exceptional case is found because its buried depth comes out zero in spite of the seabed condition of muddy sand except for the one case it can be concluded that the soft soils facilitate the settlement of the cube type ar then a concern arises if the settlements are due to a long time accumulation or the initial installation procedure collision in other words the question is how much the initial installation accounts for the total settlement however it is not easy to answer the question because continuous works in practice have been generally done not for monitoring ar settlement but for monitoring flora and fauna around ars there is no relevant literature has been found so far except for one park 2016 park 2016 prepared various seabed soils such as saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 plus gravel 30 saturated sand 40 plus gravel 60 and saturated sand 10 plus gravel 90 for settlement assessment of a small scale plastic cube type ar 5 cm 5 cm 5 cm with the colliding angle of 0 in addition in the experiment different falling distances such as 50 100 150 and 200 cm were considered to apply collisions to the seabed soils although the experimental setup is not matched with this study mainly because of the different ar material plastic and dimension lack of terminal velocity consideration and different falling distances the result shows a similar trend of settlements according to the soil composition in other words the saturated sand 100 gives the largest settlement among the four compositions indicating that the more gravel proportion the less settlement as found in the study as well the experiment park 2016 also shows that the maximum initial settlement of 0 67 cm 13 4 of the ar height 5 cm hence it gives a significant part of total settlement including long term settlement 5 conclusions it is shown that the settlement of the cube type ar varies mainly according to the seabed soil compositions saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 and then the incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 those settlements are connected to the losses of the effective useable volume of the ar ranging from 6 5 to 9 52 saturated sand 0 9 6 08 saturated sand and gravel and 18 4 25 5 saturated sand and clay for each soil composition the maximum loss of the effective useable volume occurs at the two incident angle such as 9 52 at 30 for the saturated sand 6 08 at 30 for the saturated sand and gravel and 25 5 at 45 for the saturated sand and clay it is found that most incident angles sustain their inclinations after the collisions between the ar and the seabed soils except especially for the incident angle of 30 in the case of the saturated sand and gravel this reflects the laborious intrusion of the ar with the incident angle of 30 into the soil composition sand plus gravel overall it is the saturated sand and clay composition to invoke higher settlement and accordingly higher loss of the effective useable volume 18 4 at 30 to 25 5 at 45 therefore it is recommended to avoid the seabed of any clay composition when we install artificial reefs during the free fall installation although the hard seabed soil composition e g the sand and gravel results in higher stresses in the contact region of the ar it is not necessary to consider those stress levels for its safety however the ars are exposed to the series of collisions when we install those artificial reefs by intensively stacked placement in this case careful consideration should be made for the second collision between the ar installed and an ar being installed the best way to reduce the settlement and safety issues is utilizing cable installation with divers if this installation practice is not applicable for several reasons e g installation cost the recommendation made here is an option not to severely lose the effective useable volume credit authorship contribution statement sol han methodology software investigation resources writing original draft somi jung validation

21376,some artificial reefs ars have experienced an initial settlement primarily owing to their collision to the seabed during an installation process particularly by a free fall this study presents a numerical estimation of the seabed settlement of a box type artificial reef during the initial installation for the purpose the following works were implemented first a cube type ar was selected because of its typical free fall installation procedure its facilitate volume 67 4 in korean coastal waters and accumulated statistics showing severe seabed settlement second numerical flow analyses were carried out to estimate the terminal velocities and distances of the ar in water in this stage four different incident angles were considered to calculate drag coefficients of the ar finally numerical collision analyses were conducted to investigate the settlement characteristics of the seabed soils for the analyses three seabed soils saturated sand saturated sand and gravel and saturated sand and clay were considered from the collision analysis it is the saturated sand and clay composition to invoke higher settlement and accordingly higher loss of the effective useable volume up to 25 5 at 45 therefore it is recommended to avoid the seabed of any clay composition when we install artificial reefs during the free fall installation keywords artificial reefs initial installation seabed settlement flow analysis collision analysis 1 introduction artificial reefs ars have been installed on the seabed to facilitate their intended purposes such as reducing beach erosion protecting marine habitats and providing recreational fishing and diving sites bortone 2011 kim et al 2008b 2019 becker et al 2020 le et al 2020 lee et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 recently the sizes of ars become bigger and their structural types become more complicated primarily owing to the increase in material development project scale and budget baine 2001 woo et al 2014 lee et al 2018 lemoine et al 2019 owing to the large geometrical scales the current ars especially constructed by steel frames and plates have structural issues e g stress concentration in the joints in addition to the conventional stability issues such as sliding overturning scour and settlement harris 2009 manoukian et al 2011 yoon et al 2016 yun and kim 2018 those engineering issues above are mainly concerned for the ars which are well fabricated in a systematic engineering aspect in some asian countries e g china japan and korea because of their relatively expensive fabrication cost however those issues are not closely concerned for ars made of wasting materials unless relevant environmental issues are not invoked a representative environmental issue associated with sliding horizontal movement occurred to the ars constructed by the un ballasted tire bundles which were deployed at approximately 1 8 km offshore of florida sherman and spieler 2006 the tires failed lost their substrates by even normal currents have since moved extensively traveling kilometers from their original locations to beaches and deeper waters offshore and accordingly have physically damaged benthic reef fauna on natural reefs lindberg and seaman 2011 thus the stability of ars and their environmental impact on marine flora and fauna have been considered the major issues in the ar society and community most ars are installed on the seabed using a free fall or a guided way such as divers wires and cables korea fisheries resources agency fira recommends the use of cables when ars are installed yoon et al 2016 however relatively cheap or small ars e g 2 m 2 m 2 m box type ar can be installed by a free fall procedure from a vessel in both cases the installation procedure is important because the ars usually settle down into the seabed owing to their weights kim et al 2010 manoukian et al 2011 this initial and then following long term settlement becomes clear in an intensively stacked placement of ars with multiple layers kim et al 2014a 2014b moreover initial settlement becomes more evident if ars are installed via intensive stacking thus featuring collisions between an already installed ar and a new falling ar these collisions accelerate the settlement of ars yoon et al 2016 the settlement of ars has not been widely reported because of the lack of interest and recognition of the serious yoon et al 2016 reported the buried depths from 0 to 1 0 m of nine cube type ars inspected by divers in coastal waters near busan the second largest city in south korea by proposing effective useable and burial volume of ars they emphasized the buried depth of each ar set and their effects on the loss of effective useable volume which is not desirable to recruit marine flora and fauna kim et al 2010 also reported that the cube type ars on soft seafloors have been settled down 1 9 m or 2 4 m in coastal waters near goheung in south korea and estimated that those ars have lost 50 of their roles other studies e g kim 2001 yoon and kim 2001 investigated the effect of water flows and waves on ar settlement but these did not indicate the actual settlement of the target ars the previous studies are all concerned with the long term settlement of ars however as mentioned earlier some ars experience an initial settlement primarily owing to their collision to the seabed during an installation process particularly by a free fall in this case collision analysis should be carried out to estimate the settlement this analysis can be done by a field test lab scale experiment and numerical work the first case should be the most desirable to investigate the phenomenon but it is hard and expensive to carry out a collision in water the second one is relatively reasonable but it is also difficult to not only idealize a seabed condition but also facilitate a deep water depth the experimental result is solely dependent on how the seabed soil and water depth are simulated the last one is relatively easy to simulate however it is not easy to obtain a reasonable seabed material model this study presents a numerical estimation of seabed settlement during the initial installation of a box type artificial reef for the purpose the following works are implemented first a cube type ar was selected because it has been installed through a free fall procedure from a vessel on the water near 139 413 ha 1394 km2 in korean coastal water from 1971 to 2013 kim et al 2017 which account for 64 5 of the total area and 67 4 of the total facility volume kim et al 2016b these statistics illustrates the popularity of the cube type ars in south korea primarily due to their simple shape good workability and relatively low cost in addition as reported by kim et al 2010 and yoon et al 2016 these ars have experienced settlements in coastal waters in south korea hence it is worthy to investigate how the initial settlement comes out owing to the free fall process second numerical flow analyses were carried out to estimate terminal velocities and distances of the ar in water in this stage four different incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 of the ar were considered to calculate their drag coefficients for the flow analyses the so called element based finite volume method ebfvm was used and a general purpose cfd software package ansys cfx was facilitated once obtained the drag coefficients which are dependent on the incident angle of the target ar the terminal velocities were obtained by solving the equation of motion then these terminal velocities were used in collision analyses finally numerical collision analyses were conducted to investigate the settlement characteristics of the seabed soils in this stage along with the four different incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 of the ar and accordingly the four different terminal velocities three seabed soils saturated sand saturated sand and gravel and saturated sand and clay were considered for the collision analyses a general purpose collision analysis software package ansys autodyn was facilitated the scope and method of this study are summarized in fig 1 the hypotheses and limitations of this study are as follows first because the material models of the seabed soils are the most critical for the collision analysis we selected the cu arl clemson university army research lab sand model grujicic and bell 2011 and its extension for sandy clay grujicic et al 2009 and sandy gravel soils grujicic et al 2008a which have been validated used by several other applications in other words only three seabed soils which are composed of saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 were considered for the numerical collision analyses second because of the primary concern of the study estimating the initial settlement of the seabed soils under the free fall installation procedure with the three different incident angles it is not a major concern of the material model of the target structure cube type ar and accordingly its failure thus we only pinpointed the high stressed structural members of the ar which was modeled by the rht concrete model according to the collision third the terminal velocities and distances of the cube type ar were obtained by only considering three longitudinal external forces such as the weight of the cube type ar buoyancy and drag force in other words the other forces such as current water flow to the transverse directions were not considered to obtain the terminal values finally to get the drag coefficients we only considered pressure form drag because of the blunt shape of the target structure it was assumed that the friction drag is negligible in comparison to the pressure drag 2 materials and methods 2 1 cube type ar fig 2 shows the cube type ar considered in this study the ars are made from concrete and steel reinforcing bars with a size of 2 m l 2 m b 2 m h an apparent facility volume of 8 m3 and a weight of 33 34 kn 3 4 ton jung et al 2016 the thickness of the horizontal and vertical members is all 0 25 m it is known that these ars are suitable for fisheries and the protection of migratory fish due to the relatively large void at each surface kim et al 2014a to facilitate a convenient analysis without affecting the settlement results the original ar shape is modified by excluding the four triangular corners at each side as shown in fig 2b 2 2 drag coefficient pressure drag and friction drag are significant in determining the total drag force acting on the underwater body hasanloo et al 2012 woo et al 2014 woo and na 2014 such as ars considering an example of the pressure drag flow over a flat plate normal to the flow the total drag is equal to the pressure drag because the wall shear stress is perpendicular to the flow direction and therefore does not contribute to the drag force in the case the drag coefficient is as shown in eq 1 here p is the pressure caused by flow a is the frontal area or projected area of the object ρ w is the water density and v is the flow velocity in general the drag coefficient is a function of reynolds number re 1 c d s u r f a c e p d a 1 2 ρ w v 2 for this geometry the flow separates from the edges of the plate and there is back flow recirculating flow in the low energy wake of the plate this recirculating flow is important to ars because it generates the so called wake region usually behind of the ars and a larger wake region can better provide a larger spreading area of seaweed spores and an energy saving sheltering feeding stopover and or spawning space for fish and shellfish lee et al 2020 it should be noted that the drag coefficient for all objects with a sharp edge is essentially independent of reynolds number for re 1000 because of the separation points and accordingly the size of the wake is fixed by the geometry of the object fox et al 2004 therefore we assumed that the drag coefficients of the box type ar are independent of reynolds number according to the sharp edges relevant works also showed that drag coefficients of ars with sharp edges did not vary with respect to inlet velocities and accordingly reynolds numbers e g kim et al 2014a woo et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 to verify this assumption we considered several inlet velocities in the following flow analysis section in addition because the ar is installing normally to the flow direction we assumed that pressure drag is the major one contributing drag coefficient thus eq 1 is used in the study for the geometry of the box type ar the flow separates from the edges of the members there is backflow in the low energy wake of each member although the pressure over the rear surface of each member is essentially constant its magnitude may not be determined analytically fox et al 2004 thus the numerical flow analysis is resorted to determine the drag coefficients of the cube type ar with several incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 woo et al 2014 carried out similar flow analyses to obtain the drag coefficients of 24 ars that are already installed on the seabed as illustrated in fig 3 a consider the free fall installation procedure of the ar in the study the procedure obtaining the pressure drag can be illustrated in fig 3b 2 3 terminal velocities and terminal distances the motion of the object cube type ar can be described as eq 2 by newton s second law of motion here w is the gravitational force applied to the cube type ar f b is the buoyant force f d is the drag force m s is the mass of the ar g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and v is the velocity of the cube type ar accordingly eq 2 becomes eq 3 here m w is the water mass ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 c d is the drag coefficient of the ar and a is the projected area of the ar which depends on the incident angle θ see fig 3b terminal velocity is the highest velocity which is attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid in fluid dynamics an object is moving at its terminal velocity when its speed is constant due to the restraining force exerted when the velocity remains constant i e the acceleration d v d t is zero in eq 3 the terminal velocity can be obtained as shown in eq 4 here ρ s is the density of the ar 2314 kg m 3 and v is the volume 1 25 m3 of the ar 2 f y w f b f d m s d v d t 3 m s g m w g 1 2 c d ρ w a v 2 m s d v d t 4 v t ρ s ρ w ρ w 2 g v c d a eq 3 is a nonlinear nonhomogeneous constant coefficients and first order ordinary differential equation this equation can be solved by the separation of variables with the initial velocity i e v 0 0 which indicates free fall thus the falling collision velocity v t of the ar can be expressed as eq 5 5 v t v t tanh ρ s ρ w ρ s g v t t considering the initial distance i e y 0 0 and integrating eq 5 the falling collision distance can be obtained as shown in eq 6 6 y t ρ s ρ s ρ w v t 2 g ln cosh ρ s ρ w ρ s g v t t 2 4 methods in flow analyses to obtain the terminal velocities of the target ar with the incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 their drag coefficients are required thus flow analyses were carried out to obtain pressure field around the ar using the so called ebfvm a cfd method which has been effective in various engineering applications such as airplanes pipelines and artificial reefs gylys et al 2012 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016a 2016b to facilitate the ebfvm ansys cfx was used ansys inc 2012 the flow field domain was constructed as 20 m l 20 m b 20 m h and the ar was located at the center of the domain as shown in fig 4 the domain size was determined to be 10 times the ar size so that enough spaces were assigned between the boundaries and ar surfaces the boundary conditions as also shown in fig 4 are an inlet outlet and symmetry at the inlet we considered several inlet velocities e g 1 2 and 3 m s 1 and found no significant variation in cd values within the range as other studies also found e g kim et al 2014a woo et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 this is because fully developed turbulent regimes begun at the initial stage i e the reynolds numbers of these reefs are in the self modeling region jiang et al 2016 at the outlet a zero pressure gradient was applied to get the inflow fluid flow out through the outlet the side faces x and z planes were assumed to be symmetric planes to minimize the boundary effect on the flow domain to precise the flow analysis results hexahedrons with 8 nodes were used as the elements the maximum element size near the ar was determined as 0 044 m and the maximum element size far from the ar was controlled as 0 22 m to ensure the elements quality we calculated orthogonal quality oq and skewness skw of the elements ansys inc 2012 and found that the average oq was very good 0 75 0 95 and the average skw was excellent 0 00 0 25 through the flow analysis the following hypotheses are made first the water is incompressible viscous and newtonian second the water temperature is 25 c water density is 1000 kg m 3 and dynamic viscosity is 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 finally sst shear stress transport k ω model proposed by menter 1994 is applicable to express the turbulence here sst k ω model combines the k ω and k ε models the first is used to model the inner region of the boundary layer and the second to model the region of free shear flow 2 5 ar material model as mentioned earlier the cube type ar is made from concrete and steel reinforcing bars this study focuses on the seabed settlement during the ar installation and accordingly it is a reasonable simplicity not to consider steel reinforcing bars in the ar model in general concrete has a non linear compression behavior owing to the inhomogeneity and porosity of the material thus we considered the rht concrete model which was proposed by riedel et al 1999 the rht concrete model has been widely used for damage analysis of concrete in events of transient dynamic forces such as collision and explosion riedel et al 1999 2009 ding et al 2013 hu et al 2016 abdel kader 2019 in transient dynamic analysis an equation of state strength equation failure equation and erosion criteria are required to express a material characteristic the rht concrete model is composed of a p α equation of state rht strength equation rht failure equation and erosion criteria based on geometric distortion tu and lu 2009 in the rht failure model damage level d is expressed in terms of the accumulated plastic strain and the equivalent plastic strain at failure thus the fracture strength is interpolated from the strength values for the undamaged material d 0 at failure surface and the completely damaged material d 1 table 1 shows the associated material properties and constants which were adapted from woo et al 2015 2 6 seabed material model the seabed soil is composed of a variety of materials such as sand clay silt gravel etc the seabed soil is a very complicated material because of the profound effect of particle sizes particle size distributions and the water content on the soil properties a compaction model was proposed by laine and sandvik 2001 to represent a material with porosity for collision analysis however this model was developed fundamentally for dry sand thus the compaction model cannot represent the effect of moisture clay and gravel in soil grujicic and bell 2011 to solve the problem clemson university cu and army research laboratory arl of the usa developed parameterized a new sand model that was named the cu arl sand model to parameterize the cu arl sand model several researchers carried out experiments for obtaining dynamic responses of sand at different saturation e g chapman et al 2006 bragov et al 2008 grujicic et al 2008c grujicic and bell 2011 this sand model is capable of capturing the effect of moisture on the dynamic behavior of sand it should be emphasized here that the cu arl model has been widely used in estimating high strain rate material behavior including the structure and mine installed in the ground grujicic et al 2007 2008a 2008b 2009 grujicic and bell 2011 the accuracy of the model was demonstrated by comparing the experimental values with the numerical analysis results grujicic and bell 2011 consequently the cu arl sand model and its extensions to sandy clay and sandy gravel were facilitated in this study it should be emphasized here that the cu arl sand model contains all the basic components needed in a soil model and the cu arl clay laden sand and cu arl sandy gravel models are merely extensions of the cu arl sand model by accounting for the effects of the clay and gravel respectively because those cu arl models are well explained in the literature e g grujicic and bell 2011 we give a brief overview of the cu arl sand model here the cu arl sand model is composed of four components a sand equation of state b sand strength model c sand failure model p m i n failure model and d sand erosion model based on geometric distortion grujicic and bell 2011 based on those components piece wise linear representations of the three material relations are given in tables 2 4 for the saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 respectively grujicic and bell 2011 in the tables the mo granular strength model is an extension of the drucker prager model that takes into account effects associated with granular materials such as sand ansys inc 2020 the model represents pressure hardening density hardening and variations in the shear modulus with density the descriptions above the cu arl sand model deal with essentially clay free and gravel free sand and the contents incorporate the effect of moisture grujicic and bell 2011 also described the extensions of this model to account for the effects of clay and gravel i e the cu arl clay laden sand model grujicic et al 2009 and the cu arl sandy gravel model grujicic et al 2008a these extensions maintain the basic mathematical formulations of the equation of state the strength failure and erosion models while making some of the key cu arl functions of the clay and gravel contents and their average particle sizes 2 7 methods in collision analyses an experimental approach provides a relatively accurate response of a structure in the event of a collision yoon and na 2013 however to obtain a reasonable experimental result the velocity of the falling structure the cub type ar relating with the water environment e g water depth should be well simulated and the response of the seabed occurring within a very short time should be well measured consequently an explicit dynamic finite element analysis is another option to get the response and collision characteristic however it is also not easy to get a reasonable result because of the ambiguous material properties of the target seabed soils moreover the material model of the target structure should be well established han 2016 to get reasonable explicit dynamic analysis results as described in the previous sections we used the rht concrete model for the ar and cu arl sand model and its extensions clay laden sand model and sandy gavel model for the seabed soils these models were facilitated by ansys autodyn ansys inc 2020 fig 5 shows the geometrical models of the cube type ar the seabed and their initial and boundary conditions for collision analyses except for those material models the ar geometrical model for the collision analyses proceeded in the same standard as the flow analysis mesh size was determined 0 05 m in the hexahedron elements the length l width w and height h of the seabed were selected as 8 m 8m and 2 m respectively for the seabed model the maximum element size in the internal space which occupies the space of 1 5 m 1 5 m with respect to the centerline was determined by 0 05 m and the other elements were constructed as 0 2 m the boundaries left right and bottom of the seabed are restrained as u x 0 u y 0 and u z 0 which means the horizontal vertical and out of plane displacements are zero in addition the initial velocity was assumed the terminal velocity v t 0 v t and the initial position of the ar is assumed 0 03 m above the seabed y t 0 0 3 m to save the computational time the first assumption might be reasonable if the terminal distances critical water depths to reach the terminal velocities are smaller than the water depths usually 28 32 m for the box type ar kim et al 2008a 2008b at the target sites fig 6 shows the gauge points for the settlement measurement of the seabed the gauge points when the ar collides on the seabed without any inclination i e θ 0 fig 6a and the gauge points when the ar collides on the seabed with the incident angles i e θ 15 30 or 45 fig 6b because the first model fig 6a is symmetric with respect to the centerline the settlement is expected to be symmetric and accordingly only 8 gauge points are allocated in contrast the second model fig 6b is not symmetric with respect to the centerline hence 12 gauge points are prepared it should be noted here that the gauge points all locate in the x y midplane of the ar and the vertical values y 0 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m indicate the distances below the baseline y 0 0 m respectively 3 analysis results 3 1 flow analysis results from the flow analysis results it is found that the drag coefficients c d are 1 40 1 14 1 13 and 1 29 respectively when the ar is being installed at the incident angles θ 0 15 30 and 45 the corresponding terminal velocities are calculated as 3 627 m s 1 θ 0 c d 1 40 3 048 m s 1 θ 15 c d 1 14 2 890 m s 1 θ 30 c d 1 13 and 2 881 m s 1 θ 45 c d 1 29 respectively see fig 7 the terminal velocity v t vs time curve the corresponding terminal distances come out 9 680 m θ 0 6 708 m θ 15 5 984 m θ 30 and 5 939 m θ 45 respectively 3 2 collision analysis results for settlement estimation fig 8 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 100 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 9 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point among the four incident angles the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 m s 1 the seabed protuberates at the center of the ar fig 8a and the maximum settlement is 0 107 m at g5 fig 9a in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 m s 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 8b and the maximum displacement is 0 208 m at g9 fig 9b at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements dy are almost zero at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and finally become constant it is also shown that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 22 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 066 m and the settlement at g9 decreases to 0 203 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 m s 1 the seabed is pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence and it protuberates at the center of the seabed fig 8c and each settlement remains constant after 0 4 s and the maximum settlement is 0 369 m at g9 fig 9c in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 m s 1 the seabed is also pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence fig 8d because of the symmetric geometry of the ar colliding into the seabed this case also shows the symmetric dy patterns as shown in fig 8d and some vertical displacement histories overlap as shown in fig 9d the maximum settlement is 0 51 m at g1 as illustrated in fig 9d fig 10 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is also observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 11 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point among the four cases the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 m s 1 the seabed protuberates at the center of the ar fig 10a and the maximum settlement is 0 016 m at g5 at g4 and g8 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements are almost zero indicating that the collision does not have a considerable effect on the gauge points fig 11a in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 m s 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 10b and the maximum displacement is 0 135 m at g9 at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline the displacements are almost negligible i e less effect from the collision fig 11b at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and then become constant it is also shown that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 22 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 047 m and the settlement at g9 decreases to 0 133 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 m s 1 the seabed is pushed laterally owing to the collision with the incidence and it protuberates at the center of the seabed fig 10c it is found that the angle between the ar and seabed decreases after the collision in other words the initial colliding angle decreases owing to the interaction between the ar and the seabed according to the corresponding time history fig 11c the maximum settlement is 0 183 m at g9 we can observe the secondary collision approximately at 0 59 s at g5 accordingly the settlement increases to 0 013 m in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 m s 1 the initial colliding angle 45 is maintained after the collision fig 10d the seabed around the ar protuberates slightly and the maximum protrusion is 0 021 m at g5 and g9 fig 11d it is found that the maximum settlement is 0 258 m at g1 it should be noted that the settlements at g5 g6 g7 and g8 are overlapped with those at g9 g10 g11 and g12 as shown in fig 11d because of the colliding geometry 45 and accordingly the symmetric response to the collision fig 12 shows the vertical displacement dy contours of the seabed composed of the saturated sand 85 and clay 15 according to the colliding angles 0 15 30 and 45 as shown it is also observed the protrusion dy at the adjacent area and settlement dy at the contact area to pinpoint the quantities fig 13 shows the corresponding vertical displacement histories of the seabed at each gauge point these displacements are larger than those of the other soil compositions i e the saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 composition and saturated sand 100 composition among the four angles the colliding angle θ 45 results in the maximum settlement at g1 in the case of θ 0 i e v t 3 627 ms 1 the seabed slightly rises at the center of the ar fig 12a and the maximum settlement is 0 436 m at g5 fig 13a at g4 and g8 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline y 0 the displacements are relatively negligible i e no significant influence from the collision scenario in the case of θ 15 i e v t 3 048 ms 1 the seabed considerably protuberates at the center of the ar fig 12b and the maximum displacement is 0 576 m at g9 fig 13b at g4 g8 and g12 which locate 1 5 m away from the baseline the vertical displacements dy are relatively negligible i e less effect from the collision at g1 g2 and g3 the protrusions tend to gradually increase and then become constant it is also observed that the secondary collision occurs at approximately 0 17 s after then the settlement at g5 increases to 0 283 m in the case of θ 30 i e v t 2 890 ms 1 the angle between the ar and seabed is maintained fig 12c unlike the case in fig 10c it is shown that the protrusion occurs at the center of the seabed however the protrusion settles down slightly after 0 40 s as shown in fig 13c in other words the seabed rises at g5 g6 g7 and g8 until 0 4 s due to the first or primary collision then after 0 4 s the seabed settles down owing to the second collision the maximum settlement is 0 85 m at g9 in the case of θ 45 i e v t 2 881 ms 1 as well the initial colliding angle 45 is maintained after the collision fig 12d it is shown from the displacement history fig 13d that the soils at g9 or g5 and g12 or g8 protuberate until 0 4 s due to the primary collision and then the rises slightly settle down it is found that the maximum settlement is 1 01 m at g1 it should be noted that the displacements at g5 g6 g7 and g8 are overlapped with those at g9 g10 g11 and g12 as shown in fig 13d because of the colliding geometry 45 and accordingly symmetric response to the collision 3 3 correlation between the seabed settlements and ar stresses fig 14 shows the maximum von mises stresses of the cube type ar according to the colliding angles and soil compositions and their correlations with the corresponding displacements dy of the seabed soils fig 15 shows the von mises stress contours of the ar according to the total of 12 combinations it is observed from fig 14a i e θ 0 that the maximum von mises stresses are 30 8 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 33 8 mpa saturated sand 100 and 38 2 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the left and right corners as shown in fig 15a in the case of θ 15 fig 14b the maximum von mises stresses are 13 3 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 15 8 mpa saturated sand 100 and 19 7 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the contact area as shown in fig 15b in the case of θ 30 fig 14c that the maximum von mises stresses are 15 5 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 17 6 mpa saturated sand 100 and 22 3 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively these maximum stresses occur at the contact area as shown in fig 15c in the case of θ 45 fig 14d the maximum von mises stresses are 6 1 mpa saturated sand 85 and clay 15 8 2 mpa saturated sand 100 and 16 1 mpa saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 respectively the maximum stresses occur at the contact or adjacent areas as shown in fig 15d these observations illustrate that the sandy gravel composition causes larger maximum stresses from 16 1 to 38 2 mpa in the ar followed by the sand only 8 2 33 8 mpa and sandy clay composition 6 1 30 8 mpa and consequently a negative correlation is generated between the stresses and displacements i e a larger displacement of the seabed gives smaller stress in the ar besides it is found in fig 14 that the displacement of the seabed increases but the von mises stress of the ar decreases as the colliding angle increases it should be emphasized here that the von mises stresses were not obtained for the damage assessment of the ar but instead acquired to pinpoint the region of higher stresses in general it is known that the von mises stresses are not applicable for damage assessment of brittle material such as concrete besides as mentioned earlier this study focuses on the seabed settlement during the ar installation and accordingly the rht concrete model without reinforcing bars was considered in the material model of the ar nevertheless it is found that from the rht concrete model the damage levels d of all the cases are much smaller than the completely damaged level d 1 hence the primary concern as the study planned should be the initial settlement of the ar under the installation stage 4 discussions the terminal distances indicate the water depths in which the ars reach their terminal velocities it should be noted that the average installation depth of an ar designed for fish should be at least 15 m korean fisheries resources agency 2020 and the actual installation depths range between 28 and 32 m kim et al 2008a 2008b hence the terminal distances 5 939 9 680 m guarantee that the ars reach the terminal velocities when they are installed in the coastal waters if the ars do not reach the terminal velocities the corresponding impact energies and settlements become smaller than the cases reaching the terminal velocities an initial settlement of the seabed is related to the efficiency and stability of an ar to predict the efficiency of the ar yoon et al 2016 proposed the concept of an effective useable volume by defining it as the volume including void and thickness of the cube type ar hence the effective useable volume of the cube type ar 2 m 2 m 2 m is 8 m3 however during ar installation the effective useable volume decreases owing to the initial settlement of the seabed as illustrated in fig 16 thus in this study it is considered the reduction rate of the effective useable volume when the cube type ar is being installed in this estimation the volume constructed by the protuberant is ignored seabed because this space is relatively small in comparison with the space created by the settlement as shown in fig 17 when θ 0 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes with respect to the seabed types are 0 9 sandy gravel 6 86 sand only 22 56 sandy clay respectively in the case of θ 15 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes are 5 35 sandy gravel 8 38 sand only 20 43 sandy clay respectively considering θ 30 the reduction ratios of the effective useable volumes are 6 08 sandy gravel 9 52 sand only 18 40 sandy clay respectively in the case of the maximum colliding angle θ 45 the reduction ratios are 1 66 sandy gravel 6 5 sand only 25 50 sandy clay respectively from these results the reduction ratios of the effective useable volume become significant around 20 if the seabed is the sandy clay composition i e sand 85 and clay 15 the other ratios are relatively small less than 10 0 9 9 52 the 20 reduction of the effective useable volume is about 1 6 m3 which is a significant loss at the earliest life of the cube type ar according to yoon et al 2016 nine cube type ar sets installed in coastal waters near busan south korea were investigated by divers the bottom conditions are classified into hard soils gravel and sand with rock and soft soils sandy mud muddy sand and mud and accordingly the buried depths are significant e g 0 5 and 1 0 m in the cases of the soft seabed soils the maximum buried depths 1 0 m at three sites are primarily owing to the seabed conditions muddy sand and mud an exceptional case is found because its buried depth comes out zero in spite of the seabed condition of muddy sand except for the one case it can be concluded that the soft soils facilitate the settlement of the cube type ar then a concern arises if the settlements are due to a long time accumulation or the initial installation procedure collision in other words the question is how much the initial installation accounts for the total settlement however it is not easy to answer the question because continuous works in practice have been generally done not for monitoring ar settlement but for monitoring flora and fauna around ars there is no relevant literature has been found so far except for one park 2016 park 2016 prepared various seabed soils such as saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 plus gravel 30 saturated sand 40 plus gravel 60 and saturated sand 10 plus gravel 90 for settlement assessment of a small scale plastic cube type ar 5 cm 5 cm 5 cm with the colliding angle of 0 in addition in the experiment different falling distances such as 50 100 150 and 200 cm were considered to apply collisions to the seabed soils although the experimental setup is not matched with this study mainly because of the different ar material plastic and dimension lack of terminal velocity consideration and different falling distances the result shows a similar trend of settlements according to the soil composition in other words the saturated sand 100 gives the largest settlement among the four compositions indicating that the more gravel proportion the less settlement as found in the study as well the experiment park 2016 also shows that the maximum initial settlement of 0 67 cm 13 4 of the ar height 5 cm hence it gives a significant part of total settlement including long term settlement 5 conclusions it is shown that the settlement of the cube type ar varies mainly according to the seabed soil compositions saturated sand 100 saturated sand 70 and gravel 30 and saturated sand 85 and clay 15 and then the incident angles 0 15 30 and 45 those settlements are connected to the losses of the effective useable volume of the ar ranging from 6 5 to 9 52 saturated sand 0 9 6 08 saturated sand and gravel and 18 4 25 5 saturated sand and clay for each soil composition the maximum loss of the effective useable volume occurs at the two incident angle such as 9 52 at 30 for the saturated sand 6 08 at 30 for the saturated sand and gravel and 25 5 at 45 for the saturated sand and clay it is found that most incident angles sustain their inclinations after the collisions between the ar and the seabed soils except especially for the incident angle of 30 in the case of the saturated sand and gravel this reflects the laborious intrusion of the ar with the incident angle of 30 into the soil composition sand plus gravel overall it is the saturated sand and clay composition to invoke higher settlement and accordingly higher loss of the effective useable volume 18 4 at 30 to 25 5 at 45 therefore it is recommended to avoid the seabed of any clay composition when we install artificial reefs during the free fall installation although the hard seabed soil composition e g the sand and gravel results in higher stresses in the contact region of the ar it is not necessary to consider those stress levels for its safety however the ars are exposed to the series of collisions when we install those artificial reefs by intensively stacked placement in this case careful consideration should be made for the second collision between the ar installed and an ar being installed the best way to reduce the settlement and safety issues is utilizing cable installation with divers if this installation practice is not applicable for several reasons e g installation cost the recommendation made here is an option not to severely lose the effective useable volume credit authorship contribution statement sol han methodology software investigation resources writing original draft somi jung validation

mah rauf orbay cad nu 290 istanbul 34940 turkey a parametric optimization study is carried out to find an optimal design to capture the maximum energy in a target area off the turkish coast of the black sea a heaving point absorber wave energy converter is analyzed by taking into account different float geometries with various dimensions and several hydraulic power take off parameters the calculations are carried out in time domain by modeling each sea state observed in the target area the effects of the geometry mass and the dimensions of the floats and the parameters of the power take off system on the energy generated from the waves are investigated and discussed the analyses showed that the maximum pressure of the hydraulic accumulator the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston and the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid can be selected to combine the values of those which the wec performs best in the sea state that possesses nearly similar energy as the annual average of all sea states observed in the target area the cost of energy is also evaluated and it is found that the most economical wec differs by float geometry keywords point absorber wave energy converter hydraulic power take off system the black sea parametric optimization cost analysis 1 introduction any system or device expected to satisfy numerous requirements should be designed accordingly to operate in the best condition possible under the circumstances taken into account wave energy converters wecs which are considered as promising devices in emission free and environmentally friendly electricity generation are examples of such devices that must satisfy multiple requirements to generate the greatest amount of electricity where they are deployed the design of the wave energy converters requires taking into account different parameters such as sea states observed in the area where these devices will be deployed the frequency of the sea states throughout the year the depth of water the geometry and the size of the wec type in consideration the working parameters of the power take off pto system the type of mooring system parameters related to array layout operational requirements repair and maintenance and survivability the relations between these parameters and their effects on the amount of energy that can be generated are vast areas of research towards designing optimized wecs which has not been achieved yet as in wind turbines and solar power despite the studies carried out for many years different types of wave energy converters have been designed so far which are at different levels of technological readiness but none of them is available for deployment at a commercial scale yet currently point absorber wave energy converters are the most widely studied type of wecs european marine energy center 2020 numerous studies have been carried out to find an optimal solution for generating energy from the waves efficiently which consists of single body and two body point absorber type wave energy converters optimization studies are carried out for single body point absorber type wave energy converters in a number of researches a point absorber wec which has a cylindrical float with berkeley wedge shaped bottom is studied to increase the energy generated by adjusting the resonance frequency through changing an internal mass and the spring chen et al 2019 the analyses are carried out in the frequency domain and a time domain analysis is also carried out for a chosen case in irregular waves the results show the optimal damping is larger and capture width is smaller in irregular waves than in regular waves respectively an optimization study is carried out to determine the effects of buoy mass draft and surface on the energy captured and hydrodynamic performance of the wec along with taking into account power take off systems with different characteristics shi et al 2019 a single body wec with a cylinder shaped float is optimized to maximize absorption bandwidth and the energy generated in a near shore region by studying a range of draft and diameter values through frequency domain analysis while the pto damping is chosen equal to radiation damping at the resonance frequency shadman et al 2018 another point absorber wave energy converter with a cone cylinder float which is considered to oscillate in the surge heave and pitch directions is analyzed in time domain to determine the motion response and power absorption in different sites under irregular wave conditions the influences of pto damping float diameter draft and center of gravity on the energy generated are investigated and optimal values of these parameters are determined gao and yu 2018 the geometric optimization of a wave energy converter is carried out by analyzing several float geometries with varying sizes along with an analysis for determining the optimum pto damping coefficient goggins and finnegan 2014 the responses of the floats and the mean absorbed power are calculated by taking the sea states observed in a site and their annual probability into account and an optimal wec structure is established based on annual energy production a fully submerged point absorber wave energy converter is optimized by analyzing the effects of changes in pto damping the diameter of the float water depth frictions and drag forces for given wave height and several wave periods in which the motions of the float are evaluated in time domain the performance of the system is also analyzed in an irregular sea state and it is found that the device s performance is smaller than that of the corresponding regular waves finally the performance of the wec is evaluated in a wave climate observed in a given location and the monthly seasonal and annual variability in average power absorption is determined guanche et al 2013 the effects of the geometry the mooring system and the mass distribution on the optimized pto whose damping is chosen equal to the hydrodynamic damping of the system at resonance of a tethered wec is examined under irregular wave conditions bachynski et al 2012 the heave surge and pitch responses of the wec are evaluated in the frequency domain the results show that the idealized pto damping increases with the increasing size of the wec which also increases the annual power absorption furthermore the mooring system causes a low frequency resonance which may cause the system to fail in coupled surge pitch resonance when the system is subject to long waves finally nonlinear effects such as viscous damping and time domain analysis to determine the extreme responses are considered important to better understand the dynamics of a wec a two body point absorber type wec with an electro mechanical pto is studied in martin et al 2020 the wec consists of a float and a fully submerged body with varying geometries and sizes which are connected by the pto mechanism the frequency and the time domain analyses are validated in a wave tank and an optimal ratio of the masses of the float and the submerged body is found additionally the optimal pto damping is calculated depending on the mass of the submerged body a parametric study is carried out by analyzing a two body wec based on taguchi method shami et al 2019 pto damping pto stiffness diameter and the draft of the float geometry volume and the depth of the submerged body are taken into account and their effects on the energy generated resonance frequency and bandwidth are studied in the frequency domain the results show that the shape of the submerged body has a significant effect on the energy generated moreover the volume of the submerged body has the greatest effect on the resonant frequency finally submerged body shape and pto stiffness have the biggest effects on the bandwidth the optimization of coaxial cylinder wave energy converters is carried out by actively controlling the generator damping and stiffness along with studying the effects of float geometry mooring stiffness and the depth of water jin et al 2019 and by adapting a time dependent and discontinuous pto damping to maximize the energy generated son and yeung 2017 the optimization of a point absorber type wec is carried out by applying phase control via adding a fully submerged body to the wec configuration and by studying several floats with varying sizes and by changing the pto damping values and the mass of the submerged body to maximize the annual energy production in a target area piscopo et al 2016 the cost of energy generated by the wecs studied is also evaluated by calculating the levelised cost of energy lcoe and the annual energy production per unit area of the external surface of the wec experimental results of two mass modulation schemes are presented and one of them is shown to be effective in improving the energy harvesting capabilities of a wec diamond et al 2015 a range of parameters and designs are further investigated numerically and their effects on the energy generated are discussed the method proposed by the authors is based on changing the added mass of the inner float of the two body wec analyzed in this study optimizing a wave energy converter requires a comprehensive analysis of all parameters affecting the design of the device and of the environmental conditions observed in the area where the wec is considered to be deployed as all previous studies indicate since only a limited number of studies cover the optimization of wecs by taking into account such a wide range of parameters the optimization of a single body heaving point absorber wave energy converter is carried out to present guidelines to designers in this study as a result it is determined that the wave energy converters perform better and the captured energy off the turkish coast of the black sea is maximized if the floats have a small draft and a large diameter however the cost analyses indicate that building the floats very oblate does not ensure a wave energy converter to capture the energy in the most economical way while the cylindrical floats capture the energy in the most economical way when they have the smallest draft to radius ratio considered in this study the semi ellipsoid and the semi elliptic paraboloid floats should have a larger draft to radius ratio if the drafts of these floats are approximately 60 70 of their radii these wave energy converters can capture the energy with the lowest cost in addition to the results regarding the geometry of the float it is also found that the power take off system captures maximum annual energy when its parameters are chosen to have certain values the maximum pressure of the high pressure accumulator should be set low enough to ensure charging it as fast as possible but high enough to accumulate sufficient hydraulic energy moreover the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston should be large enough to pump plenty of fluid in the shortest time possible but it should also be small enough to avoid excessive reaction forces due to the pressure built up in the hydraulic accumulator furthermore discharging the hydraulic fluid from the high pressure accumulator at a high flow rate will ensure to maximize the energy captured as a result the power take off system should be designed by combining the parameters which enable the wec to capture maximum energy in a sea state whose average energy is almost equal to annual wave energy in the target area finally it is found that the duration of discharge of the hydraulic fluid does not affect the average energy captured the analyses carried out in this study can be outlined as follows first the hydrodynamic problem associated with the motions of floating bodies is described and its solution method is presented along with several numerical results compared to the previously published ones in section 2 then all candidate wave energy converters are analyzed in the time domain by taking different float geometries power take off parameters and the sea states into account and their performances are evaluated by calculating the annual energy production and the cost of energy captured in section 3 furthermore the accuracy of the numerical solutions is discussed by comparing the results obtained by employing different methods in section 4 finally the performances of wave energy converters with different float geometries are summarized and some guidelines are drawn to maximize the energy absorbed by a point absorber wave energy converter in the target area 2 the solution of the hydrodynamic problem calculating the amplitude of the oscillations of the float of a wave energy converter and the amount of energy that can be generated requires the solution of the free surface problem related to the floating bodies under the action of waves the free surface problem associated with the wind generated gravity waves can be formulated as the following the fluid is assumed inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational thus the velocity can be written as the gradient of a scalar function called the velocity potential a cartesian coordinate system is adapted such that the xoy plane coincides with the undisturbed free surface of the sea and the positive z axis points upwards the potential of the unidirectional plane progressive waves can be found by satisfying the boundary conditions related to the free surface problem and the continuity equation as given in newman 1989 the continuity equation 1 2 0 linearized free surface condition 2 2 t 2 g z 0 o n z 0 the bottom boundary condition in infinitely deep water 3 lim z z 0 the solution of these equations results in the velocity potential of the plane progressive waves or incident waves as the following 4 i r e i g a ω e k z e i k x ω t a g ω and k represent wave amplitude acceleration of gravity circular frequency of waves and wave number respectively the wave number can be calculated by the solution of dispersion relation as given in eq 5 where h is the water depth 5 ω 2 g k tanh k h the oscillations of a body floating in the free surface of a sea generate outgoing waves these waves satisfy the same governing equation and the boundary conditions given in equations 1 3 as well as the radiation condition given in eq 6 which indicates that fluid motion vanishes in the far field of where the waves are generated 6 0 r the radiation problem associated with the outgoing waves generated by the float of a wave energy converter is evaluated by a 3d boundary element method bem based on the distribution of 3d pulsating sources on the surface of the float the velocity potential of the 3d pulsating source in deep water is given in wehausen and laitone 1960 as follows 7 σ 4 π 1 r 1 r 2 ν p v 0 e k z c j 0 k r k ν d k i 2 π ν e ν z c j 0 ν r 8 r x a 2 y b 2 z c 2 1 2 9 r x a 2 y b 2 z c 2 1 2 10 r x a 2 y b 2 1 2 11 ν ω 2 g where a b c x y z ν j 0 and pv represent the position of the source any point in the fluid domain the wave number in deep water bessel function of the first kind and cauchy principal value integral respectively the solution of eq 7 and its derivatives can be found in shin 1979 and newman 1985 the hydrodynamic force exerted on the float due to its oscillatory motion the radiation force is calculated by evaluating radiation potentials j of the body in 6 degrees of freedom dof by first satisfying the body boundary condition and calculating the unknown source strengths of the panels which are assumed constant over each panel a computer program is developed to calculate the velocity of the fluid the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the surface of the body in the frequency domain thus the dynamic forces acting on the float of a wave energy converter further details regarding the solution of the radiation problem can be found in erselcan and kükner 2017 the radiation force acting on the float can be written as the following 12 f i j r a d ρ s b j t ζ j m i d s i j 1 2 6 13 m i n i i 1 2 3 r n i 3 i 4 5 6 where n is the unit normal vector r is the position vector m is the generalized unit normal vector and ζ is the amplitude of the oscillatory motion in 6 dof the added mass and the hydrodynamic damping of a floating body undergoing unit amplitude oscillations can be calculated by normalizing the real part of the radiation force by ω 2 and the imaginary part by iω respectively here i represents the imaginary unit number discretizing the body surface and replacing the solid boundary with sources to evaluate the added mass and hydrodynamic damping of an oscillating body results in a system of linear equations these linear equations represent the flow velocities induced at the collocation points of all panels by the sources distributed on the surface of the body the solution of the system of linear equations results in non unique values at certain frequencies which are known as irregular frequencies irregular frequencies are suppressed by paneling the inner free surface and by imposing a zero normal velocity boundary condition as given in ohmatsu 1975 the heave added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients of a semi sphere obtained by the solver developed in house are presented in figs 1 2 and compared to the analytical results presented in hulme 1982 the results are in very good agreement additionally the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient of a cylinder whose radius is 5 m and the draft is 10 m are compared to the results obtained by other software which are given in roessling and ringwood 2014 the results are shown in figs 3 4 and agree well with each other the wave excitation forces are calculated by integrating the pressure due to incident waves and the diffracted waves the froude krylov forces are calculated by employing incident wave potential given in eq 4 and diffraction forces are calculated by evaluating diffraction potential d which is calculated by satisfying the boundary condition given in eq 14 on the body surface 14 i n d n o n s b the diffraction potential is calculated in a similar way by which the radiation forces are calculated by employing the 3d boundary element method the total wave excitation forces acting on the float of a wec is calculated as the following 15 f i ρ s b i d t m i d s i 1 2 6 the total heave forces acting on circular cylinders with the various draft to radius ratios are calculated numerically and compared to analytical results calculated by the equation for heave force given in finnegan et al 2013 the results are presented in fig 5 and are in good agreement it can be seen that the numerical results converge to the analytical results with the increasing draft to radius ratio a similar result which is also found by comparing the analytical results to the ones calculated by a commercial software presented in finnegan et al 2013 finally the amplitudes of the oscillatory motions of the floats of the wecs are calculated in the time domain by solving the cummins equation which is given in cummins 1962 and bruzzone and grasso 2007 as the following 16 m a 33 x 3 t ρ g s x 3 t t h 33 t τ x 3 t d τ f 3 f k t f 3 d t f p t o t the memory function in the convolution integral in eq 16 can be written for heave acceleration as in eq 17 17 h 33 t 2 π 0 a 33 ω a 33 cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 b 33 ω ω sin ω t d ω the solution of eq 16 is carried out by employing runge kutta methods with different orders of accuracy these methods are the 4th order runge kutta method as given in abramowitz and stegun 1970 and fifth sixth and seventh order runge kutta nyström rkn methods described in fehlberg 1974 the results obtained by all of these methods will be discussed in section 4 3 parametric optimization of an isolated wave energy converter a generic point absorber type wave energy converter which has a hydraulic power take off system is analyzed to find an optimum design to maximize annual energy production the analyses are carried out by taking into account different float geometries and float dimensions various power take off system parameters and different sea states observed in a target area off the turkish coast of the black sea three different geometries are considered as the float of the wave energy converter which are a semi ellipsoid se a semi elliptic paraboloid sep and a circular cylinder cyl all with circular cross sections moreover each float geometry is considered to have three different displacement tonnages mass in seawater with a density of 1 025 tonnes m3 and five different dimensions for each displacement tonnage the masses of the floats are equal to the displaced masses of semi spheres in seawater whose radii are 4 5 6 m and will be denoted as m4 m5 and m6 respectively the masses and the dimensions of the floats studied in this paper are presented in table 1 the power take off system of the wave energy converter is a high pressure hydraulic system which possesses a double acting hydraulic piston the piston is rigidly connected to the float of the wec and pumps the hydraulic fluid by the heave motion of the float additionally a group of check valves converts the bi directional flow of fluid into a uni directional flow moreover a high pressure hydraulic accumulator which is utilized as a reservoir for compensating the fluctuations in the flow is also added to the system furthermore a flow control valve ensures that the hydraulic motor driving an electric generator is supplied with fluid at a constant rate during the discharge of the high pressure accumulator finally the system possesses a low pressure hydraulic accumulator for maintaining the pressure differential across the hydraulic motor at desired levels along with an oil tank for supplying the system with the necessary amount of hydraulic fluid a schematic of the system is given in fig 6 and the modeling of the dynamic behavior of the power take off system is presented as the following erselcan and kükner 2017 the heave motion of the float activates the hydraulic piston and the hydraulic fluid is first pumped into the high pressure accumulator the instantaneous flow rate of the charged fluid q c y l can be found by the following equation where x 3 t is the velocity of the hydraulic piston equal to the heave velocity of the float and ap is the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston 18 q c y l t x 3 t a p both the high pressure and the low pressure accumulators are assumed to be piston type gas charged accumulators the compression and the expansion of the gas during charge and discharge of the fluid are polytrophic processes as a result the relation between the pressure and the volume of the gas can be expressed by the following equation 19 p v n c c o n s t a n t where p and v are the pressure and the volume of the gas and n is the polytrophic index the hydraulic piston will only move if the wave forces acting on the float are greater than the pressure built up in the high pressure accumulator during the charge sequence the dynamic behavior of the power take off system can be modeled as follows the velocity of the piston inside the high pressure accumulator the pressures of the fluid in the pressure line and the suction line are presented in eq 20 22 respectively the pressure values that are given in eqs 21 and 22 are approximate since the friction and inertia losses in the circuits and the pressure losses in the valves are not accounted for in this study additionally vsuction is the average velocity of the fluid flowing through the suction line asuction is the cross sectional area of the suction line and the pressure in the oil tank ptank is assumed equal to

p s u c t i o n the high pressure accumulator is discharged once it is filled with hydraulic fluid and the fluid pumped by the hydraulic piston due to the heave motion of the float is circulated via

circuits the inertia of the fluid and the pressure losses in the check valves are omitted the difference of pressure between the high pressure accumulator and the low pressure accumulator drives the

in this study however the discharge flow rate of the fluid and its duration can also be regulated dependently to increase the energy captured according to the sea states or any other design requirement the values of each parameter are presented in table 2 the energy generated by the point absorber type wave energy converter is calculated by modeling the sea states observed off the black sea coast of sinop turkey a map showing the target area can be found in erselcan and kükner 2017 the wave energy spectrums defining the sea states observed in this region are variants of jonswap and pierson moskowitz spectrums the spectral parameters of these spectrums are calculated based on the wave data collected by wave buoys within nato tu waves project between the years 1994 and 2001 the spectral parameters of the sea states α γ and the peak frequency of the spectrum fp observed in the sinop region can be found in yilmaz 2007 and yilmaz and ozhan 2014 four developing sea states and one fully developed sea state are taken into account in this study which represent single peaked sea states observed in the region according to yilmaz 2007 these sea states form 58 5 of all sea states observed during the project off the coast of sinop the rest of the sea states observed are reported to possess multi peaked spectrums and no spectral functions are given for them the wave energy spectrums of the developing and fully developed seas are given in eq 28 and eq 30 respectively and their spectral parameters and the annual probability of each sea state are presented for the intervals of significant wave height hs in table 3 additionally the significant wave height the energy period and the average wave power corresponding to the mean spectral parameters are also given in

wave energy converter which is capable of generating the greatest amount of energy in a year the wave energy converters are designed by combining every float in consideration with a set of power take off system parameters the energy generated by the wecs is calculated by evaluating the heave response of each system in the time domain the instantaneous power output of a wec is shown in fig 7 the power take off system generates energy when the high pressure accumulator is discharged and no power output is present while the accumulator is charged the calculations are carried out for a simulation time of 5 h and average energy values for 1 h are taken into account for evaluating the total energy that can be generated in every sea state finally the annual energy production is calculated by taking the annual probability of each sea state into account 31 p a v g 1 t 0 t p m o t o r t d t 32 e 0 t p m o t o r t d t 3 1 the maximum energy that can be generated at each sea state the first step taken towards the calculation of annual average energy that can be captured is to calculate the energy that can be generated at each sea state that is observed in the target area thus every combination of the floats with the parameters of the power take off system is evaluated and the best design for each sea state is determined the wave energy converters designed for analyses are assumed to oscillate in heave direction only and no other part of the system except the float contributes to energy generation the average power and energy generated by candidate wec designs in a sea state are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively these figures show the results obtained for wecs whose float geometry is a semi elliptic paraboloid with a mass m6 and a draft to radius ratio 0 2 the candidate design of wec which generates the maximum energy is considered the best option for that sea state numerical calculations of energy generated by each wave energy converter pointed out that the best wave energy converter differs at each sea state it is subject to the results of a wave energy converter which has a semi ellipsoid float with a mass of 463 7 tonnes are presented in table 4 the draft to radius ratio of the float is 0 2 whose radius is 11 292 m and the draft is 2 259 m the amount of energy generated by the wave energy converters which utilize other float geometries and draft to radius ratios are presented in figs 10 12 the energy generated by a wave energy converter increases with the sea states become more severe and all pto parameters change along with changing sea states however the energy generated at different discharge durations is almost the same in a sea state as can be seen in figs 10 13 this result is a consequence of both the average amount of fluid discharged in 1 h which is determined by the number of charge discharge sequences along with the amount of fluid discharged in one cycle and the maximum pressure attained in the hydraulic accumulator the number of charge discharge sequences varies with discharge duration as can be seen in fig 14 however the amount of fluid discharged in 1 h remains about an average value for all discharge durations as given in fig 15 while it can be assumed that the energy generated by the wecs does not change with changing discharge durations significantly the draft to radius ratio of a wec has a considerable effect on the amount of energy that can be generated the highest amount of energy is generated by the wecs with the smallest draft to radius ratio t r 0 2 and the energy generated decreases by increasing the draft to radius ratio the average amount of the energy generated at ten different discharge durations by the wecs with different float geometries is presented in figs 16 20 the amount of energy generated by the wecs is normalized by dividing all values by the highest energy level among them and plotted against draft to radius ratios along with linear trend lines to show the trend of change of the energy with the draft to radius ratios the displaced masses of all floats are identical which is the greatest mass of floats m6 studied in this paper it can be seen in figs 16 20 that the energy generated decreases with the increasing draft to radius ratio in all sea states the greatest change in the amount of energy generated is observed in the wecs with cylindrical floats because the bottom area of the cylindrical float which determines the magnitude of heave force acting on the float diminishes significantly with increasing draft to radius ratio the calculations show that the maximum working pressure and the effective cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston increase with the sea states become more severe as shown in figs 21 and 22 the instantaneous pressure and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston determine the magnitude of the pto force acting in the opposite direction of the wave force thus the hydraulic piston should exert enough pressure to exceed the pressure inside the high pressure accumulator and to charge it with fluid the increasing wave forces along with the more energetic sea states indicate that it is possible to set the system to operate at high pressures and to have a large piston area to sweep high volumes of fluid however the energetic sea states are observed for a limited time in the target area since the less energetic sea states ss1 ss2 and fd are more dominant throughout the year the values of maximum pressure of the hydraulic accumulator and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston corresponding particularly to ss2 are the best choices among all other cases which enable the wecs to capture the maximum amount of energy in a year on the other hand the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid exhibits an irregular pattern as shown in fig 23 unlike the ones in maximum accumulator pressure and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston although the average volume of fluid that can be discharged in 1 h is nearly the same at different discharge durations the flow rate and the number of charge discharge sequences differ by the discharge duration consequently the pto of the wec can be optimized to capture the maximum amount of annual energy by setting the maximum pressure of the hydraulic accumulator at a low value 50 60 bars the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston to a moderate value not greater than 0 1 m2 in all cases and the flow rate to a high value mostly greater than 0 25 m3 s of the ranges of these parameters analyzed in this study 3 2 annual energy production designing a wave energy converter to operate at different sea states with varying power take off parameters may be complicated as a result each set of design parameters that enabled the wec to generate the highest amount of energy in each sea state is evaluated again and the one which performs best in all sea states is determined the results are presented in table 5 and the parameters of the power take off system suitable for sea state 2 performed best in all sea states which is valid for all cases considered in this study the amount of annual energy generated by a wec is calculated by the sum of the energy that is generated at each sea state throughout a year as given in eq 33 where ti ss is the annual duration of each sea state in hours 33 e a n n u a l i 1 5 e a v e 1 h o u r i t s s i 3600 the amount of annual energy generated by the wecs at different discharge durations is very close to each other as can be seen in fig 24 the amount of annual energy generated at different discharge durations exhibits a regular pattern unlike the varying values observed at ss3 and ss4 which can be seen in fig 13 the main reason for this result is that the amount of energy generated at sea states ss1 ss2 and fd have closer values to the average and the durations of these sea states throughout the year are much greater than those of sea states ss3 and ss4 consequently the variations observed in the energy generated at sea states ss3 and ss4 do not have a significant effect on the amount of energy generated annually consequently the amount of energy generated by the wecs either in different sea states or annually can be assumed independent of discharge duration since the amount of energy generated at different discharge durations is close to each other and the differences between them are insignificant however while any discharge duration can be chosen for the design having a long discharge duration may result in a wec to have a large hydraulic capacity and cause the entire structure of the wec to become large the influence of draft to radius ratio on the amount of annual energy generated by the wecs is similar to the amount of energy generated at different sea states the greatest amount of energy is generated by the wecs which have a draft to radius ratio equal to 0 2 and the energy generated decreases by increasing draft to radius ratio the annual energy generated by the wecs with different floats is given in figs 25 27 and the curves fit by employing the least squares method show the trend of change of the energy generated by the draft to radius ratio the ratio of decrease in the amount of energy generated by increasing draft to radius ratio is about 40 in the wecs with a semi ellipsoid float 30 37 in the wecs with a semi elliptic paraboloid float and 54 58 in the wecs with a cylindrical float these results indicate that the energy generated decreases by about half of the maximum energy generated by all wecs while the draft to radius ratio of these wecs increases by five times that of the smallest one the comparison of annual energy generated by wecs with semi ellipsoid semi elliptic paraboloid and cylindrical floats are presented in fig 28 the results show that the wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats are capable of capturing more energy than the ones with semi ellipsoid and cylindrical floats the main reason for this result is that semi elliptic paraboloid floats have a larger surface and projected area than those of semi ellipsoid and cylindrical floats consequently the wave forces acting on the wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats and their heave response are greater than those of other floats in consideration which leads to higher energy generation the amount of annual average energy generated by the wecs increase by increasing the mass of the floats as shown in figs 29 31 the nondimensionalized annual average energy is plotted against nondimensionalized float mass which is carried out by dividing the masses of the floats by the greatest mass mmax m6 among them the rate of increase of the annual energy generated by the wecs with different float masses differs by the geometry of the float and the draft to radius ratios the mass of m5 is almost twice the mass of m4 and the mass of m6 is approximately 73 greater than that of m5 the amount of annual energy generated by wecs with a semi ellipsoid float increases by 12 22 while the mass of the floats increase from m4 to m5 and by 7 13 while the mass of the floats increases from m5 to m6 similarly the amount of annual energy generated by wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats increases by 18 26 and by 7 13 while the mass of the floats changes from m4 to m5 and from m5 to m6 respectively finally the rate of increase of the annual average energy generated ranges between 10 and 17 and between 2 and 8 while the mass of cylindrical floats changes from m4 to m5 and from m5 to m6 respectively these results indicate that increasing the mass of the float of a wec has a minor effect on the amount of energy generated when it is compared to the rate of increase of the mass of the floats although the data presented in figs 29 31 point that increasing the mass of the floats may help to increase the amount of energy generated the curves fitted to this data may contradict with this result since the curves tend to extend either asymptotically or with a decreasing pattern with increasing mass which is to be determined by further analysis 3 3 cost analysis the numerical analyses carried out so far indicate that the greatest amount of energy can be generated by a wec built by a heavy and oblate float however this method will make the wec large and result in using a considerable amount of material to manufacture it which will eventually increase the costs thus a cost analysis is also carried out to determine whether or not a heavy and oblate float is the best solution the method for analyzing the cost of energy generated by wecs given in si ocean 2013 is utilized and the results are presented in figs 32 34 along with curves fit the data to display their trends the levelised cost of energy lcoe can be calculated by eq 34 presented as the following 34 l c o e s c i s l d 87 6 l f r 1 r n 1 r n 1 o m 87 6 l f this equation considers the capital costs sci the decommissioning costs sld the load factor lf the discount rate r the lifetime of the energy facility n and the annual operating and maintenance costs of the facility om the approximate values of the parameters appearing in eq 34 can be found in si ocean 2013 the lcoe values of wecs with different floats are normalized by dividing all values by the maximum cost value obtained for each type of wec the calculations show that despite the greatest amount of energy is generated by the wecs which have the smallest draft to radius ratio these wecs are not the most economical ones except the wec with the cylindrical float the lcoe values obtained for wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid floats have similar trends in which the cost of the unit amount of energy increases while the draft to radius ratio both increases and decreases the energy generated by wecs with semi elliptic paraboloids possesses the lowest costs while the draft to radius ratio is approximately 0 7 and the lowest cost of energy which is generated by wecs with semi ellipsoid floats is achieved while the draft to radius ratio is approximately 0 55 on the other hand the cost of energy generated by wecs with cylindrical floats increases with increasing draft to radius ratio the main reason for this result is that increasing the draft to radius ratio of a cylindrical float increases the lateral surface area of the float while it decreases the bottom surface area which contributes to energy generation thus it increases the initial costs of a wec which eventually increases the cost of the energy generated by the wec furthermore the results show that any change in the mass of the float of a wec has a similar effect on the cost of energy generated such that increasing the mass of the float of a wec will increase the cost of energy finally the lcoe of all wecs with different floats that are normalized by dividing the highest cost value is given in fig 35 the wec with a cylindrical float of which the draft to radius ratio is 1 and the mass is m6 has the highest lcoe value among all wecs analyzed in this study the results indicate that the performance of wecs with cylindrical floats of which the masses are m5 and m6 is reduced significantly when the draft to radius ratio is greater than 0 4 however the wecs with cylindrical floats of which the mass is m4 have a better performance in terms of the cost of energy generated 4 validation of numerical results the accuracy of the numerical results obtained in this study is tested by comparing the annual average energy calculated by different methods of numerical solutions different time steps δt and different sets of random phase angles ε between 0 and 2π the numerical methods used to solve the equation of motion are runge kutta 4th order method runge kutta nyström rkn 5th 6th and 7th order methods the time steps utilized for testing the results are 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 s finally five different sets of wave phase angles are generated at each time step and numerical method to model the irregular sea states considered in this study and to calculate the time series of wave forces acting on the floats of the wecs the annual average energy generated by the wec of which the float is a semi ellipsoid with the mass m6 the draft to radius ratio is 0 2 and the discharge duration is 10 s is calculated and the results are presented in table 6 the results show that the amount of annual average energy generated does not differ with changing sets of random phase angles the difference between each result corresponding to each set of random phase angles and the average value of annual energy corresponding to these random phase angles is less than 1 5 in all cases moreover the differences between the results of different numerical methods at different time steps are insignificant consequently rkn 5th order method is chosen for evaluating the response of the wecs in waves with a time step of 0 1 s since the results obtained by different numerical methods at different time steps are very close to each other and due to this method has the shortest calculation time among all others 5 conclusion the search for an optimized point absorber wave energy converter suitable for deploying off the turkish coast of the black sea is carried out to draw guidelines that can help designers in the preliminary design stage by taking a broad range of variables into account the results indicate that the wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid floats have similar performances while the wecs with cylindrical floats have poorer performances while a heavy and oblate float helps to increase the energy captured by a wec this type of float geometry also causes the cost of energy to increase the maximum amount of energy is captured by the wecs when the draft is small compared to the radius in all cases on the other hand having a small draft to radius ratio makes a wec with a cylindrical float the most economical one while the draft to radius ratios of wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid should be greater than that of the cylindrical wec to achieve the most economical configuration increasing the mass of the float seems to have a limited effect on the energy captured since the ratio of increase in the annual average energy is considerably smaller than the ratio of increase of the mass the results show that the discharge duration of the high pressure accumulator does not affect the amount of energy generated so any value can be chosen during the design stage the values of the maximum pressure of the high pressure accumulator and the effective cross sectional area of the hydraulic cylinder increase with the sea states become more energetic but such sea states are observed for a short period during the year in the target area thus the values of these parameters corresponding to the more dominant but less energetic sea states turned out to be the best choice to maximize the annual energy absorption finally the analyses indicate that the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid depends on the discharge duration chosen in the design stage while the total amount of fluid that can be charged into the hydraulic accumulator in a given wec depends on the sea state the flow rate may be different at different discharge durations the numerical calculations carried out in this study are based on linear potential flow theory where the wave forces are evaluated on the mean wetted surface of the wecs however the wecs which can generate the greatest amount of energy have shallow drafts as a result the wetted surface area of the floats may not remain unchanged or nearly unchanged due to heave motion it is particularly correct for the float geometries considered in this study except for the cylindrical one consequently calculating the wave forces acting on the floats with small drafts nonlinearly by taking the instantaneous wetted surface into account would

average of all sea states observed in the target area the cost of energy is also evaluated and it is found that the most economical wec differs by float geometry keywords point absorber wave energy converter hydraulic power take off system the black sea parametric optimization cost analysis 1 introduction any system or device expected to satisfy numerous requirements should be designed accordingly to operate in the best condition possible under the circumstances taken into account wave energy converters wecs which are considered as promising devices in emission free and environmentally friendly electricity generation are examples of such devices that must satisfy multiple requirements to generate the greatest amount of electricity where they are deployed the design of the wave energy converters requires taking into account different parameters such as sea states observed in the area where these devices will be deployed the frequency of the sea states throughout the year the depth of water the geometry and the size of the wec type in consideration the working parameters of the power take off pto system the type of mooring system parameters related to array layout operational requirements repair and maintenance and survivability the relations between these parameters and their effects on the amount of energy that can be generated are vast areas of research towards designing optimized wecs which has not been achieved yet as in wind turbines and solar power despite the studies carried out for many years different types of wave energy converters have been designed so far which are at different levels of technological readiness but none of them is available for deployment at a commercial scale yet currently point absorber wave energy converters are the most widely studied type of wecs european marine energy center 2020 numerous studies have been carried out to find an optimal solution for generating energy from the waves efficiently which consists of single body and two body point absorber type wave energy converters optimization studies are carried out for single body point absorber type wave energy converters in a number of researches a point absorber wec which has a cylindrical float with berkeley wedge shaped bottom is studied to increase the energy generated by adjusting the resonance frequency through changing an internal mass and the spring chen et al 2019 the analyses are carried out in the frequency domain and a time domain analysis is also carried out for a chosen case in irregular waves the results show the optimal damping is larger and capture width is smaller in irregular waves than in regular waves respectively an optimization study is carried out to determine the effects of buoy mass draft and surface on the energy captured and hydrodynamic performance of the wec along with taking into account power take off systems with different characteristics shi et al 2019 a single body wec with a cylinder shaped float is optimized to maximize absorption bandwidth and the energy generated in a near shore region by studying a range of draft and diameter values through frequency domain analysis while the pto damping is chosen equal to radiation damping at the resonance frequency shadman et al 2018 another point absorber wave energy converter with a cone cylinder float which is considered to oscillate in the surge heave and pitch directions is analyzed in time domain to determine the motion response and power absorption in different sites under irregular wave conditions the influences of pto damping float diameter draft and center of gravity on the energy generated are investigated and optimal values of these parameters are determined gao and yu 2018 the geometric optimization of a wave energy converter is carried out by analyzing several float geometries with varying sizes along with an analysis for determining the optimum pto damping coefficient goggins and finnegan 2014 the responses of the floats and the mean absorbed power are calculated by taking the sea states observed in a site and their annual probability into account and an optimal wec structure is established based on annual energy production a fully submerged point absorber wave energy converter is optimized by analyzing the effects of changes in pto damping the diameter of the float water depth frictions and drag forces for given wave height and several wave periods in which the motions of the float are evaluated in time domain the performance of the system is also analyzed in an irregular sea state and it is found that the device s performance is smaller than that of the corresponding regular waves finally the performance of the wec is evaluated in a wave climate observed in a given location and the monthly seasonal and annual variability in average power absorption is determined guanche et al 2013 the effects of the geometry the mooring system and the mass distribution on the optimized pto whose damping is chosen equal to the hydrodynamic damping of the system at resonance of a tethered wec is examined under irregular wave conditions bachynski et al 2012 the heave surge and pitch responses of the wec are evaluated in the frequency domain the results show that the idealized pto damping increases with the increasing size of the wec which also increases the annual power absorption furthermore the mooring system causes a low frequency resonance which may cause the system to fail in coupled surge pitch resonance when the system is subject to long waves finally nonlinear effects such as viscous damping and time domain analysis to determine the extreme responses are considered important to better understand the dynamics of a wec a two body point absorber type wec with an electro mechanical pto is studied in martin et al 2020 the wec consists of a float and a fully submerged body with varying geometries and sizes which are connected by the pto mechanism the frequency and the time domain analyses are validated in a wave tank and an optimal ratio of the masses of the float and the submerged body is found additionally the optimal pto damping is calculated depending on the mass of the submerged body a parametric study is carried out by analyzing a two body wec based on taguchi method shami et al 2019 pto damping pto stiffness diameter and the draft of the float geometry volume and the depth of the submerged body are taken into account and their effects on the energy generated resonance frequency and bandwidth are studied in the frequency domain the results show that the shape of the submerged body has a significant effect on the energy generated moreover the volume of the submerged body has the greatest effect on the resonant frequency finally submerged body shape and pto stiffness have the biggest effects on the bandwidth the optimization of coaxial cylinder wave energy converters is carried out by actively controlling the generator damping and stiffness along with studying the effects of float geometry mooring stiffness and the depth of water jin et al 2019 and by adapting a time dependent and discontinuous pto damping to maximize the energy generated son and yeung 2017 the optimization of a point absorber type wec is carried out by applying phase control via adding a fully submerged body to the wec configuration and by studying several floats with varying sizes and by changing the pto damping values and the mass of the submerged body to maximize the annual energy production in a target area piscopo et al 2016 the cost of energy generated by the wecs studied is also evaluated by calculating the levelised cost of energy lcoe and the annual energy production per unit area of the external surface of the wec experimental results of two mass modulation schemes are presented and one of them is shown to be effective in improving the energy harvesting capabilities of a wec diamond et al 2015 a range of parameters and designs are further investigated numerically and their effects on the energy generated are discussed the method proposed by the authors is based on changing the added mass of the inner float of the two body wec analyzed in this study optimizing a wave energy converter requires a comprehensive analysis of all parameters affecting the design of the device and of the environmental conditions observed in the area where the wec is considered to be deployed as all previous studies indicate since only a limited number of studies cover the optimization of wecs by taking into account such a wide range of parameters the optimization of a single body heaving point absorber wave energy converter is carried out to present guidelines to designers in this study as a result it is determined that the wave energy converters perform better and the captured energy off the turkish coast of the black sea is maximized if the floats have a small draft and a large diameter however the cost analyses indicate that building the floats very oblate does not ensure a wave energy converter to capture the energy in the most economical way while the cylindrical floats capture the energy in the most economical way when they have the smallest draft to radius ratio considered in this study the semi ellipsoid and the semi elliptic paraboloid floats should have a larger draft to radius ratio if the drafts of these floats are approximately 60 70 of their radii these wave energy converters can capture the energy with the lowest cost in addition to the results regarding the geometry of the float it is also found that the power take off system captures maximum annual energy when its parameters are chosen to have certain values the maximum pressure of the high pressure accumulator should be set low enough to ensure charging it as fast as possible but high enough to accumulate sufficient hydraulic energy moreover the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston should be large enough to pump plenty of fluid in the shortest time possible but it should also be small enough to avoid excessive reaction forces due to the pressure built up in the hydraulic accumulator furthermore discharging the hydraulic fluid from the high pressure accumulator at a high flow rate will ensure to maximize the energy captured as a result the power take off system should be designed by combining the parameters which enable the wec to capture maximum energy in a sea state whose average energy is almost equal to annual wave energy in the target area finally it is found that the duration of discharge of the hydraulic fluid does not affect the average energy captured the analyses carried out in this study can be outlined as follows first the hydrodynamic problem associated with the motions of floating bodies is described and its solution method is presented along with several numerical results compared to the previously published ones in section 2 then all candidate wave energy converters are analyzed in the time domain by taking different float geometries power take off parameters and the sea states into account and their performances are evaluated by calculating the annual energy production and the cost of energy captured in section 3 furthermore the accuracy of the numerical solutions is discussed by comparing the results obtained by employing different methods in section 4 finally the performances of wave energy converters with different float geometries are summarized and some guidelines are drawn to maximize the energy absorbed by a point absorber wave energy converter in the target area 2 the solution of the hydrodynamic problem calculating the amplitude of the oscillations of the float of a wave energy converter and the amount of energy that can be generated requires the solution of the free surface problem related to the floating bodies under the action of waves the free surface problem associated with the wind generated gravity waves can be formulated as the following the fluid is assumed inviscid incompressible and the flow is irrotational thus the velocity can be written as the gradient of a scalar function called the velocity potential a cartesian coordinate system is adapted such that the xoy plane coincides with the undisturbed free surface of the sea and the positive z axis points upwards the potential of the unidirectional plane progressive waves can be found by satisfying the boundary conditions related to the free surface problem and the continuity equation as given in newman 1989 the continuity equation 1 2 0 linearized free surface condition 2 2 t 2 g z 0 o n z 0 the bottom boundary condition in infinitely deep water 3 lim z z 0 the solution of these equations results in the velocity potential of the plane progressive waves or incident waves as the following 4 i r e i g a ω e k z e i k x ω t a g ω and k represent wave amplitude acceleration of gravity circular frequency of waves and wave number respectively the wave number can be calculated by the solution of dispersion relation as given in eq 5 where h is the water depth 5 ω 2 g k tanh k h the oscillations of a body floating in the free surface of a sea generate outgoing waves these waves satisfy the same governing equation and the boundary conditions given in equations 1 3 as well as the radiation condition given in eq 6 which indicates that fluid motion vanishes in the far field of where the waves are generated 6 0 r the radiation problem associated with the outgoing waves generated by the float of a wave energy converter is evaluated by a 3d boundary element method bem based on the distribution of 3d pulsating sources on the surface of the float the velocity potential of the 3d pulsating source in deep water is given in wehausen and laitone 1960 as follows 7 σ 4 π 1 r 1 r 2 ν p v 0 e k z c j 0 k r k ν d k i 2 π ν e ν z c j 0 ν r 8 r x a 2 y b 2 z c 2 1 2 9 r x a 2 y b 2 z c 2 1 2 10 r x a 2 y b 2 1 2 11 ν ω 2 g where a b c x y z ν j 0 and pv represent the position of the source any point in the fluid domain the wave number in deep water bessel function of the first kind and cauchy principal value integral respectively the solution of eq 7 and its derivatives can be found in shin 1979 and newman 1985 the hydrodynamic force exerted on the float due to its oscillatory motion the radiation force is calculated by evaluating radiation potentials j of the body in 6 degrees of freedom dof by first satisfying the body boundary condition and calculating the unknown source strengths of the panels which are assumed constant over each panel a computer program is developed to calculate the velocity of the fluid the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the surface of the body in the frequency domain thus the dynamic forces acting on the float of a wave energy converter further details regarding the solution of the radiation problem can be found in erselcan and kükner 2017 the radiation force acting on the float can be written as the following 12 f i j r a d ρ s b j t ζ j m i d s i j 1 2 6 13 m i n i i 1 2 3 r n i 3 i 4 5 6 where n is the unit normal vector r is the position vector m is the generalized unit normal vector and ζ is the amplitude of the oscillatory motion in 6 dof the added mass and the hydrodynamic damping of a floating body undergoing unit amplitude oscillations can be calculated by normalizing the real part of the radiation force by ω 2 and the imaginary part by iω respectively here i represents the imaginary unit number discretizing the body surface and replacing the solid boundary with sources to evaluate the added mass and hydrodynamic damping of an oscillating body results in a system of linear equations these linear equations represent the flow velocities induced at the collocation points of all panels by the sources distributed on the surface of the body the solution of the system of linear equations results in non unique values at certain frequencies which are known as irregular frequencies irregular frequencies are suppressed by paneling the inner free surface and by imposing a zero normal velocity boundary condition as given in ohmatsu 1975 the heave added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients of a semi sphere obtained by the solver developed in house are presented in figs 1 2 and compared to the analytical results presented in hulme 1982 the results are in very good agreement additionally the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficient of a cylinder whose radius is 5 m and the draft is 10 m are compared to the results obtained by other software which are given in roessling and ringwood 2014 the results are shown in figs 3 4 and agree well with each other the wave excitation forces are calculated by integrating the pressure due to incident waves and the diffracted waves the froude krylov forces are calculated by employing incident wave potential given in eq 4 and diffraction forces are calculated by evaluating diffraction potential d which is calculated by satisfying the boundary condition given in eq 14 on the body surface 14 i n d n o n s b the diffraction potential is calculated in a similar way by which the radiation forces are calculated by employing the 3d boundary element method the total wave excitation forces acting on the float of a wec is calculated as the following 15 f i ρ s b i d t m i d s i 1 2 6 the total heave forces acting on circular cylinders with the various draft to radius ratios are calculated numerically and compared to analytical results calculated by the equation for heave force given in finnegan et al 2013 the results are presented in fig 5 and are in good agreement it can be seen that the numerical results converge to the analytical results with the increasing draft to radius ratio a similar result which is also found by comparing the analytical results to the ones calculated by a commercial software presented in finnegan et al 2013 finally the amplitudes of the oscillatory motions of the floats of the wecs are calculated in the time domain by solving the cummins equation which is given in cummins 1962 and bruzzone and grasso 2007 as the following 16 m a 33 x 3 t ρ g s x 3 t t h 33 t τ x 3 t d τ f 3 f k t f 3 d t f p t o t the memory function in the convolution integral in eq 16 can be written for heave acceleration as in eq 17 17 h 33 t 2 π 0 a 33 ω a 33 cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 b 33 ω ω sin ω t d ω the solution of eq 16 is carried out by employing runge kutta methods with different orders of accuracy these methods are the 4th order runge kutta method as given in abramowitz and stegun 1970 and fifth sixth and seventh order runge kutta nyström rkn methods described in fehlberg 1974 the results obtained by all of these methods will be discussed in section 4 3 parametric optimization of an isolated wave energy converter a generic point absorber type wave energy converter which has a hydraulic power take off system is analyzed to find an optimum design to maximize annual energy production the analyses are carried out by taking into account different float geometries and float dimensions various power take off system parameters and different sea states observed in a target area off the turkish coast of the black sea three different geometries are considered as the float of the wave energy converter which are a semi ellipsoid se a semi elliptic paraboloid sep and a circular cylinder cyl all with circular cross sections moreover each float geometry is considered to have three different displacement tonnages mass in seawater with a density of 1 025 tonnes m3 and five different dimensions for each displacement tonnage the masses of the floats are equal to the displaced masses of semi spheres in seawater whose radii are 4 5 6 m and will be denoted as m4 m5 and m6 respectively the masses and the dimensions of the floats studied in this paper are presented in table 1 the power take off system of the wave energy converter is a high pressure hydraulic system which possesses a double acting hydraulic piston the piston is rigidly connected to the float of the wec and pumps the hydraulic fluid by the heave motion of the float additionally a group of check valves converts the bi directional flow of fluid into a uni directional flow moreover a high pressure hydraulic accumulator which is utilized as a reservoir for compensating the fluctuations in the flow is also added to the system furthermore a flow control valve ensures that the hydraulic motor driving an electric generator is supplied with fluid at a constant rate during the discharge of the high pressure accumulator finally the system possesses a low pressure hydraulic accumulator for maintaining the pressure differential across the hydraulic motor at desired levels along with an oil tank for supplying the system with the necessary amount of hydraulic fluid a schematic of the system is given in fig 6 and the modeling of the dynamic behavior of the power take off system is presented as the following erselcan and kükner 2017 the heave motion of the float activates the hydraulic piston and the hydraulic fluid is first pumped into the high pressure accumulator the instantaneous flow rate of the charged fluid q c y l can be found by the following equation where x 3 t is the velocity of the hydraulic piston equal to the heave velocity of the float and ap is the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston 18 q c y l t x 3 t a p both the high pressure and the low pressure accumulators are assumed to be piston type gas charged accumulators the compression and the expansion of the gas during charge and discharge of the fluid are polytrophic processes as a result the relation between the pressure and the volume of the gas can be expressed by the following equation 19 p v n c c o n s t a n t where p and v are the pressure and the volume of the gas and n is the polytrophic index the hydraulic piston will only move if the wave forces acting on the float are greater than the pressure built up in the high pressure accumulator during the charge sequence the dynamic behavior of the power take off system can be modeled as follows the velocity of the piston inside the high pressure accumulator the pressures of the fluid in the pressure line and the suction line are presented in eq 20 22 respectively the pressure values that are given in eqs 21 and 22 are approximate since the friction and inertia losses in the circuits and the pressure losses in the valves are not accounted for in this study additionally vsuction is the average velocity of the fluid flowing through the suction line asuction is the cross sectional area of the suction line and the pressure in the oil tank ptank is assumed equal to atmospheric pressure 20 y p i s t o n h p a c c a p a p i s t o n h p a c c x 3 21 p p r e s s u r e p g a s h p a c c a p i s t o n h p a c c m p i s t o n h p a c c y p i s t o n h p a c c a p 22 p

p s u c t i o n the high pressure accumulator is discharged once it is filled with hydraulic fluid and the fluid pumped by the hydraulic piston due to the heave motion of the float is circulated via the bypass line as a result it can be assumed that the float is not subject to any reaction force due to the power take off system and oscillate freely if the losses due to the friction in the circuits the inertia of the fluid and the pressure losses in the check valves are omitted the difference of pressure between the high pressure accumulator and the low pressure accumulator drives the hydraulic motor the pressure differential across the hydraulic motor δp motor and the instantaneous power generated by the motor p motor can be written as in eq 24 27 24 p h p l p g a s h p a c c a p

outlet side of the hydraulic motor finally q m o t o r and η m o t o r represent the flow rate of fluid flowing through the hydraulic motor and the total efficiency of the hydraulic motor the effective cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston ap maximum pressure of the high pressure hydraulic accumulator pmax the duration of the discharge of the hydraulic accumulator td and the flow rate of the fluid q are the parameters of the power take off system taken into account in this study the duration of discharge and the flow rate of the fluid are considered independent of each other in this study however the discharge flow rate of the fluid and its duration can also be regulated dependently to increase the energy captured according to the sea states or any other design requirement the values of each parameter are presented in table 2 the energy generated by the point absorber type wave energy converter is calculated by modeling the sea states observed off the black sea coast of sinop turkey a map showing the target area can be found in erselcan and kükner 2017 the wave energy spectrums defining the sea states observed in this region are variants of jonswap and pierson moskowitz spectrums the spectral parameters of these spectrums are calculated based on the wave data collected by wave buoys within nato tu waves project between the years 1994 and 2001 the spectral parameters of the sea states α γ and the peak frequency of the spectrum fp observed in the sinop region can be found in yilmaz 2007 and yilmaz and ozhan 2014 four developing sea states and one fully developed sea state are taken into account in this study which represent single peaked sea states observed in the region according to yilmaz 2007 these sea states form 58 5 of all sea states observed during the project off the coast of sinop the rest of the sea states observed are reported to possess multi peaked spectrums and no spectral functions are given for them the wave energy spectrums of the developing and fully developed seas are given in eq 28 and eq 30 respectively and their spectral parameters and the annual probability of each sea state are presented for the intervals of significant wave height hs in table 3 additionally the significant wave height the energy period and the average wave power corresponding to the mean spectral parameters are also given in table 4 28 s f α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 e 1 25 f f p 4 γ e f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 29 σ σ a 0 07 f f p σ b 0 09 f f p 30 s f α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 e 1 25 f f p 4 an exhaustive search method is employed to determine the wave energy converter which is capable of generating the greatest amount of energy in a year the wave energy converters are designed by combining every float in consideration with a set of power take off system parameters the energy generated by the wecs is calculated by evaluating the heave response of each system in the time domain the instantaneous power output of a wec is shown in fig 7 the power take off system generates energy when the high pressure accumulator is discharged and no power output is present while the accumulator is charged the calculations are carried out for a simulation time of 5 h and average energy values for 1 h are taken into account for evaluating the total energy that can be generated in every sea state finally the annual energy production is calculated by taking the annual probability of each sea state into account 31 p a v g 1 t 0 t p m o t o r t d t 32 e 0 t p m o t o r t d t 3 1 the maximum energy that can be generated at each sea state the first step taken towards the calculation of annual average energy that can be captured is to calculate the energy that can be generated at each sea state that is observed in the target area thus every combination of the floats with the parameters of the power take off system is evaluated and the best design for each sea state is determined the wave energy converters designed for analyses are assumed to oscillate in heave direction only and no other part of the system except the float contributes to energy generation the average power and energy generated by candidate wec designs in a sea state are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively these figures show the results obtained for wecs whose float geometry is a semi elliptic paraboloid with a mass m6 and a draft to radius ratio 0 2 the candidate design of wec which generates the maximum energy is considered the best option for that sea state numerical calculations of energy generated by each wave energy converter pointed out that the best wave energy converter differs at each sea state it is subject to the results of a wave energy converter which has a semi ellipsoid float with a mass of 463 7 tonnes are presented in table 4 the draft to radius ratio of the float is 0 2 whose radius is 11 292 m and the draft is 2 259 m the amount of energy generated by the wave energy converters which utilize other float geometries and draft to radius ratios are presented in figs 10 12 the energy generated by a wave energy converter increases with the sea states become more severe and all pto parameters change along with changing sea states however the energy generated at different discharge durations is almost the same in a sea state as can be seen in figs 10 13 this result is a consequence of both the average amount of fluid discharged in 1 h which is determined by the number of charge discharge sequences along with the amount of fluid discharged in one cycle and the maximum pressure attained in the hydraulic accumulator the number of charge discharge sequences varies with discharge duration as can be seen in fig 14 however the amount of fluid discharged in 1 h remains about an average value for all discharge durations as given in fig 15 while it can be assumed that the energy generated by the wecs does not change with changing discharge durations significantly the draft to radius ratio of a wec has a considerable effect on the amount of energy that can be generated the highest amount of energy is generated by the wecs with the smallest draft to radius ratio t r 0 2 and the energy generated decreases by increasing the draft to radius ratio the average amount of the energy generated at ten different discharge durations by the wecs with different float geometries is presented in figs 16 20 the amount of energy generated by the wecs is normalized by dividing all values by the highest energy level among them and plotted against draft to radius ratios along with linear trend lines to show the trend of change of the energy with the draft to radius ratios the displaced masses of all floats are identical which is the greatest mass of floats m6 studied in this paper it can be seen in figs 16 20 that the energy generated decreases with the increasing draft to radius ratio in all sea states the greatest change in the amount of energy generated is observed in the wecs with cylindrical floats because the bottom area of the cylindrical float which determines the magnitude of heave force acting on the float diminishes significantly with increasing draft to radius ratio the calculations show that the maximum working pressure and the effective cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston increase with the sea states become more severe as shown in figs 21 and 22 the instantaneous pressure and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston determine the magnitude of the pto force acting in the opposite direction of the wave force thus the hydraulic piston should exert enough pressure to exceed the pressure inside the high pressure accumulator and to charge it with fluid the increasing wave forces along with the more energetic sea states indicate that it is possible to set the system to operate at high pressures and to have a large piston area to sweep high volumes of fluid however the energetic sea states are observed for a limited time in the target area since the less energetic sea states ss1 ss2 and fd are more dominant throughout the year the values of maximum pressure of the hydraulic accumulator and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston corresponding particularly to ss2 are the best choices among all other cases which enable the wecs to capture the maximum amount of energy in a year on the other hand the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid exhibits an irregular pattern as shown in fig 23 unlike the ones in maximum accumulator pressure and the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston although the average volume of fluid that can be discharged in 1 h is nearly the same at different discharge durations the flow rate and the number of charge discharge sequences differ by the discharge duration consequently the pto of the wec can be optimized to capture the maximum amount of annual energy by setting the maximum pressure of the hydraulic accumulator at a low value 50 60 bars the cross sectional area of the hydraulic piston to a moderate value not greater than 0 1 m2 in all cases and the flow rate to a high value mostly greater than 0 25 m3 s of the ranges of these parameters analyzed in this study 3 2 annual energy production designing a wave energy converter to operate at different sea states with varying power take off parameters may be complicated as a result each set of design parameters that enabled the wec to generate the highest amount of energy in each sea state is evaluated again and the one which performs best in all sea states is determined the results are presented in table 5 and the parameters of the power take off system suitable for sea state 2 performed best in all sea states which is valid for all cases considered in this study the amount of annual energy generated by a wec is calculated by the sum of the energy that is generated at each sea state throughout a year as given in eq 33 where ti ss is the annual duration of each sea state in hours 33 e a n n u a l i 1 5 e a v e 1 h o u r i t s s i 3600 the amount of annual energy generated by the wecs at different discharge durations is very close to each other as can be seen in fig 24 the amount of annual energy generated at different discharge durations exhibits a regular pattern unlike the varying values observed at ss3 and ss4 which can be seen in fig 13 the main reason for this result is that the amount of energy generated at sea states ss1 ss2 and fd have closer values to the average and the durations of these sea states throughout the year are much greater than those of sea states ss3 and ss4 consequently the variations observed in the energy generated at sea states ss3 and ss4 do not have a significant effect on the amount of energy generated annually consequently the amount of energy generated by the wecs either in different sea states or annually can be assumed independent of discharge duration since the amount of energy generated at different discharge durations is close to each other and the differences between them are insignificant however while any discharge duration can be chosen for the design having a long discharge duration may result in a wec to have a large hydraulic capacity and cause the entire structure of the wec to become large the influence of draft to radius ratio on the amount of annual energy generated by the wecs is similar to the amount of energy generated at different sea states the greatest amount of energy is generated by the wecs which have a draft to radius ratio equal to 0 2 and the energy generated decreases by increasing draft to radius ratio the annual energy generated by the wecs with different floats is given in figs 25 27 and the curves fit by employing the least squares method show the trend of change of the energy generated by the draft to radius ratio the ratio of decrease in the amount of energy generated by increasing draft to radius ratio is about 40 in the wecs with a semi ellipsoid float 30 37 in the wecs with a semi elliptic paraboloid float and 54 58 in the wecs with a cylindrical float these results indicate that the energy generated decreases by about half of the maximum energy generated by all wecs while the draft to radius ratio of these wecs increases by five times that of the smallest one the comparison of annual energy generated by wecs with semi ellipsoid semi elliptic paraboloid and cylindrical floats are presented in fig 28 the results show that the wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats are capable of capturing more energy than the ones with semi ellipsoid and cylindrical floats the main reason for this result is that semi elliptic paraboloid floats have a larger surface and projected area than those of semi ellipsoid and cylindrical floats consequently the wave forces acting on the wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats and their heave response are greater than those of other floats in consideration which leads to higher energy generation the amount of annual average energy generated by the wecs increase by increasing the mass of the floats as shown in figs 29 31 the nondimensionalized annual average energy is plotted against nondimensionalized float mass which is carried out by dividing the masses of the floats by the greatest mass mmax m6 among them the rate of increase of the annual energy generated by the wecs with different float masses differs by the geometry of the float and the draft to radius ratios the mass of m5 is almost twice the mass of m4 and the mass of m6 is approximately 73 greater than that of m5 the amount of annual energy generated by wecs with a semi ellipsoid float increases by 12 22 while the mass of the floats increase from m4 to m5 and by 7 13 while the mass of the floats increases from m5 to m6 similarly the amount of annual energy generated by wecs with semi elliptic paraboloid floats increases by 18 26 and by 7 13 while the mass of the floats changes from m4 to m5 and from m5 to m6 respectively finally the rate of increase of the annual average energy generated ranges between 10 and 17 and between 2 and 8 while the mass of cylindrical floats changes from m4 to m5 and from m5 to m6 respectively these results indicate that increasing the mass of the float of a wec has a minor effect on the amount of energy generated when it is compared to the rate of increase of the mass of the floats although the data presented in figs 29 31 point that increasing the mass of the floats may help to increase the amount of energy generated the curves fitted to this data may contradict with this result since the curves tend to extend either asymptotically or with a decreasing pattern with increasing mass which is to be determined by further analysis 3 3 cost analysis the numerical analyses carried out so far indicate that the greatest amount of energy can be generated by a wec built by a heavy and oblate float however this method will make the wec large and result in using a considerable amount of material to manufacture it which will eventually increase the costs thus a cost analysis is also carried out to determine whether or not a heavy and oblate float is the best solution the method for analyzing the cost of energy generated by wecs given in si ocean 2013 is utilized and the results are presented in figs 32 34 along with curves fit the data to display their trends the levelised cost of energy lcoe can be calculated by eq 34 presented as the following 34 l c o e s c i s l d 87 6 l f r 1 r n 1 r n 1 o m 87 6 l f this equation considers the capital costs sci the decommissioning costs sld the load factor lf the discount rate r the lifetime of the energy facility n and the annual operating and maintenance costs of the facility om the approximate values of the parameters appearing in eq 34 can be found in si ocean 2013 the lcoe values of wecs with different floats are normalized by dividing all values by the maximum cost value obtained for each type of wec the calculations show that despite the greatest amount of energy is generated by the wecs which have the smallest draft to radius ratio these wecs are not the most economical ones except the wec with the cylindrical float the lcoe values obtained for wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid floats have similar trends in which the cost of the unit amount of energy increases while the draft to radius ratio both increases and decreases the energy generated by wecs with semi elliptic paraboloids possesses the lowest costs while the draft to radius ratio is approximately 0 7 and the lowest cost of energy which is generated by wecs with semi ellipsoid floats is achieved while the draft to radius ratio is approximately 0 55 on the other hand the cost of energy generated by wecs with cylindrical floats increases with increasing draft to radius ratio the main reason for this result is that increasing the draft to radius ratio of a cylindrical float increases the lateral surface area of the float while it decreases the bottom surface area which contributes to energy generation thus it increases the initial costs of a wec which eventually increases the cost of the energy generated by the wec furthermore the results show that any change in the mass of the float of a wec has a similar effect on the cost of energy generated such that increasing the mass of the float of a wec will increase the cost of energy finally the lcoe of all wecs with different floats that are normalized by dividing the highest cost value is given in fig 35 the wec with a cylindrical float of which the draft to radius ratio is 1 and the mass is m6 has the highest lcoe value among all wecs analyzed in this study the results indicate that the performance of wecs with cylindrical floats of which the masses are m5 and m6 is reduced significantly when the draft to radius ratio is greater than 0 4 however the wecs with cylindrical floats of which the mass is m4 have a better performance in terms of the cost of energy generated 4 validation of numerical results the accuracy of the numerical results obtained in this study is tested by comparing the annual average energy calculated by different methods of numerical solutions different time steps δt and different sets of random phase angles ε between 0 and 2π the numerical methods used to solve the equation of motion are runge kutta 4th order method runge kutta nyström rkn 5th 6th and 7th order methods the time steps utilized for testing the results are 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 s finally five different sets of wave phase angles are generated at each time step and numerical method to model the irregular sea states considered in this study and to calculate the time series of wave forces acting on the floats of the wecs the annual average energy generated by the wec of which the float is a semi ellipsoid with the mass m6 the draft to radius ratio is 0 2 and the discharge duration is 10 s is calculated and the results are presented in table 6 the results show that the amount of annual average energy generated does not differ with changing sets of random phase angles the difference between each result corresponding to each set of random phase angles and the average value of annual energy corresponding to these random phase angles is less than 1 5 in all cases moreover the differences between the results of different numerical methods at different time steps are insignificant consequently rkn 5th order method is chosen for evaluating the response of the wecs in waves with a time step of 0 1 s since the results obtained by different numerical methods at different time steps are very close to each other and due to this method has the shortest calculation time among all others 5 conclusion the search for an optimized point absorber wave energy converter suitable for deploying off the turkish coast of the black sea is carried out to draw guidelines that can help designers in the preliminary design stage by taking a broad range of variables into account the results indicate that the wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid floats have similar performances while the wecs with cylindrical floats have poorer performances while a heavy and oblate float helps to increase the energy captured by a wec this type of float geometry also causes the cost of energy to increase the maximum amount of energy is captured by the wecs when the draft is small compared to the radius in all cases on the other hand having a small draft to radius ratio makes a wec with a cylindrical float the most economical one while the draft to radius ratios of wecs with semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid should be greater than that of the cylindrical wec to achieve the most economical configuration increasing the mass of the float seems to have a limited effect on the energy captured since the ratio of increase in the annual average energy is considerably smaller than the ratio of increase of the mass the results show that the discharge duration of the high pressure accumulator does not affect the amount of energy generated so any value can be chosen during the design stage the values of the maximum pressure of the high pressure accumulator and the effective cross sectional area of the hydraulic cylinder increase with the sea states become more energetic but such sea states are observed for a short period during the year in the target area thus the values of these parameters corresponding to the more dominant but less energetic sea states turned out to be the best choice to maximize the annual energy absorption finally the analyses indicate that the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid depends on the discharge duration chosen in the design stage while the total amount of fluid that can be charged into the hydraulic accumulator in a given wec depends on the sea state the flow rate may be different at different discharge durations the numerical calculations carried out in this study are based on linear potential flow theory where the wave forces are evaluated on the mean wetted surface of the wecs however the wecs which can generate the greatest amount of energy have shallow drafts as a result the wetted surface area of the floats may not remain unchanged or nearly unchanged due to heave motion it is particularly correct for the float geometries considered in this study except for the cylindrical one consequently calculating the wave forces acting on the floats with small drafts nonlinearly by taking the instantaneous wetted surface into account would result in more accurate solutions credit authorship contribution statement i̇lkay özer erselcan software validation formal analysis writing original draft visualization abdi kükner conceptualization

21378,the study of how fluid interacts with aquaculture cages and how it influences fish swimming behaviour has proven to be of great importance for designing offshore aquaculture cage systems this review examines the fluid structure interactions between structures and organisms within cage based aquaculture using data from previous research we list and classify aquaculture cages into net cage and closed cage systems net cage aquaculture systems are classified with regards to their submergence materials and aperture shapes of nets then the comparison is made between the research methods used to assess the interactions between environmental loads and aquaculture cages this comparison includes analytical studies numerical implementations field tests and laboratory experiments we also provide reviews of topics such as mooring and grid systems drag coefficients of the net panel hydrodynamic behaviours of cage components velocity reduction of cage array and volume reduction caused by cage deformation in particular fish swimming behaviour is reviewed for designing new open ocean aquaculture systems to support the further development of aquaculture engineering and technology statistics tables formulae and figures are provided keywords fluid structure interaction aquaculture cage fish swimming behaviour contents 1 introduction 1 1 drivers and limitations aquaculture is a globally sustainable industry that provides food and bioenergy to the world s growing population it plays a critical role in supplying protein to people in low income food deficient countries in 2016 according to a report from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations nearly half of the fish consumed by humans were provided by aquaculture fao 2018 at this time global aquaculture production including aquatic plants totalled 110 2 million tons and was valued at usd 243 5 billion aquaculture produced approximately 54 1 million tons of finfish usd 138 5 billion 17 1 million tons of molluscs usd 29 2 billion and 30 1 million tons of aquatic plants usd 11 7 billion many of the major fish producing countries are in south asia the most dominant producers include china 61 5 india 7 1 indonesia 6 2 vietnam 4 5 and bangladesh 2 8 aquaculture s effects on global sustainability are mostly discussed in relation to seafood production overfishing and environmental hazards demonstrate that it is challenging to meet the fao s target to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by 2030 given the increasing world population seafood demand could reach approximately 180 million tons fao 2018 future increases in seafood production should come from farming rather than fishing because of aquaculture farming s reduced environmental impact langan 2009 over the past five decades aquaculture farming has increased exponentially alongside this growth due to limited near shore space and increased environmental pollution there has been a shift towards open ocean aquaculture farming costa pierce and bridger 2002 fredriksson et al 2003 kitzhofer et al 2011 klebert et al 2015 the size of these aquaculture farms is growing meaning they can help contribute the increasing demands of seafood production most offshore farming is concerned with finfish however there has been growing interest in the offshore culture of shellfish langan 2009 shellfish can be grown at much larger scales thanks to operations such as longline and raft shellfish farming the fao reports that shelled molluscs occupy 58 8 of the production of marine and coastal aquaculture fao 2018 this suggests that offshore aquaculture farming is a method for providing sustainable seafood large scale open water aquaculture farming is a sustainable method that can help satisfy human food and biofuel demands while emitting lower levels of greenhouse gases than other farming practices despite the considerable benefits of aquaculture several limitations exist that make large scale implementation difficult in offshore regions the largest of these is the potentially harsh oceanic conditions which place heavy design constraints on the structures accordingly aquaculture farming systems must be designed to withstand these ever changing oceanic conditions and to provide a dependable habitat for the relevant marine organisms focus on fluid structure interaction fsi supports the integrity and longevity of aquaculture systems and is therefore an important area of research this paper reviews the fluid structure interactions of cage based aquaculture the goal of this review is to highlight the fundamental studies that have contributed to a mechanistic understanding of how fluid interacts with aquaculture cages and how it influences fish swimming behaviour this review is organised as follows section 2 provides the classification of the aquaculture cage systems section 3 identifies the hydrodynamic behaviours this includes but is not limited to hydrodynamic forces and cage deformation alongside the hydrodynamic behaviours comparisons of available researching methods calculations of velocity and volume reductions of aquaculture cages are examined section 4 elaborates on the fluid interactions with fish highlighting fish swimming behaviours and hydrodynamic performances section 5 gives the concluding remarks and suggestions for future research 2 classification of aquaculture cages typical aquaculture includes finfish shellfish and seaweed farming aquaculture methods can be aquaponics rakocy et al 2004 mariculture goldburg et al 2001 and integrated multi trophic aquaculture chopin et al 2001 aquaculture structures vary depending on the type and method of aquaculture as various structures function differently to meet international seafood and substitutive energy demands large scaled aquaculture structures such as open ocean net pens and longlines are recommended these are shown in fig 1 all aquaculture structures are exposed to various levels of the water column and have interactions with the surrounding fluid recent studies which consider the holistic characteristics of marine organisms have shown that when farmed together marine bivalves that extract organics and seaweeds which absorb dissolved nutrients benefit the environment and facilitate sustainable production fao 2018 this aggregate approach to farming works even better when fish molluscs and other aquatic plants are grown together on an ecosystem level this technique is referred to as an integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta system and is portrayed in fig 1 costa pierce and bridger 2002 classified all the available commercial aquaculture cages based on their location operation environment and structure their groupings included the following types of cages surface oriented anchor tensioned self tensioned semi rigid submersible and barge type lekang 2008 classified aquaculture cages as extensive intensive or semi intensive based on their production per unit volume m³ or framed unit area m2 the author also summarised previous methods of classifying cage systems beveridge 2008 huguenin 1997 loverich and gace 1997 one method was based on where a cage is situated within the water column the relevant categories included floating submerged and submersible another corresponded to the type of net frame used in the cages rigid or flexible most recently chu et al 2020 categorised aquaculture cages as either net cage systems or closed containment tank systems based on their containment methods accordingly this review categorises aquaculture systems as either net cage or closed cage furthermore net cage aquaculture systems are classified depending on their submergence materials and the apertures of their nets 2 1 net cage aquaculture systems 2 1 1 classification based on submergence beveridge 2008 classified aquaculture cages into four primary groups fixed floating submersible and submerged cages that are in the floating submersible and submerged categories can either be flexible or rigid fixed cages are inexpensive and easy to construct but can only be deployed in shallow water because of their size and shape a floating cage is supported by several buoyant collars given that floating cages can be a variety of shapes and sizes this type of cage is the most widely used a floating cage s collar can be either wide or narrow the wide collar is typically used for large cages as it provides a working platform one advantage of submersible cages is that their positions can be adjusted in the water column to avoid severe weather conditions like storms accordingly submerged cages are permanently kept underwater to protect the organisms within however pérez et al 2003 did not recommend deploying any cages where significant wave heights are expected to exceed 8 9 m fig 2 depicts five typical flexible aquaculture cage systems ordered based on their submergences for modern industrial fish farming high density polyethylene hdpe is the most widely used material for flexible cage collars one advantage of flexible cages is that cage deformation can reduce the forces incident waves exert on the structures alongside this they can easily be formed into different configurations however cage deformation can result in a loss of oxygen the surface floating gravity type cage fig 2 a is the most commonly used cage for finfish farming many publications examined the hydrodynamic characteristics of this kind of cage and its components such as the mooring system the floating collar and the net system as demonstrated in section 3 of this paper the submersible tension leg aquaculture cage e g tlc refa is shown in fig 2 b tsukrov et al 2003 used a consistent net element to study the dynamic performance of this fish cage they did this under typical and extreme environmental loading conditions at the unh aquaculture demonstration sites their results showed that extreme environmental loading could cause large deformation but moderate tensions regarding the submersible seastation cage shown by fig 2 d the mooring dynamics in single cage fredriksson et al 2003 and four cage fredriksson et al 2004 arrangements have been studied using physical and numerical models these studies validated design criteria for future applications of cage deployment section 3 1 of this paper will discuss studies relating to the single point mooring dynamics of the submersible ocean cage aquaculture technology ocat cage fig 2 c and the submerged aquapod cage fig 2 e compared to flexible aquaculture cage systems rigid aquaculture cage systems share distinctive features they are large structures and constructed from steel they can integrate feeding systems harvest cranes and surveillance systems given their rigid frames the cages maintain their volumes and keep fish in place scott and muir 2000 these design features contribute to a new generation of aquaculture fish farms even with their advantages these rigid cages have high investment costs and it is difficult to change or clean their nets fig 3 displays five typical rigid aquaculture cage systems including some novel design concepts ordered according to their submergences as shown in fig 3 a this floating vessel shaped fish farm has been designed to withstand strong wave and current loads in the open ocean li et al 2017 used a simplified rigid model to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel shaped fish farm in the frequency domain their results showed that the current and net elements affected the drift motions and mooring tensions li and ong 2017 conducted a hydrodynamic analysis of the semi submersible rigid fish farm as shown in fig 3 b based on linear potential theory underestimation has been observed for the heave and surge motions while overestimation has been observed for the pitch motion to study the hydrodynamic performance of the ocean farm 1 fish farm fig 3 c a finite element analysis and scaled model experiments were conducted it was found that the wave parameters draught and net significantly influence the fish farm s hydrodynamic response dou 2018 zhao et al 2019 the semi submersible spar fish farm was designed by de mass smc a dutch offshore oil and gas engineering company as depicted in fig 3 d the central tower can be used to integrate machinery feeding systems and it provides accommodation for operators this semi submersible spar fish farm is protected from storms because of its adjustable submergence the integration of a renewable energy system and a submerged aquaculture cage shown in fig 3 e has been proposed based on the multiple use concept buck and krause 2012 the last thing regarding submergence is that a cage s submergence will influence its mooring lines design this includes features such as the length of a mooring line and the selection of the materials used for moorings fredriksson et al 2004 tsukrov et al 2005 mooring components such as lines anchors and hardware must be specified based on aquaculture structures and their submergences furthermore the length of the net is also determined by the submergence 2 1 2 classification based on materials of nets the materials used in aquaculture engineering have been studied since the 1970s ravindran 1983 according to norwegian legislation standards norge 2009 an aquaculture cage must satisfy several conditions for example a structure must function satisfactorily in all environmental conditions and it must be resistant to biological effects e g biofouling therefore an aquaculture structure s material properties must be considered during fluid structure interaction analysis because they significantly affect the forces and deformations that the structure experiences whether they are physical e g density or mechanical e g young s modulus cage components consist of net twines woven nets ropes and pipes which are made from materials such as fibres polymers metals and alloys ashby and jones 1996 the net chamber provides a closed habitat to promote organisms growth it must offer protection from predators be nutrient and oxygen rich be free from pollution and also prevent the organisms from escaping fishing nets are made of natural materials e g plant fibre because they are inexpensive and easy to obtain however plant fibre is likely to decompose when exposed to water for a long time replacing this with polymer material offers several advantages increased longevity high breaking strength and light weight even with these advantages polymer materials are still susceptible to the effects of biofouling biofouling causes severe problems and results in increased labour and maintenance to circumnavigate this issue researchers substituted the polymer material with metals and alloys because they are resistant to corrosion and biofouling accordingly metals and alloys have been extensively used to make aquaculture nets chu et al 2020 dong et al 2020 efird 1976 efird and anderson 1975 powell and stillman 2009 tsukrov et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 most net materials used in field measurements and experimental tests are polyamide pa rather than polyethylene terephthalate pet or polyethylene pe these three materials have very similar elastic moduli and elongations at failure the only difference between them is their tensile strength pet has the greatest ranging from 35 to 210 mpa while pa s ranges from 60 to 140 mpa cardia and lovatelli 2015 dowling 2012 this material characteristic makes pet difficult to mould mckeen 2016 cages could be circular conical square rectangular or dish like however most cages have circular designs because they make the most efficient use of materials per unit volume moreover circular cages make optimal use of space with regards to fish swimming behaviour beveridge 2008 the fouling resistance of copper and its alloys provide more conducive ecosystems for marine organisms given their advantages of lower biofouling and volume deforming copper and copper alloy nets have reduced maintenance and operation costs the new semi submersible spar fish farm concept shown in fig 3 d has a cage net made of copper alloy materials however potential challenges remain regarding installation and deployment from a fluid structure interaction perspective researchers primarily focus on hydrodynamic forces and the deformation of cages because they are relevant to structural safety and stability furthermore large deformations allow fish to escape and causes a loss of oxygen and nutrition steel and copper alloys could prevent large deformations caused by high current velocity 2 1 3 classification based on apertures of nets aquaculture nets can be manufactured via knitting such as warp knitting also known as raschel net or via twisting and chain linking to form square diamond and hexagon meshes based on manufacturing processes nets can be knotted or knotless as both types are commonly used in aquaculture lekang 2008 there is little difference in the use of these nets with different apertures the aperture shape of a net significantly affects the flow field around the meshes consequently the drag induced by the wake behind a diamond mesh is higher than that of a square mesh bi et al 2017a the different aquaculture nets used for fish farming are shown in fig 4 square and diamond meshes have excellent durability in strong currents and are easy to repair however these two types of mesh take longer to manufacture the hexagon mesh has more vertical elasticity allowing it to endure harsh wave situations it is also easy to repair however it can be challenging to measure the dimensions of the hexagon mesh due to net deformation mesh size is a crucial parameter used to calculate the solidity ratio of a net solidity ratios are used to study the environmental loads acting on a net which are induced by the fluids surrounding it researchers have provided different empirical formulae to calculate the solidity ratio of a net considering knotted nets løland 1991 assumed the diameter of a knotted part to be double that of the twine so the solidity ratio is given as 1 s n 2 d w l w 1 2 d w l w 2 where d w is the twine diameter and l w is the length of the mesh side of the net without considering the knotted parts of the net the following formula is also used decew et al 2010b lader et al 2007b 2 s n 2 d w l w d w l w 2 when assuming the knotted parts of the net are so small to be negligible aarsnes et al 1990 fridman and carrothers 1986 klebert et al 2015 the following expression is used 3 s n 2 d w l w if the diameter of a knot is less than two times the twine s diameter it is better to use eq 3 rather than eq 1 for nets with square meshes eqs 1 3 are used for nets with diamond meshes the solidity ratio is given as for a knotless net 4 s n d w l w e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 for a knotted net 5 s n 2 l w d w d w 2 2 l w 2 e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 π d w 2 8 d w d w 8

width and height d w is the diameter of the sphere i e the knot currently there is no established formula for nets with hexagonal meshes 2 2 closed cage aquaculture systems closed cage aquaculture systems were introduced during the 1990s beveridge 2008 using a closed cage instead of a conventional net cage provides a solution to ecological challenges such as sea lice and other parasites fish escapes diseases and water pollution chu et al 2020 strand 2018 based on structural properties closed cage aquaculture systems can be categorised as flexible membrane cages fabric or glass fabric and rigid cages steel or glass fibre reinforced plastics as depicted in fig 5 the closed flexible membrane cage consists of a floating collar a mooring system and an impermeable flexible membrane this membrane is typically made of fabric material currently novel closed rigid aquaculture systems are still within concept design or construction phases one advantage of the closed cage aquaculture system is that water replacement can be controlled the water replacement system keeps the water regularly refreshed and provides suitable temperatures sufficient oxygen and waste removal however when these cage structures are deployed to offshore sites a power supply is required chu et al 2020 a closed cage aquaculture system interacts with sea loads when it is subjected to waves and currents due to the internal free surface the cage also experiences internal water motions known as sloshing the closed flexible membrane cage behaves hydro elastically meaning that the deformation of and the hydrodynamic forces on the membrane are nearly coupled this is because the deformations and fluid forces on the closed flexible cage are dependent on both the external and internal hydrodynamic pressures and the structure dynamics because of the limited closed cage aquaculture system use cases the hydrodynamic response and fluid forces on the system still have not been completely understood future research challenges for the closed aquaculture cage system include analysing the pressure and the deformation e g closed flexible cage wave and current loads structure responses and sloshing strand 2018 physical model experiments have been conducted to gain an understanding of the hydrodynamic behaviour of closed flexible cages in still water strand et al 2014 currents lader et al 2015 strand et al 2013 2016 and waves lader et al 2017 cylindrical cubical conical pyramidal and ellipsoidal cages have been tested it was found that the drag coefficient of the closed flexible cage increased as the filling level decreased sloshing and structure response have been studied using model tests lader et al 2017 and numerical simulations strand and faltinsen 2017 2019 2020 all the results showed that the hydrodynamic response was highly dependent on geometry and filling level numerical and experimental studies have been conducted to investigate a closed rigid cage under regular waves kristiansen et al 2018 the results showed that sloshing affected the coupled surge and pitch motions significantly it is suggested that future work facilitates three dimensional numerical studies of sloshing it would be helpful if numerical results can be verified with physical model tests cage deformation alongside hydrodynamic forces must be analysed together in the time domain moreover far field waves caused by structures should be taken into consideration when determining the hydrodynamic characteristics of closed cage systems the closed cage aquaculture system is a novel cage design concept its interaction with fluids has been studied and suggestions for future research have been provided here in the next section of this paper the components that most aquaculture cage systems have such as the mooring system the floating collar and the net system are studied with regards to fluid structure interactions the shielding effect and the deformation of the net cage systems will also be addressed 3 fluid structure interactions 3 1 mooring and grid systems 3 1 1 classification of moorings it is necessary to analyse aquaculture structures mooring systems in various environmental conditions to help prevent their failure and the subsequent escape of farmed organisms the mooring systems of aquaculture structures include catenary taut leg single point and spread line configurations fredriksson and beck stimpert 2019 single point mooring spm aquaculture cage systems have been recommended as an alternative to the traditional mooring grid array arrangement this is because as tidal currents change directions they can move around their anchor points fredriksson et al 2007b four examples of spm aquaculture cages with different submergence are depicted in fig 6 the surface floating gravity type cage fig 6 a has been modelled as subjected to waves and currents using the lumped mass method a safety factor of 1 5 was recommended for its polyethylene terephthalate pet mooring line huang and pan 2010 the submersible ocean cage aquaculture technology ocat cage shown in fig 6 b has been studied numerically and experimentally under various currents the results showed that its mooring tension was not linearly dependent on its cage submersion depth decew et al 2010b the self submersible spm cage depicted in fig 6 c has been investigated with numerical simulations and model tests in random waves these studies showed that the cage was more effective in wind waves than in swell waves shainee et al 2014 the submerged aquapod cage shown in fig 6 d has been studied with both numerical simulations and field tests in different arrangements these cages showed that a mooring grid was tolerant of currents from various directions goudey 2009 most recently an experimental study analysed the hydrodynamic performance of a vessel shaped spm aquaculture system huang et al 2020 this found that under combined wave current conditions current can reduce the mooring chain s pulse effect several drawbacks of the spm system must be assessed when designing moorings first additional safety factors should be considered during the selection of anchors mooring lines and other structural components second if the mooring experiences significant motion this can cause the connected hardware to fail lastly adopting the spm causes periodic changes in the direction of the tension applied to the anchor this variability must be considered when designing the mooring system unlike single point mooring mooring grid systems are either square or rectangle shaped grids this configuration allows aquaculture cages to be connected to several mooring lines the mooring grid system is designed to reduce cage disturbances caused by waves and currents the number of the cages in a mooring grid system ranges from 1 bai et al 2016 fredriksson et al 2003 fullerton et al 2004 hou et al 2017 huang et al 2007 shen et al 2018 yang et al 2019 2 huang et al 2008 zhao et al 2015b 4 decew et al 2010a fredriksson et al 2004 xu et al 2012 zhao et al 2015b 8 winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 zhao et al 2015b 16 bi et al 2017b to 20 fredriksson et al 2007b as depicted in fig 7 mooring grid systems are often kept at depths of 5 10 m underwater to avoid contact between their mooring ropes and the propellers of the working and well boats wires are the most fundamental element used in mooring lines and the netting frames of aquaculture structures they are laid in specific patterns to form strands that provide a rope with tensile strength tsukrov et al 2005 summarised the mechanical properties of the ropes and cables used for aquaculture cage mooring which were designed to withstand hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads specifically using finite element models they studied synthetic fibres nylon tire cord reinforced rubber stretch hoses and potentially light weight electromechanical cables rope structures can be categorised into two types twisted and braided ropes these rope types usually consist of 3 4 or 6 laid strands 8 plaited strands or 12 strands and double braid where each strand includes several twisted yarns forum 2008 mckenna et al 2004 to enhance the abrasion resistance of a braided rope a coating is employed a few typical ropes used in aquaculture moorings are exhibited in fig 8 3 1 2 analysis of moorings when analysing the mooring system three items must be considered because if they failed they could allow fish to escape 1 the design criteria of the mooring line 2 the coupling of mooring and aquaculture cages and 3 the hydrodynamic effects active on the mooring cage system the variables relevant to mooring design and fatigue analysis include the mooring length the mooring tension and the cage positions a hydrostatic analysis is necessary to determine how the static shape of the mooring gird can be maintained the static equilibrium of the tension loads in the anchor legs is estimated using the catenary equations faltinsen 1993 these equations can be used to specify the chain forming the catenary in the anchor leg the catenary equations are expressed as follows 6 d x t h a w s i n h 1 t v a w s t h a s i n h 1 t v a t h a t h a s e a 7 d z t h a w 1 t v a w s t h a 2 1 t v a t h a 2 t h a s e a w s 2 2 e a where d x and d z are the deflections of the mooring line in the horizontal and vertical directions parameter s represents the arclength from the end of the line w is the weight per unit length t h a and t v a are the horizontal and vertical components of tension e a is axial stiffness of the mooring line e is the elastic modulus and a is the cross sectional area of the mooring line for the hydrodynamic analysis of the mooring cage system three numerical models which incorporate the finite element method and the morison equation are used these are the consistent net element model decew et al 2010b fredriksson et al 2004 tsukrov et al 2003 the lumped mass model hou et al 2017 huang et al 2006 yang et al 2019 and the mass spring model cha and lee 2018 lee et al 2008 in these numerical models mooring lines are represented using truss elements or finite mass points interconnected by massless springs a nonlinear lagrangian approach is employed to account for large displacements of the structural elements or mass points to solve the nonlinear equations of motion newmark direct integration or runge kutta schemes are adopted the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural elements i e moorings are calculated using the morison equation after comparison with validated experimental measurements the results showed that the consistent net element model overestimated the mooring tension this was because of an overestimation of the inertia of the netting shen et al 2018 tsukrov et al 2003 in other words the equivalent truss elements cannot accurately represent a net panel subjected to waves and currents tsukrov et al 2000 the mass spring model and the lumped mass model also overestimated the mooring tension because they 1 did not consider the interference of the flow field and 2 used empirical values for the hydrodynamic coefficients cha and lee 2018 huang et al 2006 3 2 fluid interacting with floating collars the floating collar or the framework subjected to a high energy oceanic environment has several functions 1 supporting the whole cage in the water 2 maintaining the volume of the cage and 3 providing buoyancy for the entire cage system floating collars can be categorised as being either rigid or flexible and are usually made of different materials such as steel and high density polyethylene hdpe over the last ten years hdpe collars have been widely adopted for use in modern industrial fish farming fredheim and langan 2009 the floating collar can be shaped as circular polygonal or square lekang 2008 the rigid framework functions as a stable working platform for operation and management but may experience structural failure in extreme conditions in comparison flexible frameworks have excellent impact resistance to wave forces this kind of structure is used extensively for large commercial aquaculture systems scott and muir 2000 the environmental loads caused by waves and currents acting on the floating collar can be examined with either two dimensional or three dimensional studies newman 1977 3 2 1 two dimensional studies of floating collar segments the hydrodynamic behaviour of a floating collar can be studied by dividing it into several segments i e strip theory each segment is treated as a partially submerged rigid cylinder li et al 2007 the hydrodynamic forces active on a floating collar are calculated by totalling the forces on each segment then the hydrodynamic forces active on a floating collar are calculated by totalling the forces active on each individual segment analytical approaches such as the potential theory have been widely used to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of partially submerged circular cylinders ursell 1949 yu and ursell 1961 alternatively with the development of the morison equation morison et al 1950 researchers can also empirically predict the hydrodynamic forces on cylinders with different cross sections however the hydrodynamic coefficients in the morison equation namely the drag coefficient c d and the inertia coefficient c m must be gathered from either physical experiments or numerical implementations sarpkaya 1976 obtained the drag and inertia coefficients of a submerged horizontal cylinder using the morison equation the experimental results showed that these two hydrodynamic coefficients were functions of the keulegan carpenter kc and reynolds re numbers the empirical formulae of hydrodynamic coefficients based on kc numbers were also exhibited in xu et al 2018 the authors considered the effect of distance between the upstream and downstream segments of a floating collar accordingly the hydrodynamic coefficients have been evaluated the hydrodynamic coefficients were significantly lower for the downstream segments due to shielding from the upstream segments to obtain more accurate results the buoyancy of the submerged horizontal cylinder and the free surface effect were considered dixon 1980 experimentally investigated the interaction between waves and a partially submerged horizontal cylinder chen et al 2015 conducted numerical simulations to predict the wave forces of a partially submerged rectangular cylinder here the morison equation was modified to account for the free surface in terms of buoyancy li et al 2013b proposed a distribution method to calculate the transient buoyancy of a floating collar segment in waves qu et al 2017 studied a solitary tsunami like wave passing over two dimensional horizontal cylinders the hydrodynamic forces on and the vorticity behind the cylinders were obtained using a cfd scheme to evaluate the heave motion of a semi immersed cylinder loh et al 2018 used a two dimensional numerical model based on a modified morison equation chen et al 2013 experimentally investigated the high order force components of a near wall circular cylinder in oscillating flow cfd approaches have been employed to analyse the interactions between fluid and segments of a floating collar chen and christensen 2018 xu et al 2018 compared to experimental measurements cfd models slightly underestimated the fluid forces because of the effect of reynolds numbers two dimensional potential theory and the morison equation provide simplified models for evaluating a floating collar s hydrodynamic behaviour in the preliminary design stage of an aquaculture cage it is simple to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients using two dimensional studies however to analyse the effects of the wave especially the effects of wave frequency and far field a three dimensional study is required 3 2 2 three dimensional studies of floating collars the slender body theory and asymptotic expansion method have been used to investigate a three dimensional flow interacting with a floating rigid torus newman 1977 here the heave surge and pitch of the torus and the three dimensional effects of incident waves were evaluated based on this analytical investigation the hydroelastic effects on the dynamic response of floating collars have been studied fredriksson et al 2007a also beam theory curved beam theory and modified beam theory have been introduced to help study the nonlinear deformation and hydroelasticity of the floating collar dong et al 2010 investigated the dynamic response of a floating collar based on euler s law and curved beam theory the translation and rotation of the collar and the elastic deformation were obtained using the same theory zhao et al 2015a analysed the elastic response of a floating collar in waves li et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model based on curved beam theory that accounts for axial tension and curvature effects their obtained vertical accelerations of the floating collar are proportional to the non dimensional wave numbers shen et al 2018 experimentally investigated the dynamic response of a floating collar by considering its elastic properties the results showed that the elastic properties significantly affected the load distribution on the floating collar most recently qin et al 2020a 2020b studied the dynamic response and mooring loads of a floating collar and cage with both experimental and numerical approaches the authors reported that low frequency waves strongly affected the higher order harmonic components of the vertical acceleration it is important to note that frequency dependent hydrodynamic interaction between the incident waves and a floating collar can cause three dimensional effects therefore two dimensional strip theory and the morison equation are unable to predict a floating collar s overall hydrodynamic behaviour the discrepancy between strip theory and three dimensional potential theory is significant especially when predicting the added mass and damping of the floating collar caused by low frequency wave conditions 3 3 fluid interacting with net system a net cage provides an enclosure within which organisms can grow the net is made of different materials and has distinctive apertures for various purposes as discussed in section 2 understanding hydrodynamic impact could help improve the net design with respect to the water exchange and the cage deformation conventional methods for current force calculations and the deformation of aquaculture cage structures include four steps løland 1991 1 dividing the net cage into several net panels which could be parallel normal or with an angle arbitrary to the flow direction 2 the current velocity is reduced when flow passes through the net panel in accordance with the velocity reduction ratio 3 each net panel experiences drag force and deformation the drag and deformation depend on the flow velocity orientation net solidity and the weight of the sinkers 4 the total drag force of the cage is obtained by totalling the drag forces acting on each net panel 3 3 1 analytical studies of fluid forces several empirical formulae have been considered to evaluate the fluid forces acting on the net panels and aquaculture cages these empirical formulae can be divided into two categories those based on the morison equation choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b donley 1991 kawakami 1959 and those based on the screen aarsnes et al 1990 balash et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 milne 1972 zhan et al 2006 for those based on the morison equation the net is represented by a combination of individual twines and the fluid force on the net is equal to the total forces exerted on all net twines while for the formulae based on the screen the net is represented by several subpanels i e screens 3 3 1 1 empirical formulae based on morison equation to evaluate viscous loads on nets using morison type force model the net is represented by an equivalent system of slender cylinders i e twines the hydrodynamic forces acting on the twine can be estimated using the morison equation morison et al 1950 kawakami 1959 1964 evaluated the resistance of a flexible net panel in a uniform flow based on the morison equation they proposed a simple analytical formula as 8 f d c d 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where f d is the drag force of the net panel ρ is the fluid density a p is the project area of the net panel u is current velocity c d is the drag coefficient depending on the solidity ratio and the attack angle α for an ordinary twine in the net panel normal c d is approximately equal to 1 5 kawakami 1959 choo and casarella 1971 investigated the hydrodynamic resistance of towed cables by dividing the resistance into two components the normal and tangential resistance of the cable the authors found the resistance coefficients to be the function of the reynolds number the formulae are shown as follows 9 c d n 8 π r e n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 r e n 1 1 45 8 55 r e n 0 90 1 r e n 30 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 10 5 10 c d t π μ 0 55 r e n 1 2 0 084 r e n 2 3 where c d n and c d t are the normal and tangential coefficients of the resistance μ is the fluid viscosity s is the arc length between the lower end point and a material point of cable in an unstrained state s 0 077215665 ln 8 r e n r e n is the reynolds number based on the normal velocity when r e n is less than 2 33 10 5 eq 11 is used to evaluate the normal resistance coefficient 11 c d n 10 435 r e n 0 761 1 083 the approximation proposed by choo and casarella 1971 does not consider the reduction of the drag which is especially important at high reynolds numbers when the flow is turbulent thus decew et al 2010b expanded these formulae as shown in eq 12 12 c d n 8 π r e n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 r e n 1 1 45 8 55 r e n 0 90 1 r e n 30 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 2 33 10 5 3 41 10 6 r e n 5 78 10 5 2 33 10 5 r e n 4 92 10 5 0 401 1 e r e n 5 99 10 5 4 92 10 5 r e n 10 7 where e is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2 71828 these formulae from decew et al 2010b have only been tested for knotless netting with square meshes the reynolds number is in a range 286 4 4 10 4 s n is less than 0 238 representing the solidity ratio of a full scale net these formulae are valid for full scale cage structures at high current velocities e g 2 m s for knotted net donley 1991 and decew et al 2010b considered each knot as a sphere the authors proposed the flowing expressions for drag coefficients 13 c d 30 824 r e 0 8465 0 4347 0 r e 3 803 10 5 9 222 10 6 r e 4 3025 10 5 3 803 10 5 r e 4 165 10 5 0 0928 0 8 e 1 r e 1 3201 10 5 4 165 10 5 r e 1 259 10 6 0 1488 1 e r e 1 286 10 6 1 259 10 6 r e 10 8 only one drag component is required due to the symmetric geometry of the sphere many publications also provided the empirical values for the drag coefficients of the sphere i e the knot fredheim 2003 suggested that the drag coefficients of the knotted parts should be in a range from 1 0 to 2 0 several values were specially selected from 1 0 xu et al 2011 zhao et al 2007a 1 5 lee et al 2008 1 6 li et al 2006 to 2 0 zhao et al 2015c however these empirical values have been obtained without considering the effect of surface roughness which significantly affects the drag coefficients zdravkovich 1997 3 3 1 2 empirical formulae based on the screen unlike the morison equation based empirical formulae the screen based formulae used to evaluate the drag coefficient depend on the solidity ratio of a net the drag force acting on the screen or subpanel can be calculated as 14 d f d c d 1 2 ρ u 2 d a where d f d is the drag force on the subpanel c d is the drag coefficient and d a is the projected area of the screen milne 1972 estimated the drag coefficients of knotted and knotless nets with square meshes using the following empirical formulae for a knotless net 15 c d 1 0 1 365 s n 0 780 s n 2 for a knotted net 16 c d 1 0 1 885 s n 2 343 s n 2 where s n 2 d w l w d w is the twine diameter and l w is the length of a mesh bar the solidity ratios used in milne 1972 range from 0 2 clear net to 0 8 fouled net five water velocities from 0 25 m s to 1 5 m s in increments of 0 25 m s were applied to the system during full scale physical model testing the considered reynolds numbers are in a range 389 5 10 ³ the obtained drag coefficients for clear nets without biofouling effects vary from 1 260 to 1 416 while for biofouling nets the obtained drag coefficients vary between 2 129 and 3 985 similarly aarsnes et al 1990 and løland 1991 established an empirical relation for drag coefficients regarding the solidity ratio and the angle of attack c d is expressed as 17 c d 0 04 0 04 s n 1 24 s n 2 13 7 s n 3 sin α where α is the angle of attack when α equals 0 the net panel is parallel to the current direction yielding c d to be 0 04 the reynolds numbers used in aarsnes et al 1990 are between 200 and 1400 furthermore this formula is only used for square mesh nets where the solidity ratio s n is less than 0 35 s n 2 d w l w it should be noted that eq 15 to eq 17 do not consider the effect of the reynolds number to further explain the discrepancy between the empirical formula estimate and the experimental test results the effect of the reynolds number must be introduced zhan et al 2006 estimated the drag coefficients of diamond mesh nets with reynolds numbers ranging from 174 to 1 4 10 ³ while considering the interactions between net twines their drag coefficients are calculated with the following expression 18 c d 1 0 0 137 u n 1 002 s n 2 230 s n 2 where u n is the normal component of velocity for net panels with low solidity ratio e g 0 18 the drag coefficient is almost constant in the considered reynolds numbers eq 18 over predicts the drag coefficient due to the energy losses caused by shielding effects to account for the increased velocity when the flow passes through the net balash et al 2009 proposed the flowing expressions to calculate the drag coefficient for a knotless net 19 c d c d c y l 8 03 s n 2 0 74 s n 0 12 for a knotted net 20 c d c d c y l c d s p π d w l w 8 d w 2 1 π d w l w 8 d w 2 8 03 s n 2 0 74 s n 0 12 where c d c y l and c d s p are the drag coefficients for a circular cylinder and a sphere respectively d w is the diameter of the sphere i e the knot d w and l w are the diameter and length of the net bar according to white and corfield 2006 the drag coefficients of a circular cylinder and a sphere can be approximated for r e 5 10 ³ as 21 c d c y l 1 10 r e c 2 3 22 c d s p 24 r e c 6 1 r e c 1 2 0 4 where r e c is the corrected reynolds number which is characterized by the corrected velocity u c equal to u 1 s n 23 r e c u d w ν 1 s n the estimated reynolds numbers can be substituted in the formulae from balash et al 2009 to determine the drag coefficients of the nets the solidity ratio of the tested net is under 0 235 and the reynolds number ranges from 92 to 5 10 ³ the analytical model on average overestimated the drag coefficient this overestimate is most likely attributed to the absence of surface roughness to derive more general formulae suitable for application with a wider range of solidity ratios kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed a formula to calculate the drag coefficient of the nets which incorporates the reynolds number and the solidity ratio 24 c d c d c y l s n 2 s n 2 1 s n 2 the authors used a seventh order polynomial to approximate the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder i e single net twine at 10 3 2 r e 10 4 the seventh order polynomial is expressed as 25 c d c y l 78 46675 254 7873 log 10 re 327 8864 log 10 re 2 223 64577 log 10 re 3 87 92234 log 10 re 4 20 00769 log 10 re 5 2 44894 log 10 re 6 0 12479 log 10 re 7 this formula is not appropriate for reynolds numbers below 32 since 10 3 2 32 it is valid for a scaled cage model with s n 0 5 and angle of attack in the range 0 α π 4 the corrected towing velocity of the net twines which considers relative motion gives more accurate results the procedure has been illustrated in balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 where the corrected velocity is given as u c u 1 s n comparisons between the analytical estimates and the physical model results showed that the empirical formula over predicted the drag coefficient the surface roughness of the net twines should be responsible for this overestimate details of those empirical formulae are illustrated in table 1 the empirical formulae in table 1 evaluate the drag coefficient using three parameters the angle of attack α the solidity ratio s n and the reynolds number r e the angle of attack is directly given by values aarsnes et al 1990 balash et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 zhan et al 2006 or it can be assumed to be dependent on reynolds numbers choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b consequently the morison equation based empirical formulae in decew et al 2010b slightly underestimates the drag coefficient the discrepancy between the analytical predictions and field testing results has been observed at high current velocities of up to 1 5 m s however this discrepancy can be overlooked since aquaculture farms are typically exposed to currents of 0 0 5 m s and only up to 1 5 m s during storms lader et al 2008 the angle of attack is the most dominant factor that influences hydrodynamic coefficients compared to the solidity ratio and the reynolds number lee et al 2005 2008 the drag coefficient increases when the angle of attack is between zero and 75 it slightly decreases when the angle of attack is above 75 gansel et al 2014 this drag coefficient reduction at higher attack angle above 75 is attributed to the reconfiguration of the net all suggested formulae that incorporate the angle of attack are restricted to the range where the solidity ratio is less than 0 5 therefore to obtain more accurate hydrodynamic coefficients the angle of attack the solidity ratio and the reynolds number must be taken into consideration the solidity ratios for all the screen based formulae in table 1 use the expression s n 2 d w l w as net solidity the overestimation of the drag coefficient is attributed to net solidity løland 1991 reported that the hydrodynamic interactions between the net twines could be neglected under the assumption that l w d w 6 in other words the hydrodynamic interactions are to be overlooked if the net solidity is less than 0 33 and vice versa the effect of the reynolds number is due to viscous fluid the analytical formula from aarsnes et al 1990 over predicted the drag forces by approximately 0 9 1 3 times compared to those measured in 200 r e 800 lader and enerhaug 2005 even considering the shielding effect of upstream nets the analytical prediction remains as an overestimate for the general net twines of an aquaculture cage according to fredheim 2005 the reynolds number is in the range o 10 2 10 4 thus the effect of the reynolds number should be considered to increase prediction accuracy in evaluations of the drag coefficient the surface roughness of the net twines has received little attention in comparison to the angle of attack the solidity ratio and the reynolds number in particular the effects of the helix structures upon net twines remain uncertain hence to obtain more accurate net cage drag coefficients it is imperative to conduct further studies on the effects of surface roughness and the helix structures upon net twines 3 3 2 numerical implementations of fluid forces before deploying net pens to aquaculture sites an assessment of the environmental loads acting on the netting structure must be conducted this assessment is necessary to improve the design performance and durability of aquaculture cages in particular engineering innovations specific to open ocean environments are needed research in this area would facilitate the design of reliable systems that can withstand severe open ocean conditions potential research methods include the mathematical modelling of structural response to high energy wave conditions and three dimensional simulations of the environmental loads acting on aquaculture systems three approaches for estimating the fluid forces on and the hydrodynamic response of a net have been developed these are the finite element method the computational fluid dynamics method and the coupled fsi method which combines the finite element and computational fluid dynamics methods aside from these three approaches which are frequently discussed in the existing subject literature kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed two hydrodynamic force models to calculate viscous forces on nets these are the morison type force model and the screen type force model and they are widely used in finite element approaches these two models are dependent on how a net is approximated it is treated as either a set of twines or several sub panels most recently a comparative study of these two models was conducted under a finite element scheme to support further development of force models to net cages cheng et al 2020 3 3 2 1 finite element method so far for modelling the net of an aquaculture cage four different finite element models have been established based on the element type these models can be classified as 1 triangular element model priour 1999 2003 2 truss model theret 1994 tsukrov et al 2003 3 mass spring model cha and lee 2002 lee et al 2005 and 4 lumped mass model huang et al 2006 li et al 2006 all models are formulated using sets of differential equations these differential equations can be solved in the time domain by using numerical integration techniques the element types of these four different models are exhibited in fig 9 1 triangular element model to freely discretise the net without considering whether the side of the element is parallel to the net twine or not priour 1999 developed a triangular element model it assumes that the elongation and elasticity modulus are constant in each triangular element the net is modelled with triangular elements interconnected by defined nodes which are used to find the equilibrium position of the net as shown in fig 9 a twines and knots are considered to be circular cylinders and spheres so that they can be represented by the respective elements elements do not account for compressive loads when representing the behaviour of netting materials with low bending stiffness the equilibrium of the net is calculated at each time step using the newton raphson method it is easy to define the triangular elements in the simulation because the sides of the triangular do not need to be parallel to the net twines it is also possible to conduct a refinement by dividing an element into several smaller elements in this manner small triangular elements can be used in a highly deformed area of the net while elsewhere the triangular elements can be large during simulations one triangular element can represent several physical meshes of the net thus the triangular element model is a mesh grouping method li et al 2006 compared to previous finite element models the triangular element model improves computational efficiency this model is widely used to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces acting on trawl nets priour 2003 2005 2014 and aquaculture cage nets endresen et al 2013 enerhaug et al 2012 moe føre et al 2015 2 truss model the truss model assumes that there is no interaction between net twines by separating the net into individual twines and knots the net can be modelled using truss elements each truss element is given a centre node and can buckle under compression the equilibrium position of the net is calculated at each time step with an iteration scheme such as the newton raphson iteration scheme like the triangular element model the truss model allows several physical net twines to be represented by one truss element to reduce the number of elements and improve computational efficiency tsukrov et al 2003 proposed a consistent net element model based on the truss elements the representative equivalent truss elements in the consistent net element model are shown in fig 9 b the evaluation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the net element is based on the morison equation the total drag on the net is equal to the total drag on its individual elements fredheim and faltinsen 2001 the truss model makes it possible to account for details of net structures and flow fields the truss model has been used extensively to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of net cages decew et al 2010b used the truss model to predict the mooring dynamic behaviour of a single point moored submersible fish cage under currents their studies achieved a good balance between numerical predictions and experimental measurements li et al 2013a 2013b analysed the dynamic response and mooring tension under current regular and irregular waves respectively the geometric nonlinearity of the floating collar has been considered providing a new insight to analysing the hydrodynamic behaviours of aquaculture cages fredriksson et al 2014 employed the truss model to examine the hydrodynamic behaviour of nets the results revealed how the structural components of the net system were loaded 3 mass spring model in the mass spring model the netting structure is represented by several mass points connected by massless springs as shown in fig 9 c for nets with knots the knots are considered as mass points in the model to improve computational efficiency several physical meshes of the net are approximated using a virtual mesh it is assumed that the virtual mesh and the physical mesh are geometrically identical the virtual mesh is required to have the same physical properties e g mass projected area and hydrodynamic coefficients the equation of motion for each mass point adheres to newton s second law the formulated differential equations are solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the mass spring model does not consider the mutual interference of the velocity field in the combined wave current conditions the drag coefficient of the sphere i e mass point is given as 1 5 which is an empirical value described in fredriksson et al 2003 recently cha and lee 2018 investigated the mooring loads of a copper alloy cage model under waves and currents their results showed that numerical simulations overestimated the mooring loads than experiments did 4 lumped mass model the implementation of the lumped mass model is similar to that of the mass spring model the net is modelled with several lumped mass points interconnected with massless springs all knots on the net and the centre of each mesh side are defined as lumped mass points as shown in fig 9 d it assumes that each lumped mass point is a spherical element and the drag coefficient for the sphere element is constant e g 1 6 the drag coefficients of the cylinder elements i e net twine represented by massless spring vary with the direction of the relative fluid velocity in the lumped mass model the diameters of the lumped mass points for knotted and knotless nets are different li et al 2006 suggested that these values should be 3 14 and 1 5 times the twine diameter of knotted and knotless nets respectively the hydrodynamic forces on the net are calculated with the morison equation the fifth order runge kutta method is used to solve the differential equations of motion to improve computational efficiency a mesh grouping method is used several physical meshes are represented by an equivalent mesh with the same geometrical and physical properties such as the projected area and hydrodynamic coefficients the mesh grouping method has been used extensively to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of aquaculture cages hou et al 2017 xu et al 2012 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2007b it seems that the mass spring model and the lump mass model are very similar to each other both use mass points and springs to model the net and the mass points are connected by the massless springs the equations of motion for these two models are the same both have been solved using runge kutta schemes however differences between the models include the diameter and drag coefficients of the spheres i e mass points and their solutions to the equation of motion compared to the mass spring model the lumped mass model introduces sphere diameters i e the mass points explicitly as 3 14 and 1 5 times the twine diameter with regards to knotted and knotless nets the drag coefficients of the sphere also slightly differ as their values are 1 5 mass spring model and 1 6 lumped mass model furthermore both models use runge kutta schemes to solve the equations of motion when using fourth order mass spring model and fifth order lumped mass model methods it is important to consider the balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy these four finite element models all use the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic forces acting on the square and diamond meshes of knotted and knotless nets their ways of determining the hydrodynamic coefficients varies slightly the truss model establishes the hydrodynamic coefficient with empirical formulae choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b however the other models select the hydrodynamic coefficients based on empirical values the newton raphson and rouge kutta approaches are used to solve the equations of motion moe føre et al 2015 conducted a comparison between the triangular element model the truss model and the spring model their results showed that the truss and spring models were computationally effective but over predicted the drag forces the wake model incorporated with the triangular elements also over predicted the drag forces thus it seems that all the numerical models have their strengths and weaknesses and that further development is needed 3 3 2 2 computational fluid dynamics method the basic theory of obtaining fluid forces with a computational fluid dynamics cfd scheme differs from those that directly use the morison equation considering fluid viscosity in the cfd simulations the governing equations navier stokes equations are approximated by discretization approaches such as the finite volume method fvm the velocity and pressure of the fluid can be obtained by solving the discretized equations for the sake of computational efficiency when obtaining the fluid forces of a net via a cfd approach the net is usually approximated by a sheet of porous media rather than a system of cylinders the reynolds average navier stokes rans equations are discretized with a second order finite volume method the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple pressure correction technique patankar and spalding 1983 are used to calculate the divergence free condition of the velocity field the eddy viscosity is obtained using the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1983 and wall functions the feasibility of the porous media model mostly depends on the resistance coefficients which can be determined with analytical methods patursson et al 2010 used a least squared normalised error to find the best porous media resistance coefficients incited by patursson et al 2010 investigations regarding the flow field of a net panel and aquaculture cages under currents have been conducted zhao et al 2013a 2013b winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 concluded that the porous media model over predicted the velocity deficit this overestimation could be caused by a higher net solidity and the shielding effect of upstream cages to obtain the porous media resistance coefficients chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach based on a morison type force model their results showed that the porous media model underestimated the drag coefficients of the net 3 3 2 3 coupled fsi method the porous media model offers a step forward in evaluating the hydrodynamic behaviour of aquaculture cages mainly because it allows the fluid field of a net cage to be obtained however it still overestimates the velocity deficit and underestimates the drag coefficients therefore the coupled fsi model has been developed to accurately estimate the hydrodynamic performance of the net structures this uses the porous media model to simulate the fluid field and the lumped mass model to approximate the flexible net the studies regarding the coupled fsi model slightly underestimated the drag force compared to the results of physical model tests bi et al 2014a chen and christensen 2017 this discrepancy is attributed to the effects of the absent reynolds numbers it is worth mentioning that the governing equations used in previous studies are rans and the k ε model is used to describe the turbulent flow the k ε model is constrained in some conditions such as the no slip wall of the model the equation for epsilon is postulated and it is not accurate in the near wall regions thus further study of an appropriate turbulence model should be conducted 3 3 3 physical model and field tests of fluid forces the experimental investigation of the fluid forces on nets is necessary to verify the analytical and numerical results three major factors that affect the physical model scale selection need to be examined before test design begins these are 1 model characteristics for instance the geometry and material properties 2 wave tow basin dimensions and 3 wave generation basin dimensions determine the reflection effect of the model and the tank walls on the measurements in general more accurate results are obtained when there are lower levels of refection between the model and tank walls the wave generator must produce the scaled wave heights and periods for tests doing this in a suitable manner requires a comprehensive insight into the fundamentals of wave generator theory regarding the experimental investigations of the net panel nomura and nozawa 1962 used tank experiments to propose a simple relationship between fluid force and the inclined angle of the net panel lader et al 2007a tested the wave forces of three net panels with different solidities the results showed that the horizontal force is about ten times larger than the vertical force and that the force increases with increasing net solidity to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of a square net panel liu et al 2012 conducted forced oscillating experiments in a water flume this allowed them to establish the relationship between the inertia force and the kc number to study the fluid forces of purse seine nets riziotis et al 2013 deployed a net panel in a wave tank with three typical angles 0 45 90 a submergence test was also conducted in still water experimental tests have undertaken to evaluate the fluid forces acting on net cages for instance fredriksson et al 1999 investigated hydrodynamic forces and dynamic response with a scaled model test the heave pitch and surge of the cage were analysed palczynski 2000 conducted a model test in a towing tank to investigate the scaling law of net cages lader et al 2003 and lader and enerhaug 2005 conducted a series of experiments to examine the forces and deformations on a net cage in a uniform current in terms of field tests lader et al 2008 conducted field measurements to examine the drag forces and deformation of net cages decew et al 2013 used acoustic sensors to monitor the deformation of a cage deployed in an ocean field experimental investigations of the biofouling effects on drag forces of the net cages were conducted by bi et al 2018 these found that an accumulation of hydroids can lead to a ten times greater hydrodynamic load on the nets recently qu et al 2019 experimentally investigated the drag forces on a square cage their results showed that the drag on a diamond mesh net was 1 6 times the drag on a square mesh net therefore it can be concluded that 1 drag force increases alongside the solidity of a net 2 with identical outline areas the drag force of a diamond mesh net is greater than that of a square mesh net 3 the drag force of bio fouled nets may be ten times that of clear nets there are two possible explanations for the different drag forces of diamond mesh and square mesh nets one is that the wakes behind square and diamond meshes are different resulting in different drag forces bi et al 2017a the other is that in the square mesh net the reconfiguration of the net causes drag reduction the drag reduction induced by the reconfiguration has been quantified with a coefficient known as vegel s exponent as described in de langre 2008 de langre et al 2012 vogel 1989 2009 3 4 fluid interacting with aquaculture cage cages 3 4 1 shielding effect and velocity reduction 3 4 1 1 wake models to the shielding effect when the aquaculture cage is subjected to currents the upstream net reduces the current inside the cage resulting in the drag reduction of the downstream net this phenomenon is referred to as the shielding effect aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1993 which significantly affects the drag forces on the net to improve computational accuracy for predicting drag forces on the net an appropriate model to account for the shielding effect is required 1 huse wake model the formulation of the huse model is based on turbulent wake theory alongside momentum considerations this model has been used to calculate the current forces on a cylinder array under the assumption that the distance between cylinders is large compared to the cylinder diameter huse 1993 the schematic of the wake model is depicted in fig 10 2 blevins wake model similar to the huse model the belvins model assumes that the upstream cylinder is not affected by the downstream cylinder provided the distance between the upstream and downstream cylinders is over three times the diameter this semi empirical model is used to determine the drag and lift coefficients of a downstream cylinder it does this by considering the distance between the upstream and downstream cylinders the drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder and the cylinder diameters blevins et al 2006 after comparing these wake models cifuentes salazar 2016 found that combining finite element simulations with the wake model improved the accuracy of estimating drag forces modifications have been made to the wake model to account for the drag and velocity reductions cifuentes and kim 2017 considered the shielding effect that causes the loss of kinetic energy so proposed the wake model accordingly their results showed that the wake models slightly underestimated the drag force 3 4 1 2 solutions to velocity reduction current reduction occurs when flow passes through the cages leading to lower oxygen levels inside than outside the cages this lower oxygen level can affect fish growth and thus the investigation of current reduction has become an important subject two approaches can be used to evaluate velocity reduction the wake deficit model and the porous media model 1 wake deficit model to gain an accurate estimate of the current force acting on the aquaculture cage it is imperative to identify the current reduction caused by the shielding effect from the upstream net of a cage løland 1991 proposed a wake deficit model based on the boundary layer theory schlichting 1968 the wake was generated by a screen or a net using linear free wake equations in conjunction with an eddy viscosity formulation the near wake was described by a sum of cylinder model and the far wake was described by a plane wake model the two dimensional velocity profile of a turbulent wake behind a single cylinder can be calculated using the linearized turbulent wake equations løland 1993 verified the theory with experimental tests and a linear correlation between the velocity reduction factor and the drag coefficient is proposed to be 26 r 1 0 0 46 c d where r is the velocity reduction factor for a single cage several velocity reduction factors based on numerical simulations and experimental tests are established from 0 7 zhan et al 2006 0 8 bi et al 2018 fredriksson et al 2007b gansel et al 2018 klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2003 0 85 bi et al 2014a huang et al 2006 2007 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2013 to 0 9 bi et al 2013 decew et al 2010b fredriksson 2001 patursson et al 2010 yao et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a 2013b the ones for multi cage systems are based on theoretical considerations numerical investigations and experimental tests the velocity reduction factors are given as r 1 0 46 c d aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1991 or by empirical values as illustrated in table 2 it is difficult to determine accurate velocity reduction factors when the fluid passes through the netting or cage array because of the complicated interactions between the fluid and flexible structures selecting a velocity reduction factor is a somewhat arbitrary process for full scale aquaculture cages gansel et al 2018 conducted field tests to study the velocity reduction factor after compared with the physical model tests the results showed that physical model tests underestimated the velocity reduction factor thus a velocity reduction factor of 0 8 has been recommended to avoid underestimation moreover it is difficult to distinguish between upstream and downstream areas when nets are three dimensional and their shapes are complicated lader and enerhaug 2005 hence to precisely predict the behaviour of aquaculture cage systems more additional experiments are encouraged 2 the porous media model the wake deficit model is the simplest way to model the flow field but it is difficult to determine the wake region when the net system is complex e g cage array most empirical values of velocity reduction obtained with physical model tests seem random computational fluid dynamics combined with the porous media model can provide details regarding water velocity distribution thus they offer an alternative for estimating current velocity reductions patursson et al 2010 used the porous media model to simulate the net panel a k ε turbulence model was used to describe the flow field and the rans equations have been solved using the finite volume method a velocity reduction factor of 0 9 was obtained using the porous media model in the cfd scheme the flow field around a single cage and two tandem cages has been estimated zhao et al 2013a 2013b the flow reduction is approximately 10 17 inside a single cage and is 33 37 inside a downstream cage when two cages are in a tandem arrangement bi et al 2014b developed a coupled fsi model that combines the porous media model for the flow field with the lumped mass model for the net the average velocity reductions of 10 and 25 have been obtained for single and two cages in rows a recent study showed that the velocity reduction of a net with a great biofouling effect could approach 21 4 bi et al 2018 overall the porous media model underestimates the velocity reduction factor because of the lower porous resistance coefficients used in the simulation 3 4 2 cage deformation and volume reduction 3 4 2 1 determination of volume reduction aquaculture cages deform when currents influence them because current loads affect the overall net chamber geometry causing cage volume loss this in turn may negatively impact fish farming volume loss has been shown to cause stress in fish contributing to low growth rates and higher cases of infection harper and wolf 2009 ortuno et al 2001 rowland et al 2006 additionally open ocean environments can cause fish to swim quickly in response to strong currents if the fish exhaust their anaerobic capacity they will be forced against the cage wall oppedal et al 2011 the effects of cage deformation and fast fish swimming pose great challenges for fish farming thus it is essential to understand cage deformation and volume loss cage deformation caused by currents has been extensively studied aarsnes et al 1990 decew et al 2013 fredheim 2005 huang et al 2006 2007 lader et al 2003 li et al 2006 qu et al 2019 tsukrov et al 2011 zhao et al 2007a the deformations of scaled cage models under varying flow regimes have been tested in flume tanks lader and enerhaug 2005 in tank trials total cage volume was found to reduce by up to 35 when there was a steady flow velocity of 0 5 m s lader and enerhaug 2005 lee et al 2005 aside from laboratory tests having in situ data for cage deformation is critical to facilitate a better understanding of the responses of these flexible systems decew et al 2013 the data sets can also be used to calibrate numerical model predictions and laboratory experiments there are four approximation approaches to estimate the volume reduction of an aquaculture cage within a current these are 1 the scalar triple product method 2 the divergence method 3 the signed volume method and 4 the polygon method decew et al 2013 klebert et al 2015 all these can be used to compare the cage volume within physical model tests field measurements and numerical model predictions the first three methods are used to estimate a net cage s volume when it has a flat bottom net the final approach is used to determine a net cage s volume when it has a cone shaped bottom net schematic detailing of different methods for volume calculations are depicted in fig 11 1 scalar triple product method the scalar triple product method has been developed by huang et al 2006 to measure cage deformation and calculate the instantaneous volume of a shape by representing it as a series of stacked geometric disks the volume can be separated into m levels with each level divided into n sectors each sector can then be divided into three tetrahedrons as shown in fig 11 a the cylindrical volume represents the model in its undeformed state using the principle of scalar triple products the volume of the cylinder can be separated into individual tetrahedrons fig 11 b it can then be calculated by summing the volume of all tetrahedrons fig 11 c and d the total volume of the cylindrical cage is expressed with the following equation 27 i 1 n 1 6 a b c where is the total volume n is the total number of tetrahedrons that comprise the volume and a b and c are the vectors that construct the tetrahedron when this method is used on a flexible body such as a cage in a dynamic environment it is necessary to monitor the deformation of the tetrahedrons inaccurate volume calculations may result from a disk inversion i e if points a2 b2 or b3 rise above point a1 there will be additional volume present which is absent from the field and numerical models like most volume computational methods accuracy is largely dependent on the level of model discretization or the number of known nodal coordinates 2 divergence method the divergence method uses gauss s theorem to approximate the volume as follows 28 δ f d s f n d a s where a s is the surface area of the enclosed volume and n is a unit normal vector of the surface plane volume if the initial volume is assumed to be unity f 1 then the integration of the left hand side of the equation becomes the total instantaneous volume of the enclosed surface s the surface of an object can be represented as a series of discrete triangular planar elements as shown in fig 11 e thus applying the divergence theorem to each discretized element and summing all the triangular surface elements yields the approximated volume of the object by applying the finite discrete form of the surface area integral the following equation can be derived to calculate the cage s volume 29 i 1 n x g i i y g i j z g i k r 12 i r 23 i r 12 i r 23 i δ a i where g i is the geometric centre of a triangular planar element r 12 i and r 23 i are vectors of the i th triangular planar element δ a i is the area of triangular planar element i 3 signed volume method the signed volume method employs triangular surface mesh elements to represent the cage zhang and chen 2001 tetrahedral elements are then created with a fourth vertex outside the volume of the cage unlike other approaches in the signed volume method all the elements must have the same point of origin as shown in fig 11 f the total volume is then calculated as 30 i 1 n 1 6 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 where i stands for the index of elementary tetrahedrons x i 1 y i 1 z i 1 x i 2 y i 2 z i 2 and x i 3 y i 3 z i 3 are the coordinates of the vertices of tetrahedron i and they are ordered so that the normal of tetrahedron i is consistent with other tetrahedrons normal the details of this method are demonstrated in zhang and chen 2001 4 polygon method this method assumes that the cage is divided into numerous planes and that each plane is a polygon as shown in fig 11 g the area of the polygon changes as a second order polynomial and can be integrated to yield the volume of the polygon it does this as follows 31 0 h a x d x 1 6 h a l a u 4 a h where a l a u and a h are the areas of the polygons in the lower upper and middle planes respectively h is the height between the lower and upper planes the algorithm continues by adding planes above the upper plane until the final top is reached the first step is a special case with a l 0 comparisons with the scalar triple product divergence and signed volume methods have been conducted by decew et al 2013 the authors found that these three methods provided similar results within each load case however the numerical estimation of the triple scalar volume technique under predicted field measurements klebert et al 2015 reported that the polygon method under predicted the field measurements by approximately 10 overall these four approaches could be used to gain an understanding of cage deformation caused by currents to help develop new generation aquaculture cages 4 fluid organism interactions 4 1 fish swimming behaviour 4 1 1 group behaviour and schooling patterns fish swimming mechanics and behaviour in complex flow environment have been extensively studied the reasons for investigating fish swimming behaviour include 1 to help design inspiring robotic devices for propulsion and maneuvering under water salazar et al 2018 sfakiotakis et al 1999 2 to gain an understanding of how fish survive within and have adapted to their environments pavlov and kasumyan 2000 3 to manage fisheries and ecology from a hydrodynamic perspective liao 2007 4 to understand the interaction between fluid aquaculture structures and fish bi et al 2020 he et al 2018 fish respond to cage environment by altering their vertical positions and modifying other behaviours dempster et al 2009 johansson et al 2006 2007 2009 korsøen et al 2009 studies on their behaviour have revealed that fish rarely distribute themselves randomly in aquaculture cages but instead adapt their swimming depth and speed in response to environmental gradients oppedal et al 2011 schooling behaviour is one of the most common forms of social behaviour in fish and is observed in numerous fish species many publications have investigated the schooling behaviour of the fish within and outside of aquaculture cages oppedal et al 2011 pavlov and kasumyan 2000 basic schooling types in fish include moving school resting school feeding school defensive look around school and defensive school for evading solitary predators as shown in fig 12 typically farmed fish such as salmon form swim in a circular pattern during the daytime and avoid the innermost part and the corners of the cage dempster et al 2008 2009 korsøen et al 2009 this schooling behaviour leads to 1 5 5 times the stocking density in certain areas of the cage fish exhibit circular schooling behaviours to avoid interactions with the cage wall and other fish føre et al 2009 during feeding time the circular schooling breaks down and fish swim towards the food pellets these investigations e g bi et al 2020 he et al 2018 on mutual effects between aquaculture cages and fish show that 1 fish schoolings do not have remarkable contributions to drag acting on the net cage while they have pronounced effect on mooring loads 2 fish schooling patterns predominantly affect flow inside and around the net cage 3 the swimming behaviour and fish schooling are complex and have not been completely understood 4 1 2 individual behaviour and fish locomotion a better understanding of individual fish species behaviour will provide essential information regarding schooling behaviours that can be used to design effective new aquaculture systems locomotion is the result of the transfer of momentum from fish musculature to the surrounding water weihs 1989 recently salazar et al 2018 divided fish locomotion into three groups based on previous research these were fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion the authors demonstrated that caudal fin swimmers were the largest category within fin oscillation while the largest category in fin undulation was pectoral fin swimmers there was less variety in jet propulsion fish maneuver under water most of them produce thrust to resist drag the evolution of bladder provides fish buoyancy to maintain depth control it is essential to recognise that quickly lifting an aquaculture cage during harvest operations can lead to the death of closed bladder fish such as cod fredheim and langan 2009 thus the lifting speed of the aquaculture cage should be taken into account when designing submersible aquaculture systems fish maneuver with auxiliary fins and by flexing their bodies webb and weihs 2015 classified the stability of fish into two categories hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stabilities fish maneuvers in steady and unsteady flows by responding to the constant velocity and any changes to it by maneuvering vogel 2008 defined almost all aquatic locomotion at low reynolds number in his research the modes of aquatic locomotion were classified into four categories drag based swimming lift based swimming direct reaction swimming and interfacial swimming weihs 1989 defined the locomotion of fish from the perspective of energy the velocity and typical length of fish were dimensioned using reynolds numbers at a prescribed reynolds number the forces could be represented with either the added mass mode or the vorticity mode voesenek et al 2018 divided fish locomotion into cyclic and acyclic swimming during cyclic swimming because of variations between swimming cycles the average cycle speed is hardly constant acyclic swimming incorporates most of the fish s swimming motions such as turns escape maneuvers feeding strikes and burst and coast swimming acyclic swimming has been defined as unsteady locomotion in the study of borazjani 2015 fast starts c start or s start escape maneuvers turns acceleration deceleration and sudden changes in speed during steady locomotion were also included 4 1 3 unsteady forces and wake dynamics it has been shown that the motion of fish body and fins enhance water turbulence of the net cage and vortices generated by fish are dependent on fish species and sizes bi et al 2020 moreover the turbulence effect should not be neglected when studying the flow passes through net cages with the fish inside martin et al 2020 based on these significant findings it is imperative to study fish swimming mechanics and vortex dynamics to support the further design of new open offshore aquaculture systems the analytical models numerical approaches and experimental measurements that can be used to investigate unsteady locomotion and hydrodynamic forces are examined in this section the theoretical models based on elongated body theory and inviscid vortex methods are inviscid methods numerical approaches mainly focus on the applications of computational fluid dynamics which consider fluid viscosity the experimental methods using particle image velocimetry piv are also introduced in detail the reynolds number for most species of grown up fish ranges from 10 3 to 10 8 wu 2011 the boundary layer enveloping the fish is so thin that its thickness can be neglected when calculating the thrust and power of fish locomotion lighthill 1970 wu 2011 based on this assumption the elongated body theory ebt has been extensively used lighthill 1960 1970 1971 1969 wu 2011 ebt is the first approach used to study the mechanisms of aquatic locomotion it assumes that the fluid is inviscid and irrotational and that the flow does not separate weihs 1972 applied lighthill s ebt to large amplitude movement and turning maneuvers in his study the forces caused by tangential movements were neglected however this method overestimated the forces and thrust efficiency weihs 1972 another theoretical method employed to analyse unsteady locomotion was the vortex panel method hess and smith 1967 this method was used to calculate potential flows where the effects of compressibility and viscosity were negligible and the potential vortex satisfied the laplace equation by combining the vortices the flow around complex geometries could be evaluated katz and plotkin 2001 this vortex panel method has been used to ascertain the forces active during unsteady motions however it could not determine the flow separation and dynamic wakes during fish maneuvering still the vortex panel method is a practical approach for simplifying the relevant mathematical and computational complexities asides from the theoretical methods numerical methods can be used to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on the fish these are the boundary element method cheng and chahine 2001 and cfd maertens et al 2017 moored 2018 triantafyllou et al 2016 cfd based approaches predict flow separation and the vortices behind the fish with boundary confirming moving grid and non boundary confirming fixed grid methods borazjani 2015 the governing equations for the flow around aquatic swimmers during unsteady locomotion are unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations for the boundary confirming method the arbitrary lagrangian euler ale formulation is usually used donea et al 2017 non boundary confirming methods such as the overset method has also been frequently used for fish swimming behaviours meakin 1999 the ale method is used to investigate unsteady locomotion li et al 2012 2014 the multi block has been separately set for the whole domain and fish bodies other cfd investigations regarding fish maneuvers fin dynamics fluid dynamics and vortex can be seen in horner and jayne 2008 müller and van leeuwen 2004 najafi and golestanian 2004 van leeuwen et al 2008 verhagen 2004 the mechanisms of viscous forces were investigated thoroughly including the thrust the drag vortices and the strouhal number the model for unsteady locomotion in the intermediate reynolds numbers has been implemented by li et al 2012 and gazzola et al 2014 their results showed that body wave amplitude has a profound effect on fish swimming performance however in the inertia dominant flow regime turbulence makes it difficult to conduct accurate simulations for instance the kolmogorov scale of turbulence eddies decreases in the intermediate reynolds numbers which requires refined meshes to resolve the smaller scales the turbulence model based rans equations could be dissipative with this issue thus a large eddy simulation or other advanced approaches are recommended for use within intermediate reynolds numbers simulations experimental techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv have been used to quantify wake dynamics behind swimming fish daghooghi and borazjani 2015 muller et al 2000 müller et al 2008 stamhuis and videler 1995 wolfgang et al 1999 piv measurements behind steadily swimming fish along the horizontal mid plane of the body show clear two dimensional karman vortex street configurations and three dimensional vortex rings two effects should be considered to understand the wake vortex dynamics when analysing piv data 1 the wake impulse and 2 the added mass effects the momentum of the wake can be determined with the wake impulse the added mass effects could induce additional impulses which cannot be neglected epps and techet 2010 considered the thickness of a finite vortex core when formulating their full wake vortex dynamics the vortex ring linking was not considered when calculating the hydrodynamic impulse from piv data however the use of two dimensional linked cores could cause the overestimation of the thrust produced by the swimming fish further three dimensional piv methods are needed three dimensional piv measurements can be obtained by using imaging and reconstruction techniques such as tomographic piv stereo piv and defocusing digital piv kitzhofer et al 2011 mendelson and techet 2015 scarano 2012 flammang et al 2011 provided complete visualization of 3d vortex rings behind bluegill sunfish and cichlid fish in a flume by utilizing defocusing digital piv after conducting piv tests for the caudal fin wake of a dogfish shark flammang et al 2011 found that a highly three dimensional dual linked vortex ring structure is far more complicated than any two dimensional vortex velocity fields observed with piv have been used to estimate pressure fields in a horizontal plane around swimming fish dabiri et al 2014 the shear stress distribution can be calculated through the velocity gradient near the fish s body which makes it possible to calculate the force distribution on the fish s body from a velocity field around the fish from a biomechanical perspective of fish swimming behaviour we can see the developed mechanisms and their significance to the aquatic environment in this review a mechanistic understanding of fish swimming behaviour provides insight into the study of fish in complex fluid environments such as in aquaculture cages exposed to open ocean the understanding based on the interactions between fluid aquaculture cage structures and fish is essential for the development of new aquaculture systems 5 conclusions and future perspectives understanding the fluid structure interactions of cage based aquaculture is essential for reliably estimating the hydrodynamic behaviour of the aquaculture structures and farmed organisms the cross disciplinary studies included in this review illustrate a broad variety of work to understand the interactions between fluid aquaculture cages and fish with this understanding further aquaculture systems can potentially be designed to better withstand the rigors of the open ocean this review summarizes a growing body of work that shows how ocean environmental loads can have dramatic effects on offshore aquaculture cages and fish swimming behaviour it is clear how analytical approaches rarely yield accurate solutions due to a tendency of making assumptions conclusive data shows that the morison equation based empirical formulae underestimated the drag force on the net while the screen based empirical formulae overestimated the drag force the most reliable methods to use are validated physical models and numerical implementations however the use of physical models and numerical implementations must consider the strengths and weaknesses of each method the comparison between field measurements physical models and numerical implementations suggests that physical models are more conservative than the others because physical models overestimated the loads more than the numerical predictions did numerical implementations are inexpensive and flexible however additional conditions such as the interference of the fluid field and the effects of reynolds numbers must be considered otherwise overestimations of drag force and mooring tension will occur when using finite element models even a coupled fsi model has been developed to improve computational accuracy but this model is still in its early stages using the porous media model in the cfd scheme provides details regarding water velocity distribution but it underestimates the velocity reduction factor compared with field measurements the numerical estimations underestimate the volume reduction factor physical model approaches require wave basins instruments and certain similarity principles but direct observations can provide a better understanding of system behaviour to gain a better understanding of unsteady fish locomotion controlled laboratory studies will continue to be one of the pronounced approaches for examining the fundamental mechanisms still several issues must be addressed for example fish swim fast in aquaculture cages subjected to strong currents to avoid being pushed against the cage wall oppedal et al 2011 the investigation of swimming efficiency has recently attracted attention floryan et al 2018 more physical model tests and numerical simulations are required to study the fast swimming behaviour and swimming efficiency of fish this will help select appropriate farming sites and improve the designs of offshore aquaculture cage systems moreover aquaculture cages deployed in north atlantic occasionally make contact with drift ice masser and bridger 2007 which could damage the cage structures fluid ice aquaculture structure interactions however have received little attention and must be studied in the future alongside the integrated multi trophic aquaculture ecosystem some new elements have been involved for the development of aquaculture technology these include the integration of aquaculture farming and ocean renewable energy system buck and langan 2017 it seems that a vast array of applications is ready for the evolution of aquaculture engineering and technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

21378,the study of how fluid interacts with aquaculture cages and how it influences fish swimming behaviour has proven to be of great importance for designing offshore aquaculture cage systems this review examines the fluid structure interactions between structures and organisms within cage based aquaculture using data from previous research we list and classify aquaculture cages into net cage and closed cage systems net cage aquaculture systems are classified with regards to their submergence materials and aperture shapes of nets then the comparison is made between the research methods used to assess the interactions between environmental loads and aquaculture cages this comparison includes analytical studies numerical implementations field tests and laboratory experiments we also provide reviews of topics such as mooring and grid systems drag coefficients of the net panel hydrodynamic behaviours of cage components velocity reduction of cage array and volume reduction caused by cage deformation in particular fish swimming behaviour is reviewed for designing new open ocean aquaculture systems to support the further development of aquaculture engineering and technology statistics tables formulae and figures are provided keywords fluid structure interaction aquaculture cage fish swimming behaviour contents 1 introduction 1 1 drivers and limitations aquaculture is a globally sustainable industry that provides food and bioenergy to the world s growing population it plays a critical role in supplying protein to people in low income food deficient countries in 2016 according to a report from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations nearly half of the fish consumed by humans were provided by aquaculture fao 2018 at this time global aquaculture production including aquatic plants totalled 110 2 million tons and was valued at usd 243 5 billion aquaculture produced approximately 54 1 million tons of finfish usd 138 5 billion 17 1 million tons of molluscs usd 29 2 billion and 30 1 million tons of aquatic plants usd 11 7 billion many of the major fish producing countries are in south asia the most dominant producers include china 61 5 india 7 1 indonesia 6 2 vietnam 4 5 and bangladesh 2 8 aquaculture s effects on global sustainability are mostly discussed in relation to seafood production overfishing and environmental hazards demonstrate that it is challenging to meet the fao s target to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by 2030 given the increasing world population seafood demand could reach approximately 180 million tons fao 2018 future increases in seafood production should come from farming rather than fishing because of aquaculture farming s reduced environmental impact langan 2009 over the past five decades aquaculture farming has increased exponentially alongside this growth due to limited near shore space and increased environmental pollution there has been a shift towards open ocean aquaculture farming costa pierce and bridger 2002 fredriksson et al 2003 kitzhofer et al 2011 klebert et al 2015 the size of these aquaculture farms is growing meaning they can help contribute the increasing demands of seafood production most offshore farming is concerned with finfish however there has been growing interest in the offshore culture of shellfish langan 2009 shellfish can be grown at much larger scales thanks to operations such as longline and raft shellfish farming the fao reports that shelled molluscs occupy 58 8 of the production of marine and coastal aquaculture fao 2018 this suggests that offshore aquaculture farming is a method for providing sustainable seafood large scale open water aquaculture farming is a sustainable method that can help satisfy human food and biofuel demands while emitting lower levels of greenhouse gases than other farming practices despite the considerable benefits of aquaculture several limitations exist that make large scale implementation difficult in offshore regions the largest of these is the potentially harsh oceanic conditions which place heavy design constraints on the structures accordingly aquaculture farming systems must be designed to withstand these ever changing oceanic conditions and to provide a dependable habitat for the relevant marine organisms focus on fluid structure interaction fsi supports the integrity and longevity of aquaculture systems and is therefore an important area of research this paper reviews the fluid structure interactions of cage based aquaculture the goal of this review is to highlight the fundamental studies that have contributed to a mechanistic understanding of how fluid interacts with aquaculture cages and how it influences fish swimming behaviour this review is organised as follows section 2 provides the classification of the aquaculture cage systems section 3 identifies the hydrodynamic behaviours this includes but is not limited to hydrodynamic forces and cage deformation alongside the hydrodynamic behaviours comparisons of available researching methods calculations of velocity and volume reductions of aquaculture cages are examined section 4 elaborates on the fluid interactions with fish highlighting fish swimming behaviours and hydrodynamic performances section 5 gives the concluding remarks and suggestions for future research 2 classification of aquaculture cages typical aquaculture includes finfish shellfish and seaweed farming aquaculture methods can be aquaponics rakocy et al 2004 mariculture goldburg et al 2001 and integrated multi trophic aquaculture chopin et al 2001 aquaculture structures vary depending on the type and method of aquaculture as various structures function differently to meet international seafood and substitutive energy demands large scaled aquaculture structures such as open ocean net pens and longlines are recommended these are shown in fig 1 all aquaculture structures are exposed to various levels of the water column and have interactions with the surrounding fluid recent studies which consider the holistic characteristics of marine organisms have shown that when farmed together marine bivalves that extract organics and seaweeds which absorb dissolved nutrients benefit the environment and facilitate sustainable production fao 2018 this aggregate approach to farming works even better when fish molluscs and other aquatic plants are grown together on an ecosystem level this technique is referred to as an integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta system and is portrayed in fig 1 costa pierce and bridger 2002 classified all the available commercial aquaculture cages based on their location operation environment and structure their groupings included the following types of cages surface oriented anchor tensioned self tensioned semi rigid submersible and barge type lekang 2008 classified aquaculture cages as extensive intensive or semi intensive based on their production per unit volume m³ or framed unit area m2 the author also summarised previous methods of classifying cage systems beveridge 2008 huguenin 1997 loverich and gace 1997 one method was based on where a cage is situated within the water column the relevant categories included floating submerged and submersible another corresponded to the type of net frame used in the cages rigid or flexible most recently chu et al 2020 categorised aquaculture cages as either net cage systems or closed containment tank systems based on their containment methods accordingly this review categorises aquaculture systems as either net cage or closed cage furthermore net cage aquaculture systems are classified depending on their submergence materials and the apertures of their nets 2 1 net cage aquaculture systems 2 1 1 classification based on submergence beveridge 2008 classified aquaculture cages into four primary groups fixed floating submersible and submerged cages that are in the floating submersible and submerged categories can either be flexible or rigid fixed cages are inexpensive and easy to construct but can only be deployed in shallow water because of their size and shape a floating cage is supported by several buoyant collars given that floating cages can be a variety of shapes and sizes this type of cage is the most widely used a floating cage s collar can be either wide or narrow the wide collar is typically used for large cages as it provides a working platform one advantage of submersible cages is that their positions can be adjusted in the water column to avoid severe weather conditions like storms accordingly submerged cages are permanently kept underwater to protect the organisms within however pérez et al 2003 did not recommend deploying any cages where significant wave heights are expected to exceed 8 9 m fig 2 depicts five typical flexible aquaculture cage systems ordered based on their submergences for modern industrial fish farming high density polyethylene hdpe is the most widely used material for flexible cage collars one advantage of flexible cages is that cage deformation can reduce the forces incident waves exert on the structures alongside this they can easily be formed into different configurations however cage deformation can result in a loss of oxygen the surface floating gravity type cage fig 2 a is the most commonly used cage for finfish farming many publications examined the hydrodynamic characteristics of this kind of cage and its components such as the mooring system the floating collar and the net system as demonstrated in section 3 of this paper the submersible tension leg aquaculture cage e g tlc refa is shown in fig 2 b tsukrov et al 2003 used a consistent net element to study the dynamic performance of this fish cage they did this under typical and extreme environmental loading conditions at the unh aquaculture demonstration sites their results showed that extreme environmental loading could cause large deformation but moderate tensions regarding the submersible seastation cage shown by fig 2 d the mooring dynamics in single cage fredriksson et al 2003 and four cage fredriksson et al 2004 arrangements have been studied using physical and numerical models these studies validated design criteria for future applications of cage deployment section 3 1 of this paper will discuss studies relating to the single point mooring dynamics of the submersible ocean cage aquaculture technology ocat cage fig 2 c and the submerged aquapod cage fig 2 e compared to flexible aquaculture cage systems rigid aquaculture cage systems share distinctive features they are large structures and constructed from steel they can integrate feeding systems harvest cranes and surveillance systems given their rigid frames the cages maintain their volumes and keep fish in place scott and muir 2000 these design features contribute to a new generation of aquaculture fish farms even with their advantages these rigid cages have high investment costs and it is difficult to change or clean their nets fig 3 displays five typical rigid aquaculture cage systems including some novel design concepts ordered according to their submergences as shown in fig 3 a this floating vessel shaped fish farm has been designed to withstand strong wave and current loads in the open ocean li et al 2017 used a simplified rigid model to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vessel shaped fish farm in the frequency domain their results showed that the current and net elements affected the drift motions and mooring tensions li and ong 2017 conducted a hydrodynamic analysis of the semi submersible rigid fish farm as shown in fig 3 b based on linear potential theory underestimation has been observed for the heave and surge motions while overestimation has been observed for the pitch motion to study the hydrodynamic performance of the ocean farm 1 fish farm fig 3 c a finite element analysis and scaled model experiments were conducted it was found that the wave parameters draught and net significantly influence the fish farm s hydrodynamic response dou 2018 zhao et al 2019 the semi submersible spar fish farm was designed by de mass smc a dutch offshore oil and gas engineering company as depicted in fig 3 d the central tower can be used to integrate machinery feeding systems and it provides accommodation for operators this semi submersible spar fish farm is protected from storms because of its adjustable submergence the integration of a renewable energy system and a submerged aquaculture cage shown in fig 3 e has been proposed based on the multiple use concept buck and krause 2012 the last thing regarding submergence is that a cage s submergence will influence its mooring lines design this includes features such as the length of a mooring line and the selection of the materials used for moorings fredriksson et al 2004 tsukrov et al 2005 mooring components such as lines anchors and hardware must be specified based on aquaculture structures and their submergences furthermore the length of the net is also determined by the submergence 2 1 2 classification based on materials of nets the materials used in aquaculture engineering have been studied since the 1970s ravindran 1983 according to norwegian legislation standards norge 2009 an aquaculture cage must satisfy several conditions for example a structure must function satisfactorily in all environmental conditions and it must be resistant to biological effects e g biofouling therefore an aquaculture structure s material properties must be considered during fluid structure interaction analysis because they significantly affect the forces and deformations that the structure experiences whether they are physical e g density or mechanical e g young s modulus cage components consist of net twines woven nets ropes and pipes which are made from materials such as fibres polymers metals and alloys ashby and jones 1996 the net chamber provides a closed habitat to promote organisms growth it must offer protection from predators be nutrient and oxygen rich be free from pollution and also prevent the organisms from escaping fishing nets are made of natural materials e g plant fibre because they are inexpensive and easy to obtain however plant fibre is likely to decompose when exposed to water for a long time replacing this with polymer material offers several advantages increased longevity high breaking strength and light weight even with these advantages polymer materials are still susceptible to the effects of biofouling biofouling causes severe problems and results in increased labour and maintenance to circumnavigate this issue researchers substituted the polymer material with metals and alloys because they are resistant to corrosion and biofouling accordingly metals and alloys have been extensively used to make aquaculture nets chu et al 2020 dong et al 2020 efird 1976 efird and anderson 1975 powell and stillman 2009 tsukrov et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 most net materials used in field measurements and experimental tests are polyamide pa rather than polyethylene terephthalate pet or polyethylene pe these three materials have very similar elastic moduli and elongations at failure the only difference between them is their tensile strength pet has the greatest ranging from 35 to 210 mpa while pa s ranges from 60 to 140 mpa cardia and lovatelli 2015 dowling 2012 this material characteristic makes pet difficult to mould mckeen 2016 cages could be circular conical square rectangular or dish like however most cages have circular designs because they make the most efficient use of materials per unit volume moreover circular cages make optimal use of space with regards to fish swimming behaviour beveridge 2008 the fouling resistance of copper and its alloys provide more conducive ecosystems for marine organisms given their advantages of lower biofouling and volume deforming copper and copper alloy nets have reduced maintenance and operation costs the new semi submersible spar fish farm concept shown in fig 3 d has a cage net made of copper alloy materials however potential challenges remain regarding installation and deployment from a fluid structure interaction perspective researchers primarily focus on hydrodynamic forces and the deformation of cages because they are relevant to structural safety and stability furthermore large deformations allow fish to escape and causes a loss of oxygen and nutrition steel and copper alloys could prevent large deformations caused by high current velocity 2 1 3 classification based on apertures of nets aquaculture nets can be manufactured via knitting such as warp knitting also known as raschel net or via twisting and chain linking to form square diamond and hexagon meshes based on manufacturing processes nets can be knotted or knotless as both types are commonly used in aquaculture lekang 2008 there is little difference in the use of these nets with different apertures the aperture shape of a net significantly affects the flow field around the meshes consequently the drag induced by the wake behind a diamond mesh is higher than that of a square mesh bi et al 2017a the different aquaculture nets used for fish farming are shown in fig 4 square and diamond meshes have excellent durability in strong currents and are easy to repair however these two types of mesh take longer to manufacture the hexagon mesh has more vertical elasticity allowing it to endure harsh wave situations it is also easy to repair however it can be challenging to measure the dimensions of the hexagon mesh due to net deformation mesh size is a crucial parameter used to calculate the solidity ratio of a net solidity ratios are used to study the environmental loads acting on a net which are induced by the fluids surrounding it researchers have provided different empirical formulae to calculate the solidity ratio of a net considering knotted nets løland 1991 assumed the diameter of a knotted part to be double that of the twine so the solidity ratio is given as 1 s n 2 d w l w 1 2 d w l w 2 where d w is the twine diameter and l w is the length of the mesh side of the net without considering the knotted parts of the net the following formula is also used decew et al 2010b lader et al 2007b 2 s n 2 d w l w d w l w 2 when assuming the knotted parts of the net are so small to be negligible aarsnes et al 1990 fridman and carrothers 1986 klebert et al 2015 the following expression is used 3 s n 2 d w l w if the diameter of a knot is less than two times the twine s diameter it is better to use eq 3 rather than eq 1 for nets with square meshes eqs 1 3 are used for nets with diamond meshes the solidity ratio is given as for a knotless net 4 s n d w l w e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 for a knotted net 5 s n 2 l w d w d w 2 2 l w 2 e h e v d w 2 l w 2 1 e h 2 1 e v 2 π d w 2 8 d w d w 8

width and height d w is the diameter of the sphere i e the knot currently there is no established formula for nets with hexagonal meshes 2 2 closed cage aquaculture systems closed cage aquaculture systems were introduced during the 1990s beveridge 2008 using a closed cage instead of a conventional net cage provides a solution to ecological challenges such as sea lice and other parasites fish escapes diseases and water pollution chu et al 2020 strand 2018 based on structural properties closed cage aquaculture systems can be categorised as flexible membrane cages fabric or glass fabric and rigid cages steel or glass fibre reinforced plastics as depicted in fig 5 the closed flexible membrane cage consists of a floating collar a mooring system and an impermeable flexible membrane this membrane is typically made of fabric material currently novel closed rigid aquaculture systems are still within concept design or construction phases one advantage of the closed cage aquaculture system is that water replacement can be controlled the water replacement system keeps the water regularly refreshed and provides suitable temperatures sufficient oxygen and waste removal however when these cage structures are deployed to offshore sites a power supply is required chu et al 2020 a closed cage aquaculture system interacts with sea loads when it is subjected to waves and currents due to the internal free surface the cage also experiences internal water motions known as sloshing the closed flexible membrane cage behaves hydro elastically meaning that the deformation of and the hydrodynamic forces on the membrane are nearly coupled this is because the deformations and fluid forces on the closed flexible cage are dependent on both the external and internal hydrodynamic pressures and the structure dynamics because of the limited closed cage aquaculture system use cases the hydrodynamic response and fluid forces on the system still have not been completely understood future research challenges for the closed aquaculture cage system include analysing the pressure and the deformation e g closed flexible cage wave and current loads structure responses and sloshing strand 2018 physical model experiments have been conducted to gain an understanding of the hydrodynamic behaviour of closed flexible cages in still water strand et al 2014 currents lader et al 2015 strand et al 2013 2016 and waves lader et al 2017 cylindrical cubical conical pyramidal and ellipsoidal cages have been tested it was found that the drag coefficient of the closed flexible cage increased as the filling level decreased sloshing and structure response have been studied using model tests lader et al 2017 and numerical simulations strand and faltinsen 2017 2019 2020 all the results showed that the hydrodynamic response was highly dependent on geometry and filling level numerical and experimental studies have been conducted to investigate a closed rigid cage under regular waves kristiansen et al 2018 the results showed that sloshing affected the coupled surge and pitch motions significantly it is suggested that future work facilitates three dimensional numerical studies of sloshing it would be helpful if numerical results can be verified with physical model tests cage deformation alongside hydrodynamic forces must be analysed together in the time domain moreover far field waves caused by structures should be taken into consideration when determining the hydrodynamic characteristics of closed cage systems the closed cage aquaculture system is a novel cage design concept its interaction with fluids has been studied and suggestions for future research have been provided here in the next section of this paper the components that most aquaculture cage systems have such as the mooring system the floating collar and the net system are studied with regards to fluid structure interactions the shielding effect and the deformation of the net cage systems will also be addressed 3 fluid structure interactions 3 1 mooring and grid systems 3 1 1 classification of moorings it is necessary to analyse aquaculture structures mooring systems in various environmental conditions to help prevent their failure and the subsequent escape of farmed organisms the mooring systems of aquaculture structures include catenary taut leg single point and spread line configurations fredriksson and beck stimpert 2019 single point mooring spm aquaculture cage systems have been recommended as an alternative to the traditional mooring grid array arrangement this is because as tidal currents change directions they can move around their anchor points fredriksson et al 2007b four examples of spm aquaculture cages with different submergence are depicted in fig 6 the surface floating gravity type cage fig 6 a has been modelled as subjected to waves and currents using the lumped mass method a safety factor of 1 5 was recommended for its polyethylene terephthalate pet mooring line huang and pan 2010 the submersible ocean cage aquaculture technology ocat cage shown in fig 6 b has been studied numerically and experimentally under various currents the results showed that its mooring tension was not linearly dependent on its cage submersion depth decew et al 2010b the self submersible spm cage depicted in fig 6 c has been investigated with numerical simulations and model tests in random waves these studies showed that the cage was more effective in wind waves than in swell waves shainee et al 2014 the submerged aquapod cage shown in fig 6 d has been studied with both numerical simulations and field tests in different arrangements these cages showed that a mooring grid was tolerant of currents from various directions goudey 2009 most recently an experimental study analysed the hydrodynamic performance of a vessel shaped spm aquaculture system huang et al 2020 this found that under combined wave current conditions current can reduce the mooring chain s pulse effect several drawbacks of the spm system must be assessed when designing moorings first additional safety factors should be considered during the selection of anchors mooring lines and other structural components second if the mooring experiences significant motion this can cause the connected hardware to fail lastly adopting the spm causes periodic changes in the direction of the tension applied to the anchor this variability must be considered when designing the mooring system unlike single point mooring mooring grid systems are either square or rectangle shaped grids this configuration allows aquaculture cages to be connected to several mooring lines the mooring grid system is designed to reduce cage disturbances caused by waves and currents the number of the cages in a mooring grid system ranges from 1 bai et al 2016 fredriksson et al 2003 fullerton et al 2004 hou et al 2017 huang et al 2007 shen et al 2018 yang et al 2019 2 huang et al 2008 zhao et al 2015b 4 decew et al 2010a fredriksson et al 2004 xu et al 2012 zhao et al 2015b 8 winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 zhao et al 2015b 16 bi et al 2017b to 20 fredriksson et al 2007b as depicted in fig 7 mooring grid systems are often kept at depths of 5 10 m underwater to avoid contact between their mooring ropes and the propellers of the working and well boats wires are the most fundamental element used in mooring lines and the netting frames of aquaculture structures they are laid in specific patterns to form strands that provide a rope with tensile strength tsukrov et al 2005 summarised the mechanical properties of the ropes and cables used for aquaculture cage mooring which were designed to withstand hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads specifically using finite element models they studied synthetic fibres nylon tire cord reinforced rubber stretch hoses and potentially light weight electromechanical cables rope structures can be categorised into two types twisted and braided ropes these rope types usually consist of 3 4 or 6 laid strands 8 plaited strands or 12 strands and double braid where each strand includes several twisted yarns forum 2008 mckenna et al 2004 to enhance the abrasion resistance of a braided rope a coating is employed a few typical ropes used in aquaculture moorings are exhibited in fig 8 3 1 2 analysis of moorings when analysing the mooring system three items must be considered because if they failed they could allow fish to escape 1 the design criteria of the mooring line 2 the coupling of mooring and aquaculture cages and 3 the hydrodynamic effects active on the mooring cage system the variables relevant to mooring design and fatigue analysis include the mooring length the mooring tension and the cage positions a hydrostatic analysis is necessary to determine how the static shape of the mooring gird can be maintained the static equilibrium of the tension loads in the anchor legs is estimated using the catenary equations faltinsen 1993 these equations can be used to specify the chain forming the catenary in the anchor leg the catenary equations are expressed as follows 6 d x t h a w s i n h 1 t v a w s t h a s i n h 1 t v a t h a t h a s e a 7 d z t h a w 1 t v a w s t h a 2 1 t v a t h a 2 t h a s e a w s 2 2 e a where d x and d z are the deflections of the mooring line in the horizontal and vertical directions parameter s represents the arclength from the end of the line w is the weight per unit length t h a and t v a are the horizontal and vertical components of tension e a is axial stiffness of the mooring line e is the elastic modulus and a is the cross sectional area of the mooring line for the hydrodynamic analysis of the mooring cage system three numerical models which incorporate the finite element method and the morison equation are used these are the consistent net element model decew et al 2010b fredriksson et al 2004 tsukrov et al 2003 the lumped mass model hou et al 2017 huang et al 2006 yang et al 2019 and the mass spring model cha and lee 2018 lee et al 2008 in these numerical models mooring lines are represented using truss elements or finite mass points interconnected by massless springs a nonlinear lagrangian approach is employed to account for large displacements of the structural elements or mass points to solve the nonlinear equations of motion newmark direct integration or runge kutta schemes are adopted the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural elements i e moorings are calculated using the morison equation after comparison with validated experimental measurements the results showed that the consistent net element model overestimated the mooring tension this was because of an overestimation of the inertia of the netting shen et al 2018 tsukrov et al 2003 in other words the equivalent truss elements cannot accurately represent a net panel subjected to waves and currents tsukrov et al 2000 the mass spring model and the lumped mass model also overestimated the mooring tension because they 1 did not consider the interference of the flow field and 2 used empirical values for the hydrodynamic coefficients cha and lee 2018 huang et al 2006 3 2 fluid interacting with floating collars the floating collar or the framework subjected to a high energy oceanic environment has several functions 1 supporting the whole cage in the water 2 maintaining the volume of the cage and 3 providing buoyancy for the entire cage system floating collars can be categorised as being either rigid or flexible and are usually made of different materials such as steel and high density polyethylene hdpe over the last ten years hdpe collars have been widely adopted for use in modern industrial fish farming fredheim and langan 2009 the floating collar can be shaped as circular polygonal or square lekang 2008 the rigid framework functions as a stable working platform for operation and management but may experience structural failure in extreme conditions in comparison flexible frameworks have excellent impact resistance to wave forces this kind of structure is used extensively for large commercial aquaculture systems scott and muir 2000 the environmental loads caused by waves and currents acting on the floating collar can be examined with either two dimensional or three dimensional studies newman 1977 3 2 1 two dimensional studies of floating collar segments the hydrodynamic behaviour of a floating collar can be studied by dividing it into several segments i e strip theory each segment is treated as a partially submerged rigid cylinder li et al 2007 the hydrodynamic forces active on a floating collar are calculated by totalling the forces on each segment then the hydrodynamic forces active on a floating collar are calculated by totalling the forces active on each individual segment analytical approaches such as the potential theory have been widely used to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of partially submerged circular cylinders ursell 1949 yu and ursell 1961 alternatively with the development of the morison equation morison et al 1950 researchers can also empirically predict the hydrodynamic forces on cylinders with different cross sections however the hydrodynamic coefficients in the morison equation namely the drag coefficient c d and the inertia coefficient c m must be gathered from either physical experiments or numerical implementations sarpkaya 1976 obtained the drag and inertia coefficients of a submerged horizontal cylinder using the morison equation the experimental results showed that these two hydrodynamic coefficients were functions of the keulegan carpenter kc and reynolds re numbers the empirical formulae of hydrodynamic coefficients based on kc numbers were also exhibited in xu et al 2018 the authors considered the effect of distance between the upstream and downstream segments of a floating collar accordingly the hydrodynamic coefficients have been evaluated the hydrodynamic coefficients were significantly lower for the downstream segments due to shielding from the upstream segments to obtain more accurate results the buoyancy of the submerged horizontal cylinder and the free surface effect were considered dixon 1980 experimentally investigated the interaction between waves and a partially submerged horizontal cylinder chen et al 2015 conducted numerical simulations to predict the wave forces of a partially submerged rectangular cylinder here the morison equation was modified to account for the free surface in terms of buoyancy li et al 2013b proposed a distribution method to calculate the transient buoyancy of a floating collar segment in waves qu et al 2017 studied a solitary tsunami like wave passing over two dimensional horizontal cylinders the hydrodynamic forces on and the vorticity behind the cylinders were obtained using a cfd scheme to evaluate the heave motion of a semi immersed cylinder loh et al 2018 used a two dimensional numerical model based on a modified morison equation chen et al 2013 experimentally investigated the high order force components of a near wall circular cylinder in oscillating flow cfd approaches have been employed to analyse the interactions between fluid and segments of a floating collar chen and christensen 2018 xu et al 2018 compared to experimental measurements cfd models slightly underestimated the fluid forces because of the effect of reynolds numbers two dimensional potential theory and the morison equation provide simplified models for evaluating a floating collar s hydrodynamic behaviour in the preliminary design stage of an aquaculture cage it is simple to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients using two dimensional studies however to analyse the effects of the wave especially the effects of wave frequency and far field a three dimensional study is required 3 2 2 three dimensional studies of floating collars the slender body theory and asymptotic expansion method have been used to investigate a three dimensional flow interacting with a floating rigid torus newman 1977 here the heave surge and pitch of the torus and the three dimensional effects of incident waves were evaluated based on this analytical investigation the hydroelastic effects on the dynamic response of floating collars have been studied fredriksson et al 2007a also beam theory curved beam theory and modified beam theory have been introduced to help study the nonlinear deformation and hydroelasticity of the floating collar dong et al 2010 investigated the dynamic response of a floating collar based on euler s law and curved beam theory the translation and rotation of the collar and the elastic deformation were obtained using the same theory zhao et al 2015a analysed the elastic response of a floating collar in waves li et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model based on curved beam theory that accounts for axial tension and curvature effects their obtained vertical accelerations of the floating collar are proportional to the non dimensional wave numbers shen et al 2018 experimentally investigated the dynamic response of a floating collar by considering its elastic properties the results showed that the elastic properties significantly affected the load distribution on the floating collar most recently qin et al 2020a 2020b studied the dynamic response and mooring loads of a floating collar and cage with both experimental and numerical approaches the authors reported that low frequency waves strongly affected the higher order harmonic components of the vertical acceleration it is important to note that frequency dependent hydrodynamic interaction between the incident waves and a floating collar can cause three dimensional effects therefore two dimensional strip theory and the morison equation are unable to predict a floating collar s overall hydrodynamic behaviour the discrepancy between strip theory and three dimensional potential theory is significant especially when predicting the added mass and damping of the floating collar caused by low frequency wave conditions 3 3 fluid interacting with net system a net cage provides an enclosure within which organisms can grow the net is made of different materials and has distinctive apertures for various purposes as discussed in section 2 understanding hydrodynamic impact could help improve the net design with respect to the water exchange and the cage deformation conventional methods for current force calculations and the deformation of aquaculture cage structures include four steps løland 1991 1 dividing the net cage into several net panels which could be parallel normal or with an angle arbitrary to the flow direction 2 the current velocity is reduced when flow passes through the net panel in accordance with the velocity reduction ratio 3 each net panel experiences drag force and deformation the drag and deformation depend on the flow velocity orientation net solidity and the weight of the sinkers 4 the total drag force of the cage is obtained by totalling the drag forces acting on each net panel 3 3 1 analytical studies of fluid forces several empirical formulae have been considered to evaluate the fluid forces acting on the net panels and aquaculture cages these empirical formulae can be divided into two categories those based on the morison equation choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b donley 1991 kawakami 1959 and those based on the screen aarsnes et al 1990 balash et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 milne 1972 zhan et al 2006 for those based on the morison equation the net is represented by a combination of individual twines and the fluid force on the net is equal to the total forces exerted on all net twines while for the formulae based on the screen the net is represented by several subpanels i e screens 3 3 1 1 empirical formulae based on morison equation to evaluate viscous loads on nets using morison type force model the net is represented by an equivalent system of slender cylinders i e twines the hydrodynamic forces acting on the twine can be estimated using the morison equation morison et al 1950 kawakami 1959 1964 evaluated the resistance of a flexible net panel in a uniform flow based on the morison equation they proposed a simple analytical formula as 8 f d c d 1 2 ρ a p u 2 where f d is the drag force of the net panel ρ is the fluid density a p is the project area of the net panel u is current velocity c d is the drag coefficient depending on the solidity ratio and the attack angle α for an ordinary twine in the net panel normal c d is approximately equal to 1 5 kawakami 1959 choo and casarella 1971 investigated the hydrodynamic resistance of towed cables by dividing the resistance into two components the normal and tangential resistance of the cable the authors found the resistance coefficients to be the function of the reynolds number the formulae are shown as follows 9 c d n 8 π r e n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 r e n 1 1 45 8 55 r e n 0 90 1 r e n 30 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 10 5 10 c d t π μ 0 55 r e n 1 2 0 084 r e n 2 3 where c d n and c d t are the normal and tangential coefficients of the resistance μ is the fluid viscosity s is the arc length between the lower end point and a material point of cable in an unstrained state s 0 077215665 ln 8 r e n r e n is the reynolds number based on the normal velocity when r e n is less than 2 33 10 5 eq 11 is used to evaluate the normal resistance coefficient 11 c d n 10 435 r e n 0 761 1 083 the approximation proposed by choo and casarella 1971 does not consider the reduction of the drag which is especially important at high reynolds numbers when the flow is turbulent thus decew et al 2010b expanded these formulae as shown in eq 12 12 c d n 8 π r e n s 1 0 87 s 2 0 r e n 1 1 45 8 55 r e n 0 90 1 r e n 30 1 1 4 r e n 0 50 30 r e n 2 33 10 5 3 41 10 6 r e n 5 78 10 5 2 33 10 5 r e n 4 92 10 5 0 401 1 e r e n 5 99 10 5 4 92 10 5 r e n 10 7 where e is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2 71828 these formulae from decew et al 2010b have only been tested for knotless netting with square meshes the reynolds number is in a range 286 4 4 10 4 s n is less than 0 238 representing the solidity ratio of a full scale net these formulae are valid for full scale cage structures at high current velocities e g 2 m s for knotted net donley 1991 and decew et al 2010b considered each knot as a sphere the authors proposed the flowing expressions for drag coefficients 13 c d 30 824 r e 0 8465 0 4347 0 r e 3 803 10 5 9 222 10 6 r e 4 3025 10 5 3 803 10 5 r e 4 165 10 5 0 0928 0 8 e 1 r e 1 3201 10 5 4 165 10 5 r e 1 259 10 6 0 1488 1 e r e 1 286 10 6 1 259 10 6 r e 10 8 only one drag component is required due to the symmetric geometry of the sphere many publications also provided the empirical values for the drag coefficients of the sphere i e the knot fredheim 2003 suggested that the drag coefficients of the knotted parts should be in a range from 1 0 to 2 0 several values were specially selected from 1 0 xu et al 2011 zhao et al 2007a 1 5 lee et al 2008 1 6 li et al 2006 to 2 0 zhao et al 2015c however these empirical values have been obtained without considering the effect of surface roughness which significantly affects the drag coefficients zdravkovich 1997 3 3 1 2 empirical formulae based on the screen unlike the morison equation based empirical formulae the screen based formulae used to evaluate the drag coefficient depend on the solidity ratio of a net the drag force acting on the screen or subpanel can be calculated as 14 d f d c d 1 2 ρ u 2 d a where d f d is the drag force on the subpanel c d is the drag coefficient and d a is the projected area of the screen milne 1972 estimated the drag coefficients of knotted and knotless nets with square meshes using the following empirical formulae for a knotless net 15 c d 1 0 1 365 s n 0 780 s n 2 for a knotted net 16 c d 1 0 1 885 s n 2 343 s n 2 where s n 2 d w l w d w is the twine diameter and l w is the length of a mesh bar the solidity ratios used in milne 1972 range from 0 2 clear net to 0 8 fouled net five water velocities from 0 25 m s to 1 5 m s in increments of 0 25 m s were applied to the system during full scale physical model testing the considered reynolds numbers are in a range 389 5 10 ³ the obtained drag coefficients for clear nets without biofouling effects vary from 1 260 to 1 416 while for biofouling nets the obtained drag coefficients vary between 2 129 and 3 985 similarly aarsnes et al 1990 and løland 1991 established an empirical relation for drag coefficients regarding the solidity ratio and the angle of attack c d is expressed as 17 c d 0 04 0 04 s n 1 24 s n 2 13 7 s n 3 sin α where α is the angle of attack when α equals 0 the net panel is parallel to the current direction yielding c d to be 0 04 the reynolds numbers used in aarsnes et al 1990 are between 200 and 1400 furthermore this formula is only used for square mesh nets where the solidity ratio s n is less than 0 35 s n 2 d w l w it should be noted that eq 15 to eq 17 do not consider the effect of the reynolds number to further explain the discrepancy between the empirical formula estimate and the experimental test results the effect of the reynolds number must be introduced zhan et al 2006 estimated the drag coefficients of diamond mesh nets with reynolds numbers ranging from 174 to 1 4 10 ³ while considering the interactions between net twines their drag coefficients are calculated with the following expression 18 c d 1 0 0 137 u n 1 002 s n 2 230 s n 2 where u n is the normal component of velocity for net panels with low solidity ratio e g 0 18 the drag coefficient is almost constant in the considered reynolds numbers eq 18 over predicts the drag coefficient due to the energy losses caused by shielding effects to account for the increased velocity when the flow passes through the net balash et al 2009 proposed the flowing expressions to calculate the drag coefficient for a knotless net 19 c d c d c y l 8 03 s n 2 0 74 s n 0 12 for a knotted net 20 c d c d c y l c d s p π d w l w 8 d w 2 1 π d w l w 8 d w 2 8 03 s n 2 0 74 s n 0 12 where c d c y l and c d s p are the drag coefficients for a circular cylinder and a sphere respectively d w is the diameter of the sphere i e the knot d w and l w are the diameter and length of the net bar according to white and corfield 2006 the drag coefficients of a circular cylinder and a sphere can be approximated for r e 5 10 ³ as 21 c d c y l 1 10 r e c 2 3 22 c d s p 24 r e c 6 1 r e c 1 2 0 4 where r e c is the corrected reynolds number which is characterized by the corrected velocity u c equal to u 1 s n 23 r e c u d w ν 1 s n the estimated reynolds numbers can be substituted in the formulae from balash et al 2009 to determine the drag coefficients of the nets the solidity ratio of the tested net is under 0 235 and the reynolds number ranges from 92 to 5 10 ³ the analytical model on average overestimated the drag coefficient this overestimate is most likely attributed to the absence of surface roughness to derive more general formulae suitable for application with a wider range of solidity ratios kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed a formula to calculate the drag coefficient of the nets which incorporates the reynolds number and the solidity ratio 24 c d c d c y l s n 2 s n 2 1 s n 2 the authors used a seventh order polynomial to approximate the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder i e single net twine at 10 3 2 r e 10 4 the seventh order polynomial is expressed as 25 c d c y l 78 46675 254 7873 log 10 re 327 8864 log 10 re 2 223 64577 log 10 re 3 87 92234 log 10 re 4 20 00769 log 10 re 5 2 44894 log 10 re 6 0 12479 log 10 re 7 this formula is not appropriate for reynolds numbers below 32 since 10 3 2 32 it is valid for a scaled cage model with s n 0 5 and angle of attack in the range 0 α π 4 the corrected towing velocity of the net twines which considers relative motion gives more accurate results the procedure has been illustrated in balash et al 2009 and kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 where the corrected velocity is given as u c u 1 s n comparisons between the analytical estimates and the physical model results showed that the empirical formula over predicted the drag coefficient the surface roughness of the net twines should be responsible for this overestimate details of those empirical formulae are illustrated in table 1 the empirical formulae in table 1 evaluate the drag coefficient using three parameters the angle of attack α the solidity ratio s n and the reynolds number r e the angle of attack is directly given by values aarsnes et al 1990 balash et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 zhan et al 2006 or it can be assumed to be dependent on reynolds numbers choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b consequently the morison equation based empirical formulae in decew et al 2010b slightly underestimates the drag coefficient the discrepancy between the analytical predictions and field testing results has been observed at high current velocities of up to 1 5 m s however this discrepancy can be overlooked since aquaculture farms are typically exposed to currents of 0 0 5 m s and only up to 1 5 m s during storms lader et al 2008 the angle of attack is the most dominant factor that influences hydrodynamic coefficients compared to the solidity ratio and the reynolds number lee et al 2005 2008 the drag coefficient increases when the angle of attack is between zero and 75 it slightly decreases when the angle of attack is above 75 gansel et al 2014 this drag coefficient reduction at higher attack angle above 75 is attributed to the reconfiguration of the net all suggested formulae that incorporate the angle of attack are restricted to the range where the solidity ratio is less than 0 5 therefore to obtain more accurate hydrodynamic coefficients the angle of attack the solidity ratio and the reynolds number must be taken into consideration the solidity ratios for all the screen based formulae in table 1 use the expression s n 2 d w l w as net solidity the overestimation of the drag coefficient is attributed to net solidity løland 1991 reported that the hydrodynamic interactions between the net twines could be neglected under the assumption that l w d w 6 in other words the hydrodynamic interactions are to be overlooked if the net solidity is less than 0 33 and vice versa the effect of the reynolds number is due to viscous fluid the analytical formula from aarsnes et al 1990 over predicted the drag forces by approximately 0 9 1 3 times compared to those measured in 200 r e 800 lader and enerhaug 2005 even considering the shielding effect of upstream nets the analytical prediction remains as an overestimate for the general net twines of an aquaculture cage according to fredheim 2005 the reynolds number is in the range o 10 2 10 4 thus the effect of the reynolds number should be considered to increase prediction accuracy in evaluations of the drag coefficient the surface roughness of the net twines has received little attention in comparison to the angle of attack the solidity ratio and the reynolds number in particular the effects of the helix structures upon net twines remain uncertain hence to obtain more accurate net cage drag coefficients it is imperative to conduct further studies on the effects of surface roughness and the helix structures upon net twines 3 3 2 numerical implementations of fluid forces before deploying net pens to aquaculture sites an assessment of the environmental loads acting on the netting structure must be conducted this assessment is necessary to improve the design performance and durability of aquaculture cages in particular engineering innovations specific to open ocean environments are needed research in this area would facilitate the design of reliable systems that can withstand severe open ocean conditions potential research methods include the mathematical modelling of structural response to high energy wave conditions and three dimensional simulations of the environmental loads acting on aquaculture systems three approaches for estimating the fluid forces on and the hydrodynamic response of a net have been developed these are the finite element method the computational fluid dynamics method and the coupled fsi method which combines the finite element and computational fluid dynamics methods aside from these three approaches which are frequently discussed in the existing subject literature kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed two hydrodynamic force models to calculate viscous forces on nets these are the morison type force model and the screen type force model and they are widely used in finite element approaches these two models are dependent on how a net is approximated it is treated as either a set of twines or several sub panels most recently a comparative study of these two models was conducted under a finite element scheme to support further development of force models to net cages cheng et al 2020 3 3 2 1 finite element method so far for modelling the net of an aquaculture cage four different finite element models have been established based on the element type these models can be classified as 1 triangular element model priour 1999 2003 2 truss model theret 1994 tsukrov et al 2003 3 mass spring model cha and lee 2002 lee et al 2005 and 4 lumped mass model huang et al 2006 li et al 2006 all models are formulated using sets of differential equations these differential equations can be solved in the time domain by using numerical integration techniques the element types of these four different models are exhibited in fig 9 1 triangular element model to freely discretise the net without considering whether the side of the element is parallel to the net twine or not priour 1999 developed a triangular element model it assumes that the elongation and elasticity modulus are constant in each triangular element the net is modelled with triangular elements interconnected by defined nodes which are used to find the equilibrium position of the net as shown in fig 9 a twines and knots are considered to be circular cylinders and spheres so that they can be represented by the respective elements elements do not account for compressive loads when representing the behaviour of netting materials with low bending stiffness the equilibrium of the net is calculated at each time step using the newton raphson method it is easy to define the triangular elements in the simulation because the sides of the triangular do not need to be parallel to the net twines it is also possible to conduct a refinement by dividing an element into several smaller elements in this manner small triangular elements can be used in a highly deformed area of the net while elsewhere the triangular elements can be large during simulations one triangular element can represent several physical meshes of the net thus the triangular element model is a mesh grouping method li et al 2006 compared to previous finite element models the triangular element model improves computational efficiency this model is widely used to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces acting on trawl nets priour 2003 2005 2014 and aquaculture cage nets endresen et al 2013 enerhaug et al 2012 moe føre et al 2015 2 truss model the truss model assumes that there is no interaction between net twines by separating the net into individual twines and knots the net can be modelled using truss elements each truss element is given a centre node and can buckle under compression the equilibrium position of the net is calculated at each time step with an iteration scheme such as the newton raphson iteration scheme like the triangular element model the truss model allows several physical net twines to be represented by one truss element to reduce the number of elements and improve computational efficiency tsukrov et al 2003 proposed a consistent net element model based on the truss elements the representative equivalent truss elements in the consistent net element model are shown in fig 9 b the evaluation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the net element is based on the morison equation the total drag on the net is equal to the total drag on its individual elements fredheim and faltinsen 2001 the truss model makes it possible to account for details of net structures and flow fields the truss model has been used extensively to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of net cages decew et al 2010b used the truss model to predict the mooring dynamic behaviour of a single point moored submersible fish cage under currents their studies achieved a good balance between numerical predictions and experimental measurements li et al 2013a 2013b analysed the dynamic response and mooring tension under current regular and irregular waves respectively the geometric nonlinearity of the floating collar has been considered providing a new insight to analysing the hydrodynamic behaviours of aquaculture cages fredriksson et al 2014 employed the truss model to examine the hydrodynamic behaviour of nets the results revealed how the structural components of the net system were loaded 3 mass spring model in the mass spring model the netting structure is represented by several mass points connected by massless springs as shown in fig 9 c for nets with knots the knots are considered as mass points in the model to improve computational efficiency several physical meshes of the net are approximated using a virtual mesh it is assumed that the virtual mesh and the physical mesh are geometrically identical the virtual mesh is required to have the same physical properties e g mass projected area and hydrodynamic coefficients the equation of motion for each mass point adheres to newton s second law the formulated differential equations are solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the mass spring model does not consider the mutual interference of the velocity field in the combined wave current conditions the drag coefficient of the sphere i e mass point is given as 1 5 which is an empirical value described in fredriksson et al 2003 recently cha and lee 2018 investigated the mooring loads of a copper alloy cage model under waves and currents their results showed that numerical simulations overestimated the mooring loads than experiments did 4 lumped mass model the implementation of the lumped mass model is similar to that of the mass spring model the net is modelled with several lumped mass points interconnected with massless springs all knots on the net and the centre of each mesh side are defined as lumped mass points as shown in fig 9 d it assumes that each lumped mass point is a spherical element and the drag coefficient for the sphere element is constant e g 1 6 the drag coefficients of the cylinder elements i e net twine represented by massless spring vary with the direction of the relative fluid velocity in the lumped mass model the diameters of the lumped mass points for knotted and knotless nets are different li et al 2006 suggested that these values should be 3 14 and 1 5 times the twine diameter of knotted and knotless nets respectively the hydrodynamic forces on the net are calculated with the morison equation the fifth order runge kutta method is used to solve the differential equations of motion to improve computational efficiency a mesh grouping method is used several physical meshes are represented by an equivalent mesh with the same geometrical and physical properties such as the projected area and hydrodynamic coefficients the mesh grouping method has been used extensively to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of aquaculture cages hou et al 2017 xu et al 2012 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2007b it seems that the mass spring model and the lump mass model are very similar to each other both use mass points and springs to model the net and the mass points are connected by the massless springs the equations of motion for these two models are the same both have been solved using runge kutta schemes however differences between the models include the diameter and drag coefficients of the spheres i e mass points and their solutions to the equation of motion compared to the mass spring model the lumped mass model introduces sphere diameters i e the mass points explicitly as 3 14 and 1 5 times the twine diameter with regards to knotted and knotless nets the drag coefficients of the sphere also slightly differ as their values are 1 5 mass spring model and 1 6 lumped mass model furthermore both models use runge kutta schemes to solve the equations of motion when using fourth order mass spring model and fifth order lumped mass model methods it is important to consider the balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy these four finite element models all use the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic forces acting on the square and diamond meshes of knotted and knotless nets their ways of determining the hydrodynamic coefficients varies slightly the truss model establishes the hydrodynamic coefficient with empirical formulae choo and casarella 1971 decew et al 2010b however the other models select the hydrodynamic coefficients based on empirical values the newton raphson and rouge kutta approaches are used to solve the equations of motion moe føre et al 2015 conducted a comparison between the triangular element model the truss model and the spring model their results showed that the truss and spring models were computationally effective but over predicted the drag forces the wake model incorporated with the triangular elements also over predicted the drag forces thus it seems that all the numerical models have their strengths and weaknesses and that further development is needed 3 3 2 2 computational fluid dynamics method the basic theory of obtaining fluid forces with a computational fluid dynamics cfd scheme differs from those that directly use the morison equation considering fluid viscosity in the cfd simulations the governing equations navier stokes equations are approximated by discretization approaches such as the finite volume method fvm the velocity and pressure of the fluid can be obtained by solving the discretized equations for the sake of computational efficiency when obtaining the fluid forces of a net via a cfd approach the net is usually approximated by a sheet of porous media rather than a system of cylinders the reynolds average navier stokes rans equations are discretized with a second order finite volume method the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple pressure correction technique patankar and spalding 1983 are used to calculate the divergence free condition of the velocity field the eddy viscosity is obtained using the standard k ε model launder and spalding 1983 and wall functions the feasibility of the porous media model mostly depends on the resistance coefficients which can be determined with analytical methods patursson et al 2010 used a least squared normalised error to find the best porous media resistance coefficients incited by patursson et al 2010 investigations regarding the flow field of a net panel and aquaculture cages under currents have been conducted zhao et al 2013a 2013b winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 concluded that the porous media model over predicted the velocity deficit this overestimation could be caused by a higher net solidity and the shielding effect of upstream cages to obtain the porous media resistance coefficients chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach based on a morison type force model their results showed that the porous media model underestimated the drag coefficients of the net 3 3 2 3 coupled fsi method the porous media model offers a step forward in evaluating the hydrodynamic behaviour of aquaculture cages mainly because it allows the fluid field of a net cage to be obtained however it still overestimates the velocity deficit and underestimates the drag coefficients therefore the coupled fsi model has been developed to accurately estimate the hydrodynamic performance of the net structures this uses the porous media model to simulate the fluid field and the lumped mass model to approximate the flexible net the studies regarding the coupled fsi model slightly underestimated the drag force compared to the results of physical model tests bi et al 2014a chen and christensen 2017 this discrepancy is attributed to the effects of the absent reynolds numbers it is worth mentioning that the governing equations used in previous studies are rans and the k ε model is used to describe the turbulent flow the k ε model is constrained in some conditions such as the no slip wall of the model the equation for epsilon is postulated and it is not accurate in the near wall regions thus further study of an appropriate turbulence model should be conducted 3 3 3 physical model and field tests of fluid forces the experimental investigation of the fluid forces on nets is necessary to verify the analytical and numerical results three major factors that affect the physical model scale selection need to be examined before test design begins these are 1 model characteristics for instance the geometry and material properties 2 wave tow basin dimensions and 3 wave generation basin dimensions determine the reflection effect of the model and the tank walls on the measurements in general more accurate results are obtained when there are lower levels of refection between the model and tank walls the wave generator must produce the scaled wave heights and periods for tests doing this in a suitable manner requires a comprehensive insight into the fundamentals of wave generator theory regarding the experimental investigations of the net panel nomura and nozawa 1962 used tank experiments to propose a simple relationship between fluid force and the inclined angle of the net panel lader et al 2007a tested the wave forces of three net panels with different solidities the results showed that the horizontal force is about ten times larger than the vertical force and that the force increases with increasing net solidity to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of a square net panel liu et al 2012 conducted forced oscillating experiments in a water flume this allowed them to establish the relationship between the inertia force and the kc number to study the fluid forces of purse seine nets riziotis et al 2013 deployed a net panel in a wave tank with three typical angles 0 45 90 a submergence test was also conducted in still water experimental tests have undertaken to evaluate the fluid forces acting on net cages for instance fredriksson et al 1999 investigated hydrodynamic forces and dynamic response with a scaled model test the heave pitch and surge of the cage were analysed palczynski 2000 conducted a model test in a towing tank to investigate the scaling law of net cages lader et al 2003 and lader and enerhaug 2005 conducted a series of experiments to examine the forces and deformations on a net cage in a uniform current in terms of field tests lader et al 2008 conducted field measurements to examine the drag forces and deformation of net cages decew et al 2013 used acoustic sensors to monitor the deformation of a cage deployed in an ocean field experimental investigations of the biofouling effects on drag forces of the net cages were conducted by bi et al 2018 these found that an accumulation of hydroids can lead to a ten times greater hydrodynamic load on the nets recently qu et al 2019 experimentally investigated the drag forces on a square cage their results showed that the drag on a diamond mesh net was 1 6 times the drag on a square mesh net therefore it can be concluded that 1 drag force increases alongside the solidity of a net 2 with identical outline areas the drag force of a diamond mesh net is greater than that of a square mesh net 3 the drag force of bio fouled nets may be ten times that of clear nets there are two possible explanations for the different drag forces of diamond mesh and square mesh nets one is that the wakes behind square and diamond meshes are different resulting in different drag forces bi et al 2017a the other is that in the square mesh net the reconfiguration of the net causes drag reduction the drag reduction induced by the reconfiguration has been quantified with a coefficient known as vegel s exponent as described in de langre 2008 de langre et al 2012 vogel 1989 2009 3 4 fluid interacting with aquaculture cage cages 3 4 1 shielding effect and velocity reduction 3 4 1 1 wake models to the shielding effect when the aquaculture cage is subjected to currents the upstream net reduces the current inside the cage resulting in the drag reduction of the downstream net this phenomenon is referred to as the shielding effect aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1993 which significantly affects the drag forces on the net to improve computational accuracy for predicting drag forces on the net an appropriate model to account for the shielding effect is required 1 huse wake model the formulation of the huse model is based on turbulent wake theory alongside momentum considerations this model has been used to calculate the current forces on a cylinder array under the assumption that the distance between cylinders is large compared to the cylinder diameter huse 1993 the schematic of the wake model is depicted in fig 10 2 blevins wake model similar to the huse model the belvins model assumes that the upstream cylinder is not affected by the downstream cylinder provided the distance between the upstream and downstream cylinders is over three times the diameter this semi empirical model is used to determine the drag and lift coefficients of a downstream cylinder it does this by considering the distance between the upstream and downstream cylinders the drag coefficient of the upstream cylinder and the cylinder diameters blevins et al 2006 after comparing these wake models cifuentes salazar 2016 found that combining finite element simulations with the wake model improved the accuracy of estimating drag forces modifications have been made to the wake model to account for the drag and velocity reductions cifuentes and kim 2017 considered the shielding effect that causes the loss of kinetic energy so proposed the wake model accordingly their results showed that the wake models slightly underestimated the drag force 3 4 1 2 solutions to velocity reduction current reduction occurs when flow passes through the cages leading to lower oxygen levels inside than outside the cages this lower oxygen level can affect fish growth and thus the investigation of current reduction has become an important subject two approaches can be used to evaluate velocity reduction the wake deficit model and the porous media model 1 wake deficit model to gain an accurate estimate of the current force acting on the aquaculture cage it is imperative to identify the current reduction caused by the shielding effect from the upstream net of a cage løland 1991 proposed a wake deficit model based on the boundary layer theory schlichting 1968 the wake was generated by a screen or a net using linear free wake equations in conjunction with an eddy viscosity formulation the near wake was described by a sum of cylinder model and the far wake was described by a plane wake model the two dimensional velocity profile of a turbulent wake behind a single cylinder can be calculated using the linearized turbulent wake equations løland 1993 verified the theory with experimental tests and a linear correlation between the velocity reduction factor and the drag coefficient is proposed to be 26 r 1 0 0 46 c d where r is the velocity reduction factor for a single cage several velocity reduction factors based on numerical simulations and experimental tests are established from 0 7 zhan et al 2006 0 8 bi et al 2018 fredriksson et al 2007b gansel et al 2018 klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2003 0 85 bi et al 2014a huang et al 2006 2007 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2013 to 0 9 bi et al 2013 decew et al 2010b fredriksson 2001 patursson et al 2010 yao et al 2016 zhao et al 2013a 2013b the ones for multi cage systems are based on theoretical considerations numerical investigations and experimental tests the velocity reduction factors are given as r 1 0 46 c d aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1991 or by empirical values as illustrated in table 2 it is difficult to determine accurate velocity reduction factors when the fluid passes through the netting or cage array because of the complicated interactions between the fluid and flexible structures selecting a velocity reduction factor is a somewhat arbitrary process for full scale aquaculture cages gansel et al 2018 conducted field tests to study the velocity reduction factor after compared with the physical model tests the results showed that physical model tests underestimated the velocity reduction factor thus a velocity reduction factor of 0 8 has been recommended to avoid underestimation moreover it is difficult to distinguish between upstream and downstream areas when nets are three dimensional and their shapes are complicated lader and enerhaug 2005 hence to precisely predict the behaviour of aquaculture cage systems more additional experiments are encouraged 2 the porous media model the wake deficit model is the simplest way to model the flow field but it is difficult to determine the wake region when the net system is complex e g cage array most empirical values of velocity reduction obtained with physical model tests seem random computational fluid dynamics combined with the porous media model can provide details regarding water velocity distribution thus they offer an alternative for estimating current velocity reductions patursson et al 2010 used the porous media model to simulate the net panel a k ε turbulence model was used to describe the flow field and the rans equations have been solved using the finite volume method a velocity reduction factor of 0 9 was obtained using the porous media model in the cfd scheme the flow field around a single cage and two tandem cages has been estimated zhao et al 2013a 2013b the flow reduction is approximately 10 17 inside a single cage and is 33 37 inside a downstream cage when two cages are in a tandem arrangement bi et al 2014b developed a coupled fsi model that combines the porous media model for the flow field with the lumped mass model for the net the average velocity reductions of 10 and 25 have been obtained for single and two cages in rows a recent study showed that the velocity reduction of a net with a great biofouling effect could approach 21 4 bi et al 2018 overall the porous media model underestimates the velocity reduction factor because of the lower porous resistance coefficients used in the simulation 3 4 2 cage deformation and volume reduction 3 4 2 1 determination of volume reduction aquaculture cages deform when currents influence them because current loads affect the overall net chamber geometry causing cage volume loss this in turn may negatively impact fish farming volume loss has been shown to cause stress in fish contributing to low growth rates and higher cases of infection harper and wolf 2009 ortuno et al 2001 rowland et al 2006 additionally open ocean environments can cause fish to swim quickly in response to strong currents if the fish exhaust their anaerobic capacity they will be forced against the cage wall oppedal et al 2011 the effects of cage deformation and fast fish swimming pose great challenges for fish farming thus it is essential to understand cage deformation and volume loss cage deformation caused by currents has been extensively studied aarsnes et al 1990 decew et al 2013 fredheim 2005 huang et al 2006 2007 lader et al 2003 li et al 2006 qu et al 2019 tsukrov et al 2011 zhao et al 2007a the deformations of scaled cage models under varying flow regimes have been tested in flume tanks lader and enerhaug 2005 in tank trials total cage volume was found to reduce by up to 35 when there was a steady flow velocity of 0 5 m s lader and enerhaug 2005 lee et al 2005 aside from laboratory tests having in situ data for cage deformation is critical to facilitate a better understanding of the responses of these flexible systems decew et al 2013 the data sets can also be used to calibrate numerical model predictions and laboratory experiments there are four approximation approaches to estimate the volume reduction of an aquaculture cage within a current these are 1 the scalar triple product method 2 the divergence method 3 the signed volume method and 4 the polygon method decew et al 2013 klebert et al 2015 all these can be used to compare the cage volume within physical model tests field measurements and numerical model predictions the first three methods are used to estimate a net cage s volume when it has a flat bottom net the final approach is used to determine a net cage s volume when it has a cone shaped bottom net schematic detailing of different methods for volume calculations are depicted in fig 11 1 scalar triple product method the scalar triple product method has been developed by huang et al 2006 to measure cage deformation and calculate the instantaneous volume of a shape by representing it as a series of stacked geometric disks the volume can be separated into m levels with each level divided into n sectors each sector can then be divided into three tetrahedrons as shown in fig 11 a the cylindrical volume represents the model in its undeformed state using the principle of scalar triple products the volume of the cylinder can be separated into individual tetrahedrons fig 11 b it can then be calculated by summing the volume of all tetrahedrons fig 11 c and d the total volume of the cylindrical cage is expressed with the following equation 27 i 1 n 1 6 a b c where is the total volume n is the total number of tetrahedrons that comprise the volume and a b and c are the vectors that construct the tetrahedron when this method is used on a flexible body such as a cage in a dynamic environment it is necessary to monitor the deformation of the tetrahedrons inaccurate volume calculations may result from a disk inversion i e if points a2 b2 or b3 rise above point a1 there will be additional volume present which is absent from the field and numerical models like most volume computational methods accuracy is largely dependent on the level of model discretization or the number of known nodal coordinates 2 divergence method the divergence method uses gauss s theorem to approximate the volume as follows 28 δ f d s f n d a s where a s is the surface area of the enclosed volume and n is a unit normal vector of the surface plane volume if the initial volume is assumed to be unity f 1 then the integration of the left hand side of the equation becomes the total instantaneous volume of the enclosed surface s the surface of an object can be represented as a series of discrete triangular planar elements as shown in fig 11 e thus applying the divergence theorem to each discretized element and summing all the triangular surface elements yields the approximated volume of the object by applying the finite discrete form of the surface area integral the following equation can be derived to calculate the cage s volume 29 i 1 n x g i i y g i j z g i k r 12 i r 23 i r 12 i r 23 i δ a i where g i is the geometric centre of a triangular planar element r 12 i and r 23 i are vectors of the i th triangular planar element δ a i is the area of triangular planar element i 3 signed volume method the signed volume method employs triangular surface mesh elements to represent the cage zhang and chen 2001 tetrahedral elements are then created with a fourth vertex outside the volume of the cage unlike other approaches in the signed volume method all the elements must have the same point of origin as shown in fig 11 f the total volume is then calculated as 30 i 1 n 1 6 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 where i stands for the index of elementary tetrahedrons x i 1 y i 1 z i 1 x i 2 y i 2 z i 2 and x i 3 y i 3 z i 3 are the coordinates of the vertices of tetrahedron i and they are ordered so that the normal of tetrahedron i is consistent with other tetrahedrons normal the details of this method are demonstrated in zhang and chen 2001 4 polygon method this method assumes that the cage is divided into numerous planes and that each plane is a polygon as shown in fig 11 g the area of the polygon changes as a second order polynomial and can be integrated to yield the volume of the polygon it does this as follows 31 0 h a x d x 1 6 h a l a u 4 a h where a l a u and a h are the areas of the polygons in the lower upper and middle planes respectively h is the height between the lower and upper planes the algorithm continues by adding planes above the upper plane until the final top is reached the first step is a special case with a l 0 comparisons with the scalar triple product divergence and signed volume methods have been conducted by decew et al 2013 the authors found that these three methods provided similar results within each load case however the numerical estimation of the triple scalar volume technique under predicted field measurements klebert et al 2015 reported that the polygon method under predicted the field measurements by approximately 10 overall these four approaches could be used to gain an understanding of cage deformation caused by currents to help develop new generation aquaculture cages 4 fluid organism interactions 4 1 fish swimming behaviour 4 1 1 group behaviour and schooling patterns fish swimming mechanics and behaviour in complex flow environment have been extensively studied the reasons for investigating fish swimming behaviour include 1 to help design inspiring robotic devices for propulsion and maneuvering under water salazar et al 2018 sfakiotakis et al 1999 2 to gain an understanding of how fish survive within and have adapted to their environments pavlov and kasumyan 2000 3 to manage fisheries and ecology from a hydrodynamic perspective liao 2007 4 to understand the interaction between fluid aquaculture structures and fish bi et al 2020 he et al 2018 fish respond to cage environment by altering their vertical positions and modifying other behaviours dempster et al 2009 johansson et al 2006 2007 2009 korsøen et al 2009 studies on their behaviour have revealed that fish rarely distribute themselves randomly in aquaculture cages but instead adapt their swimming depth and speed in response to environmental gradients oppedal et al 2011 schooling behaviour is one of the most common forms of social behaviour in fish and is observed in numerous fish species many publications have investigated the schooling behaviour of the fish within and outside of aquaculture cages oppedal et al 2011 pavlov and kasumyan 2000 basic schooling types in fish include moving school resting school feeding school defensive look around school and defensive school for evading solitary predators as shown in fig 12 typically farmed fish such as salmon form swim in a circular pattern during the daytime and avoid the innermost part and the corners of the cage dempster et al 2008 2009 korsøen et al 2009 this schooling behaviour leads to 1 5 5 times the stocking density in certain areas of the cage fish exhibit circular schooling behaviours to avoid interactions with the cage wall and other fish føre et al 2009 during feeding time the circular schooling breaks down and fish swim towards the food pellets these investigations e g bi et al 2020 he et al 2018 on mutual effects between aquaculture cages and fish show that 1 fish schoolings do not have remarkable contributions to drag acting on the net cage while they have pronounced effect on mooring loads 2 fish schooling patterns predominantly affect flow inside and around the net cage 3 the swimming behaviour and fish schooling are complex and have not been completely understood 4 1 2 individual behaviour and fish locomotion a better understanding of individual fish species behaviour will provide essential information regarding schooling behaviours that can be used to design effective new aquaculture systems locomotion is the result of the transfer of momentum from fish musculature to the surrounding water weihs 1989 recently salazar et al 2018 divided fish locomotion into three groups based on previous research these were fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion the authors demonstrated that caudal fin swimmers were the largest category within fin oscillation while the largest category in fin undulation was pectoral fin swimmers there was less variety in jet propulsion fish maneuver under water most of them produce thrust to resist drag the evolution of bladder provides fish buoyancy to maintain depth control it is essential to recognise that quickly lifting an aquaculture cage during harvest operations can lead to the death of closed bladder fish such as cod fredheim and langan 2009 thus the lifting speed of the aquaculture cage should be taken into account when designing submersible aquaculture systems fish maneuver with auxiliary fins and by flexing their bodies webb and weihs 2015 classified the stability of fish into two categories hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stabilities fish maneuvers in steady and unsteady flows by responding to the constant velocity and any changes to it by maneuvering vogel 2008 defined almost all aquatic locomotion at low reynolds number in his research the modes of aquatic locomotion were classified into four categories drag based swimming lift based swimming direct reaction swimming and interfacial swimming weihs 1989 defined the locomotion of fish from the perspective of energy the velocity and typical length of fish were dimensioned using reynolds numbers at a prescribed reynolds number the forces could be represented with either the added mass mode or the vorticity mode voesenek et al 2018 divided fish locomotion into cyclic and acyclic swimming during cyclic swimming because of variations between swimming cycles the average cycle speed is hardly constant acyclic swimming incorporates most of the fish s swimming motions such as turns escape maneuvers feeding strikes and burst and coast swimming acyclic swimming has been defined as unsteady locomotion in the study of borazjani 2015 fast starts c start or s start escape maneuvers turns acceleration deceleration and sudden changes in speed during steady locomotion were also included 4 1 3 unsteady forces and wake dynamics it has been shown that the motion of fish body and fins enhance water turbulence of the net cage and vortices generated by fish are dependent on fish species and sizes bi et al 2020 moreover the turbulence effect should not be neglected when studying the flow passes through net cages with the fish inside martin et al 2020 based on these significant findings it is imperative to study fish swimming mechanics and vortex dynamics to support the further design of new open offshore aquaculture systems the analytical models numerical approaches and experimental measurements that can be used to investigate unsteady locomotion and hydrodynamic forces are examined in this section the theoretical models based on elongated body theory and inviscid vortex methods are inviscid methods numerical approaches mainly focus on the applications of computational fluid dynamics which consider fluid viscosity the experimental methods using particle image velocimetry piv are also introduced in detail the reynolds number for most species of grown up fish ranges from 10 3 to 10 8 wu 2011 the boundary layer enveloping the fish is so thin that its thickness can be neglected when calculating the thrust and power of fish locomotion lighthill 1970 wu 2011 based on this assumption the elongated body theory ebt has been extensively used lighthill 1960 1970 1971 1969 wu 2011 ebt is the first approach used to study the mechanisms of aquatic locomotion it assumes that the fluid is inviscid and irrotational and that the flow does not separate weihs 1972 applied lighthill s ebt to large amplitude movement and turning maneuvers in his study the forces caused by tangential movements were neglected however this method overestimated the forces and thrust efficiency weihs 1972 another theoretical method employed to analyse unsteady locomotion was the vortex panel method hess and smith 1967 this method was used to calculate potential flows where the effects of compressibility and viscosity were negligible and the potential vortex satisfied the laplace equation by combining the vortices the flow around complex geometries could be evaluated katz and plotkin 2001 this vortex panel method has been used to ascertain the forces active during unsteady motions however it could not determine the flow separation and dynamic wakes during fish maneuvering still the vortex panel method is a practical approach for simplifying the relevant mathematical and computational complexities asides from the theoretical methods numerical methods can be used to investigate the hydrodynamic forces on the fish these are the boundary element method cheng and chahine 2001 and cfd maertens et al 2017 moored 2018 triantafyllou et al 2016 cfd based approaches predict flow separation and the vortices behind the fish with boundary confirming moving grid and non boundary confirming fixed grid methods borazjani 2015 the governing equations for the flow around aquatic swimmers during unsteady locomotion are unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations for the boundary confirming method the arbitrary lagrangian euler ale formulation is usually used donea et al 2017 non boundary confirming methods such as the overset method has also been frequently used for fish swimming behaviours meakin 1999 the ale method is used to investigate unsteady locomotion li et al 2012 2014 the multi block has been separately set for the whole domain and fish bodies other cfd investigations regarding fish maneuvers fin dynamics fluid dynamics and vortex can be seen in horner and jayne 2008 müller and van leeuwen 2004 najafi and golestanian 2004 van leeuwen et al 2008 verhagen 2004 the mechanisms of viscous forces were investigated thoroughly including the thrust the drag vortices and the strouhal number the model for unsteady locomotion in the intermediate reynolds numbers has been implemented by li et al 2012 and gazzola et al 2014 their results showed that body wave amplitude has a profound effect on fish swimming performance however in the inertia dominant flow regime turbulence makes it difficult to conduct accurate simulations for instance the kolmogorov scale of turbulence eddies decreases in the intermediate reynolds numbers which requires refined meshes to resolve the smaller scales the turbulence model based rans equations could be dissipative with this issue thus a large eddy simulation or other advanced approaches are recommended for use within intermediate reynolds numbers simulations experimental techniques such as particle image velocimetry piv have been used to quantify wake dynamics behind swimming fish daghooghi and borazjani 2015 muller et al 2000 müller et al 2008 stamhuis and videler 1995 wolfgang et al 1999 piv measurements behind steadily swimming fish along the horizontal mid plane of the body show clear two dimensional karman vortex street configurations and three dimensional vortex rings two effects should be considered to understand the wake vortex dynamics when analysing piv data 1 the wake impulse and 2 the added mass effects the momentum of the wake can be determined with the wake impulse the added mass effects could induce additional impulses which cannot be neglected epps and techet 2010 considered the thickness of a finite vortex core when formulating their full wake vortex dynamics the vortex ring linking was not considered when calculating the hydrodynamic impulse from piv data however the use of two dimensional linked cores could cause the overestimation of the thrust produced by the swimming fish further three dimensional piv methods are needed three dimensional piv measurements can be obtained by using imaging and reconstruction techniques such as tomographic piv stereo piv and defocusing digital piv kitzhofer et al 2011 mendelson and techet 2015 scarano 2012 flammang et al 2011 provided complete visualization of 3d vortex rings behind bluegill sunfish and cichlid fish in a flume by utilizing defocusing digital piv after conducting piv tests for the caudal fin wake of a dogfish shark flammang et al 2011 found that a highly three dimensional dual linked vortex ring structure is far more complicated than any two dimensional vortex velocity fields observed with piv have been used to estimate pressure fields in a horizontal plane around swimming fish dabiri et al 2014 the shear stress distribution can be calculated through the velocity gradient near the fish s body which makes it possible to calculate the force distribution on the fish s body from a velocity field around the fish from a biomechanical perspective of fish swimming behaviour we can see the developed mechanisms and their significance to the aquatic environment in this review a mechanistic understanding of fish swimming behaviour provides insight into the study of fish in complex fluid environments such as in aquaculture cages exposed to open ocean the understanding based on the interactions between fluid aquaculture cage structures and fish is essential for the development of new aquaculture systems 5 conclusions and future perspectives understanding the fluid structure interactions of cage based aquaculture is essential for reliably estimating the hydrodynamic behaviour of the aquaculture structures and farmed organisms the cross disciplinary studies included in this review illustrate a broad variety of work to understand the interactions between fluid aquaculture cages and fish with this understanding further aquaculture systems can potentially be designed to better withstand the rigors of the open ocean this review summarizes a growing body of work that shows how ocean environmental loads can have dramatic effects on offshore aquaculture cages and fish swimming behaviour it is clear how analytical approaches rarely yield accurate solutions due to a tendency of making assumptions conclusive data shows that the morison equation based empirical formulae underestimated the drag force on the net while the screen based empirical formulae overestimated the drag force the most reliable methods to use are validated physical models and numerical implementations however the use of physical models and numerical implementations must consider the strengths and weaknesses of each method the comparison between field measurements physical models and numerical implementations suggests that physical models are more conservative than the others because physical models overestimated the loads more than the numerical predictions did numerical implementations are inexpensive and flexible however additional conditions such as the interference of the fluid field and the effects of reynolds numbers must be considered otherwise overestimations of drag force and mooring tension will occur when using finite element models even a coupled fsi model has been developed to improve computational accuracy but this model is still in its early stages using the porous media model in the cfd scheme provides details regarding water velocity distribution but it underestimates the velocity reduction factor compared with field measurements the numerical estimations underestimate the volume reduction factor physical model approaches require wave basins instruments and certain similarity principles but direct observations can provide a better understanding of system behaviour to gain a better understanding of unsteady fish locomotion controlled laboratory studies will continue to be one of the pronounced approaches for examining the fundamental mechanisms still several issues must be addressed for example fish swim fast in aquaculture cages subjected to strong currents to avoid being pushed against the cage wall oppedal et al 2011 the investigation of swimming efficiency has recently attracted attention floryan et al 2018 more physical model tests and numerical simulations are required to study the fast swimming behaviour and swimming efficiency of fish this will help select appropriate farming sites and improve the designs of offshore aquaculture cage systems moreover aquaculture cages deployed in north atlantic occasionally make contact with drift ice masser and bridger 2007 which could damage the cage structures fluid ice aquaculture structure interactions however have received little attention and must be studied in the future alongside the integrated multi trophic aquaculture ecosystem some new elements have been involved for the development of aquaculture technology these include the integration of aquaculture farming and ocean renewable energy system buck and langan 2017 it seems that a vast array of applications is ready for the evolution of aquaculture engineering and technology declaration

21379,oil spills due to accidental leakage from container ships in a marine environment poses a major challenge to aquatic living organisms and affects human health by increasing the environmental pollution autonomous underwater vehicles auv s are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills as the coastal areas are vast and lengthy effective path planning of deployed auvs is necessary many path planning algorithms for auvs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance the auvs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption in this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal auv paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area the proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa that results in increase in the search space global search ability and the convergence speed with the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of auvs are reduced it is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in auv energy consumption by 57 compared to the existing boustrophedon and woa approach keywords auv optimization oil spill whale optimization algorithm cuckoo search algorithm 1 introduction oil as well as oil products spill into the sea as a result of accidents river runoffs leaking pipelines etc causing danger to human health and marine life in addition to enormous monetary losses oil spills harm not only the sea condition but affect local economies too the spilled oil is difficult to recollect after it is washed aground the presence of excessive residual oil content in the ground soil increases pollution that poses danger to marine and human life to avoid these types of losses it is necessary to detect and remove the oil spills as soon as the spill occurs auvs are deployed for oil spill detection auv is an unmanned underwater self propelled vehicle utilized to deliver modest activities with no human control auvs provide sensor platforms for measuring oceanic water properties auvs can detect the position of the oil spill in the water and optimize the search distance by selecting an optimal path multiple heterogenous sensors are placed inside the auv kato et al 2017 one of the challenges of auvs is the limited battery power more energy is required to explore the coastal waters over a large distance against the harsh environmental conditions prevailing in the sea hence auvs have to provide maximum detection performance with reduced search distance an efficient and optimal path planning algorithm has to be implemented in auvs marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 auv path planning is inspired by the travelling salesman problem tsp kato et al 2017 proposed the auv leak path detection using sotab 1 the sotab 1 has four main components power supply processing unit sensors and acoustic weight drop system the sotab 1 is used to monitor the transportation of oil droplet using 3d transform and it has the capability to measure in situ of dissolved oil substance and oceanographic data marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 used the technique based on bayesian search theory and obtained an optimal solution for leak path detection in a difficult environment jin and ray 2014 proposed a multi resolution approach for the local and global navigation on the basis of sensor data an unknown environment s overall coverage to clean the oil spill is provided in this algorithm it is also used for cleaning oil spills effectively through dynamic adjustment once spill is detected ramos et al 2018 used transoceanic glider auv it is used at 0 1000 m depth in the ocean the dynamical system theory is used by applying a real time navigation approach that increases the auv battery life by increasing the velocity gilabert et al 2015 presented the multivehicle robotic technology the vehicles considered are unmanned aerial vehicles uav autonomous underwater vehicles auv as well as unmanned surface vehicles usv this multivehicle technology is cheap flexible precise and provides rapid decision support system nègre et al 2012 presented the dynamic programming theory for the submarine equipped with a sonar system which wants to detect the target tian et al 2008 presented the layered decision frame to control manifold purposes in a surveillance operation a cooperative real tone path choice process is utilized for uav main purpose of this algorithm is to aid safe navigation of the uav in the hostile environment zhang et al 2011 provided a peak capture process for the auv gulpers they captured peaks in a thin phytoplankton layer accurately the experiment was implemented in the gulf of mexico to detect oil spill emission yilmaz et al 2008 introduced the path planning of auv through adaptive sampling with the help of milp mixed integer linear programming this method can be applied on single as well as multiple auvs and for multiple days pereda et al 2011 used autonomous marine surface vehicle amsvs for the oil spill detection this work aims to contemplate the route undertakings that should be forced for an appropriate towing of an oil spill restriction blast kakalis and ventikos 2008 implemented the robotic swarm notion to detect the oil spill underwater numerous high power robotic elements were contained in this type of system for recovering oil automatically this method was most eco friendly to the environment petres et al 2005 proposed the modified fast marching process with directional constraints the method deals with various vectoral fields mirjalili and lewis 2016 presented the woa that mimics the actions of a whale the whales have special hunting methods on the basis of the hunting nature of whales an algorithm is implemented which provides better results compared to particle swarm optimization differential evolution de improved harmony search hs the basic concepts of whale optimization algorithm include prey encircling bubble net attacking method as well as prey search one of the greatest baleen whales is humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae their preferred prey are krill and little fish groups the most fascinating thing about the humpback whales is their uncommon chasing strategy this is named as bubble net encouraging methodology rajabioun 2011 suggested a novel method for non linear optimization namely the cs algorithm that is basically motivated through the life of a cuckoo bird family cuckoos in contrast to other birds do not make nests for themselves but continuously utilize the nests of other birds to reproduce one egg is laid by each cuckoo at a time in a randomly selected nest finally the number of host nests is fixed and the host bird discovers each egg laid by the cuckoo bird with a specific probability in the standard cs algorithm a cuckoo search different nest via lévy flights this signifies random walks by its step length characterization which obeys a power law distribution hybrid algorithms have been developed to improve or enhance overall search efficiency woa grey wolf optimizer hagwo was introduced by singh and hachimi 2018 to advance the stability convergence and quality of solutions the spiral function of woa covers a border area in an uncertain search space and the hagwo offers enhanced quality of solutions with less number of iterations kaveh and rastegar moghaddam 2018 introduced an algorithm named woa cbo whale optimization algorithm colliding bodies optimization the updating mechanism of woa was modified and improved in the hybrid woa cbo each whale search agent is considered as solution candidate in order to discover the optimum solution the search agent is made to move in n dimensional search space khalilpourazari and khalilpourazary 2018 presented scwoa sine cosine whale optimization algorithm which proved that the proposed hybrid algorithm is able to make a proper trade off between exploration and exploitation scwoa algorithm make use of both advantages of sca and woa but these hybrid techniques suffer from few drawbacks namely slow convergence worse local searching ability and low solving precision thus a new hybrid combination is introduced which detects the oil spills and offers effective path planning in this work we propose an efficient method namely the wcsoa which combines the features of woa and cs for selecting optimal path by minimizing the search distance and search delay the proposed method reduces energy consumption and maximizes detection of oil spills woa is used for maximizing oil spill detection reduction in search distance is achieved using the cuckoo search approach woa is a global optimization technique but has very slow convergence rate stability of fitness value is weak and accuracy is also small yan et al 2018 cuckoo search has global convergence abilities and supports both local and global optimal values in woa the bubble net mechanism is utilized as the best search agent to encircle and chase the prey the lévy flight approach is used in cs as lévy flights have boundless mean and variance cs can investigate the search area more productively than calculations utilizing standard gaussian procedures cuckoo search is made global by its strong lévy flight property which updates the positions of the cuckoo by step size depending upon the difference of the global and local best positions the function of the lévy flight of cs can be utilized in the search area exploration to increase the convergence rate the combination of these two algorithms is observed to provide better performance auv is considered as an economical and safe tool for investigation search identification and rescue operations on sea floor auv path planning for oil spill detection involves smoothing the trajectory shortening of voyage avoiding obstacles etc some of the key issues associated with auv path planning for oil spill detection are limited battery power data transmission capability sensing technology available for underwater operations also more energy is required to explore the coastal waters over a large distance against the harsh environmental conditions prevailing in the sea the major contributions of this work are to introduce an efficient path planning of auvs to detect the oil spills to provide maximum detection performance with reduced search distance to select an optimal path using wcsoa which covers all oil spills to minimize the travel distance delay and to make the auv energy efficient the paper is organized as follows in section 2 1 the woa is described section 2 2 provides details of the cs approach the proposed model is discussed in section 3 section 4 provides the results and discussion the conclusions are given in section 5 2 woa woa is a meta heuristic algorithm mirjalili and lewis 2016 this is a novel technique for solving optimization problems the woa includes 3 operations namely the prey search prey encircling and bubble net foraging behavior of humpback whales whales live in groups as well as develop their own language according to hof and van der gucht 2007 the whales have a special cell present in the brain which is used for emotions judgement etc it has been proved that whales can learn think and also communicate as human does there are seven dissimilar types of whales among them humpback whale is unique due to its special mechanism of hunting this is often termed as bubble net feeding approach whales prefer to hunt krill or small fishes closer to surface therefore humpback whales swim around in a spiral shaped path around the prey along a circle see fig 1 or 9 shaped path to create distinctive bubbles to simulate this behavior in woa the choice of shrinking encircling mechanism or spiral model for updating the position of whales is used with a likelihood of 50 each the movement of whales is classified in two ways one in which whales go down and begin to generate bubble around the prey and move upwards and the other includes the different stages namely lobtail coral loop in addition to capture loop a population initialization a population of the whales is generated sharma et al 2016 by the following equation 1 x i x m i n r a n d 1 0 x m a x x m i n i 1 2 sp where x m i n and x m a x are the bounds of x i rand 1 0 is a random number uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 sp denotes the size of the whales population b prey encircling the basic idea in woa is surrounding the prey the location of prey is well known to humpback whales which enables them to encircle the prey since the best search agent is not known in advance the target prey is considered as the present best outcome by woa also the other agents try to update their position towards the best search agent after the best search agent is chosen the behavior of the whale is represented mirjalili and lewis 2016 by the following equation 2 d c x t x t 3 x t 1 x t d a where t signifies present iteration x represents location vector x denotes location vector of the best solution acquired up to now illustrates absolute value and dot represents element wise multiplication a c are coefficient vectors which are computed using 4 and 5 given below x is updated after each iteration if better solution is attained d represents the search distance 4 a 2 a r a 5 c 2 r where a is diameter of the spiral that is linearly reduced to 0 from 2 and r is the random vector in the range 0 1 2 1 bubble net approach bubble net feeding process has two phases namely exploitation and exploration the two phases are described below 2 1 1 exploitation shrinking encircling mechanism bubble net mechanism is utilized by the humpback whales to attack the prey this mechanism is attained by reducing a value to 0 from 2 and hence there will be some fluctuation in a as shown in fig 2 a due to decreasing value of a a is a random value in the range a a where a is reduced from 2 to 0 as the iteration progresses setting up the random values for a in the range 1 1 search agent s new location can be described anywhere in between the current best search agent and original position fig 2 b shows locations from x y in the direction of x y to update the spiral location the position of prey distance x y from the whale location x y is determined as follows a spiral formed along the location of whale and the prey is represented using following expression mirjalili and lewis 2016 6 x t 1 x t d e b l cos 2 π l where d x t x t indicates ith whale distance from the prey b represents a constant l denotes a random value in the range 1 1 dot signifies element wise multiplication the likelihood of choosing the shrinking process or spiral to update the location is assumed to be around 50 7 x t 1 x t d a i f p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π l x t i f p 0 5 where p is a random number in the range 0 1 2 1 2 exploration phase search for prey in exploration phase search agents examine for the best solution randomly as well as change its position with reference to the position of other whales a value should be superior to one or less than 1 to force the search agent to move away from reference whale 8 d c x r a n d x 9 x t 1 x r a n d d a if a 1 then random search agent gets selected or else best solution is selected position vector x r a n d is chosen from the present whale population 3 cuckoo search algorithm a cuckoo bird family s lifestyle inspires a novel optimization algorithm called cuckoo search cs the exact egg laying and breeding behavior of cuckoo birds are the basis of this mechanism rajabioun 2011 cuckoo birds are attractive in nature not because of their beautiful sound but then due to their aggressive reproduction scheme by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds a number of species engage the obligate brood parasitism the proposed cs algorithm is based on brood nature of some cuckoo species cuckoo search algorithm is enhanced by the so called lévy flights rather than by simple isotropic random walks recent studies prove that cs is potentially far more efficient than pso and genetic algorithms cuckoo search is characterized by its strong lévy flight property lévy flight can maximize the diversification of search agents which guarantees that the algorithm can explore the search place efficiently and accomplish local minima avoidance this implies that the lévy flight trajectory is helpful in obtaining a better trade off between exploration and exploitation based on the simplest approach for cuckoo search where each nest has only a single egg the new solution for a cuckoo i is generated by performing a lévy flight ling et al 2017 10 x i t 1 x i t α s i g n r a n d 1 2 lévy s where s i g n r a n d 1 2 has three values i e 1 0 1 the above expression 10 is the stochastic equation for a random walk and it is used to explore the search area efficiently due to its longer step length x i t represents the current iteration x i t 1 represents the next iteration the product implies entry wise multiplication ling et al 2017 α indicates the step size and it is given by the following equation 11 α a 0 x r a n d t x t where α 0 set to be 0 01 and x r a n d is the position vector of a random whale the lévy flight essentially provides a random walk while the random step length is drawn from a lévy distribution the new solution is written as in yang and deb 2009 12 l e v y s s 1 β 0 β 2 where s is the step length of levy flight the generation of direction is drawn from the uniform distribution generation of steps is quite tricky for which mantegna s algorithm mantegna 1994 could be used 13 s μ v 1 β μ n 0 σ μ 2 v n 0 σ v 2 μ and v follow a normal distribution 14 σ μ γ 1 β sin π β 2 β γ 1 β 2 2 β 1 2 1 β σ v 1 where γ is a standard gamma function cs algorithm is summarized as follows initially each cuckoo will lay one egg at a time and select a nest randomly then the best nest with egg of highest quality can pass onto the new generations finally the number of host nests is fixed and the egg laid by the bird can be discovered by means of the host bird with probability p a 0 1 image 1 4 proposed whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa wcsoa stands for whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm which involves cs over woa to improve the drawbacks of woa such as slow convergence rate weak stability of fitness and less accuracy yan et al 2018 we use cuckoo search algorithm cs cs can avoid local optimum due to its inherent lévy flight property and can be used for augmenting woa the hybrid algorithm provides good stability and fast convergence rate in cs the function of the lévy flight is utilized in the search space s exploration cuckoo search has global convergence abilities and supports both the local and global optima the combination of these two algorithms is observed to provide better performance cuckoo search has dual search capabilities local in addition to global search controlled by means of a switching probability a further significance of cuckoo search is that its global search utilizes lévy flights or process rather than standard random walks as lévy flights have infinite mean as well as variance cs can explore the search space more efficiently than algorithms utilizing standard gaussian processes this significance combined with both local as well as search capabilities and guaranteed global convergence makes cuckoo search very efficient the proposed wcsoa approach uses cuckoo search as an augmentation to the whale optimization algorithm to select the best path for the auv to detect the oil spills a model of oil spill in a particular area is designed with the following considerations 1 the center points of each spill are randomly generated using gaussian distribution and an elliptical spill area is considered 2 all trajectories are calculated at a constant depth and possible patterns are restricted to classical boustrophedon 3 auvs are designed to move at constant speed along each horizontal track line since the wcsoa approach combines woa over cs with the lévy flight property the position updation is represented by modification of 9 as follows 15 x t 1 x r a n d t s i g n r a n d 1 2 α 0 μ v 1 β x r a n d t x t where x t 1 obtained from 9 13 optimization performance in terms of convergence is tested using ackley function which is a concave function the definition for this function on a 2 d domain jamil and yang 2013 is given below 16 f x y 20 exp 0 2 0 5 x 2 y 2 exp cos 2 π x cos 2 π y e 20 where f x y is the ackley function x and y represent dimensional variables proposed solution is tested in two dimensions f x 0 y 0 0 the global minima of this function lie at 0 0 the wcsoa surface plot is observed to converge at zero as shown in fig 3 tracing of global minima for woa and wcsoa optimization functions are shown in fig 4 it illustrates that both woa and wcsoa converge to basins of attraction near to global minima giving acceptable solutions the convergence rate of woa is lesser than wcsoa let i 1 n represent the potential leak source each leak source i has a probability of spill π i in spill area a i for the maximization of auv leak detection the device must be available for maximum time in each spill area we limit conceivable track lines to m well picked lines thus boustrophedon design comprises a choice of track lines in a set represented by j 1 m v j represents the auv speed on the tracklines and δ j is an integer variable that represents the number of times the auv travelled on the track line j δ j takes values between 0 and z z being the maximal number of times the auv can travel on a solitary track line marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 in the classical boustrophedon technique the lines are very close to each other horizontally and are present over the entire search area the search along the y direction is implicit the boustrophedon lines selected will touch all the oil spills in the search area and auv will travel only along the selected boustrophedon lines though the search area is two dimensional considering vertical boustrophedon lines does not have much impact on spill detection hence vertical boustrophedon lines are not considered in the proposed approach the objective function for minimizing the travel distance is given by 17 d i s t i 1 n j 1 n d i s t i j where i and j are boustrophedon lines touching each spill area as represented in fig 6 the wcsoa optimization algorithm provides the index of lines to be selected as the optimum paths and total distance of those lines is the distance of the path travelled by auv the input index matrix to the objective function of wcsoa is 18 i n d e x 0 1 1 1 0 n where n is the number of boustrophedon lines lines with index 1 are selected for total distance calculation if there are 25 oil spills then number of boustrophedon lines will be 50 so 19 n 2 n o i l where n number of boustrophedon lines n o i l number of oil spills in calculation of objective function care must be taken that selected track lines must cover all oil spills in the area a connection matrix between selected path from woa and covered spill area is formulated as 20 l i n k 1 p i n d e x t r a c k l i n e p i 0 o t h e r w i s e where link connection matrix of n o i l n p index path index form wcsoa of size 1 n t r a c k l i n e line covering the oil spill p l set of all track lines the connection matrix helps to check if all oil spills are covered by p i n d e x all lines will be covered if each row of connection matrix has at least one none zero element in the connection matrix the optimization is carried out in three phases namely initialization exploration and exploitation phase 1 initialization the wcsoa is initially set to contain the number of populations whales number of maximum iterations and the control parameters each processing operation sequence is generated 5 and its corresponding whale individuals are also generated using 1 to find the probability of oil spill each whale individual should be mapped into a solution vector in this phase no of leaks probability of oil spills are provided as input parameters phase 2 exploration in this phase the position of each whale is updated using 15 the value of each corresponding position of the current whale individual and random whale is mathematically calculated to form a new position vector of the current whale individual which is a continuous vector the search space to the random whale s arbitrary position component is expanded by levy s flight which makes the hunting range of whales wider and increases the global search performance of the algorithm phase 3 exploitation in this phase there are two ways to exploit the algorithm one is shrinking encircling and the other is spiral updating position the similarity between them is that the best whale individual the target prey is used as the base to calculate the corresponding position components of the current whale individual as per 3 and 6 so that the current whale individual can optimize its position in the neighbourhood of the best whale individual and jumps out of the local optimum the position vector of the current whale individual is updated in different ways to enhance the local optimization ability of the algorithm and a new whale individual is generated image 2 4 1 energy calculation auvs are battery powered hence have limited energy selection of the optimal path of travel makes it energy efficient we show that the proposed path planning method based on wcsoa reduces the travel distance and hence makes the auv energy efficient a linear model is developed for energy calculation and it is based on 2 degrees of freedom abscissa and ordinate movement of the vehicle in the proposed work auv follows the boustrophedon pattern so only two location dependent degrees of freedom are required we assume that auv moves at a constant depth over a long travel path we neglect the ups and downs in the water surface in a path between two waypoints w a w b the displacement is calculated by the position change in x and y co ordinates of auv a complete travel path is the sum of these displacements de carolis et al 2014 21 d i 1 n δ x i δ y i d is displacement vector δ x i and δ y i represents the change of co ordinates the energy spent by auv in travel is 22 δ e k 1 δ x i k 2 δ y i δ e represents the required energy k 1 and k 2 are energy coefficients in j m and are estimated by curve fitting method or bayesian learning using some prior collected data of auv path and travel fashion the linear model de carolis et al 2014 is used for estimating the required energy for navigation the total energy during the whole travel is given by 23 t e i 1 n δ e ω i 1 ω i where ω i 1 and ω i are waypoints along the auv path 4 2 optimal path selection the proposed method is based on selecting the optimal path which consumes least energy and minimum travel distance the woa optimization algorithm selects the path for the auv and for each selected path we calculate the total distance and hence the energy consumed total energy consumption e cons total is determined based on the objective function in 24 24 o b j f w 1 i 1 n j 1 n d i s t i j w 2 i 1 n δ e ω i 1 ω i where w 1 and w 2 are weights assigned to both we use w 1 0 4 and w 2 0 6 de carolis et al 2014 we further test the proposed optimization on several benchmark functions in three categories as shown in the appendix the results of 20 trials have been tabulated in a 1 four parameters namely mean standard deviation minimum and maximum values obtained for each of the benchmark function using wcsoa are compared with that of woa a comparison based on cec2019 benchmark functions is presented in a 2 the significance of the results obtained has been proved in a 3 using the wilcoxon rank sum test from the results obtained it is observed that wcsoa algorithm provides better performance across the benchmark functions 5 results and discussion the proposed auv path planning approach is simulated using matlab platform with various search areas 9 25 64 and 100 sq meters three different types of elliptical spills with varying x and y lengths are considered which is represented in fig 5 using yellow green and red colors these spills are assumed to occur randomly within the search area with varying apriori probabilities of detection each spill is considered to be elliptical with different axial length this makes the simulation environment closer to real oil spill scenario due to non uniformity in the spills fig 5 shows the created environment for a 25 sq m search area with each oil spill generated randomly in the spill area using gaussian random distribution with m e a n μ 0 and s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n σ 1 yellow color spills are with less apriori probability of occurrence p b 0 05 green colored with p b 0 15 and rest have p b of 0 8 a total of 50 spills are generated in the search region all boustrophedon lines are plotted considering the major axis along which the spill coincides with the auv path as shown in fig 6 the spill color differentiation is not shown in figs 6 8 below to highlight the intersection of the boustrophedon lines with the spills only single color is used to represent the spills fig 6 represents the paths covering the spill areas using boustrophedon technique fig 7 signifies the paths covering spill areas using woa wcsoa approach covers all the oil spills with lesser number of paths as shown in fig 8 from the plot it is proved that more number of paths are required with woa which covers minimum oil spills as shown in fig 7 whereas fig 8 shows that only minimum number of paths are selected which further covers all oil spills the convergence curve for the minimization function in 20 is plotted in fig 9 for both woa and wcsoa it is observed that wcsoa convergence rate is higher due to global minima obtained by the lévy flight property of cuckoo search algorithm out of 100 paths woa selected 68 while wcsoa selected only 59 paths covering all oil spills in the area a pie chart for comparison of total paths selected and corresponding distance covered is shown in fig 10 since the auv travels along all the selected horizontal paths in the search area the total distance travelled is indicated in kilometers even when the length and breadth of the search area are in meters path selection index is an indication of the presence or absence of the horizontal boustrophedon lines the path selection index for woa and wcsoa considering up to 50 spills and 100 boustrophedon lines is indicated in fig 11 below the gap between the lines implies the absence of path it can be observed from fig 11 a and b that the number of lines in boustrophedon is 100 and reduced to 68 in woa and 59 in wcsoa the performance parameters namely the search distance search time and auv energy consumption are compared for boustrophedon woa and wcsoa as shown in figs 12 14 respectively it is observed that the proposed wcsoa technique gives less time low energy consumption in addition to minimum search distance the numerical values are given in table 1 the search distance covered in each algorithm for various search areas is represented in fig 12 it is observed that the proposed wcsoa approach covers the least distance for a given search area it is observed from fig 12 that with wcsoa the search distance is reduced compared to boustrophedon and woa approaches on average respectively for the given search areas it is also observed that for the auv speed of 3 knots 5 56 km h considered the search time reduces with wcsoa compared to boustrophedon and woa on average for the given search areas as depicted in fig 13 to determine the energy consumption of the auv while traversing the optimized paths according to the proposed method the auv is assumed to have an initial energy capacity of 1800 wh the energy consumed by the auv as per 19 is reduced when wcsoa is implemented the reduction is by a factor of 1 64 compared to boustrophedon and a factor of 1 783 compared to woa approaches for a search area of 25 25 sq m it is also observed from table 1 that the auv cannot provide the search over the entire area in the case of 100 100 sq m using boustrophedon and woa approaches due to the increased energy consumption that is higher than its initial energy of 1800 wh whereas with the proposed wcsoa approach the entire search area can be covered we compare the proposed wcsoa approach with other hybrid woa algorithms namely the hybrid whale optimizer algorithm with grey wolf optimizer hagwo whale optimization algorithm with colliding bodies optimization woa cbo and hybrid sine cosine whale optimization algorithm scwoa in terms of convergence time fig 15 represents the convergence curves of various hybridized woa algorithms it is observed from the curves that wcsoa achieves better convergence when compared to other hybrid woa techniques 6 conclusion we have proposed an efficient path planning methodology for autonomous underwater vehicles with limited battery power used in oil spill detection over large areas in coastal regions the proposed method which uses cuckoo search over the whale optimization algorithm is used to optimally select the path to cover all leakage spills in the given area application of the proposed approach to benchmark functions proves to provide good performance a comparison of the results of the proposed approach with the boustrophedon and woa approaches shows reduction in search distance delay and energy consumption of the auv deployed as multiple whales are generated for the search and optimization is implemented using cuckoo search the approach is faster and provides the auv with better energy utilization that improves the performance further work in this area would be to consider varying number of oil spills in varying search areas and train the auvs to automatically change search directions depending on the wind direction and velocity using machine learning approaches and optimal path planning techniques such as wcsoa

21379,oil spills due to accidental leakage from container ships in a marine environment poses a major challenge to aquatic living organisms and affects human health by increasing the environmental pollution autonomous underwater vehicles auv s are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills as the coastal areas are vast and lengthy effective path planning of deployed auvs is necessary many path planning algorithms for auvs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance the auvs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption in this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal auv paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area the proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa that results in increase in the search space global search ability and the convergence speed with the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of auvs are reduced it is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in auv energy consumption by 57 compared to the existing boustrophedon and woa approach keywords auv optimization oil spill whale optimization algorithm cuckoo search algorithm 1 introduction oil as well as oil products spill into the sea as a result of accidents river runoffs leaking pipelines etc causing danger to human health and marine life in addition to enormous monetary losses oil spills harm not only the sea condition but affect local economies too the spilled oil is difficult to recollect after it is washed aground the presence of excessive residual oil content in the ground soil increases pollution that poses danger to marine and human life to avoid these types of losses it is necessary to detect and remove the oil spills as soon as the spill occurs auvs are deployed for oil spill detection auv is an unmanned underwater self propelled vehicle utilized to deliver modest activities with no human control auvs provide sensor platforms for measuring oceanic water properties auvs can detect the position of the oil spill in the water and optimize the search distance by selecting an optimal path multiple heterogenous sensors are placed inside the auv kato et al 2017 one of the challenges of auvs is the limited battery power more energy is required to explore the coastal waters over a large distance against the harsh environmental conditions prevailing in the sea hence auvs have to provide maximum detection performance with reduced search distance an efficient and optimal path planning algorithm has to be implemented in auvs marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 auv path planning is inspired by the travelling salesman problem tsp kato et al 2017 proposed the auv leak path detection using sotab 1 the sotab 1 has four main components power supply processing unit sensors and acoustic weight drop system the sotab 1 is used to monitor the transportation of oil droplet using 3d transform and it has the capability to measure in situ of dissolved oil substance and oceanographic data marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 used the technique based on bayesian search theory and obtained an optimal solution for leak path detection in a difficult environment jin and ray 2014 proposed a multi resolution approach for the local and global navigation on the basis of sensor data an unknown environment s overall coverage to clean the oil spill is provided in this algorithm it is also used for cleaning oil spills effectively through dynamic adjustment once spill is detected ramos et al 2018 used transoceanic glider auv it is used at 0 1000 m depth in the ocean the dynamical system theory is used by applying a real time navigation approach that increases the auv battery life by increasing the velocity gilabert et al 2015 presented the multivehicle robotic technology the vehicles considered are unmanned aerial vehicles uav autonomous underwater vehicles auv as well as unmanned surface vehicles usv this multivehicle technology is cheap flexible precise and provides rapid decision support system nègre et al 2012 presented the dynamic programming theory for the submarine equipped with a sonar system which wants to detect the target tian et al 2008 presented the layered decision frame to control manifold purposes in a surveillance operation a cooperative real tone path choice process is utilized for uav main purpose of this algorithm is to aid safe navigation of the uav in the hostile environment zhang et al 2011 provided a peak capture process for the auv gulpers they captured peaks in a thin phytoplankton layer accurately the experiment was implemented in the gulf of mexico to detect oil spill emission yilmaz et al 2008 introduced the path planning of auv through adaptive sampling with the help of milp mixed integer linear programming this method can be applied on single as well as multiple auvs and for multiple days pereda et al 2011 used autonomous marine surface vehicle amsvs for the oil spill detection this work aims to contemplate the route undertakings that should be forced for an appropriate towing of an oil spill restriction blast kakalis and ventikos 2008 implemented the robotic swarm notion to detect the oil spill underwater numerous high power robotic elements were contained in this type of system for recovering oil automatically this method was most eco friendly to the environment petres et al 2005 proposed the modified fast marching process with directional constraints the method deals with various vectoral fields mirjalili and lewis 2016 presented the woa that mimics the actions of a whale the whales have special hunting methods on the basis of the hunting nature of whales an algorithm is implemented which provides better results compared to particle swarm optimization differential evolution de improved harmony search hs the basic concepts of whale optimization algorithm include prey encircling bubble net attacking method as well as prey search one of the greatest baleen whales is humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae their preferred prey are krill and little fish groups the most fascinating thing about the humpback whales is their uncommon chasing strategy this is named as bubble net encouraging methodology rajabioun 2011 suggested a novel method for non linear optimization namely the cs algorithm that is basically motivated through the life of a cuckoo bird family cuckoos in contrast to other birds do not make nests for themselves but continuously utilize the nests of other birds to reproduce one egg is laid by each cuckoo at a time in a randomly selected nest finally the number of host nests is fixed and the host bird discovers each egg laid by the cuckoo bird with a specific probability in the standard cs algorithm a cuckoo search different nest via lévy flights this signifies random walks by its step length characterization which obeys a power law distribution hybrid algorithms have been developed to improve or enhance overall search efficiency woa grey wolf optimizer hagwo was introduced by singh and hachimi 2018 to advance the stability convergence and quality of solutions the spiral function of woa covers a border area in an uncertain search space and the hagwo offers enhanced quality of solutions with less number of iterations kaveh and rastegar moghaddam 2018 introduced an algorithm named woa cbo whale optimization algorithm colliding bodies optimization the updating mechanism of woa was modified and improved in the hybrid woa cbo each whale search agent is considered as solution candidate in order to discover the optimum solution the search agent is made to move in n dimensional search space khalilpourazari and khalilpourazary 2018 presented scwoa sine cosine whale optimization algorithm which proved that the proposed hybrid algorithm is able to make a proper trade off between exploration and exploitation scwoa algorithm make use of both advantages of sca and woa but these hybrid techniques suffer from few drawbacks namely slow convergence worse local searching ability and low solving precision thus a new hybrid combination is introduced which detects the oil spills and offers effective path planning in this work we propose an efficient method namely the wcsoa which combines the features of woa and cs for selecting optimal path by minimizing the search distance and search delay the proposed method reduces energy consumption and maximizes detection of oil spills woa is used for maximizing oil spill detection reduction in search distance is achieved using the cuckoo search approach woa is a global optimization technique but has very slow convergence rate stability of fitness value is weak and accuracy is also small yan et al 2018 cuckoo search has global convergence abilities and supports both local and global optimal values in woa the bubble net mechanism is utilized as the best search agent to encircle and chase the prey the lévy flight approach is used in cs as lévy flights have boundless mean and variance cs can investigate the search area more productively than calculations utilizing standard gaussian procedures cuckoo search is made global by its strong lévy flight property which updates the positions of the cuckoo by step size depending upon the difference of the global and local best positions the function of the lévy flight of cs can be utilized in the search area exploration to increase the convergence rate the combination of these two algorithms is observed to provide better performance auv is considered as an economical and safe tool for investigation search identification and rescue operations on sea floor auv path planning for oil spill detection involves smoothing the trajectory shortening of voyage avoiding obstacles etc some of the key issues associated with auv path planning for oil spill detection are limited battery power data transmission capability sensing technology available for underwater operations also more energy is required to explore the coastal waters over a large distance against the harsh environmental conditions prevailing in the sea the major contributions of this work are to introduce an efficient path planning of auvs to detect the oil spills to provide maximum detection performance with reduced search distance to select an optimal path using wcsoa which covers all oil spills to minimize the travel distance delay and to make the auv energy efficient the paper is organized as follows in section 2 1 the woa is described section 2 2 provides details of the cs approach the proposed model is discussed in section 3 section 4 provides the results and discussion the conclusions are given in section 5 2 woa woa is a meta heuristic algorithm mirjalili and lewis 2016 this is a novel technique for solving optimization problems the woa includes 3 operations namely the prey search prey encircling and bubble net foraging behavior of humpback whales whales live in groups as well as develop their own language according to hof and van der gucht 2007 the whales have a special cell present in the brain which is used for emotions judgement etc it has been proved that whales can learn think and also communicate as human does there are seven dissimilar types of whales among them humpback whale is unique due to its special mechanism of hunting this is often termed as bubble net feeding approach whales prefer to hunt krill or small fishes closer to surface therefore humpback whales swim around in a spiral shaped path around the prey along a circle see fig 1 or 9 shaped path to create distinctive bubbles to simulate this behavior in woa the choice of shrinking encircling mechanism or spiral model for updating the position of whales is used with a likelihood of 50 each the movement of whales is classified in two ways one in which whales go down and begin to generate bubble around the prey and move upwards and the other includes the different stages namely lobtail coral loop in addition to capture loop a population initialization a population of the whales is generated sharma et al 2016 by the following equation 1 x i x m i n r a n d 1 0 x m a x x m i n i 1 2 sp where x m i n and x m a x are the bounds of x i rand 1 0 is a random number uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 sp denotes the size of the whales population b prey encircling the basic idea in woa is surrounding the prey the location of prey is well known to humpback whales which enables them to encircle the prey since the best search agent is not known in advance the target prey is considered as the present best outcome by woa also the other agents try to update their position towards the best search agent after the best search agent is chosen the behavior of the whale is represented mirjalili and lewis 2016 by the following equation 2 d c x t x t 3 x t 1 x t d a where t signifies present iteration x represents location vector x denotes location vector of the best solution acquired up to now illustrates absolute value and dot represents element wise multiplication a c are coefficient vectors which are computed using 4 and 5 given below x is updated after each iteration if better solution is attained d represents the search distance 4 a 2 a r a 5 c 2 r where a is diameter of the spiral that is linearly reduced to 0 from 2 and r is the random vector in the range 0 1 2 1 bubble net approach bubble net feeding process has two phases namely exploitation and exploration the two phases are described below 2 1 1 exploitation shrinking encircling mechanism bubble net mechanism is utilized by the humpback whales to attack the prey this mechanism is attained by reducing a value to 0 from 2 and hence there will be some fluctuation in a as shown in fig 2 a due to decreasing value of a a is a random value in the range a a where a is reduced from 2 to 0 as the iteration progresses setting up the random values for a in the range 1 1 search agent s new location can be described anywhere in between the current best search agent and original position fig 2 b shows locations from x y in the direction of x y to update the spiral location the position of prey distance x y from the whale location x y is determined as follows a spiral formed along the location of whale and the prey is represented using following expression mirjalili and lewis 2016 6 x t 1 x t d e b l cos 2 π l where d x t x t indicates ith whale distance from the prey b represents a constant l denotes a random value in the range 1 1 dot signifies element wise multiplication the likelihood of choosing the shrinking process or spiral to update the location is assumed to be around 50 7 x t 1 x t d a i f p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π l x t i f p 0 5 where p is a random number in the range 0 1 2 1 2 exploration phase search for prey in exploration phase search agents examine for the best solution randomly as well as change its position with reference to the position of other whales a value should be superior to one or less than 1 to force the search agent to move away from reference whale 8 d c x r a n d x 9 x t 1 x r a n d d a if a 1 then random search agent gets selected or else best solution is selected position vector x r a n d is chosen from the present whale population 3 cuckoo search algorithm a cuckoo bird family s lifestyle inspires a novel optimization algorithm called cuckoo search cs the exact egg laying and breeding behavior of cuckoo birds are the basis of this mechanism rajabioun 2011 cuckoo birds are attractive in nature not because of their beautiful sound but then due to their aggressive reproduction scheme by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds a number of species engage the obligate brood parasitism the proposed cs algorithm is based on brood nature of some cuckoo species cuckoo search algorithm is enhanced by the so called lévy flights rather than by simple isotropic random walks recent studies prove that cs is potentially far more efficient than pso and genetic algorithms cuckoo search is characterized by its strong lévy flight property lévy flight can maximize the diversification of search agents which guarantees that the algorithm can explore the search place efficiently and accomplish local minima avoidance this implies that the lévy flight trajectory is helpful in obtaining a better trade off between exploration and exploitation based on the simplest approach for cuckoo search where each nest has only a single egg the new solution for a cuckoo i is generated by performing a lévy flight ling et al 2017 10 x i t 1 x i t α s i g n r a n d 1 2 lévy s where s i g n r a n d 1 2 has three values i e 1 0 1 the above expression 10 is the stochastic equation for a random walk and it is used to explore the search area efficiently due to its longer step length x i t represents the current iteration x i t 1 represents the next iteration the product implies entry wise multiplication ling et al 2017 α indicates the step size and it is given by the following equation 11 α a 0 x r a n d t x t where α 0 set to be 0 01 and x r a n d is the position vector of a random whale the lévy flight essentially provides a random walk while the random step length is drawn from a lévy distribution the new solution is written as in yang and deb 2009 12 l e v y s s 1 β 0 β 2 where s is the step length of levy flight the generation of direction is drawn from the uniform distribution generation of steps is quite tricky for which mantegna s algorithm mantegna 1994 could be used 13 s μ v 1 β μ n 0 σ μ 2 v n 0 σ v 2 μ and v follow a normal distribution 14 σ μ γ 1 β sin π β 2 β γ 1 β 2 2 β 1 2 1 β σ v 1 where γ is a standard gamma function cs algorithm is summarized as follows initially each cuckoo will lay one egg at a time and select a nest randomly then the best nest with egg of highest quality can pass onto the new generations finally the number of host nests is fixed and the egg laid by the bird can be discovered by means of the host bird with probability p a 0 1 image 1 4 proposed whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa wcsoa stands for whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm which involves cs over woa to improve the drawbacks of woa such as slow convergence rate weak stability of fitness and less accuracy yan et al 2018 we use cuckoo search algorithm cs cs can avoid local optimum due to its inherent lévy flight property and can be used for augmenting woa the hybrid algorithm provides good stability and fast convergence rate in cs the function of the lévy flight is utilized in the search space s exploration cuckoo search has global convergence abilities and supports both the local and global optima the combination of these two algorithms is observed to provide better performance cuckoo search has dual search capabilities local in addition to global search controlled by means of a switching probability a further significance of cuckoo search is that its global search utilizes lévy flights or process rather than standard random walks as lévy flights have infinite mean as well as variance cs can explore the search space more efficiently than algorithms utilizing standard gaussian processes this significance combined with both local as well as search capabilities and guaranteed global convergence makes cuckoo search very efficient the proposed wcsoa approach uses cuckoo search as an augmentation to the whale optimization algorithm to select the best path for the auv to detect the oil spills a model of oil spill in a particular area is designed with the following considerations 1 the center points of each spill are randomly generated using gaussian distribution and an elliptical spill area is considered 2 all trajectories are calculated at a constant depth and possible patterns are restricted to classical boustrophedon 3 auvs are designed to move at constant speed along each horizontal track line since the wcsoa approach combines woa over cs with the lévy flight property the position updation is represented by modification of 9 as follows 15 x t 1 x r a n d t s i g n r a n d 1 2 α 0 μ v 1 β x r a n d t x t where x t 1 obtained from 9 13 optimization performance in terms of convergence is tested using ackley function which is a concave function the definition for this function on a 2 d domain jamil and yang 2013 is given below 16 f x y 20 exp 0 2 0 5 x 2 y 2 exp cos 2 π x cos 2 π y e 20 where f x y is the ackley function x and y represent dimensional variables proposed solution is tested in two dimensions f x 0 y 0 0 the global minima of this function lie at 0 0 the wcsoa surface plot is observed to converge at zero as shown in fig 3 tracing of global minima for woa and wcsoa optimization functions are shown in fig 4 it illustrates that both woa and wcsoa converge to basins of attraction near to global minima giving acceptable solutions the convergence rate of woa is lesser than wcsoa let i 1 n represent the potential leak source each leak source i has a probability of spill π i in spill area a i for the maximization of auv leak detection the device must be available for maximum time in each spill area we limit conceivable track lines to m well picked lines thus boustrophedon design comprises a choice of track lines in a set represented by j 1 m v j represents the auv speed on the tracklines and δ j is an integer variable that represents the number of times the auv travelled on the track line j δ j takes values between 0 and z z being the maximal number of times the auv can travel on a solitary track line marceau and vanpeperstraete 2017 in the classical boustrophedon technique the lines are very close to each other horizontally and are present over the entire search area the search along the y direction is implicit the boustrophedon lines selected will touch all the oil spills in the search area and auv will travel only along the selected boustrophedon lines though the search area is two dimensional considering vertical boustrophedon lines does not have much impact on spill detection hence vertical boustrophedon lines are not considered in the proposed approach the objective function for minimizing the travel distance is given by 17 d i s t i 1 n j 1 n d i s t i j where i and j are boustrophedon lines touching each spill area as represented in fig 6 the wcsoa optimization algorithm provides the index of lines to be selected as the optimum paths and total distance of those lines is the distance of the path travelled by auv the input index matrix to the objective function of wcsoa is 18 i n d e x 0 1 1 1 0 n where n is the number of boustrophedon lines lines with index 1 are selected for total distance calculation if there are 25 oil spills then number of boustrophedon lines will be 50 so 19 n 2 n o i l where n number of boustrophedon lines n o i l number of oil spills in calculation of objective function care must be taken that selected track lines must cover all oil spills in the area a connection matrix between selected path from woa and covered spill area is formulated as 20 l i n k 1 p i n d e x t r a c k l i n e p i 0 o t h e r w i s e where link connection matrix of n o i l n p index path index form wcsoa of size 1 n t r a c k l i n e line covering the oil spill p l set of all track lines the connection matrix helps to check if all oil spills are covered by p i n d e x all lines will be covered if each row of connection matrix has at least one none zero element in the connection matrix the optimization is carried out in three phases namely initialization exploration and exploitation phase 1 initialization the wcsoa is initially set to contain the number of populations whales number of maximum iterations and the control parameters each processing operation sequence is generated 5 and its corresponding whale individuals are also generated using 1 to find the probability of oil spill each whale individual should be mapped into a solution vector in this phase no of leaks probability of oil spills are provided as input parameters phase 2 exploration in this phase the position of each whale is updated using 15 the value of each corresponding position of the current whale individual and random whale is mathematically calculated to form a new position vector of the current whale individual which is a continuous vector the search space to the random whale s arbitrary position component is expanded by levy s flight which makes the hunting range of whales wider and increases the global search performance of the algorithm phase 3 exploitation in this phase there are two ways to exploit the algorithm one is shrinking encircling and the other is spiral updating position the similarity between them is that the best whale individual the target prey is used as the base to calculate the corresponding position components of the current whale individual as per 3 and 6 so that the current whale individual can optimize its position in the neighbourhood of the best whale individual and jumps out of the local optimum the position vector of the current whale individual is updated in different ways to enhance the local optimization ability of the algorithm and a new whale individual is generated image 2 4 1 energy calculation auvs are battery powered hence have limited energy selection of the optimal path of travel makes it energy efficient we show that the proposed path planning method based on wcsoa reduces the travel distance and hence makes the auv energy efficient a linear model is developed for energy calculation and it is based on 2 degrees of freedom abscissa and ordinate movement of the vehicle in the proposed work auv follows the boustrophedon pattern so only two location dependent degrees of freedom are required we assume that auv moves at a constant depth over a long travel path we neglect the ups and downs in the water surface in a path between two waypoints w a w b the displacement is calculated by the position change in x and y co ordinates of auv a complete travel path is the sum of these displacements de carolis et al 2014 21 d i 1 n δ x i δ y i d is displacement vector δ x i and δ y i represents the change of co ordinates the energy spent by auv in travel is 22 δ e k 1 δ x i k 2 δ y i δ e represents the required energy k 1 and k 2 are energy coefficients in j m and are estimated by curve fitting method or bayesian learning using some prior collected data of auv path and travel fashion the linear model de carolis et al 2014 is used for estimating the required energy for navigation the total energy during the whole travel is given by 23 t e i 1 n δ e ω i 1 ω i where ω i 1 and ω i are waypoints along the auv path 4 2 optimal path selection the proposed method is based on selecting the optimal path which consumes least energy and minimum travel distance the woa optimization algorithm selects the path for the auv and for each selected path we calculate the total distance and hence the energy consumed total energy consumption e cons total is determined based on the objective function in 24 24 o b j f w 1 i 1 n j 1 n d i s t i j w 2 i 1 n δ e ω i 1 ω i where w 1 and w 2 are weights assigned to both we use w 1 0 4 and w 2 0 6 de carolis et al 2014 we further test the proposed optimization on several benchmark functions in three categories as shown in the appendix the results of 20 trials have been tabulated in a 1 four parameters namely mean standard deviation minimum and maximum values obtained for each of the benchmark function using wcsoa are compared with that of woa a comparison based on cec2019 benchmark functions is presented in a 2 the significance of the results obtained has been proved in a 3 using the wilcoxon rank sum test from the results obtained it is observed that wcsoa algorithm provides better performance across the benchmark functions 5 results and discussion the proposed auv path planning approach is simulated using matlab platform with various search areas 9 25 64 and 100 sq meters three different types of elliptical spills with varying x and y lengths are considered which is represented in fig 5 using yellow green and red colors these spills are assumed to occur randomly within the search area with varying apriori probabilities of detection each spill is considered to be elliptical with different axial length this makes the simulation environment closer to real oil spill scenario due to non uniformity in the spills fig 5 shows the created environment for a 25 sq m search area with each oil spill generated randomly in the spill area using gaussian random distribution with m e a n μ 0 and s t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n σ 1 yellow color spills are with less apriori probability of occurrence p b 0 05 green colored with p b 0 15 and rest have p b of 0 8 a total of 50 spills are generated in the search region all boustrophedon lines are plotted considering the major axis along which the spill coincides with the auv path as shown in fig 6 the spill color differentiation is not shown in figs 6 8 below to highlight the intersection of the boustrophedon lines with the spills only single color is used to represent the spills fig 6 represents the paths covering the spill areas using boustrophedon technique fig 7 signifies the paths covering spill areas using woa wcsoa approach covers all the oil spills with lesser number of paths as shown in fig 8 from the plot it is proved that more number of paths are required with woa which covers minimum oil spills as shown in fig 7 whereas fig 8 shows that only minimum number of paths are selected which further covers all oil spills the convergence curve for the minimization function in 20 is plotted in fig 9 for both woa and wcsoa it is observed that wcsoa convergence rate is higher due to global minima obtained by the lévy flight property of cuckoo search algorithm out of 100 paths woa selected 68 while wcsoa selected only 59 paths covering all oil spills in the area a pie chart for comparison of total paths selected and corresponding distance covered is shown in fig 10 since the auv travels along all the selected horizontal paths in the search area the total distance travelled is indicated in kilometers even when the length and breadth of the search area are in meters path selection index is an indication of the presence or absence of the horizontal boustrophedon lines the path selection index for woa and wcsoa considering up to 50 spills and 100 boustrophedon lines is indicated in fig 11 below the gap between the lines implies the absence of path it can be observed from fig 11 a and b that the number of lines in boustrophedon is 100 and reduced to 68 in woa and 59 in wcsoa the performance parameters namely the search distance search time and auv energy consumption are compared for boustrophedon woa and wcsoa as shown in figs 12 14 respectively it is observed that the proposed wcsoa technique gives less time low energy consumption in addition to minimum search distance the numerical values are given in table 1 the search distance covered in each algorithm for various search areas is represented in fig 12 it is observed that the proposed wcsoa approach covers the least distance for a given search area it is observed from fig 12 that with wcsoa the search distance is reduced compared to boustrophedon and woa approaches on average respectively for the given search areas it is also observed that for the auv speed of 3 knots 5 56 km h considered the search time reduces with wcsoa compared to boustrophedon and woa on average for the given search areas as depicted in fig 13 to determine the energy consumption of the auv while traversing the optimized paths according to the proposed method the auv is assumed to have an initial energy capacity of 1800 wh the energy consumed by the auv as per 19 is reduced when wcsoa is implemented the reduction is by a factor of 1 64 compared to boustrophedon and a factor of 1 783 compared to woa approaches for a search area of 25 25 sq m it is also observed from table 1 that the auv cannot provide the search over the entire area in the case of 100 100 sq m using boustrophedon and woa approaches due to the increased energy consumption that is higher than its initial energy of 1800 wh whereas with the proposed wcsoa approach the entire search area can be covered we compare the proposed wcsoa approach with other hybrid woa algorithms namely the hybrid whale optimizer algorithm with grey wolf optimizer hagwo whale optimization algorithm with colliding bodies optimization woa cbo and hybrid sine cosine whale optimization algorithm scwoa in terms of convergence time fig 15 represents the convergence curves of various hybridized woa algorithms it is observed from the curves that wcsoa achieves better convergence when compared to other hybrid woa techniques 6 conclusion we have proposed an efficient path planning methodology for autonomous underwater vehicles with limited battery power used in oil spill detection over large areas in coastal regions the proposed method which uses cuckoo search over the whale optimization algorithm is used to optimally select the path to cover all leakage spills in the given area application of the proposed approach to benchmark functions proves to provide good performance a comparison of the results of the proposed approach with the boustrophedon and woa approaches shows reduction in search distance delay and energy consumption of the auv deployed as multiple whales are generated for the search and optimization is implemented using cuckoo search the approach is faster and provides the auv with better energy utilization that improves the performance further work in this area would be to consider varying number of oil spills in varying search areas and train the auvs to automatically change search directions depending on the wind direction and velocity using machine learning approaches and optimal path planning techniques such as wcsoa

3 wilcoxon rank sum test wilcoxon rank sum test is used to determine whether two independent samples were selected from populations having same distribution if two independent samples are given then the test statistic z for the wilcoxon rank sum test is given as z r μ r σ r μ r n 1 n 1 n 2 1 2 σ r n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 12 where r represents the sum of the ranks for the smaller sample n 1 is smaller sample size and n 2 is size of larger sample the step by step explanation of wilcoxon rank sum test is as follows step 1 state the hypothesis and identify the claim h0 the values are significant claim ha the values are non significant step 2 to find the critical value p value since the test is a two tailed test with α 0 05 then the critical values are z 0 2 and z 0 2 the rejection regions are z 2 and z 2 step 3 compute the test values in order to find the values of r μ r a n d σ r the values of distance and energy consumed by wcsoa are combined and arranged in ascending order also
