15240,activation of peracetic acid paa to generate powerful oxidizing species has become a promising advanced oxidation processes aops in wastewater treatment yet the development of low cost and high performance activators is still a primary challenge herein a range of co mn spinel oxides co3 xmnxo4 with varying levels of co and mn were successfully elaborated in which co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited remarkable performance in paa activation outperforming most reported heterogeneous catalysts extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis indicated that acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo was the predominated oxidizing species responsible for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation density functional theory dft calculations revealed that doping with mn not only promoted the electron transfer and accelerated reduction of co iii to co ii but also lowered the energy barrier for paa activation moreover the prominent chemisorption and activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 was also benefitted from the significant role of mn in optimizing the distribution of bonding and antibonding states on co 3d orbitals unexpectedly high levels of cl greatly facilitated smx degradation due to the mass production of hocl from the chain reactions of various radicals with cl this work provides new insights into bimetallic activation of paa and the knowledge obtained will further advance the application of paa based aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid co mn spinel oxides acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo sulfonamide antibiotics chloride data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction peracetic acid paa ch3co3h a strong oxidant with redox potential of e0 1 06 1 96 v has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional chlorinated disinfectants in water treatment owing to its low risk to form harmful disinfection byproducts kitis 2004 liu et al 2022 beyond that paa shows prominent prospects in degrading recalcitrant organic micropollutants omps ao et al 2020 although paa alone failed to degrade various omps due to the high selectivity towards organic compound oxidation kim and huang 2020 activation of paa to generate powerful oxidizing species has become an attractive way to achieve high efficiency degradation of omps as the structural basis for peroxide oxidants the oo bond energy in paa molecule 159 kj mol is lower than that in some commonly used peroxide oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 213 kj mol and peroxymonosulfate pms 317 kj mol kong et al 2022 wacławek et al 2017 suggesting the great potential towards reactive species generation from paa cleavage the homolysis of paa can generate hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals ro e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo while the major reactive species responsible for contaminants oxidation are dependent on the activation methods kim et al 2019 for instance paa activated by uv irradiation can form both oh and ro with oh dominantly contributing to carbamazepine oxidation cai et al 2017 nevertheless ch3c o o and ch3c o oo rather than oh are widely reported as the essential reactive oxidizing species ros for decontamination in transition metal catalyzed paa systems e g co2 paa process zhang et al 2022 2021 generally ro possess longer half life and moderate oxidizing power compared with oh favoring them to better contact with the target compounds and be less quenched by the background components in real waters cai et al 2017 hence ro are expected to be highly prospective to achieve selective removal of omps from the contaminated water transition metal catalysis is currently a research hotspot in the field of paa activation because transition metals can effectively activate oo bond to dominantly produce ro while requiring no additional energy liu et al 2021 among the transition metals e g co fe mn and cu co shows the strongest activity for paa activation kim et al 2020 zhang et al 1998 however the homogeneous co2 paa system may cause inevitable secondary contamination due to the potentially toxic and carcinogenic property of the cobalt ions in this regards co based heterogeneous catalysts in particular bimetal catalysts could be the promising alternatives for paa activation with the advantage of high catalytic activity and relatively slow co2 release hu and long 2016 among various bimetal catalysts spinel structured oxides with the formula of ab2o4 a b co fe mn cu and so on have received intensive attention in heterogeneous catalytic advanced oxidation systems benefitting from their low cost simple fabrication and desirable magnetic recovery property peng et al 2021b co based spinel structured oxides demonstrated great potential in structural stability due to the formed strong metal covalent bond thus effectively inhibited the leaching of metals kang et al 2019 although one study on the potential of paa activated with cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 has been reported the efficiency of the cofe2o4 paa process was far from satisfactory and a high catalyst dosage was required wang et al 2021 moreover the mechanism of bimetallic enhanced paa activation in terms of the critical role of the incorporation of a second metal on boosting co activity has not been clarified it is found that introducing manganese mn into cobalt spinel structure could significantly trigger the catalytic activity in fenton like process guo et al 2021 mn possesses unique mn2 mn3 mn4 redox loops and thus the bimetallic oxide of cobalt oxide combined with mn has a variety of valence states and more electron transfer pathways are involved huang et al 2017 which is conducive to redox reaction beyond that mn has the advantages of low cost abundant natural reserves and high environmental compatibility li et al 2018 endowing itself with a broad application prospect in water decontamination given the advantages of comn spinel oxides it is highly promising to achieve robust removal of omps from the contaminated wastewater with the activation of paa by comn spinel oxides and is imperative to explore the catalytic mechanism herein a range of co3 xmnxo4 x 0 6 2 2 with varying levels of co and mn was successfully elaborated and further applied as paa activators for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation the prepared co1 1mn1 9o4 delivers excellent catalytic performance in the paa activation for smx degradation which is observably superior to that of the existing heterogeneous catalysts for paa reported to date the extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis were conducted to determine the reactive species involved in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process density functional theory dft calculations were further performed to unveil the catalytic mechanism and significant role of mn for the high activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 then the impacts of solution ph and common water matrices such as humic substance and inorganic ions e g cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 were comprehensively evaluated we interestingly found that cl at high levels could significantly facilitate the degradation of smx and the underlying mechanism was unveiled the performance of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system in simulated mariculture wastewater and the reusability of the catalyst were further evaluated overall our study will enrich the understanding of the activation mechanism between paa and bimetallic materials and is expected to broaden the application of paa in practical wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the details of the chemicals and materials are provided in the supporting information text s1 the simulated mariculture wastewater was prepared by american national standard astm d1141 98 2003 with the compositions listed in the supporting information table s1 2 2 synthesis and characterizations of co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides x 0 2 2 are synthesized by hydrothermal method li et al 2018 the synthesis steps and characterizations of co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides are detailed in the supporting information text s2 2 3 catalytic activity evaluation of the catalysts unless specified all catalytic reactions were carried out in a 150 ml glass beaker under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at a water temperature of 20 1 c the catalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by the degradation of smx a typical sulfonamide antibiotics that was selected as a model omps typically paa 0 26 mm was spiked into 100 ml deionized water in advance containing smx 10 μm and immediately the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 with diluted naoh and hcl the catalytic reaction was triggered once dosing the catalyst 0 025 g l as the reaction proceeded 0 5 ml aliquots of reaction solution were withdrawn and immediately filtered through a ptfe filter 0 22 μm and quenched by na2s2o3 to terminate the reaction the concentrations of organic pollutants were measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 equipped with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm and a uv detector detailed mobile phase and wavelength for each compound are listed in the supporting information table s2 the degradation products of smx were analyzed through an acquity uplc system agilent 1290 possessing a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer agilent qtof 6550 more details shown in text s3 the acute and chronic toxicities of smx and its transformation products were predicted by ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program the antibacterial activity of smx before and after degradation were performed using escherichia coli e coli as model bacteria zhou et al 2018 the paa concentration was determined according to the n n diethylp phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method xiao et al 2019 the radical species were determined by electron spin resonance esr analysis using 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline noxide dmpo as the trapping agents in water and in ethanol solution with n2 respectively the obtained esr spectrum was further simulated via matlab to identify each radical capture product details shown in text s4 theoretical and computational details are shown in the supporting information text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the catalysts the crystallographic structure of the catalysts was characterized by xrd all the prepared materials possessed similar xrd patterns agreeing well with the typical spinel crystalline structure of co3 xmnxo4 x 0 2 2 fig s1 besides it could be observed from the xrd characterization that the type of spinel phases varied with the mn content of co3 xmnxo4 to be specific the synthesized materials with low mn contents x 0 0 6 were in cubic phase while the crystallographic phase changed to tetragonal phase as mn content raised 1 9 x 2 2 which is consistent with the previous observation lee et al 2015 the structural formation of bimetallic oxides was attributed to the strong interactions between co and mn ions with different coordination of m o m distributed on octahedral and tetrahedral r k n kutty et al 2019 the morphologies of the prepared catalysts were further observed with sem and tem from the sem images fig 1 a e all the co3 xmnxo4 x 0 samples had similar olive like shape while the pure co3o4 showed a nanorod like structure the edx mapping of co1 1mn1 9o4 suggested that co mn and o elements were uniformly dispersed in the catalyst fig 1f the olive like structure was also observed in the tem image of co1 1mn1 9o4 fig 1g in agreement with the sem result furthermore the hrtem images of co1 1mn1 9o4 showed the lattice fringes with spaces of 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 nm fig 1h which could be assigned to 311 400 and 433 lattice plane of co mn 3o4 oxides jcpds no 18 0408 respectively the co3 xmnxo4 samples also possessed similar bet specific surface area and pore volume of 70 7 77 6 m2 g and 0 16 0 17 cm3 g respectively fig s2 text s6 the high resolution xps spectrum revealed the existence of co ⅱ co ⅲ mn ⅱ mn ⅲ and mn ⅳ in all co3 xmnxo4 samples fig s3 s4 text s7 the ratios of co ii co iii increased with mn content x 0 6 2 0 table s3 while mn ⅳ mn ⅲ and mn ⅲ mn ⅱ were similar in all the spinel oxides table s4 3 2 paa activation by co3 xmnxo4 smx was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the activities of different catalysts in paa activation as shown in fig s5 paa or catalysts alone can hardly remove smx while the activation of paa with different co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides significantly enhanced the degradation of smx fig 2 a the catalytic activities of the prepared co3 xmnxo4 differed drastically with mn content in paa activation notably co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited the most outstanding activity with almost complete removal of smx achieved after 7 min the intrinsic activities of the catalysts are further reflected by normalizing the smx degradation rate constant k obs to specific surface area sbet the highest normalized k obs proved the superior intrinsic activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 fig s6 the normalized k obs of co1 1mn1 9o4 was 7 2 times higher than that of co3o4 furthermore the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process is compared with various heterogeneous paa based processes in organic contaminants removal a modified k obs m k obs is applied by dividing the k obs of contaminant degradation with the amount of catalyst addition and then multiplying the contaminant concentration chen et al 2019 as shown in table s5 and fig 2b the m k obs of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was as high as 220 μmol min 1 g 1 which is 5 0 to 1195 7 times higher than those of reported paa activation systems based on transition metal activators such as 45 8 fold and 5 fold over cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 bc activated systems respectively the results substantiated that co1 1mn1 9o4 was among the most excellent heterogeneous activators for paa the activations of other well known peroxide oxidants e g h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms using co1 1mn1 9o4 as the activator are also performed from fig s7 the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process exhibited the best performance in terms of smx degradation followed by the pms based system and both h2o2 and pds can hardly degrade smx with the activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 this result demonstrated the superiority of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the negligible degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 h2o2 process with h2o2 concentration equal to or even ten times higher than paa suggested that the co existing h2o2 was insignificant in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system from fig s8 the increasing dosage of co1 1mn1 9o4 or paa significantly promoted smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process details shown in text s8 it is reported that the catalytic performance of paa based aops can be greatly affected by solution ph ao et al 2020 hence it is highly required to assess the effect of solution ph on the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process as shown in fig 2c the removal efficiency of smx was strongly dependent on the solution ph to be specific smx was almost completely degraded under the initial ph of 5 0 7 0 within 7 min and the highest reaction rate of 0 54 min 1 was achieved at neutral condition fig 2d the degradation rate of smx obviously decreased to 0 27 min 1 with the initial ph lowered to 4 0 indicating that the oxidation capacity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was weakened under acidic conditions besides the serious inhibitory effects on smx degradation was observed when increasing the initial ph to 9 0 and 10 0 with the corresponding degradation rate significantly reduced to 0 16 and 0 05 min 1 respectively paa has a dissociation constant pka of around 8 2 and the acid base dissociation determined the distribution of paa species in conjugate acid paah and conjugate base paa under different ph conditions luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 paah is the dominant 94 species at ph lower than 7 0 while anionic paa becomes dominant 89 at ph higher than 9 0 previous studies reported that paah is more stable than anionic paa rendering it more difficult to be activated to produce reactive species zhang et al 2017 however the decline in smx degradation from ph 7 0 to 4 0 might not be attributed to the greater stability of paah considering the similar proportions of paah at ph 7 0 and 4 0 notably paa is positively charged in acidic environment due to the h bond formed between h and paa da silva et al 2020 in the current study co1 1mn1 9o4 was determined to possess an isoelectric point phiep of around 5 0 and hence the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 was positively charged at ph 4 0 fig s9 therefore the interaction between paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 at ph 4 0 can be restrained due to the electrostatic repulsion resulting in the inhibition of smx degradation at ph 4 0 under strong alkaline conditions ph 9 0 the powerful electrostatic repulsion between anionic paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 emerged which greatly prevented their interactions besides paa undergoes significant hydrolysis at highly basic phs which accelerated the consumption of paa without reactive species generation luukkonen et al 2014 therefore these two factors together caused severe reduction in smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process at strong alkaline conditions the capacity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process for degrading various sulfonamide antibiotics sas was further investigated although all the selected sas can be almost completely removed within 7 min in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig 3 a the degradation rates varied widely and were dependent on the structure of sas fig 3b the observed k obs of sas degradation followed a sequence of sulfamethizole smiz 0 45 min 1 smx 0 54 min 1 sulfapyridine spy 0 61 min 1 sulfadiazine sdz 0 71 min 1 sulfamerazine sm1 0 73 min 1 sulfamethazine sm2 0 77 min 1 obviously the degradations of sas containing six membered heterocyclic moieties were faster than those with five membered heterocyclic ring fig s10 besides the existence of ch3 an electron donating group on six membered heterocyclic moieties of the sas favored the degradation of sas to further understand the structure dependence of sas with the degradation rate the nucleophilicity of the sas were evaluated via the calculations based on density functional theory dft the nucleophilicity n index of the compounds could be described by the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy as eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 n e h o m o n u e v e h o m o t c e e v where tetracyanoethylene tce with the lowest homo energy among a series of compounds was used as a reference and hence a positive value of nucleophilicity n index for sas could be obtained table s10 as shown in fig 3b the global nucleophilicity of sas exhibited a reasonably good positive correlation with the corresponding reaction rate constants which implied that sas with high electrophilic structure possessed higher reactivity in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process moreover the removal of total organic carbon toc in the degradation of sas are investigated as fig s11 shows sas removed in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process can be largely mineralized and above 67 5 of toc were removed within 7 min for all the sas 3 3 activation mechanism 3 3 1 identification of reactive species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process it is reported that various reactive species including singlet oxygen 1o2 oh and ro e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3 and ch3o2 can be generated in paa based aops via complicated radical chain reactions eqs 2 7 rokhina et al 2010 1o2 in paa containing solution could be produced through the attack on central c atom of paa with ch3c o oo eq 8 evans and upton 1985 indeed the typical signals assigning to tmp 1o2 adducts were detected in paa solution marked as 0 min in fig 4 b while its intensity not increased as the reaction proceeds after dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 indicating that 1o2 was generated by paa alone and the activation by co1 1mn1 9o4 did not promote the production of 1o2 the contribution of 1o2 for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was evaluated by using nan3 as a specific 1o2 scavenger 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 gsponer et al 1987 the addition of nan3 hardly affected the degradation of smx indicating the insignificant role of 1o2 as reported the electron transfer from the metal active centers to paa induced the oo bond cleavage and followed by the generation of oh or ch3c o o as the primary radicals ao et al 2020 para chlorobenzoic acid p cba and nitrobenzene nb are selected as the typical probes for oh to demonstrate the existence of oh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process as fig s12 shows small amounts of p cba and nb can be degraded both lower than 25 within 30 min the degradations of these two probes were suppressed with tert butyl alcohol tba a well known quencher for oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the results supported the formation of oh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the contribution of oh on smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was further evaluated tba was applied as the specific oh scavenger in paa related aops because it can effectively quench oh rather than ro while methanol meoh can react rapidly with both oh and ro zhang et al 2022 hence the contributions of oh and ro to the degradations of organics could be differentiated using tba and meoh as the scavengers the degradation of smx was slightly inhibited in the presence of tba fig 4a indicating that oh played an insignificant role in smx degradation in contrast the addition of meoh significantly suppressed smx degradation accompanied by the promotion of paa decomposition somewhat in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig s13 the consumption of paa by meoh might lead to the inhibition of smx degradation to make it clear the paa concentration in the sample containing meoh was doubled to 0 52 mm to make sure that its paa concentration kept higher than that in the absence of meoh fig s14a the significant lower of smx degradation 25 0 in the presence of meoh than that 99 6 without meoh fig s14b supported that the inhibition of smx degradation by methanol was not contributed from the consumption of paa but primarily from the quenching of oh and r o taken together ro are more likely to be the dominant reactive species for smx oxidation while oh contributes less 2 c h 3 c o o o h m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n

h 3 c o o o h c h 3 c o o o c h 3 c o o h c h 3 c o o 1 o 2 among the various ro ch3c o o as a primary radical is highly unstable and tends to undergo self decay reaction to generate ch3 eq 5 which further readily react with dissolved oxygen to form ch3o2 eq 6 generally ch3 and ch3o2 are not powerful oxidants and possess low reactivity towards most organic compounds wang et al 2020 to assess the role of ch3 and ch3o2 the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was conducted under oxygen deprived or oxygen saturated condition with tba to eliminate oh cai et al 2017 the oxygen deprived condition could prevent the generation of ch3o2 from ch3 while conversion of ch3 to ch3o2 could be achieved in oxygen saturated condition as shown in fig 4a the degradations of smx were not obviously affected under both oxygen deprived and oxygen saturated conditions in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa tba process suggesting the negligible contribution of ch3 and ch3o2 in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system taken together acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are expected to be the dominated reactive species ch3c o oo is among the most powerful peroxyl radicals and can be generated from the attack of the primary oh or ch3c o o on paa molecule eqs 4 and 5 it was reported that 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd with two cc double bonds could effectively scavenge acetyl per oxyl radicals kim et al 2020 as expected the degradation of smx was nearly completely suppressed after dosing 2 4 hd fig 4a indicating that acetyl per oxyl radicals might be the primary reactive species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system as above mentioned however ch3c o o could be largely consumed by the self decay reaction and paa thus the direct oxidation of smx by ch3c o o could be disregarded details provided in text s9 thus ch3c o oo is more likely to be the dominant reactive species responsible for smx degradation our previous study has proved that mn2 can specifically scavenge ch3c o oo but has no effect on other radical species e g oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 in paa based aops zhang et al 2022 the presence of mn2 completely inhibited the degradation of smx fig 4a strongly supporting that ch3c o oo dominantly contributed to the oxidation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to further ascertain the formation of these radical species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system the esr analysis using dippmpo as a spin trapping reagent was performed as shown in fig s15 a complicated spectrum containing multiple peaks was observed representing a composite signal formed by several dippmpo trapping products the intensity of these trapping products of radicals was significantly enhanced with longer time while visible trapping peaks were not detected in paa solution without dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 see line named 0 min in fig s15 and in the co1 1mn1 9o4 h2o2 system fig s16 these results indicated that the radical species trapped by dippmpo were produced during the activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 spectra simulation was further conducted to identify each radical and the fitted data and plots was presented in table s6 and fig 4c respectively the extracted hyperfine splitting constants ap an and ah of the trapping products by simulation strongly evidenced the presence of oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 table s6 furthermore the typical eight line esr spectrum of dippmpo oh twelve line spectrum of dippmpo ch3 and twelve line spectrum of dippmpoch3o2 can be directly observed from the fitting curve fig 4c unfortunately dippmpo capture in water cannot distinguish ch3c o oo from other carbon centered radicals in esr spectrum more recently chen et al successfully established an esr analytical method for ch3c o oo in paa based aops by using dmpo capture in ethanol with n2 chen et al 2022 ethanol with high viscosity can enhance the spectrum of macromolecular radical and an oxygen free condition by purging n2 is required to block the generation of ch3o2 which has a similar esr spectrum with ch3c o oo as shown in fig 4d an obvious signal of dmpoch3c o oo was observed which presented a total spectral width of 37g and hyperfine splitting constant of anβ 13 7372g ahβ 8 769g ahγ 1 5805g this result strongly supported the generation of ch3c o oo in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system 3 3 2 insight into the significance of mn species in co1 1mn1 9o4 as previously discussed co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited a much stronger activity in paa activation than that of co3o4 implying a significant role of mn species in boosting the catalytic activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 whereas such enhancement effect by introducing mn was not observed when mn3o4 and co3o4 was physically mixed fig s17 thus some synergistic effect between co and mn in the co1 1mn1 9o4 fundamentally enhanced the catalytic reactivity the electrochemical studies were conducted to elucidate the role of mn in paa activation by the co1 1mn1 9o4 fig 5 a displays the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 when introducing mn into co3o4 the active area of cv curve obviously increased indicating the enhanced conductivity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 in addition a strong reduction peak at ca 0 49 v was detected in the cv curve of co1 1mn1 9o4 underlining the greater reductive capability of co1 1mn1 9o4 than that of co3o4 thus the addition of mn enhanced the conductivity and reductive capability which was expected to boost the paa activation via an electron transfer pathway furthermore co1 1mn1 9o4 possessed a lower charge transfer resistance value compared to co3o4 fig 5b which implied that the electron transfer in co1 1mn1 9o4 was more favorable dft calculations were further conducted to compare the adsorption energies of paa on co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 as listed in table s7 the adsorption energy of paa onto co1 1mn1 9o4 was larger than that onto co3o4 0 78 ev vs 0 64 ev reflecting the stronger adsorption of co1 1mn1 9o4 than co3o4 for paa hence mn species doped into co3o4 enhanced the adsorption capacity of paa facilitating the further catalytic reactions the intermediate structures and the corresponding energy profiles of paa adsorption onto the co sites with and without the introduction of mn atoms represented as red and blue routes respectively are shown in fig 5c firstly paa binds to the co sites state ii with the single o atom attaching to the c atom on oo bond and releases energy subsequently the absorbed paa is activated forming the intermediate of co oocch3 state iii with an energy barrier of 0 68 and 1 82 ev with and without mn incorporation respectively then co site is recovered after releasing ch3coo moiety state iv and energy hence the barrier height of the reaction on co sites should be 0 68 and 1 82 ev respectively for the cases with and without mn incorporation the much lower energy barrier for paa activated by co1 1mn1 9o4 than co3o4 demonstrating that the activation of paa on co sites with mn binding is more thermodynamically favorable the partial density of states pdos of co atom in co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 are calculated and displayed in fig 5d it was observed that the 3d orbital electrons of the co atoms in co3o4 are dispersed and situated below the fermi level at 5 37 3 98 and 1 06 ev respectively while those of the co atoms in co1 1mn1 9o4 are mainly clustered at 0 90 ev hence the introduction of mn in co3o4 enables more intensive and closer fermi level electrons in co atoms which suggested that the catalytic reactivities of co active sites in co1 1mn1 9o4 are stronger than that in co3o4 to interact with paa zhang et al 2020 furthermore the existence of mn pulls the unoccupied antibonding orbitals mostly above the fermi level of co atoms below the fermi level fig 5d increasing the number of empty orbitals that can be occupied by electrons in co 3d orbitals and thus facilitating the chemisorption of paa zhang et al 2020 this result was supported by the larger adsorption energy of paa on co1 1mn1 9o4 than that on co3o4 table s7 3 3 3 overall reaction mechanism generally the homogeneous catalytic process also played a role in metal based heterogeneous systems for peroxides activation due to the leached metal ions to make it clear the leaching of metal ions including co2 and mn2 after reaction in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process were determined under near neutral conditions solution ph decreased from 7 0 to 6 2 after reaction merely 0 002 and 0 12 mg l of co2 and mn2 was detected after reaction fig s18 respectively which was much lower than the wastewater discharge standard of 1 0 mg co l and 2 0 mg mn l china we further evaluated the possible contribution of the leached co2 and mn2 on smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the maximum concentrations of co2 0 002 mg l and mn2 0 12 mg l in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system were selected for co2 paa and mn2 paa processes respectively as fig s19 shows the aqueous co2 was effective in paa activation for smx degradation and approximately 48 of smx was removed within 7 min while mn2 was less powerful to activate paa with merely 18 of smx degraded noting that the contents of metal ions were gradually increased during the reaction the contributions of the leached metal ions in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process for smx degradation should be much lower than that observed in fig s19 therefore the heterogeneous activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 for paa played a dominant role for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to give insight into the reaction mechanism the variations in chemical composition of the co1 1mn1 9o4 after reaction was further investigated the xps spectra showed that the atomic ratio of co ii slightly decreased from 53 to 51 after the paa activation fig 6 a implying the electron transfer to paa to predominantly produce ch3c o o or little oh meanwhile the atomic ratio of mn ii and mn iii decreased from 41 33 to 39 and 32 respectively which is mainly due to the reaction with co iii accompanied by the regeneration of co ii fig 6b besides the slight variations of the co and mn species after reaction suggested that co ii co iii and mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ redox cycles might be involved in paa activation as shown in the o1s xps spectra fig 6c the peaks with the binding energy at 530 1 and 531 2 ev were ascribed to the lattice o in metal oxygen bonds and m oh hydroxyl group m denoted as co or mn respectively yang et al 2022 the relative content of the m oh group in co1 1mn1 9o4 increased from 41 to 52 after reacting with paa which suggested the formation of m oh group on catalyst surface during the reaction the reduction in the fraction of the lattice o was likely to be ascribed to the reduction of m iii to m ii the charge density analysis of paa adsorbed on co1 1mn1 9o4 was further performed to demonstrate the electron transfer process during the reaction the result proves the significant electron transfer between the paa molecule and co mn centers fig s20 to be specific it showed that co and mn atoms suffered a marked charge depletion accompanied by the charge accumulation of o in paa molecule supporting the electron transfer from co mn centers to paa on the other hand the charge lost around the h atom of paa was also observed indicating the electron transfer from paa to co mn centers as a result ch3c o oo was produced as a primary radical based on the above discussed results a primary activation mechanism towards heterogeneous catalysis of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 was proposed fig 6d co and mn ions as lewis sites can react with desorbed h2o molecules to form co oh and mn oh species on the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 respectively the catalytic reaction is triggered through the absorption of paa onto the active metal hydroxyl sites via hydrogen bonding followed by the production of ch3c o o or minor oh through the electron transfer from these metal hydroxyl sites i e co ii oh mn ii oh and mn iii oh to paa molecules eqs 9 12 the formed ch3c o o can further attack paa to generate ch3c o oo which is confirmed to perform as the dominant oxidizing species for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process ch3c o oo can also be directly generated via the electron transfer from paa to the metal hydroxyl species in high valent state as mn 1 oh accompanied by the regeneration of mn oh eqs 13 15 furthermore co iii co ii has a standard reduction potential of e0 1 81 v which is higher than that of mn iv mn iii 0 15 v and mn iii mn ii 1 51 v li et al 2018 yao et al 2015 hence the recovery of co ii from the reduction of co iii with mn ii and mn iii was thermodynamically favorable eqs 16 17 suggesting that the introduce of mn facilitated the regeneration of co ii on the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 9 c o i i o h c h 3 c o o o h c o i i i o h c h 3 c o o o h 10 c o i i o h c h 3 c o o o h c

abundantly in water bodies can affect the performance of aops to different degrees ha showed an adverse impact on the degradation of smx fig s21a which was primarily attributed to the scavenging of oh and r o by ha fig s21b text s10 the existence of hco3 co3 2 also inhibited the smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig s21 and further study discovered that the inhibition was caused by the formed unreactive cobalt bicarbonate complexes and the quenching effect on radical species fig s21d fig s22 text s10 besides the degradation of smx was not affected by ca2 but was slightly facilitated by mg2 at high concentration 50 mm fig s23 as fig 7 a shows low concentration 1 mm of cl showed negligible effect on smx degradation which might be due to the low reactivity of cl with oh and r o ao et al 2020 whereas it was surprising to observe that high levels of cl markedly enhanced the reactivity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process and the promotion for smx degradation became much stronger with higher cl concentration more specifically the reaction rate of smx was significantly increased from 0 56 to 1 37 min 1 with the addition of cl increased from 10 mm to 500 mm fig 7a insert 3 5 mechanism of chloride ions promoted smx degradation to further reveal the role of cl the impact of cl on the removal of smx with the presence of paa or co1 1mn1 9o4 individually was investigated as fig s24a shows the oxidation of smx by paa was hardly affected in the presence of 1 500 mm cl and similarly the adsorption of smx by co1 1mn1 9o4 was unaffected at different levels of cl fig s24b furthermore the decomposition of paa in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system was barely influenced by cl fig s25 suggesting that the reaction between paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 was not facilitated in the presence of cl these results implied that the enhancement of smx degradation after dosing cl in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was more likely to be attributed to the generation of reactive cl species as well known oh is readily quenched by halogen ions such as cl with the generation of cl eqs 18 19 which possesses strong oxidizing power with a standard redox potential of 2 4 v cl cl and can effectively oxidize those contaminants with electron rich moieties ji et al 2022 although the reaction between cl and r o formed in paa based aops is still largely unreported it is highly probable to occur due to the strong oxidizing power of r o especially ch3c o o and ch3c o oo the produced cl might further react with cl to generate cl2 via eq 20 it was reported that the degradation rate constants of cl and cl2 for some organic contaminants were in the same order of magnitude as oh lei et al 2019 furthermore hocl cl2 could further be produced through the attack of cl on cl2 eq 21 and the intermolecular reaction of cl2 eq 22 the generated cl2 hclo with strong oxidation capacity can effectively degrade refractory organic pollutants such as smx murrieta et al 2020 as reported hocl cl2 could be generated in large amounts under high cl surroundings in fenton like catalytic system and played a much stronger role than other radicals due to its much longer lifetime peng et al 2021a

of oh r o cl cl2 and hclo to identify the dominant oxidative species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system a series of quenching experiments were further conducted tba can effectively quench oh and cl metz et al 2022 and meoh can rapidly eliminate oh r o cl and cl2 but has no effect on hclo cai et al 2017 lei et al 2019 as shown in fig 7b the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system was not affected after dosing tba reflecting the negligible role of oh and cl moreover slight inhibition of smx degradation was observed with the dosage of meoh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system suggesting the insignificant contribution of r o and cl2 which is largely distinct from the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system that was dominated by r o hence it is expected that the activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 might be converted to a nonradical mediated process under high levels of cl and the generated hclo is likely to become the main oxidant to make it clear nh4 was used as a specific hclo scavenger because nh4 is hard to be oxidized by free radicals such as oh and cl but can rapidly react with hclo to form nh2cl with weak oxidative power wang et al 2011 as fig 7b shows once dosing 10 mm nh4 into the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system the degradation of smx was significantly inhibited and complete inhibition was observed with nh4 concentration further increased to 100 mm the results strongly evidenced that hclo should be the primary reactive species accounting for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system with high levels of cl to explore the pathway for hclo formation the detection of hclo in different systems were conducted by using rhodamine b hydrazine rbh as a fluorescence probe of hocl luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 the result showed that no fluorescence peak was observed in the chlorine free system while the hocl fluorescence peak at 578 nm appeared in the paa cl system fig 7c indicating the formation of hocl through the direct reaction of paa with chloride more significantly the fluorescence intensity was significantly enhanced in paa cl system after dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 indicating that the reaction between cl and paa can be further induced with the activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 to form more hocl for smx degradation as previously discussed the radical chain reactions of oh and r o with cl could be the significant pathway for generating hclo to make it clear the effects of cl on the generation of oh and r o were explored fig 8 a shows that the presence of cl 500 mm obviously reduced the intensity of dippmo oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 adducts in the esr spectrum and similar diminish for dmpoch3c o oo adduct was also observed after introducing high level of cl fig 8b these results demonstrated that the production of oh and r o was inhibited by cl while the decomposition of paa was not affected fig s25 hence the decrease of oh and r o should be attributed to the chain reactions with cl resulting to the generation of hocl considering the high tolerance of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to cl this novel oxidation technology is promising to be applied in high salinity wastewater treatment to further assess its application potential the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was operated in the simulated mariculture wastewater a typical high salt content wastewater contaminated with antibiotics as shown in fig 7d the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was remarkably enhanced under the simulated seawater sample to be specific complete degradation of smx was achieved within 3 min in the simulated seawater and the k obs value significantly increased from 0 36 to 1 74 min 1 compared to that in the deionized water fig 7d insert which might be attributed to the abundance of cl and mg2 in seawater this phenomenon indicated that the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was particularly promising to be applied in high salinity wastewater e g mariculture wastewater treatment 3 6 degradation pathways and toxicity evolution of smx five transformation products tps including tp 269 tp 283 tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 were identified after reaction with the ion fragments and proposed structures shown in figs s26 s31 as reported electron transfer and h abstraction were the main reaction in ch3c o oo driven organic pollutant degradation du et al 2022 kim et al 2020 from fig s32 the aromatic ring nh2 group and s n bond of smx possessed deeper highest occupied molecular orbital homo level implying that these sites are prone to losing electrons the possible transformation pathway of smx was proposed in fig 9 firstly the nh2 group of smx is vulnerable to ch3c o oo and can be oxidized to no2 group resulting in the generation of nitro smx tp 283 pathway i furthermore the coupling reaction also occurred during the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process pathway ii followed by the production of three dimeric products tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 besides the hydroxylation of the aniline ring was observed and generated hydroxyl smx derivative tp 269 which was attributed to the generation of aniline radicals via hydrogen atom abstraction by ch3c o oo pathway iii the h abstraction by ch3c o oo on the nh2 group of smx could also generate n centered radicals e n step et al 1991 and the hydroxyl smx further underwent coupling reaction with these n centered radicals forming azo smx tp 502 and hydroxylated azo smx tp 518 the acute and chronic toxicities of smx and its tps were predicted via the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar program qian et al 2021 according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals the degree of toxicity can be classified into four levels table s8 as shown in table s9 and fig 10 the acute and chronic toxicities towards fish and green algae of the tps were comparable to that of smx while most tps exhibited significantly lower acute and chronic toxicities to daphnid than smx to be specific the overall toxicity of the hydroxylation product of the aniline ring i e tp269 in this case was slightly lower than that of the parent compound in addition the oxidation of nh2 to no2 group generating tp283 and the coupling reaction producing dimeric products as tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 significantly reduced the acute and chronic toxicities of smx to daphnid the effect of smx treatment by the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process on its antibacterial activity was investigated via the e coli growth test δod600 was applied to reflect the growth of e coli in the presence of untreated and treated smx samples as observed in fig s33 the treatment of smx with the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process slightly facilitated the growth of e coli directly indicating that the toxicity of smx reduced after the treatment 3 7 reusability and stability tests of co1 1mn1 9o4 the cycle experiment was performed to evaluate the reusability of co1 1mn1 9o4 towards paa activation as shown in fig s34 the degradation of smx maintained above 95 after 7 min reaction in the first three cycles and slightly decreased to 88 after four cycle runs the phenomenon suggested a remarkable reusability of co1 1mn1 9o4 in paa activation which is of great benefit for promoting the application in the future the slight decrease of smx degradation might be attributed to the loss of active sites by metal leaching and the formed unreactive metal organic complex on catalyst surface the xrd analysis for co1 1mn1 9o4 before and after use were conducted to assess the stability of the catalyst no distinct change was observed in the xrd patterns of fresh and used co1 1mn1 9o4 fig s35 indicating that co1 1mn1 9o4 was highly stable in term of the crystal structure during paa activation the negligible leaching of metal ions also supported the high stability of co1 1mn1 9o4 during reaction fig s18 4 conclusions herein the prepared co1 1mn1 9o4 material displayed remarkable catalytic activity in the paa activation for smx degradation under near neutral environment outperforming the most heterogeneous activators reported so far ch3c o oo as a powerful r o was proved to be the primary reactive species responsible for smx oxidation results indicated that mn species greatly facilitated the catalytic activity of co sites by accelerating electron transfer lowering energy barrier and optimizing the distribution of bonding and antibonding states on co 3d orbitals the degradation of smx was significantly promoted under dense cl environment due to the generation of large amounts of hclo through the conversion of radicals oh and r o with cl and hence the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process exhibited even stronger activity in simulated mariculture wastewater in terms of smx degradation implying the great potential of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process in high salinity wastewater remediation

15240,activation of peracetic acid paa to generate powerful oxidizing species has become a promising advanced oxidation processes aops in wastewater treatment yet the development of low cost and high performance activators is still a primary challenge herein a range of co mn spinel oxides co3 xmnxo4 with varying levels of co and mn were successfully elaborated in which co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited remarkable performance in paa activation outperforming most reported heterogeneous catalysts extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis indicated that acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo was the predominated oxidizing species responsible for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation density functional theory dft calculations revealed that doping with mn not only promoted the electron transfer and accelerated reduction of co iii to co ii but also lowered the energy barrier for paa activation moreover the prominent chemisorption and activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 was also benefitted from the significant role of mn in optimizing the distribution of bonding and antibonding states on co 3d orbitals unexpectedly high levels of cl greatly facilitated smx degradation due to the mass production of hocl from the chain reactions of various radicals with cl this work provides new insights into bimetallic activation of paa and the knowledge obtained will further advance the application of paa based aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid co mn spinel oxides acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo sulfonamide antibiotics chloride data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction peracetic acid paa ch3co3h a strong oxidant with redox potential of e0 1 06 1 96 v has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional chlorinated disinfectants in water treatment owing to its low risk to form harmful disinfection byproducts kitis 2004 liu et al 2022 beyond that paa shows prominent prospects in degrading recalcitrant organic micropollutants omps ao et al 2020 although paa alone failed to degrade various omps due to the high selectivity towards organic compound oxidation kim and huang 2020 activation of paa to generate powerful oxidizing species has become an attractive way to achieve high efficiency degradation of omps as the structural basis for peroxide oxidants the oo bond energy in paa molecule 159 kj mol is lower than that in some commonly used peroxide oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 213 kj mol and peroxymonosulfate pms 317 kj mol kong et al 2022 wacławek et al 2017 suggesting the great potential towards reactive species generation from paa cleavage the homolysis of paa can generate hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals ro e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo while the major reactive species responsible for contaminants oxidation are dependent on the activation methods kim et al 2019 for instance paa activated by uv irradiation can form both oh and ro with oh dominantly contributing to carbamazepine oxidation cai et al 2017 nevertheless ch3c o o and ch3c o oo rather than oh are widely reported as the essential reactive oxidizing species ros for decontamination in transition metal catalyzed paa systems e g co2 paa process zhang et al 2022 2021 generally ro possess longer half life and moderate oxidizing power compared with oh favoring them to better contact with the target compounds and be less quenched by the background components in real waters cai et al 2017 hence ro are expected to be highly prospective to achieve selective removal of omps from the contaminated water transition metal catalysis is currently a research hotspot in the field of paa activation because transition metals can effectively activate oo bond to dominantly produce ro while requiring no additional energy liu et al 2021 among the transition metals e g co fe mn and cu co shows the strongest activity for paa activation kim et al 2020 zhang et al 1998 however the homogeneous co2 paa system may cause inevitable secondary contamination due to the potentially toxic and carcinogenic property of the cobalt ions in this regards co based heterogeneous catalysts in particular bimetal catalysts could be the promising alternatives for paa activation with the advantage of high catalytic activity and relatively slow co2 release hu and long 2016 among various bimetal catalysts spinel structured oxides with the formula of ab2o4 a b co fe mn cu and so on have received intensive attention in heterogeneous catalytic advanced oxidation systems benefitting from their low cost simple fabrication and desirable magnetic recovery property peng et al 2021b co based spinel structured oxides demonstrated great potential in structural stability due to the formed strong metal covalent bond thus effectively inhibited the leaching of metals kang et al 2019 although one study on the potential of paa activated with cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 has been reported the efficiency of the cofe2o4 paa process was far from satisfactory and a high catalyst dosage was required wang et al 2021 moreover the mechanism of bimetallic enhanced paa activation in terms of the critical role of the incorporation of a second metal on boosting co activity has not been clarified it is found that introducing manganese mn into cobalt spinel structure could significantly trigger the catalytic activity in fenton like process guo et al 2021 mn possesses unique mn2 mn3 mn4 redox loops and thus the bimetallic oxide of cobalt oxide combined with mn has a variety of valence states and more electron transfer pathways are involved huang et al 2017 which is conducive to redox reaction beyond that mn has the advantages of low cost abundant natural reserves and high environmental compatibility li et al 2018 endowing itself with a broad application prospect in water decontamination given the advantages of comn spinel oxides it is highly promising to achieve robust removal of omps from the contaminated wastewater with the activation of paa by comn spinel oxides and is imperative to explore the catalytic mechanism herein a range of co3 xmnxo4 x 0 6 2 2 with varying levels of co and mn was successfully elaborated and further applied as paa activators for sulfamethoxazole smx degradation the prepared co1 1mn1 9o4 delivers excellent catalytic performance in the paa activation for smx degradation which is observably superior to that of the existing heterogeneous catalysts for paa reported to date the extensive quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr analysis were conducted to determine the reactive species involved in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process density functional theory dft calculations were further performed to unveil the catalytic mechanism and significant role of mn for the high activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 then the impacts of solution ph and common water matrices such as humic substance and inorganic ions e g cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 were comprehensively evaluated we interestingly found that cl at high levels could significantly facilitate the degradation of smx and the underlying mechanism was unveiled the performance of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system in simulated mariculture wastewater and the reusability of the catalyst were further evaluated overall our study will enrich the understanding of the activation mechanism between paa and bimetallic materials and is expected to broaden the application of paa in practical wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the details of the chemicals and materials are provided in the supporting information text s1 the simulated mariculture wastewater was prepared by american national standard astm d1141 98 2003 with the compositions listed in the supporting information table s1 2 2 synthesis and characterizations of co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides x 0 2 2 are synthesized by hydrothermal method li et al 2018 the synthesis steps and characterizations of co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides are detailed in the supporting information text s2 2 3 catalytic activity evaluation of the catalysts unless specified all catalytic reactions were carried out in a 150 ml glass beaker under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at a water temperature of 20 1 c the catalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by the degradation of smx a typical sulfonamide antibiotics that was selected as a model omps typically paa 0 26 mm was spiked into 100 ml deionized water in advance containing smx 10 μm and immediately the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 with diluted naoh and hcl the catalytic reaction was triggered once dosing the catalyst 0 025 g l as the reaction proceeded 0 5 ml aliquots of reaction solution were withdrawn and immediately filtered through a ptfe filter 0 22 μm and quenched by na2s2o3 to terminate the reaction the concentrations of organic pollutants were measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 equipped with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm and a uv detector detailed mobile phase and wavelength for each compound are listed in the supporting information table s2 the degradation products of smx were analyzed through an acquity uplc system agilent 1290 possessing a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer agilent qtof 6550 more details shown in text s3 the acute and chronic toxicities of smx and its transformation products were predicted by ecological structure activity relationship model ecosar program the antibacterial activity of smx before and after degradation were performed using escherichia coli e coli as model bacteria zhou et al 2018 the paa concentration was determined according to the n n diethylp phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method xiao et al 2019 the radical species were determined by electron spin resonance esr analysis using 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline noxide dmpo as the trapping agents in water and in ethanol solution with n2 respectively the obtained esr spectrum was further simulated via matlab to identify each radical capture product details shown in text s4 theoretical and computational details are shown in the supporting information text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the catalysts the crystallographic structure of the catalysts was characterized by xrd all the prepared materials possessed similar xrd patterns agreeing well with the typical spinel crystalline structure of co3 xmnxo4 x 0 2 2 fig s1 besides it could be observed from the xrd characterization that the type of spinel phases varied with the mn content of co3 xmnxo4 to be specific the synthesized materials with low mn contents x 0 0 6 were in cubic phase while the crystallographic phase changed to tetragonal phase as mn content raised 1 9 x 2 2 which is consistent with the previous observation lee et al 2015 the structural formation of bimetallic oxides was attributed to the strong interactions between co and mn ions with different coordination of m o m distributed on octahedral and tetrahedral r k n kutty et al 2019 the morphologies of the prepared catalysts were further observed with sem and tem from the sem images fig 1 a e all the co3 xmnxo4 x 0 samples had similar olive like shape while the pure co3o4 showed a nanorod like structure the edx mapping of co1 1mn1 9o4 suggested that co mn and o elements were uniformly dispersed in the catalyst fig 1f the olive like structure was also observed in the tem image of co1 1mn1 9o4 fig 1g in agreement with the sem result furthermore the hrtem images of co1 1mn1 9o4 showed the lattice fringes with spaces of 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 nm fig 1h which could be assigned to 311 400 and 433 lattice plane of co mn 3o4 oxides jcpds no 18 0408 respectively the co3 xmnxo4 samples also possessed similar bet specific surface area and pore volume of 70 7 77 6 m2 g and 0 16 0 17 cm3 g respectively fig s2 text s6 the high resolution xps spectrum revealed the existence of co ⅱ co ⅲ mn ⅱ mn ⅲ and mn ⅳ in all co3 xmnxo4 samples fig s3 s4 text s7 the ratios of co ii co iii increased with mn content x 0 6 2 0 table s3 while mn ⅳ mn ⅲ and mn ⅲ mn ⅱ were similar in all the spinel oxides table s4 3 2 paa activation by co3 xmnxo4 smx was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the activities of different catalysts in paa activation as shown in fig s5 paa or catalysts alone can hardly remove smx while the activation of paa with different co3 xmnxo4 spinel oxides significantly enhanced the degradation of smx fig 2 a the catalytic activities of the prepared co3 xmnxo4 differed drastically with mn content in paa activation notably co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited the most outstanding activity with almost complete removal of smx achieved after 7 min the intrinsic activities of the catalysts are further reflected by normalizing the smx degradation rate constant k obs to specific surface area sbet the highest normalized k obs proved the superior intrinsic activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 fig s6 the normalized k obs of co1 1mn1 9o4 was 7 2 times higher than that of co3o4 furthermore the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process is compared with various heterogeneous paa based processes in organic contaminants removal a modified k obs m k obs is applied by dividing the k obs of contaminant degradation with the amount of catalyst addition and then multiplying the contaminant concentration chen et al 2019 as shown in table s5 and fig 2b the m k obs of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was as high as 220 μmol min 1 g 1 which is 5 0 to 1195 7 times higher than those of reported paa activation systems based on transition metal activators such as 45 8 fold and 5 fold over cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 bc activated systems respectively the results substantiated that co1 1mn1 9o4 was among the most excellent heterogeneous activators for paa the activations of other well known peroxide oxidants e g h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms using co1 1mn1 9o4 as the activator are also performed from fig s7 the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process exhibited the best performance in terms of smx degradation followed by the pms based system and both h2o2 and pds can hardly degrade smx with the activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 this result demonstrated the superiority of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the negligible degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 h2o2 process with h2o2 concentration equal to or even ten times higher than paa suggested that the co existing h2o2 was insignificant in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system from fig s8 the increasing dosage of co1 1mn1 9o4 or paa significantly promoted smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process details shown in text s8 it is reported that the catalytic performance of paa based aops can be greatly affected by solution ph ao et al 2020 hence it is highly required to assess the effect of solution ph on the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process as shown in fig 2c the removal efficiency of smx was strongly dependent on the solution ph to be specific smx was almost completely degraded under the initial ph of 5 0 7 0 within 7 min and the highest reaction rate of 0 54 min 1 was achieved at neutral condition fig 2d the degradation rate of smx obviously decreased to 0 27 min 1 with the initial ph lowered to 4 0 indicating that the oxidation capacity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was weakened under acidic conditions besides the serious inhibitory effects on smx degradation was observed when increasing the initial ph to 9 0 and 10 0 with the corresponding degradation rate significantly reduced to 0 16 and 0 05 min 1 respectively paa has a dissociation constant pka of around 8 2 and the acid base dissociation determined the distribution of paa species in conjugate acid paah and conjugate base paa under different ph conditions luukkonen and pehkonen 2016 paah is the dominant 94 species at ph lower than 7 0 while anionic paa becomes dominant 89 at ph higher than 9 0 previous studies reported that paah is more stable than anionic paa rendering it more difficult to be activated to produce reactive species zhang et al 2017 however the decline in smx degradation from ph 7 0 to 4 0 might not be attributed to the greater stability of paah considering the similar proportions of paah at ph 7 0 and 4 0 notably paa is positively charged in acidic environment due to the h bond formed between h and paa da silva et al 2020 in the current study co1 1mn1 9o4 was determined to possess an isoelectric point phiep of around 5 0 and hence the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 was positively charged at ph 4 0 fig s9 therefore the interaction between paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 at ph 4 0 can be restrained due to the electrostatic repulsion resulting in the inhibition of smx degradation at ph 4 0 under strong alkaline conditions ph 9 0 the powerful electrostatic repulsion between anionic paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 emerged which greatly prevented their interactions besides paa undergoes significant hydrolysis at highly basic phs which accelerated the consumption of paa without reactive species generation luukkonen et al 2014 therefore these two factors together caused severe reduction in smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process at strong alkaline conditions the capacity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process for degrading various sulfonamide antibiotics sas was further investigated although all the selected sas can be almost completely removed within 7 min in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig 3 a the degradation rates varied widely and were dependent on the structure of sas fig 3b the observed k obs of sas degradation followed a sequence of sulfamethizole smiz 0 45 min 1 smx 0 54 min 1 sulfapyridine spy 0 61 min 1 sulfadiazine sdz 0 71 min 1 sulfamerazine sm1 0 73 min 1 sulfamethazine sm2 0 77 min 1 obviously the degradations of sas containing six membered heterocyclic moieties were faster than those with five membered heterocyclic ring fig s10 besides the existence of ch3 an electron donating group on six membered heterocyclic moieties of the sas favored the degradation of sas to further understand the structure dependence of sas with the degradation rate the nucleophilicity of the sas were evaluated via the calculations based on density functional theory dft the nucleophilicity n index of the compounds could be described by the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy as eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 n e h o m o n u e v e h o m o t c e e v where tetracyanoethylene tce with the lowest homo energy among a series of compounds was used as a reference and hence a positive value of nucleophilicity n index for sas could be obtained table s10 as shown in fig 3b the global nucleophilicity of sas exhibited a reasonably good positive correlation with the corresponding reaction rate constants which implied that sas with high electrophilic structure possessed higher reactivity in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process moreover the removal of total organic carbon toc in the degradation of sas are investigated as fig s11 shows sas removed in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process can be largely mineralized and above 67 5 of toc were removed within 7 min for all the sas 3 3 activation mechanism 3 3 1 identification of reactive species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process it is reported that various reactive species including singlet oxygen 1o2 oh and ro e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3 and ch3o2 can be generated in paa based aops via complicated radical chain reactions eqs 2 7 rokhina et al 2010 1o2 in paa containing solution could be produced through the attack on central c atom of paa with ch3c o oo eq 8 evans and upton 1985 indeed the typical signals assigning to tmp 1o2 adducts were detected in paa solution marked as 0 min in fig 4 b while its intensity not increased as the reaction proceeds after dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 indicating that 1o2 was generated by paa alone and the activation by co1 1mn1 9o4 did not promote the production of 1o2 the contribution of 1o2 for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was evaluated by using nan3 as a specific 1o2 scavenger 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 gsponer et al 1987 the addition of nan3 hardly affected the degradation of smx indicating the insignificant role of 1o2 as reported the electron transfer from the metal active centers to paa induced the oo bond cleavage and followed by the generation of oh or ch3c o o as the primary radicals ao et al 2020 para chlorobenzoic acid p cba and nitrobenzene nb are selected as the typical probes for oh to demonstrate the existence of oh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process as fig s12 shows small amounts of p cba and nb can be degraded both lower than 25 within 30 min the degradations of these two probes were suppressed with tert butyl alcohol tba a well known quencher for oh k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the results supported the formation of oh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the contribution of oh on smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was further evaluated tba was applied as the specific oh scavenger in paa related aops because it can effectively quench oh rather than ro while methanol meoh can react rapidly with both oh and ro zhang et al 2022 hence the contributions of oh and ro to the degradations of organics could be differentiated using tba and meoh as the scavengers the degradation of smx was slightly inhibited in the presence of tba fig 4a indicating that oh played an insignificant role in smx degradation in contrast the addition of meoh significantly suppressed smx degradation accompanied by the promotion of paa decomposition somewhat in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig s13 the consumption of paa by meoh might lead to the inhibition of smx degradation to make it clear the paa concentration in the sample containing meoh was doubled to 0 52 mm to make sure that its paa concentration kept higher than that in the absence of meoh fig s14a the significant lower of smx degradation 25 0 in the presence of meoh than that 99 6 without meoh fig s14b supported that the inhibition of smx degradation by methanol was not contributed from the consumption of paa but primarily from the quenching of oh and r o taken together ro are more likely to be the dominant reactive species for smx oxidation while oh contributes less 2 c h 3 c o o o h m n 1 c h 3 c o o m n

further readily react with dissolved oxygen to form ch3o2 eq 6 generally ch3 and ch3o2 are not powerful oxidants and possess low reactivity towards most organic compounds wang et al 2020 to assess the role of ch3 and ch3o2 the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was conducted under oxygen deprived or oxygen saturated condition with tba to eliminate oh cai et al 2017 the oxygen deprived condition could prevent the generation of ch3o2 from ch3 while conversion of ch3 to ch3o2 could be achieved in oxygen saturated condition as shown in fig 4a the degradations of smx were not obviously affected under both oxygen deprived and oxygen saturated conditions in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa tba process suggesting the negligible contribution of ch3 and ch3o2 in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system taken together acetyl per oxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are expected to be the dominated reactive species ch3c o oo is among the most powerful peroxyl radicals and can be generated from the attack of the primary oh or ch3c o o on paa molecule eqs 4 and 5 it was reported that 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd with two cc double bonds could effectively scavenge acetyl per oxyl radicals kim et al 2020 as expected the degradation of smx was nearly completely suppressed after dosing 2 4 hd fig 4a indicating that acetyl per oxyl radicals might be the primary reactive species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system as above mentioned however ch3c o o could be largely consumed by the self decay reaction and paa thus the direct oxidation of smx by ch3c o o could be disregarded details provided in text s9 thus ch3c o oo is more likely to be the dominant reactive species responsible for smx degradation our previous study has proved that mn2 can specifically scavenge ch3c o oo but has no effect on other radical species e g oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 in paa based aops zhang et al 2022 the presence of mn2 completely inhibited the degradation of smx fig 4a strongly supporting that ch3c o oo dominantly contributed to the oxidation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to further ascertain the formation of these radical species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system the esr analysis using dippmpo as a spin trapping reagent was performed as shown in fig s15 a complicated spectrum containing multiple peaks was observed representing a composite signal formed by several dippmpo trapping products the intensity of these trapping products of radicals was significantly enhanced with longer time while visible trapping peaks were not detected in paa solution without dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 see line named 0 min in fig s15 and in the co1 1mn1 9o4 h2o2 system fig s16 these results indicated that the radical species trapped by dippmpo were produced during the activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 spectra simulation was further conducted to identify each radical and the fitted data and plots was presented in table s6 and fig 4c respectively the extracted hyperfine splitting constants ap an and ah of the trapping products by simulation strongly evidenced the presence of oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 table s6 furthermore the typical eight line esr spectrum of dippmpo oh twelve line spectrum of dippmpo ch3 and twelve line spectrum of dippmpoch3o2 can be directly observed from the fitting curve fig 4c unfortunately dippmpo capture in water cannot distinguish ch3c o oo from other carbon centered radicals in esr spectrum more recently chen et al successfully established an esr analytical method for ch3c o oo in paa based aops by using dmpo capture in ethanol with n2 chen et al 2022 ethanol with high viscosity can enhance the spectrum of macromolecular radical and an oxygen free condition by purging n2 is required to block the generation of ch3o2 which has a similar esr spectrum with ch3c o oo as shown in fig 4d an obvious signal of dmpoch3c o oo was observed which presented a total spectral width of 37g and hyperfine splitting constant of anβ 13 7372g ahβ 8 769g ahγ 1 5805g this result strongly supported the generation of ch3c o oo in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system 3 3 2 insight into the significance of mn species in co1 1mn1 9o4 as previously discussed co1 1mn1 9o4 exhibited a much stronger activity in paa activation than that of co3o4 implying a significant role of mn species in boosting the catalytic activity of co1 1mn1 9o4 whereas such enhancement effect by introducing mn was not observed when mn3o4 and co3o4 was physically mixed fig s17 thus some synergistic effect between co and mn in the co1 1mn1 9o4 fundamentally enhanced the catalytic reactivity the electrochemical studies were conducted to elucidate the role of mn in paa activation by the co1 1mn1 9o4 fig 5 a displays the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 when introducing mn into co3o4 the active area of cv curve obviously increased indicating the enhanced conductivity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 in addition a strong reduction peak at ca 0 49 v was detected in the cv curve of co1 1mn1 9o4 underlining the greater reductive capability of co1 1mn1 9o4 than that of co3o4 thus the addition of mn enhanced the conductivity and reductive capability which was expected to boost the paa activation via an electron transfer pathway furthermore co1 1mn1 9o4 possessed a lower charge transfer resistance value compared to co3o4 fig 5b which implied that the electron transfer in co1 1mn1 9o4 was more favorable dft calculations were further conducted to compare the adsorption energies of paa on co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 as listed in table s7 the adsorption energy of paa onto co1 1mn1 9o4 was larger than that onto co3o4 0 78 ev vs 0 64 ev reflecting the stronger adsorption of co1 1mn1 9o4 than co3o4 for paa hence mn species doped into co3o4 enhanced the adsorption capacity of paa facilitating the further catalytic reactions the intermediate structures and the corresponding energy profiles of paa adsorption onto the co sites with and without the introduction of mn atoms represented as red and blue routes respectively are shown in fig 5c firstly paa binds to the co sites state ii with the single o atom attaching to the c atom on oo bond and releases energy subsequently the absorbed paa is activated forming the intermediate of co oocch3 state iii with an energy barrier of 0 68 and 1 82 ev with and without mn incorporation respectively then co site is recovered after releasing ch3coo moiety state iv and energy hence the barrier height of the reaction on co sites should be 0 68 and 1 82 ev respectively for the cases with and without mn incorporation the much lower energy barrier for paa activated by co1 1mn1 9o4 than co3o4 demonstrating that the activation of paa on co sites with mn binding is more thermodynamically favorable the partial density of states pdos of co atom in co3o4 and co1 1mn1 9o4 are calculated and displayed in fig 5d it was observed that the 3d orbital electrons of the co atoms in co3o4 are dispersed and situated below the fermi level at 5 37 3 98 and 1 06 ev respectively while those of the co atoms in co1 1mn1 9o4 are mainly clustered at 0 90 ev hence the introduction of mn in co3o4 enables more intensive and closer fermi level electrons in co atoms which suggested that the catalytic reactivities of co active sites in co1 1mn1 9o4 are stronger than that in co3o4 to interact with paa zhang et al 2020 furthermore the existence of mn pulls the unoccupied antibonding orbitals mostly above the fermi level of co atoms below the fermi level fig 5d increasing the number of empty orbitals that can be occupied by electrons in co 3d orbitals and thus facilitating the chemisorption of paa zhang et al 2020 this result was supported by the larger adsorption energy of paa on co1 1mn1 9o4 than that on co3o4 table s7 3 3 3 overall reaction mechanism generally the homogeneous catalytic process also played a role in metal based heterogeneous systems for peroxides activation due to the leached metal ions to make it clear the leaching of metal ions including co2 and mn2 after reaction in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process were determined under near neutral conditions solution ph decreased from 7 0 to 6 2 after reaction merely 0 002 and 0 12 mg l of co2 and mn2 was detected after reaction fig s18 respectively which was much lower than the wastewater discharge standard of 1 0 mg co l and 2 0 mg mn l china we further evaluated the possible contribution of the leached co2 and mn2 on smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process the maximum concentrations of co2 0 002 mg l and mn2 0 12 mg l in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system were selected for co2 paa and mn2 paa processes respectively as fig s19 shows the aqueous co2 was effective in paa activation for smx degradation and approximately 48 of smx was removed within 7 min while mn2 was less powerful to activate paa with merely 18 of smx degraded noting that the contents of metal ions were gradually increased during the reaction the contributions of the leached metal ions in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process for smx degradation should be much lower than that observed in fig s19 therefore the heterogeneous activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 for paa played a dominant role for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to give insight into the reaction mechanism the variations in chemical composition of the co1 1mn1 9o4 after reaction was further investigated the xps spectra showed that the atomic ratio of co ii slightly decreased from 53 to 51 after the paa activation fig 6 a implying the electron transfer to paa to predominantly produce ch3c o o or little oh meanwhile the atomic ratio of mn ii and mn iii decreased from 41 33 to 39 and 32 respectively which is mainly due to the reaction with co iii accompanied by the regeneration of co ii fig 6b besides the slight variations of the co and mn species after reaction suggested that co ii co iii and mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ redox cycles might be involved in paa activation as shown in the o1s xps spectra fig 6c the peaks with the binding energy at 530 1 and 531 2 ev were ascribed to the lattice o in metal oxygen bonds and m oh hydroxyl group m denoted as co or mn respectively yang et al 2022 the relative content of the m oh group in co1 1mn1 9o4 increased from 41 to 52 after reacting with paa which suggested the formation of m oh group on catalyst surface during the reaction the reduction in the fraction of the lattice o was likely to be ascribed to the reduction of m iii to m ii the charge density analysis of paa adsorbed on co1 1mn1 9o4 was further performed to demonstrate the electron transfer process during the reaction the result proves the significant electron transfer between the paa molecule and co mn centers fig s20 to be specific it showed that co and mn atoms suffered a marked charge depletion accompanied by the charge accumulation of o in paa molecule supporting the electron transfer from co mn centers to paa on the other hand the charge lost around the h atom of paa was also observed indicating the electron transfer from paa to co mn centers as a result ch3c o oo was produced as a primary radical based on the above discussed results a primary activation mechanism towards heterogeneous catalysis of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 was proposed fig 6d co and mn ions as lewis sites can react with desorbed h2o molecules to form co oh and mn oh species on the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 respectively the catalytic reaction is triggered through the absorption of paa onto the active metal hydroxyl sites via hydrogen bonding followed by the production of ch3c o o or minor oh through the electron transfer from these metal hydroxyl sites i e co ii oh mn ii oh and mn iii oh to paa molecules eqs 9 12 the formed ch3c o o can further attack paa to generate ch3c o oo which is confirmed to perform as the dominant oxidizing species for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process ch3c o oo can also be directly generated via the electron transfer from paa to the metal hydroxyl species in high valent state as mn 1 oh accompanied by the regeneration of mn oh eqs 13 15 furthermore co iii co ii has a standard reduction potential of e0 1 81 v which is higher than that of mn iv mn iii 0 15 v and mn iii mn ii 1 51 v li et al 2018 yao et al 2015 hence the recovery of co ii from the reduction of co iii with mn ii and mn iii was thermodynamically favorable eqs 16 17 suggesting that the introduce of mn facilitated the regeneration of co ii on the surface of co1 1mn1 9o4 9 c o i i o h c h 3 c o o o h c o i i i o h c h 3 c o o o h 10 c o i i o h c h 3 c o o o h c

abundantly in water bodies can affect the performance of aops to different degrees ha showed an adverse impact on the degradation of smx fig s21a which was primarily attributed to the scavenging of oh and r o by ha fig s21b text s10 the existence of hco3 co3 2 also inhibited the smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process fig s21 and further study discovered that the inhibition was caused by the formed unreactive cobalt bicarbonate complexes and the quenching effect on radical species fig s21d fig s22 text s10 besides the degradation of smx was not affected by ca2 but was slightly facilitated by mg2 at high concentration 50 mm fig s23 as fig 7 a shows low concentration 1 mm of cl showed negligible effect on smx degradation which might be due to the low reactivity of cl with oh and r o ao et al 2020 whereas it was surprising to observe that high levels of cl markedly enhanced the reactivity of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process and the promotion for smx degradation became much stronger with higher cl concentration more specifically the reaction rate of smx was significantly increased from 0 56 to 1 37 min 1 with the addition of cl increased from 10 mm to 500 mm fig 7a insert 3 5 mechanism of chloride ions promoted smx degradation to further reveal the role of cl the impact of cl on the removal of smx with the presence of paa or co1 1mn1 9o4 individually was investigated as fig s24a shows the oxidation of smx by paa was hardly affected in the presence of 1 500 mm cl and similarly the adsorption of smx by co1 1mn1 9o4 was unaffected at different levels of cl fig s24b furthermore the decomposition of paa in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system was barely influenced by cl fig s25 suggesting that the reaction between paa and co1 1mn1 9o4 was not facilitated in the presence of cl these results implied that the enhancement of smx degradation after dosing cl in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was more likely to be attributed to the generation of reactive cl species as well known oh is readily quenched by halogen ions such as cl with the generation of cl eqs 18 19 which possesses strong oxidizing power with a standard redox potential of 2 4 v cl cl and can effectively oxidize those contaminants with electron rich moieties ji et al 2022 although the reaction between cl and r o formed in paa based aops is still largely unreported it is highly probable to occur due to the strong oxidizing power of r o especially ch3c o o and ch3c o oo the produced cl might further react with cl to generate cl2 via eq 20 it was reported that the degradation rate constants of cl and cl2 for some organic contaminants were in the same order of magnitude as oh lei et al 2019 furthermore hocl cl2 could further be produced through the attack of cl on cl2 eq 21 and the intermolecular reaction of cl2 eq 22 the generated cl2 hclo with strong oxidation capacity can effectively degrade refractory organic pollutants such as smx murrieta et al 2020 as reported hocl cl2 could be generated in large amounts under high cl surroundings in fenton like catalytic system and played a much stronger role than other radicals due to its much longer lifetime peng et al 2021a

of oh r o cl cl2 and hclo to identify the dominant oxidative species in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system a series of quenching experiments were further conducted tba can effectively quench oh and cl metz et al 2022 and meoh can rapidly eliminate oh r o cl and cl2 but has no effect on hclo cai et al 2017 lei et al 2019 as shown in fig 7b the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system was not affected after dosing tba reflecting the negligible role of oh and cl moreover slight inhibition of smx degradation was observed with the dosage of meoh in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system suggesting the insignificant contribution of r o and cl2 which is largely distinct from the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system that was dominated by r o hence it is expected that the activation of paa with co1 1mn1 9o4 might be converted to a nonradical mediated process under high levels of cl and the generated hclo is likely to become the main oxidant to make it clear nh4 was used as a specific hclo scavenger because nh4 is hard to be oxidized by free radicals such as oh and cl but can rapidly react with hclo to form nh2cl with weak oxidative power wang et al 2011 as fig 7b shows once dosing 10 mm nh4 into the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa cl system the degradation of smx was significantly inhibited and complete inhibition was observed with nh4 concentration further increased to 100 mm the results strongly evidenced that hclo should be the primary reactive species accounting for smx degradation in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa system with high levels of cl to explore the pathway for hclo formation the detection of hclo in different systems were conducted by using rhodamine b hydrazine rbh as a fluorescence probe of hocl luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 the result showed that no fluorescence peak was observed in the chlorine free system while the hocl fluorescence peak at 578 nm appeared in the paa cl system fig 7c indicating the formation of hocl through the direct reaction of paa with chloride more significantly the fluorescence intensity was significantly enhanced in paa cl system after dosing co1 1mn1 9o4 indicating that the reaction between cl and paa can be further induced with the activation of co1 1mn1 9o4 to form more hocl for smx degradation as previously discussed the radical chain reactions of oh and r o with cl could be the significant pathway for generating hclo to make it clear the effects of cl on the generation of oh and r o were explored fig 8 a shows that the presence of cl 500 mm obviously reduced the intensity of dippmo oh ch3c o o ch3 and ch3o2 adducts in the esr spectrum and similar diminish for dmpoch3c o oo adduct was also observed after introducing high level of cl fig 8b these results demonstrated that the production of oh and r o was inhibited by cl while the decomposition of paa was not affected fig s25 hence the decrease of oh and r o should be attributed to the chain reactions with cl resulting to the generation of hocl considering the high tolerance of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process to cl this novel oxidation technology is promising to be applied in high salinity wastewater treatment to further assess its application potential the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was operated in the simulated mariculture wastewater a typical high salt content wastewater contaminated with antibiotics as shown in fig 7d the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was remarkably enhanced under the simulated seawater sample to be specific complete degradation of smx was achieved within 3 min in the simulated seawater and the k obs value significantly increased from 0 36 to 1 74 min 1 compared to that in the deionized water fig 7d insert which might be attributed to the abundance of cl and mg2 in seawater this phenomenon indicated that the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process was particularly promising to be applied in high salinity wastewater e g mariculture wastewater treatment 3 6 degradation pathways and toxicity evolution of smx five transformation products tps including tp 269 tp 283 tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 were identified after reaction with the ion fragments and proposed structures shown in figs s26 s31 as reported electron transfer and h abstraction were the main reaction in ch3c o oo driven organic pollutant degradation du et al 2022 kim et al 2020 from fig s32 the aromatic ring nh2 group and s n bond of smx possessed deeper highest occupied molecular orbital homo level implying that these sites are prone to losing electrons the possible transformation pathway of smx was proposed in fig 9 firstly the nh2 group of smx is vulnerable to ch3c o oo and can be oxidized to no2 group resulting in the generation of nitro smx tp 283 pathway i furthermore the coupling reaction also occurred during the degradation of smx in the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process pathway ii followed by the production of three dimeric products tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 besides the hydroxylation of the aniline ring was observed and generated hydroxyl smx derivative tp 269 which was attributed to the generation of aniline radicals via hydrogen atom abstraction by ch3c o oo pathway iii the h abstraction by ch3c o oo on the nh2 group of smx could also generate n centered radicals e n step et al 1991 and the hydroxyl smx further underwent coupling reaction with these n centered radicals forming azo smx tp 502 and hydroxylated azo smx tp 518 the acute and chronic toxicities of smx and its tps were predicted via the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar program qian et al 2021 according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals the degree of toxicity can be classified into four levels table s8 as shown in table s9 and fig 10 the acute and chronic toxicities towards fish and green algae of the tps were comparable to that of smx while most tps exhibited significantly lower acute and chronic toxicities to daphnid than smx to be specific the overall toxicity of the hydroxylation product of the aniline ring i e tp269 in this case was slightly lower than that of the parent compound in addition the oxidation of nh2 to no2 group generating tp283 and the coupling reaction producing dimeric products as tp 347 tp 502 and tp 518 significantly reduced the acute and chronic toxicities of smx to daphnid the effect of smx treatment by the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process on its antibacterial activity was investigated via the e coli growth test δod600 was applied to reflect the growth of e coli in the presence of untreated and treated smx samples as observed in fig s33 the treatment of smx with the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process slightly facilitated the growth of e coli directly indicating that the toxicity of smx reduced after the treatment 3 7 reusability and stability tests of co1 1mn1 9o4 the cycle experiment was performed to evaluate the reusability of co1 1mn1 9o4 towards paa activation as shown in fig s34 the degradation of smx maintained above 95 after 7 min reaction in the first three cycles and slightly decreased to 88 after four cycle runs the phenomenon suggested a remarkable reusability of co1 1mn1 9o4 in paa activation which is of great benefit for promoting the application in the future the slight decrease of smx degradation might be attributed to the loss of active sites by metal leaching and the formed unreactive metal organic complex on catalyst surface the xrd analysis for co1 1mn1 9o4 before and after use were conducted to assess the stability of the catalyst no distinct change was observed in the xrd patterns of fresh and used co1 1mn1 9o4 fig s35 indicating that co1 1mn1 9o4 was highly stable in term of the crystal structure during paa activation the negligible leaching of metal ions also supported the high stability of co1 1mn1 9o4 during reaction fig s18 4 conclusions herein the prepared co1 1mn1 9o4 material displayed remarkable catalytic activity in the paa activation for smx degradation under near neutral environment outperforming the most heterogeneous activators reported so far ch3c o oo as a powerful r o was proved to be the primary reactive species responsible for smx oxidation results indicated that mn species greatly facilitated the catalytic activity of co sites by accelerating electron transfer lowering energy barrier and optimizing the distribution of bonding and antibonding states on co 3d orbitals the degradation of smx was significantly promoted under dense cl environment due to the generation of large amounts of hclo through the conversion of radicals oh and r o with cl and hence the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process exhibited even stronger activity in simulated mariculture wastewater in terms of smx degradation implying the great potential of the co1 1mn1 9o4 paa process in high salinity wastewater remediation

15241,the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args in freshwater reservoirs threatens ecosystem security and human health and has attracted increasing attention a series of recent research articles on args provides a unique opportunity for data driven discoveries in this emerging field here we mined data from a total of 290 samples from 60 reservoirs worldwide with a data driven framework dd developed to discover geographical distribution influencing factors and pollution hotspots of args in freshwater reservoirs most data came from asia and europe where nine classes of args were most frequently detected in reservoirs with multi drug resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes prevailing factors driving distribution of reservoir args differed between reservoir waters and sediments and interactions among these factors had linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on the explanatory power of arg distribution during the cold season small sized reservoir waters rich in organic carbon mobile genetic elements mges and antibiotics had a higher pollution potential of args during the spring drought sediments in large reservoirs located in densely populated areas were more conducive to dissemination of args due to their richness in antibiotics and mges thus distribution pattern of arg pollution hotspots in reservoir waters and sediments varies greatly depending on the differences of internal and external factors from the one health perspective this widespread contamination of freshwater reservoirs by args we discovered through the dd framework should be a push to promote integrated research across regions and disciplines especially the human food chain ecosystem interface needs an improved understanding of arg contamination mechanisms and targeted monitoring and evaluation systems should be developed to maintain all ecosystem services in freshwater reservoirs as well as to safeguard human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes freshwater reservoirs distribution influencing factors pollution hotspots data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args across species and regions has caused antibiotic resistance to become globalized posing a serious threat to public health and food safety antibiotics reach aquatic ecosystems through sewage discharge surface runoff and aquaculture contributing to the rise and proliferation of args within antibiotic resistant bacteria hendriksen et al 2019 schar et al 2021 with an increase in human activities exposure of aquatic ecosystems to args usually increases zhu et al 2017 as the one health approach emphasizes arg pollution endangers health and wellbeing of humans animals and the environment and accelerated globalization is driving the transfer among those three chatterjee et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 given that the occurrence of args and antibiotic resistance may increase virulence pathogenicity and mortality berendonk et al 2015 the world health organization who views their global dissemination as a crisis that threatens global public health security and the core of modern medicine who 2015 reservoirs artificial freshwater storage systems constructed by damming to secure water needs have potential to become important dissemination channels for args from environment to humans bacterial communities in waters can perpetuate args originating from sewage marti et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 even advanced water treatment technologies have difficulty in completely removing args and limiting their occurrence and abundance garner et al 2018 reservoirs usually receive both rain river and wastewater for drinking water storage facilitating args transfer from environment to aquatic organisms and humans martínez 2008 args could eventually contribute to emergence of antibiotic resistance in humans through food chain or direct contact thus enabling cross species gene sharing pehrsson et al 2016 van boeckel et al 2015 thus freshwater reservoirs play an important role in the propagation of args and controlling their increase of resistance can help reduce human mortality rate and medical burden to some extent given the potential threat of args to multiple ecosystem services in reservoirs research on occurrence and mechanisms driving the spread of args is crucial to ensure water security and health faced with the current situation of widespread arg contamination researchers have paid increasing attention to what factors mainly influence the distribution of args because antibiotics exert persistent selection pressure on microorganisms an association between antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance has been discovered in reservoirs chen et al 2019 several biotic and abiotic factors such as presence of bacterial communities metals e g cu and zn mobile genetic elements mges and seasonal variation are considered to be key influencing factors of args variability in reservoirs as well as directly interact with args to some extent bengtsson palme et al 2018 laffite et al 2020 while exploring distribution and factors influencing args in individual reservoirs has clear benefits for water safety management of the reservoir itself a comprehensive scientific understanding of issue on a large scale perspective regarding args is yet to be developed on one hand reservoirs are frequently disturbed by anthropogenic activities making external drivers of args diverse and complex on the other hand it is unclear how internal factors such as storage capacity reservoir level and reservoir catchment area affect how args respond to external driving forces therefore to uncover the mechanisms impacting args in a global context suitable statistical tools are needed to effectively identify factors driving the distribution of args in reservoirs in general and assess their importance in today s information and data era a rapidly growing number of studies focusing their research on args in reservoirs presents a unique opportunity to integrate those data gain generalized insights into arg distribution and identify research gaps in order to elevate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing distribution of arg pollutants we integrated published data to construct a data driven framework dd the framework is a data intensive scientific discovery oriented approach that integrates multidimensional raw data collected through data extraction data grouping multivariate statistics to determine current status of reservoir arg pollution identify problems with existing studies and provide guiding recommendations for management of reservoir arg pollution dd framework was applied to address three questions i global occurrence and distribution of args in reservoirs ii factors driving the distribution of args in reservoirs and their interactions and iii pollution hotspots or potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs based on the application of our dd framework we gained important new insights into mechanisms impacting args in reservoirs and their pollution hotspots in our study we are highlighting key issues and challenges surrounding research of arg pollution 2 data driven framework to investigate distribution and influencing mechanisms of args in reservoirs we constructed and applied a data driven framework dd for data extraction and grouping as well as a statistical analysis fig 1 first we retrieved literature screened publications according to inclusion criteria and extracted data from them acquired data were then grouped and analyzed using statistical methods to integrate results of existing studies our analyses and interpretations provide an intercontinental scale perspective on the pollution profile of args in reservoirs due to limited availability of data this research is a preliminary basis for follow up studies and analyses to further refine and adjust our findings 2 1 data extraction and grouping to obtain data on reservoir args we conducted a search of the web of science and scopus database in december 2021 using the following subject terms topic reservoir or dam and antibiotic resistance gene or antibiotic resistance bacteria or antibiotic resistant bacteria or antimicrobial resistance or antibiotic resistome the scope of the subject search included the title abstract and keyword list inclusion criteria consisted of research articles published in english and a total of 2020 articles were retrieved among these articles we selected the ones that measured abundance of args in reservoirs since we were interested in variability of geographical distribution of arg abundance we contacted authors and requested additional data for studies that only provided averages of arg abundance for multiple reservoirs or did not explicitly provide information on sample area if the relevant information was still not available we excluded those studies based on these screening criteria 26 peer reviewed papers published between 2010 and 2021 met the requirements these 26 studies primarily investigated args in reservoirs and sediments 25 articles while only 1 article was conducted on organisms such as fish fig 1a thus 25 studies reporting args in reservoir waters and sediments were found to provide comparable data and ultimately considered from the 25 eligible studies we extracted i sampling information such as sampling time and sampling site coordinates ii reservoir characteristics including reservoir level storage capacity reservoir catchment area and hydraulic residence time iii data for args mobile genetic elements mges and antibiotic concentrations as well as common physicochemical parameters and iv quantifying methods of args the range of data collection included text tables and figures where raw data were presented in the form of graphs data were extracted using getdata graph digitizer v2 26 error analysis of data extraction see text s1 abundance of args from the same sampling site at different sampling times was considered a different data point units of arg abundance were expressed as copies 16s rrna relative abundance gene copy number of args was divided by 16s rrna or copies ml absolute abundance in study that provided absolute abundance of args in reservoirs two main quantitative methods high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr and qpcr were used ht qpcr is a thermocyclic polymerase chain reaction with high temperature denaturation low temperature denaturation and moderate temperature extension by adding fluorescent groups to pcr reaction system of template dna su et al 2015 eventually a total of 290 data points from 60 reservoirs consisting of 210 water samples and 80 sediment samples were extracted from 25 studies some of the collected parameters e g bacterial communities and nutrient concentrations were not included in this dataset because only a small number of studies reported it thus in addition to arg abundance our dataset consists of 13 explanatory variables including geographic location of sampling sites reservoir characteristics seasonal variation quantitative methods used to measure args mge abundance and physicochemical indicators table s1 2 2 statistical analysis geodetector is a new statistical tool for the detection of impact mechanisms as well as risk hotspots wang et al 2010 compared to traditional correlation and regression analysis geodetector model identifies driving forces of multiple independent variables xi on the dependent variable y and their interactions and does not require linear assumptions guo et al 2021a we used the geodetector model to quantify effects of the 13 explanatory variables geographic location seasonal variation reservoir characteristics physicochemical parameters and quantitative methods on args and their interactions fig 1b a detailed description of geodetector models is in text s2 of the 13 independent variables those identified as having a significant effect q value p 0 05 by geodetector model s factor detector were further analyzed to assess driving patterns of differences in the distribution of args linear or binomial regressions were chosen to fit two variable on the r2 and akaike information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 combined with the results from the geodetector model s risk detector we assessed subregions with the highest potential risk or patterns favoring distributions of args because absolute abundance reflects the true number and variance of args in the sample we used absolute abundance of args when available for factor detection and fitted regression analyses 150 water samples and 46 sediment samples analysis of similarities anosim was used to test whether environmental media water vs sediment cause differences in arg distribution distance decay models were applied to analyze effects of geographical distance on similarity of args 1 bray curtis and degree of decay mantel tests were used to verify whether distance decay relationship was significant if correlations existed they were fitted using the vegan and soda packages in r software 3 results 3 1 distribution and occurrence of args in reservoirs arg abundance data were collected from a total of 290 samples in 60 reservoirs covering 4 geographical regions from 40 cities fig 2 a c to our knowledge no studies investigating arg pollution have been conducted in reservoirs located in africa north america or oceania environmental media studies were mainly reservoir waters 22 articles and sediments 10 articles with less attention paid to aquatic organisms such as fish 1 article the number of args detected per sample varied widely ranging from 3 to 436 these dominant args fell mainly into 9 classes including args against aminoglycosides β lactams chloramphenicol macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb sulfonamides tetracyclines vancomycin multi drug resistance and others the highest frequency of detection in water samples was for β lactams and mlsb resistance genes 155 210 both 74 followed by tetracyclines 72 sulfonamides 69 aminoglycosides 64 and multi resistance genes 53 the highest frequency of detection in sediments was for tetracyclines 50 80 63 followed by sulfonamides 48 and mlsb resistance genes 44 abundance and most common classes of dominant args varied among reservoirs fig 2b d absolute abundance of args detected in waters of the três marias reservoir tm brazil south america and hadera reservoir re israel middle east were low with 2 77 102 copies ml and 7 40 102 copies ml respectively sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes were the main classes of args in these two reservoirs in the european region bs fig 2b absolute abundance of args detected in reservoir waters ranged from 2 21 104 to 8 94 104 copies ml average value 3 30 104 copies ml with the highest abundance being tetracycline resistance genes followed by args for sulfonamides and β lactams in the asian region the average absolute abundance of args in reservoir waters was one order of magnitude higher than in europe with 7 77 105 copies ml range 1 93 103 1 56 107 copies ml multi drug resistance genes were most abundant in asian reservoir waters followed by aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes consistent with the absolute abundance results relative abundance of args in european reservoir waters was low with multi drug resistance and aminoglycoside resistance genes being the dominant args fig s1a relative abundance of all 9 arg classes detected in reservoir waters was low average value 0 02 copies 16s rrna variation of arg abundance in reservoir sediments was greater figs 2d and s1b than the variation in water the lowest abundance of args was detected in três marias reservoir 8 97 102 copies g brazil south america followed by lake brêt in europe 1 13 106 copies g switzerland the highest levels of args were detected in reservoir sediments from asia with an average abundance of 2 37 108 copies g reservoir sediment samples had a high proportion of sulfonamide and β lactam resistance genes in addition mlsb resistant genes were also detected in high abundances in asian reservoir sediments fig 2d average relative abundance of all 9 arg classes was 0 01 copies 16s rrna fig s1b 3 2 factors and their interactions as shown by the analysis of similarity anosim environmental media influenced composition of reservoir args r 0 62 p 0 01 and differences in composition of args were significantly higher in waters than in sediments fig s2 similarity of arg composition followed a distance decay relationship in both reservoir waters and sediments mantel test waters r 0 39 p 0 01 sediments r 0 50 p 0 01 similarity of arg composition in waters exhibited a higher decay rate with increasing geographical distance compared to sediments slope 1 99 10 5 1 14 10 5 fig 3 a b thirteen potential variables such as geographic location seasonal variation physicochemical parameters reservoir characteristics and quantitative methods of args influenced differences in distribution of arg concentration fig s2a among them mobile genetic elements mges explanatory power 87 reservoir capacity 55 water temperature 54 and reservoir catchment area 47 were the dominant factors influencing distribution of args in reservoir waters antibiotic concentration 17 was secondary in explaining variation in the distribution of args effects of quantitative methods qpcr versus ht qpcr and total organic carbon toc on the variation of args in waters were significant but weak with both being below 10 in terms of factor interactions some single factors such as geographical location and seasonal variation had no significant impact on args but these parameters often showed significant two factor linear or non linear enhancement effects with other parameters for example interactions of longitude water temperature the interaction of factors x1 and x2 is represented by x1 x2 longitude latitude mges seasonal variation mges seasonal variation reservoir catchment area and seasonal variation water temperature all explained over 83 of differences in distribution of args in reservoir sediments factors that dominated differences in distribution of args were reservoir characteristics geographical location and physicochemical parameters fig s2b among them reservoir catchment area reservoir level and longitude had the strongest influence on args with all explaining over 69 of the variation toc ph and reservoir capacity were also important factors driving differences in distribution of args followed by mges and antibiotic concentrations 26 except for effects of antibiotic concentration and quantification method on args which were independent of each other all other factors together increased the explanatory power of differences in arg distribution in particular two factor linear enhancement effects of seasonal variation reservoir level seasonal variation reservoir catchment area longitude seasonal variation longitude toc reservoir level toc and reservoir catchment area toc and a non linear enhancement effect of mges toc all drove up the explanatory power to above 80 3 3 models and pollution paradigm relationships between dominant factors and arg abundance were further quantified using regression analyses abundance of reservoir args showed a linear relationship with both mges and antibiotic concentrations fig 3c g similarly abundance of args in sediments increased with increasing longitude fig s3 however reservoir characteristics reservoir capacity reservoir level and reservoir catchment area were not simply linearly related to args fig 3d f absolute abundance of args in waters and sediments increased and then decreased with reservoir capacity while the relationship with reservoir catchment area had an opposite trend showing a decrease followed by an increase abundance of args in waters increased with toc while abundance of args in sediments showed a decreasing and then increasing trend with toc and ph fig s3 in addition water temperature an important factor influencing arg abundance distribution in waters did not show a significant linear relationship with arg abundance indicating that the relationship was complex and needs to be further identified in conjunction with results from risk detection pollution hotspot of args in reservoirs was assessed by combining regression analyses and geodetector model s risk detection fig 4 reservoirs with small storage capacity and catchment areas were more likely to have enriched args in waters while larger reservoir capacity and low reservoir levels indicated high susceptibility to arg contamination in reservoir sediments additionally low temperature seasons winter or early spring contributed to enrichment of args in reservoir waters while dry spring seasons predispose reservoirs to arg contamination in sediments especially when situated close to coastal cities in china densely populated areas reservoir waters rich in toc and with higher abundance of antibiotics and mges had relatively higher abundance of args similarly the higher the residual antibiotic and mges in sediments the more abundant were args 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variations and factors influencing difference of args typical classes and abundance of widespread args in reservoirs varied across continents and reservoirs different levels of arg contamination have been detected in reservoirs from 4 geographic regions to date the amount of args detected varied across reservoirs by 1 2 orders of magnitude and their classes varied as well in south america and the middle east abundance of args detected in reservoir waters was low and was dominated by sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes in contrast probably due to higher population densities and prevalent over consumption of antibiotics klein et al 2018 reservoir waters in asia were the most contaminated by args with concentrations an order of magnitude higher than in europe multi drug aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes were the most abundant types in asia s reservoirs reflecting concentrations in water arg contamination in sediments was also relatively low in south america followed by the european region while asia was the most polluted in some reservoir sediments e g danjiangkou dj dominant gene classes were not consistent with those in waters this might indicate that common antibiotics used in various geographical regions have changed over time and the sediment serves as a memory of past activities anderson 1995 or that certain antibiotics have a higher affinity to the sediment löffler et al 2005 and thus the corresponding args are also preferably found there in general geographical differences in arg contamination may be attributed to local differences in antibiotic production and consumption patterns and disposal levels gilchrist et al 2007 van boeckel et al 2014 this suggests that contamination in reservoir args requires place based control strategies to improve water supply and ecological security to date no data have been collected on occurrence of args in reservoir waters and sediments from africa north america and oceania which should become a research priority in those regions similarity of args decreased with increasing geographical distance this suggests that reservoirs that are closely located or have overlapping pollution sources are more likely to transmit or receive the same args distance decay rates reflect limitations in dispersal of microbial communities martiny et al 2006 however similarity of args in waters exhibited a higher rate of geographical distance decay than sediments i e microbes in sediments and their args are capable of dispersing more readily than microbes in waters we believe this can be attributed to long term sediment deposition and accumulation and microbial communities in sediments are relatively stable iniesto et al 2021 which is conducive to dispersal of args over time because of limited data available for monitoring args in reservoir sediments future studies will need more information to verify this interesting speculation factors driving distribution of arg abundance in reservoirs and the degree of their influence differed in water versus sediment variations in distribution of args in reservoir waters were significantly higher than those in sediments which may be attributed to the more complex and diverse sources of args in reservoir waters with frequent anthropogenic disturbances mges reservoir capacity water temperature and reservoir catchment area were important factors influencing arg distribution in waters while in sediments reservoir characteristics reservoir catchment area reservoir level and reservoir capacity longitude toc and ph were the most important influencing factors reservoir characteristics influenced arg distribution most strongly however relationships between reservoir and arg abundance in reservoirs was not simply linear this suggests that characteristics of arg distribution in reservoirs were the result of a multifactorial interaction in other words args that enter reservoirs can interact with multiple abiotic reservoir internal factors in complex manners which in turn expose reservoir ecosystems to new and poorly understood stressors with the possibility of unintended repercussion for biota and humans furthermore interactions between factors often resulted in linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on the distribution of args fig 4 such interactions occurred namely between similar parameters e g antibiotics toc which are both chemical parameters and also between vastly different variables e g seasonal variation reservoir capacity although args in reservoirs did not show significant seasonal variation seasonal factors together with reservoir characteristics and mges had a strong influence on args of reservoir waters likewise seasonal variation together with reservoir level and longitude explain a significant amount of variation of args in reservoir sediments joint effects of seasonal variation and reservoir characteristics on args distribution may originate from the fact that reservoir dynamic capacity or water levels fluctuate seasonally due to drawing of water resources from the reservoir during scheduled time periods soundharajan et al 2016 this dynamic process may enhance influence on reservoir arg composition and their occurrence in addition to the influence of reservoir characteristics we also found that the seasonal factors coupled with longitudinal gradient variables reflecting demographic and economic differences act together in the distribution of args in sediments sediment samples were mainly collected from reservoirs in china and the region shows a trend of increasing population and economy with increasing longitude from west to east zhang et al 2022 the enhanced interaction of seasonal variation longitude suggests certain seasonal variation in arg pollution in densely populated areas to understand the actual influence mechanisms integrated monitoring of reservoir characteristic parameters and consideration of the combined effects of multiple variables on reservoir args are required that needs to go hand in hand with a more uniform utilization of methodologies for example compared to ht qpcr methods the amount and classes of args detected in waters by qpcr methods were limited yang et al 2018 dominant args were analyzed in this study and overall quantifying method of args had small effects on the total abundance of dominant args both high abundance of antibiotics and mges contributed to increased args under the selective pressure of antibiotics a large quantity of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be transferred through mges and thus disseminate args zainab et al 2020 hence rational use of antibiotics proper disposal of antibiotic waste and wastewater and widespread public education about antibiotic drugs will help mitigate contamination from args chung and brooks 2019 4 2 pollution hotspots of args we identified potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs which provides a base for more focused future investigations of arg pollution management in reservoirs as both the demand for reservoir ecosystem services and the risk of arg pollution increase it is essential to improve our understanding of arg contamination and be able to tailor pollution mitigation strategies according to characteristics of specific reservoirs thus we strived to clarify pollution potential of args in reservoir waters and sediments by considering effects of multiple risk factors such as spatiotemporal heterogeneity as well as reservoir characteristics args in reservoir waters and sediments had different pollution hotspots fig 4 in waters small sized reservoirs rich in organic carbon were more vulnerable to contamination by args especially during the cold season seasonal anthropogenic activities and climate effects such as increased use of antibiotic treatments to treat or prevent human and livestock diseases in the cold season may lead to more serious contamination of args during that time suda et al 2014 abundance of organic carbon in reservoir waters can lead to an increase in args because args can bind to organic carbon and protect them from degradation by nucleases demaneche et al 2001 alternatively higher organic carbon favors the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and these bacteria are more likely to carry intracellular args tuomanen et al 1986 thus for small sized reservoirs with high organic carbon content and during the cold season the pollution discharge has to be closely monitored and potentially mitigated especially when intending to use the water for human consumption this can be particularly critical since the storage capacity is small and the amount of available drinking water may be limited args in sediments were dependent on geographical location and overall concentration of antibiotics in sediments in densely populated areas production of args in large reservoir sediments may be induced by more widespread antibiotic production and consumption a spring drought reduces the dilution effect on contaminants and a relative increase in the level of contaminants such as antibiotics in reservoir sediments can generate higher selective pressure on microorganisms dang et al 2020 therefore it should be possible to respond to arg contamination by regulating the water level of reservoirs during this time period pollution risk assessments regarding reservoirs args are limited consequently it is necessary to construct a risk assessment system across ecosystems especially pollution hotspots reservoirs are critical water supply infrastructures and contamination of reservoirs by args not only damages the structure and function of reservoir ecosystems but also threatens human health through direct and food chain transmission to build a risk assessment system for args it is necessary to work together at the international level to promote global and interdisciplinary communication and assistance at the human food chain ecosystem interface to address general public health as advocated for by the one health perspective zhu et al 2019 this will improve both awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance risks and make an implementation of best management practices to maintain multiple reservoir services possible in addition this would support the goals laid out in the un sustainable development goals united nations 2015 to secure basic physical needs and health benefits of humanity overall considering the potential for transfer of args from the environment over organismal hosts to become human pathogens we believe that the hierarchical risk system as proposed by martinez et al 2015 would work well to distinguish between public health risks of different classes of args 4 3 challenges and prospects we used a data driven framework dd to integrate the distribution influencing factors and pollution hotspots of args from a total of 60 reservoirs in 4 geographic regions this allowed us to identify spatiotemporal ranges and indicator variables that need to be monitored as a priority for reservoir arg studies in the future contamination potential of args in water was higher in small sized reservoirs rich in organic carbon and antibiotics especially during the cold season unlike reservoir waters sediments of large reservoirs in densely populated areas had a higher potential of arg contamination due to the residual and accumulation of antibiotics over a long time pollution hotspots of args were identified at the intercontinental scale which helps to systematically set priorities for pollution monitoring and control of reservoir args in areas with high risk of contaminants although the currently limited amount of data is not sufficient to reflect the full picture of arg contamination in reservoirs the dd framework may be further improved to assess reservoirs arg contamination and its pollution hotspots as more and more detailed data become available therefore the constructed dd framework can be upgraded and optimized for data grouping and statistics in future as additional data continue to emerge this provides a heuristic and replicable research paradigm for data intensive scientific discoveries of environmental pollutants in terms of systematic methodology dataset integrity and scientific discoveries large scale investigations of args in reservoirs are currently underway but there is still a need to expand the scope of arg studies in reservoirs and obtain more field monitoring data in order to establish a complete international monitoring system in particular africa north america south america and oceania have not yet or rarely been screened for occurrence of args in their reservoirs in these regions no or too few sample data have been obtained to provide a comprehensive understanding of their arg pollution status in asia and europe pollution of reservoir args is of higher concern and more closely monitored in at least some reservoirs however considering the increasing antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance aus der beek et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 as well as the important ecosystem service of reservoirs it is necessary to expand the geographical scope of reservoir investigations globally additionally the problem of arg pollution might be unknowingly greatly exacerbated in some less developed regions or countries with poor water quality and sanitation larsson and flach 2022 which are typical hotspots for antibiotic resistance transmission nadimpalli et al 2020 nevertheless args do not respect national boundaries and tend to propagate rapidly around the world hooban et al 2020 okeke and edelman 2001 consequently challenges regarding arg contamination of reservoirs require a broad international and interdisciplinary collaboration to include a global perspective this will not only improve understanding of general antibiotic resistance but also help less developed countries to focus on most important monitoring efforts and effective treatment of arg contamination thus building a reliable and complete monitoring system with minimal resources in view of the various influencing factors of arg pollution in reservoirs we should incorporate the identified important variable into a standardized data monitoring system to comprehensively assess pollution mechanisms of args in other words future pollution surveys of args in individual reservoirs need to consider the effects and interactions of sampling location reservoir characteristics seasonal variation and physicochemical parameters including water temperature ph antibiotic concentration and toc furthermore bacterial communities facilitate args transfer shin et al 2020 and effects of their biomass and community composition on args in reservoirs deserve further investigation in our study we did not focus on impacts of bacterial communities on args in reservoirs due to the limited data availability in addition to some well documented selective pressures on antibiotics some non antibiotic pollutants such as metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and disinfectants often contribute to proliferation and dissemination of args ostman et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 interestingly reservoirs serve as important storage sites for nutrients guo et al 2021b and algal blooms triggered by excess nutrients may instead inhibit proliferation of args guo et al 2018 thus it is necessary to integrate these biotic and abiotic parameters for future pollution monitoring for args in reservoirs in order to make accurate judgments about parameters driving args ecological and health risks of antibiotic resistance in reservoirs need to consider not only contamination of args within reservoir ecosystems but also determine risks posed by transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria through food chains and by resistance of human commensal microorganisms args have the ability to disseminate through water supply systems to a healthy gut flora of humans zhu et al 2018 yet it is unclear whether reservoirs args and antibiotic resistant bacteria actually have a substantial impact on human exposure to arg contamination to monitor and assess risks data on antibiotic use and residues arg types of human accessibility antibiotic resistant bacteria in faces and gut and args need to be collected to integrate environmental biological and human transmission pathways and risk potential huijbers et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 only by fully understanding the emergence spread and evolution of args within the reservoir food chain human pathway can we start to grasp the overall impact of args on health risk and take appropriate actions hernando amado et al 2019 advancement of gene sequencing technologies offers the possibility to track and quantify transmission risk of this complex pathway and to find key control points for dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria koch et al 2017 this will not only allow for a better understanding of antibiotic resistance transmission mechanisms on the cross ecosystem scale but also improve contamination monitoring and risk control strategies for args applying quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra methods the health risks posed by exposure to args and antibiotic resistant bacteria in reservoir ecosystems can be determined amarasiri et al 2019 standardized sampling methods and detailed records location reservoir characteristics sampling effort weather and climate condition etc would improve study comparability and reduce uncertainties in findings during the extraction of literature data we found that some studies lacked information such as specific coordinates of sampling sites sampling depth sampling time and reservoir characteristics moreover units of arg measurements were not uniform results of this study demonstrated that these parameters were influential on how args were generally distributed in addition parameters such as nutrients and land use were important drivers of changes in arg distribution pei et al 2006 subirats et al 2018 in particular information on args and antibiotic discharges from point diffuse sources such as wastewater treatment plants pharmaceutical plants and livestock farms around reservoirs is key to identify occurrence and potential sources of arg compositions li et al 2020 but relevant background information is less commonly mentioned relationships between certain environmental factors and args in reservoirs could not be quantified and assessed because often these important parameters were ignored or too many data were missing the lack of study comparability reduces data availability and ultimately results accuracy therefore standardized reporting and detailed documentation of these parameters would allow for more usable data to support analyzes of arg pollution in future we strongly encourage international data sharing to improve data availability accessibility and large scale reproducible analyses this would promote convergence of disciplines while simultaneously expanding and directing important research foci of args the existing arg classes in reservoirs are diverse and complex and costs of monitoring them qualitatively and quantitatively are large however at the same time the amount of data information generated would be substantial furthermore we then could merge all of the data on an information sharing platform and exchange data supporting the science without borders vision laursen 2018 this large data resource would greatly facilitate and increase information we could extract from these data access and reanalysis of shared raw data by scientists across disciplines and borders could greatly extend the depth of ongoing research and reduce the amount of research repetition required prince et al 2020 tedersoo et al 2021 however data requests to authors were often ignored or eventually remained unanswered during our collection of arg data presumably caused by cultural technical policy and privacy barriers construction of reservoir arg datasets is not the ultimate goal of this study our focus is to find a way to integrate cross sectoral and interdisciplinary knowledge that can lead to data intensive scientific discoveries therefore steps to encourage data sharing and accessibility should be prioritized during policy management and technology development alexander et al 2019 li et al 2021 this would enable statisticians and scientists with the ability and willingness to analyze large data sets to more effectively address needs to conduct research and manage args pollution across a large scale in reservoirs as well as similar issues in summary the six priorities for future research to better understand pollution and potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs on a global scale are i prioritizing controlling reservoirs with high pollution potential ii expanding global monitoring of reservoirs arg pollution and building effective monitoring systems based on international interdisciplinary collaboration iii incorporating identified determining factors into data collection of args in reservoirs data monitoring systems iv quantifying risks from args through reservoir food chain human

a data driven framework was constructed to systematically demonstrate distribution influencing factors and potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs at the intercontinental scale in the conducted studies dominant classes and abundance of args detected varied among continents and reservoirs the most args contaminated reservoirs were located in asia factors affecting difference in occurrence and distribution such as reservoir characteristics and physicochemical indicators often interacted and showed linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on args both in waters and sediments

15241,the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args in freshwater reservoirs threatens ecosystem security and human health and has attracted increasing attention a series of recent research articles on args provides a unique opportunity for data driven discoveries in this emerging field here we mined data from a total of 290 samples from 60 reservoirs worldwide with a data driven framework dd developed to discover geographical distribution influencing factors and pollution hotspots of args in freshwater reservoirs most data came from asia and europe where nine classes of args were most frequently detected in reservoirs with multi drug resistance and sulfonamide resistance genes prevailing factors driving distribution of reservoir args differed between reservoir waters and sediments and interactions among these factors had linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on the explanatory power of arg distribution during the cold season small sized reservoir waters rich in organic carbon mobile genetic elements mges and antibiotics had a higher pollution potential of args during the spring drought sediments in large reservoirs located in densely populated areas were more conducive to dissemination of args due to their richness in antibiotics and mges thus distribution pattern of arg pollution hotspots in reservoir waters and sediments varies greatly depending on the differences of internal and external factors from the one health perspective this widespread contamination of freshwater reservoirs by args we discovered through the dd framework should be a push to promote integrated research across regions and disciplines especially the human food chain ecosystem interface needs an improved understanding of arg contamination mechanisms and targeted monitoring and evaluation systems should be developed to maintain all ecosystem services in freshwater reservoirs as well as to safeguard human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes freshwater reservoirs distribution influencing factors pollution hotspots data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args across species and regions has caused antibiotic resistance to become globalized posing a serious threat to public health and food safety antibiotics reach aquatic ecosystems through sewage discharge surface runoff and aquaculture contributing to the rise and proliferation of args within antibiotic resistant bacteria hendriksen et al 2019 schar et al 2021 with an increase in human activities exposure of aquatic ecosystems to args usually increases zhu et al 2017 as the one health approach emphasizes arg pollution endangers health and wellbeing of humans animals and the environment and accelerated globalization is driving the transfer among those three chatterjee et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 given that the occurrence of args and antibiotic resistance may increase virulence pathogenicity and mortality berendonk et al 2015 the world health organization who views their global dissemination as a crisis that threatens global public health security and the core of modern medicine who 2015 reservoirs artificial freshwater storage systems constructed by damming to secure water needs have potential to become important dissemination channels for args from environment to humans bacterial communities in waters can perpetuate args originating from sewage marti et al 2014 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 even advanced water treatment technologies have difficulty in completely removing args and limiting their occurrence and abundance garner et al 2018 reservoirs usually receive both rain river and wastewater for drinking water storage facilitating args transfer from environment to aquatic organisms and humans martínez 2008 args could eventually contribute to emergence of antibiotic resistance in humans through food chain or direct contact thus enabling cross species gene sharing pehrsson et al 2016 van boeckel et al 2015 thus freshwater reservoirs play an important role in the propagation of args and controlling their increase of resistance can help reduce human mortality rate and medical burden to some extent given the potential threat of args to multiple ecosystem services in reservoirs research on occurrence and mechanisms driving the spread of args is crucial to ensure water security and health faced with the current situation of widespread arg contamination researchers have paid increasing attention to what factors mainly influence the distribution of args because antibiotics exert persistent selection pressure on microorganisms an association between antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance has been discovered in reservoirs chen et al 2019 several biotic and abiotic factors such as presence of bacterial communities metals e g cu and zn mobile genetic elements mges and seasonal variation are considered to be key influencing factors of args variability in reservoirs as well as directly interact with args to some extent bengtsson palme et al 2018 laffite et al 2020 while exploring distribution and factors influencing args in individual reservoirs has clear benefits for water safety management of the reservoir itself a comprehensive scientific understanding of issue on a large scale perspective regarding args is yet to be developed on one hand reservoirs are frequently disturbed by anthropogenic activities making external drivers of args diverse and complex on the other hand it is unclear how internal factors such as storage capacity reservoir level and reservoir catchment area affect how args respond to external driving forces therefore to uncover the mechanisms impacting args in a global context suitable statistical tools are needed to effectively identify factors driving the distribution of args in reservoirs in general and assess their importance in today s information and data era a rapidly growing number of studies focusing their research on args in reservoirs presents a unique opportunity to integrate those data gain generalized insights into arg distribution and identify research gaps in order to elevate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing distribution of arg pollutants we integrated published data to construct a data driven framework dd the framework is a data intensive scientific discovery oriented approach that integrates multidimensional raw data collected through data extraction data grouping multivariate statistics to determine current status of reservoir arg pollution identify problems with existing studies and provide guiding recommendations for management of reservoir arg pollution dd framework was applied to address three questions i global occurrence and distribution of args in reservoirs ii factors driving the distribution of args in reservoirs and their interactions and iii pollution hotspots or potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs based on the application of our dd framework we gained important new insights into mechanisms impacting args in reservoirs and their pollution hotspots in our study we are highlighting key issues and challenges surrounding research of arg pollution 2 data driven framework to investigate distribution and influencing mechanisms of args in reservoirs we constructed and applied a data driven framework dd for data extraction and grouping as well as a statistical analysis fig 1 first we retrieved literature screened publications according to inclusion criteria and extracted data from them acquired data were then grouped and analyzed using statistical methods to integrate results of existing studies our analyses and interpretations provide an intercontinental scale perspective on the pollution profile of args in reservoirs due to limited availability of data this research is a preliminary basis for follow up studies and analyses to further refine and adjust our findings 2 1 data extraction and grouping to obtain data on reservoir args we conducted a search of the web of science and scopus database in december 2021 using the following subject terms topic reservoir or dam and antibiotic resistance gene or antibiotic resistance bacteria or antibiotic resistant bacteria or antimicrobial resistance or antibiotic resistome the scope of the subject search included the title abstract and keyword list inclusion criteria consisted of research articles published in english and a total of 2020 articles were retrieved among these articles we selected the ones that measured abundance of args in reservoirs since we were interested in variability of geographical distribution of arg abundance we contacted authors and requested additional data for studies that only provided averages of arg abundance for multiple reservoirs or did not explicitly provide information on sample area if the relevant information was still not available we excluded those studies based on these screening criteria 26 peer reviewed papers published between 2010 and 2021 met the requirements these 26 studies primarily investigated args in reservoirs and sediments 25 articles while only 1 article was conducted on organisms such as fish fig 1a thus 25 studies reporting args in reservoir waters and sediments were found to provide comparable data and ultimately considered from the 25 eligible studies we extracted i sampling information such as sampling time and sampling site coordinates ii reservoir characteristics including reservoir level storage capacity reservoir catchment area and hydraulic residence time iii data for args mobile genetic elements mges and antibiotic concentrations as well as common physicochemical parameters and iv quantifying methods of args the range of data collection included text tables and figures where raw data were presented in the form of graphs data were extracted using getdata graph digitizer v2 26 error analysis of data extraction see text s1 abundance of args from the same sampling site at different sampling times was considered a different data point units of arg abundance were expressed as copies 16s rrna relative abundance gene copy number of args was divided by 16s rrna or copies ml absolute abundance in study that provided absolute abundance of args in reservoirs two main quantitative methods high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr and qpcr were used ht qpcr is a thermocyclic polymerase chain reaction with high temperature denaturation low temperature denaturation and moderate temperature extension by adding fluorescent groups to pcr reaction system of template dna su et al 2015 eventually a total of 290 data points from 60 reservoirs consisting of 210 water samples and 80 sediment samples were extracted from 25 studies some of the collected parameters e g bacterial communities and nutrient concentrations were not included in this dataset because only a small number of studies reported it thus in addition to arg abundance our dataset consists of 13 explanatory variables including geographic location of sampling sites reservoir characteristics seasonal variation quantitative methods used to measure args mge abundance and physicochemical indicators table s1 2 2 statistical analysis geodetector is a new statistical tool for the detection of impact mechanisms as well as risk hotspots wang et al 2010 compared to traditional correlation and regression analysis geodetector model identifies driving forces of multiple independent variables xi on the dependent variable y and their interactions and does not require linear assumptions guo et al 2021a we used the geodetector model to quantify effects of the 13 explanatory variables geographic location seasonal variation reservoir characteristics physicochemical parameters and quantitative methods on args and their interactions fig 1b a detailed description of geodetector models is in text s2 of the 13 independent variables those identified as having a significant effect q value p 0 05 by geodetector model s factor detector were further analyzed to assess driving patterns of differences in the distribution of args linear or binomial regressions were chosen to fit two variable on the r2 and akaike information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 combined with the results from the geodetector model s risk detector we assessed subregions with the highest potential risk or patterns favoring distributions of args because absolute abundance reflects the true number and variance of args in the sample we used absolute abundance of args when available for factor detection and fitted regression analyses 150 water samples and 46 sediment samples analysis of similarities anosim was used to test whether environmental media water vs sediment cause differences in arg distribution distance decay models were applied to analyze effects of geographical distance on similarity of args 1 bray curtis and degree of decay mantel tests were used to verify whether distance decay relationship was significant if correlations existed they were fitted using the vegan and soda packages in r software 3 results 3 1 distribution and occurrence of args in reservoirs arg abundance data were collected from a total of 290 samples in 60 reservoirs covering 4 geographical regions from 40 cities fig 2 a c to our knowledge no studies investigating arg pollution have been conducted in reservoirs located in africa north america or oceania environmental media studies were mainly reservoir waters 22 articles and sediments 10 articles with less attention paid to aquatic organisms such as fish 1 article the number of args detected per sample varied widely ranging from 3 to 436 these dominant args fell mainly into 9 classes including args against aminoglycosides β lactams chloramphenicol macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb sulfonamides tetracyclines vancomycin multi drug resistance and others the highest frequency of detection in water samples was for β lactams and mlsb resistance genes 155 210 both 74 followed by tetracyclines 72 sulfonamides 69 aminoglycosides 64 and multi resistance genes 53 the highest frequency of detection in sediments was for tetracyclines 50 80 63 followed by sulfonamides 48 and mlsb resistance genes 44 abundance and most common classes of dominant args varied among reservoirs fig 2b d absolute abundance of args detected in waters of the três marias reservoir tm brazil south america and hadera reservoir re israel middle east were low with 2 77 102 copies ml and 7 40 102 copies ml respectively sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes were the main classes of args in these two reservoirs in the european region bs fig 2b absolute abundance of args detected in reservoir waters ranged from 2 21 104 to 8 94 104 copies ml average value 3 30 104 copies ml with the highest abundance being tetracycline resistance genes followed by args for sulfonamides and β lactams in the asian region the average absolute abundance of args in reservoir waters was one order of magnitude higher than in europe with 7 77 105 copies ml range 1 93 103 1 56 107 copies ml multi drug resistance genes were most abundant in asian reservoir waters followed by aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes consistent with the absolute abundance results relative abundance of args in european reservoir waters was low with multi drug resistance and aminoglycoside resistance genes being the dominant args fig s1a relative abundance of all 9 arg classes detected in reservoir waters was low average value 0 02 copies 16s rrna variation of arg abundance in reservoir sediments was greater figs 2d and s1b than the variation in water the lowest abundance of args was detected in três marias reservoir 8 97 102 copies g brazil south america followed by lake brêt in europe 1 13 106 copies g switzerland the highest levels of args were detected in reservoir sediments from asia with an average abundance of 2 37 108 copies g reservoir sediment samples had a high proportion of sulfonamide and β lactam resistance genes in addition mlsb resistant genes were also detected in high abundances in asian reservoir sediments fig 2d average relative abundance of all 9 arg classes was 0 01 copies 16s rrna fig s1b 3 2 factors and their interactions as shown by the analysis of similarity anosim environmental media influenced composition of reservoir args r 0 62 p 0 01 and differences in composition of args were significantly higher in waters than in sediments fig s2 similarity of arg composition followed a distance decay relationship in both reservoir waters and sediments mantel test waters r 0 39 p 0 01 sediments r 0 50 p 0 01 similarity of arg composition in waters exhibited a higher decay rate with increasing geographical distance compared to sediments slope 1 99 10 5 1 14 10 5 fig 3 a b thirteen potential variables such as geographic location seasonal variation physicochemical parameters reservoir characteristics and quantitative methods of args influenced differences in distribution of arg concentration fig s2a among them mobile genetic elements mges explanatory power 87 reservoir capacity 55 water temperature 54 and reservoir catchment area 47 were the dominant factors influencing distribution of args in reservoir waters antibiotic concentration 17 was secondary in explaining variation in the distribution of args effects of quantitative methods qpcr versus ht qpcr and total organic carbon toc on the variation of args in waters were significant but weak with both being below 10 in terms of factor interactions some single factors such as geographical location and seasonal variation had no significant impact on args but these parameters often showed significant two factor linear or non linear enhancement effects with other parameters for example interactions of longitude water temperature the interaction of factors x1 and x2 is represented by x1 x2 longitude latitude mges seasonal variation mges seasonal variation reservoir catchment area and seasonal variation water temperature all explained over 83 of differences in distribution of args in reservoir sediments factors that dominated differences in distribution of args were reservoir characteristics geographical location and physicochemical parameters fig s2b among them reservoir catchment area reservoir level and longitude had the strongest influence on args with all explaining over 69 of the variation toc ph and reservoir capacity were also important factors driving differences in distribution of args followed by mges and antibiotic concentrations 26 except for effects of antibiotic concentration and quantification method on args which were independent of each other all other factors together increased the explanatory power of differences in arg distribution in particular two factor linear enhancement effects of seasonal variation reservoir level seasonal variation reservoir catchment area longitude seasonal variation longitude toc reservoir level toc and reservoir catchment area toc and a non linear enhancement effect of mges toc all drove up the explanatory power to above 80 3 3 models and pollution paradigm relationships between dominant factors and arg abundance were further quantified using regression analyses abundance of reservoir args showed a linear relationship with both mges and antibiotic concentrations fig 3c g similarly abundance of args in sediments increased with increasing longitude fig s3 however reservoir characteristics reservoir capacity reservoir level and reservoir catchment area were not simply linearly related to args fig 3d f absolute abundance of args in waters and sediments increased and then decreased with reservoir capacity while the relationship with reservoir catchment area had an opposite trend showing a decrease followed by an increase abundance of args in waters increased with toc while abundance of args in sediments showed a decreasing and then increasing trend with toc and ph fig s3 in addition water temperature an important factor influencing arg abundance distribution in waters did not show a significant linear relationship with arg abundance indicating that the relationship was complex and needs to be further identified in conjunction with results from risk detection pollution hotspot of args in reservoirs was assessed by combining regression analyses and geodetector model s risk detection fig 4 reservoirs with small storage capacity and catchment areas were more likely to have enriched args in waters while larger reservoir capacity and low reservoir levels indicated high susceptibility to arg contamination in reservoir sediments additionally low temperature seasons winter or early spring contributed to enrichment of args in reservoir waters while dry spring seasons predispose reservoirs to arg contamination in sediments especially when situated close to coastal cities in china densely populated areas reservoir waters rich in toc and with higher abundance of antibiotics and mges had relatively higher abundance of args similarly the higher the residual antibiotic and mges in sediments the more abundant were args 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variations and factors influencing difference of args typical classes and abundance of widespread args in reservoirs varied across continents and reservoirs different levels of arg contamination have been detected in reservoirs from 4 geographic regions to date the amount of args detected varied across reservoirs by 1 2 orders of magnitude and their classes varied as well in south america and the middle east abundance of args detected in reservoir waters was low and was dominated by sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes in contrast probably due to higher population densities and prevalent over consumption of antibiotics klein et al 2018 reservoir waters in asia were the most contaminated by args with concentrations an order of magnitude higher than in europe multi drug aminoglycoside and sulfonamide resistance genes were the most abundant types in asia s reservoirs reflecting concentrations in water arg contamination in sediments was also relatively low in south america followed by the european region while asia was the most polluted in some reservoir sediments e g danjiangkou dj dominant gene classes were not consistent with those in waters this might indicate that common antibiotics used in various geographical regions have changed over time and the sediment serves as a memory of past activities anderson 1995 or that certain antibiotics have a higher affinity to the sediment löffler et al 2005 and thus the corresponding args are also preferably found there in general geographical differences in arg contamination may be attributed to local differences in antibiotic production and consumption patterns and disposal levels gilchrist et al 2007 van boeckel et al 2014 this suggests that contamination in reservoir args requires place based control strategies to improve water supply and ecological security to date no data have been collected on occurrence of args in reservoir waters and sediments from africa north america and oceania which should become a research priority in those regions similarity of args decreased with increasing geographical distance this suggests that reservoirs that are closely located or have overlapping pollution sources are more likely to transmit or receive the same args distance decay rates reflect limitations in dispersal of microbial communities martiny et al 2006 however similarity of args in waters exhibited a higher rate of geographical distance decay than sediments i e microbes in sediments and their args are capable of dispersing more readily than microbes in waters we believe this can be attributed to long term sediment deposition and accumulation and microbial communities in sediments are relatively stable iniesto et al 2021 which is conducive to dispersal of args over time because of limited data available for monitoring args in reservoir sediments future studies will need more information to verify this interesting speculation factors driving distribution of arg abundance in reservoirs and the degree of their influence differed in water versus sediment variations in distribution of args in reservoir waters were significantly higher than those in sediments which may be attributed to the more complex and diverse sources of args in reservoir waters with frequent anthropogenic disturbances mges reservoir capacity water temperature and reservoir catchment area were important factors influencing arg distribution in waters while in sediments reservoir characteristics reservoir catchment area reservoir level and reservoir capacity longitude toc and ph were the most important influencing factors reservoir characteristics influenced arg distribution most strongly however relationships between reservoir and arg abundance in reservoirs was not simply linear this suggests that characteristics of arg distribution in reservoirs were the result of a multifactorial interaction in other words args that enter reservoirs can interact with multiple abiotic reservoir internal factors in complex manners which in turn expose reservoir ecosystems to new and poorly understood stressors with the possibility of unintended repercussion for biota and humans furthermore interactions between factors often resulted in linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on the distribution of args fig 4 such interactions occurred namely between similar parameters e g antibiotics toc which are both chemical parameters and also between vastly different variables e g seasonal variation reservoir capacity although args in reservoirs did not show significant seasonal variation seasonal factors together with reservoir characteristics and mges had a strong influence on args of reservoir waters likewise seasonal variation together with reservoir level and longitude explain a significant amount of variation of args in reservoir sediments joint effects of seasonal variation and reservoir characteristics on args distribution may originate from the fact that reservoir dynamic capacity or water levels fluctuate seasonally due to drawing of water resources from the reservoir during scheduled time periods soundharajan et al 2016 this dynamic process may enhance influence on reservoir arg composition and their occurrence in addition to the influence of reservoir characteristics we also found that the seasonal factors coupled with longitudinal gradient variables reflecting demographic and economic differences act together in the distribution of args in sediments sediment samples were mainly collected from reservoirs in china and the region shows a trend of increasing population and economy with increasing longitude from west to east zhang et al 2022 the enhanced interaction of seasonal variation longitude suggests certain seasonal variation in arg pollution in densely populated areas to understand the actual influence mechanisms integrated monitoring of reservoir characteristic parameters and consideration of the combined effects of multiple variables on reservoir args are required that needs to go hand in hand with a more uniform utilization of methodologies for example compared to ht qpcr methods the amount and classes of args detected in waters by qpcr methods were limited yang et al 2018 dominant args were analyzed in this study and overall quantifying method of args had small effects on the total abundance of dominant args both high abundance of antibiotics and mges contributed to increased args under the selective pressure of antibiotics a large quantity of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be transferred through mges and thus disseminate args zainab et al 2020 hence rational use of antibiotics proper disposal of antibiotic waste and wastewater and widespread public education about antibiotic drugs will help mitigate contamination from args chung and brooks 2019 4 2 pollution hotspots of args we identified potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs which provides a base for more focused future investigations of arg pollution management in reservoirs as both the demand for reservoir ecosystem services and the risk of arg pollution increase it is essential to improve our understanding of arg contamination and be able to tailor pollution mitigation strategies according to characteristics of specific reservoirs thus we strived to clarify pollution potential of args in reservoir waters and sediments by considering effects of multiple risk factors such as spatiotemporal heterogeneity as well as reservoir characteristics args in reservoir waters and sediments had different pollution hotspots fig 4 in waters small sized reservoirs rich in organic carbon were more vulnerable to contamination by args especially during the cold season seasonal anthropogenic activities and climate effects such as increased use of antibiotic treatments to treat or prevent human and livestock diseases in the cold season may lead to more serious contamination of args during that time suda et al 2014 abundance of organic carbon in reservoir waters can lead to an increase in args because args can bind to organic carbon and protect them from degradation by nucleases demaneche et al 2001 alternatively higher organic carbon favors the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and these bacteria are more likely to carry intracellular args tuomanen et al 1986 thus for small sized reservoirs with high organic carbon content and during the cold season the pollution discharge has to be closely monitored and potentially mitigated especially when intending to use the water for human consumption this can be particularly critical since the storage capacity is small and the amount of available drinking water may be limited args in sediments were dependent on geographical location and overall concentration of antibiotics in sediments in densely populated areas production of args in large reservoir sediments may be induced by more widespread antibiotic production and consumption a spring drought reduces the dilution effect on contaminants and a relative increase in the level of contaminants such as antibiotics in reservoir sediments can generate higher selective pressure on microorganisms dang et al 2020 therefore it should be possible to respond to arg contamination by regulating the water level of reservoirs during this time period pollution risk assessments regarding reservoirs args are limited consequently it is necessary to construct a risk assessment system across ecosystems especially pollution hotspots reservoirs are critical water supply infrastructures and contamination of reservoirs by args not only damages the structure and function of reservoir ecosystems but also threatens human health through direct and food chain transmission to build a risk assessment system for args it is necessary to work together at the international level to promote global and interdisciplinary communication and assistance at the human food chain ecosystem interface to address general public health as advocated for by the one health perspective zhu et al 2019 this will improve both awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance risks and make an implementation of best management practices to maintain multiple reservoir services possible in addition this would support the goals laid out in the un sustainable development goals united nations 2015 to secure basic physical needs and health benefits of humanity overall considering the potential for transfer of args from the environment over organismal hosts to become human pathogens we believe that the hierarchical risk system as proposed by martinez et al 2015 would work well to distinguish between public health risks of different classes of args 4 3 challenges and prospects we used a data driven framework dd to integrate the distribution influencing factors and pollution hotspots of args from a total of 60 reservoirs in 4 geographic regions this allowed us to identify spatiotemporal ranges and indicator variables that need to be monitored as a priority for reservoir arg studies in the future contamination potential of args in water was higher in small sized reservoirs rich in organic carbon and antibiotics especially during the cold season unlike reservoir waters sediments of large reservoirs in densely populated areas had a higher potential of arg contamination due to the residual and accumulation of antibiotics over a long time pollution hotspots of args were identified at the intercontinental scale which helps to systematically set priorities for pollution monitoring and control of reservoir args in areas with high risk of contaminants although the currently limited amount of data is not sufficient to reflect the full picture of arg contamination in reservoirs the dd framework may be further improved to assess reservoirs arg contamination and its pollution hotspots as more and more detailed data become available therefore the constructed dd framework can be upgraded and optimized for data grouping and statistics in future as additional data continue to emerge this provides a heuristic and replicable research paradigm for data intensive scientific discoveries of environmental pollutants in terms of systematic methodology dataset integrity and scientific discoveries large scale investigations of args in reservoirs are currently underway but there is still a need to expand the scope of arg studies in reservoirs and obtain more field monitoring data in order to establish a complete international monitoring system in particular africa north america south america and oceania have not yet or rarely been screened for occurrence of args in their reservoirs in these regions no or too few sample data have been obtained to provide a comprehensive understanding of their arg pollution status in asia and europe pollution of reservoir args is of higher concern and more closely monitored in at least some reservoirs however considering the increasing antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance aus der beek et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 as well as the important ecosystem service of reservoirs it is necessary to expand the geographical scope of reservoir investigations globally additionally the problem of arg pollution might be unknowingly greatly exacerbated in some less developed regions or countries with poor water quality and sanitation larsson and flach 2022 which are typical hotspots for antibiotic resistance transmission nadimpalli et al 2020 nevertheless args do not respect national boundaries and tend to propagate rapidly around the world hooban et al 2020 okeke and edelman 2001 consequently challenges regarding arg contamination of reservoirs require a broad international and interdisciplinary collaboration to include a global perspective this will not only improve understanding of general antibiotic resistance but also help less developed countries to focus on most important monitoring efforts and effective treatment of arg contamination thus building a reliable and complete monitoring system with minimal resources in view of the various influencing factors of arg pollution in reservoirs we should incorporate the identified important variable into a standardized data monitoring system to comprehensively assess pollution mechanisms of args in other words future pollution surveys of args in individual reservoirs need to consider the effects and interactions of sampling location reservoir characteristics seasonal variation and physicochemical parameters including water temperature ph antibiotic concentration and toc furthermore bacterial communities facilitate args transfer shin et al 2020 and effects of their biomass and community composition on args in reservoirs deserve further investigation in our study we did not focus on impacts of bacterial communities on args in reservoirs due to the limited data availability in addition to some well documented selective pressures on antibiotics some non antibiotic pollutants such as metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and disinfectants often contribute to proliferation and dissemination of args ostman et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 interestingly reservoirs serve as important storage sites for nutrients guo et al 2021b and algal blooms triggered by excess nutrients may instead inhibit proliferation of args guo et al 2018 thus it is necessary to integrate these biotic and abiotic parameters for future pollution monitoring for args in reservoirs in order to make accurate judgments about parameters driving args ecological and health risks of antibiotic resistance in reservoirs need to consider not only contamination of args within reservoir ecosystems but also determine risks posed by transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria through food chains and by resistance of human commensal microorganisms args have the ability to disseminate through water supply systems to a healthy gut flora of humans zhu et al 2018 yet it is unclear whether reservoirs args and antibiotic resistant bacteria actually have a substantial impact on human exposure to arg contamination to monitor and assess risks data on antibiotic use and residues arg types of human accessibility antibiotic resistant bacteria in faces and gut and args need to be collected to integrate environmental biological and human transmission pathways and risk potential huijbers et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 only by fully understanding the emergence spread and evolution of args within the reservoir food chain human pathway can we start to grasp the overall impact of args on health risk and take appropriate actions hernando amado et al 2019 advancement of gene sequencing technologies offers the possibility to track and quantify transmission risk of this complex pathway and to find key control points for dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria koch et al 2017 this will not only allow for a better understanding of antibiotic resistance transmission mechanisms on the cross ecosystem scale but also improve contamination monitoring and risk control strategies for args applying quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra methods the health risks posed by exposure to args and antibiotic resistant bacteria in reservoir ecosystems can be determined amarasiri et al 2019 standardized sampling methods and detailed records location reservoir characteristics sampling effort weather and climate condition etc would improve study comparability and reduce uncertainties in findings during the extraction of literature data we found that some studies lacked information such as specific coordinates of sampling sites sampling depth sampling time and reservoir characteristics moreover units of arg measurements were not uniform results of this study demonstrated that these parameters were influential on how args were generally distributed in addition parameters such as nutrients and land use were important drivers of changes in arg distribution pei et al 2006 subirats et al 2018 in particular information on args and antibiotic discharges from point diffuse sources such as wastewater treatment plants pharmaceutical plants and livestock farms around reservoirs is key to identify occurrence and potential sources of arg compositions li et al 2020 but relevant background information is less commonly mentioned relationships between certain environmental factors and args in reservoirs could not be quantified and assessed because often these important parameters were ignored or too many data were missing the lack of study comparability reduces data availability and ultimately results accuracy therefore standardized reporting and detailed documentation of these parameters would allow for more usable data to support analyzes of arg pollution in future we strongly encourage international data sharing to improve data availability accessibility and large scale reproducible analyses this would promote convergence of disciplines while simultaneously expanding and directing important research foci of args the existing arg classes in reservoirs are diverse and complex and costs of monitoring them qualitatively and quantitatively are large however at the same time the amount of data information generated would be substantial furthermore we then could merge all of the data on an information sharing platform and exchange data supporting the science without borders vision laursen 2018 this large data resource would greatly facilitate and increase information we could extract from these data access and reanalysis of shared raw data by scientists across disciplines and borders could greatly extend the depth of ongoing research and reduce the amount of research repetition required prince et al 2020 tedersoo et al 2021 however data requests to authors were often ignored or eventually remained unanswered during our collection of arg data presumably caused by cultural technical policy and privacy barriers construction of reservoir arg datasets is not the ultimate goal of this study our focus is to find a way to integrate cross sectoral and interdisciplinary knowledge that can lead to data intensive scientific discoveries therefore steps to encourage data sharing and accessibility should be prioritized during policy management and technology development alexander et al 2019 li et al 2021 this would enable statisticians and scientists with the ability and willingness to analyze large data sets to more effectively address needs to conduct research and manage args pollution across a large scale in reservoirs as well as similar issues in summary the six priorities for future research to better understand pollution and potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs on a global scale are i prioritizing controlling reservoirs with high pollution potential ii expanding global monitoring of reservoirs arg pollution and building effective monitoring systems based on international interdisciplinary collaboration iii incorporating identified determining factors into data collection of args in reservoirs data monitoring systems iv quantifying risks from args through reservoir food chain human pathways v standardizing sampling methods and detailing survey report formats vi encouraging data sharing improving data accessibility and providing of a finer resolution of existing data 5 conclusion a data driven framework was constructed to systematically demonstrate distribution influencing factors and potentially contaminated areas of args in reservoirs at the intercontinental scale in the conducted studies dominant classes and abundance of args detected varied among continents and reservoirs the most args contaminated reservoirs were located in asia factors affecting difference in occurrence and distribution such as reservoir characteristics and physicochemical indicators often interacted and showed linear or nonlinear enhancement effects on args both in waters and sediments small sized reservoir waters rich in organic carbon and antibiotics have a higher pollution potential of args during the cold season while larger reservoir sediments contribute to accumulation and dissemination of args during spring drought considering the multiple ecosystem service functions reservoirs provide and the health hazards of arg contamination and their antibiotic resistance future research needs to include expanded monitoring and prioritize control of args in high risk areas the most important influencing factors of args in reservoirs should be incorporated into routine monitoring of reservoirs particular emphasis needs to be on integrated risk of arg transmission via the reservoir ecosystem food chain human pathway furthermore detailed information such as sampling

15242,ca accumulibacter was the predominant microorganism relative fish bio abundance of 67 5 in a lab scale sequential batch reactor that accomplished enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr while using glucose and acetate as the carbon sources 1 1 cod based ratio both organic compounds were completely anaerobically consumed the reactor s performance in terms of p c ratio phosphorous release and uptake and overall kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were on the high end of the reported spectrum for ebpr systems 100 9 3 net mg phosphate removal per mg cod consumed when using glucose and acetate in a 1 1 ratio the batch tests showed that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter can putatively utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to biologically remove phosphate cod p mg mg removal ratio of 100 6 3 when using only glucose thus this research proposes that ca accumulibacter directly anaerobically stored the fed glucose primarily as glycogen by utilizing the atp provided via the hydrolysis of poly p and secondarily as pha by balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage alternative hypotheses are also discussed the reported findings could challenge the conventional theories of glucose assimilation by ca accumulibacter and can be of significance for the biological removal of phosphorus from wastewaters with high contents of fermentable compounds or low vfas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal wastewater with fermentable compounds glucose metabolism ca accumulibacter data availability all data have been deposited in the eawag research data institutional repository https opendata eawag ch and are publicly available 1 introduction the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process is widely used worldwide in municipal wastewater treatment plants it is considered an efficient and more environmentally sustainable alternative to chemical methods coats et al 2018 oehmen et al 2007 theoretically in an ebpr activated sludge system phosphorus is removed by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos paos utilize phosphorus beyond their growth requirements via the storing and hydrolysis of their polyphosphate pool thus achieving greater phosphorus incorporation into the sludge mass barnard 1975 comeau et al 1986 to promote the growth of paos the activated sludge system needs to be designed and operated so that these organisms growth is stimulated and the consequent increase in phosphorus removal is achieved barnard et al 2017 however like with any microbiological process the ebpr performance is prone to be affected by environmental and operational factors such as a significant presence of detrimental microorganisms and physicochemical properties of the wastewater gebremariam et al 2012 lópez vázquez et al 2008 regarding the latter glucose utilization has been a recurrent topic in the literature on the ebpr process cech and hartman 1993 1990 jeon and park 2000 santos et al 1999 wang et al 2002 however the attested consensus seemed that paos could not anaerobically uptake fermentable compounds such as glucose while promoting the subsequent phosphate uptake on the contrary the presence of glucose in ebpr systems was associated with an instability of the performance as in the studies of cech and hartman 1990 1993 and begum and batista 2012 different explanations were hypothesized for the deterioration of the ebpr performance when glucose is used in the first place glucose was believed to select for an undesirable group of microorganisms initially called g bacteria and later renamed glycogen accumulating organisms gaos capable of accumulating glycogen without the release of phosphate mino et al 1998 these organisms were believed to excessively proliferate under these circumstances thus outcompeting the paos considering the fact that according to the metabolic model of mino et al 1994 they are able to produce phas with a positive net balance of one mole of atp wang et al 2010 on the other hand the deterioration of the ebpr performance due to the absence of fermentative flanking species was first suggested by randall et al 1997 this study reported that paos could not ferment glucose during the anaerobic stage hence if the sugar was not pre fermented by non poly p microorganisms an ebpr failure could be expected these two explanations correlate to the reports of kong et al 2004 and nguyen et al 2011 which inferred the canonical pao ca accumulibacter usually considered vital in the ebpr process cannot uptake glucose given the absence of encoding genes for its assimilation a circumstance already hypothesized a priori by wentzel et al 1986 nonetheless a later metatranscriptomic study of ca accumulibacter has stated differently oyserman et al 2016 similarly gaos present the necessary genes for glucose assimilation the same can be said about the fermentative putative pao tetrasphaera as was first verified by kong et al 2005 and then further confirmed by nguyen et al 2011 and kristiansen et al 2013 however the presence of fermentative paos such as tetrasphaera could also prove to be detrimental to the ebpr process since an additional source of energy as atp such as the one provided via fermentation could cease the poly p hydrolysis this theory is supported by marques et al 2017 and rubio rincón et al 2019 the latter suggested that neither tetrasphaera nor ca accumulibacter could significantly store phosphate while utilizing lactate as the primary carbon source the reason behind this seems to be that no extra atp is needed for storing lactate as pha hence no poly p hydrolysis is required despite this several studies have reported a good ebpr performance while using glucose as the carbon source jeon and park 2000 santos et al 1999 wang et al 2002 in these reports withal different contradicting hypotheses were presented to explain the metabolism behind the recounted removal furthermore due to the lack of microbial characterization in the previous studies the role of ca accumulibacter was not thoroughly elucidated or discussed for this purpose we conducted a long term study by operating an anaerobic aerobic sequential batch reactor sbr using glucose and acetate as carbon sources we evaluated the results in terms of ebpr performance and the role of ca accumulibacter in glucose fed systems is analyzed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr operation the biomass enrichment was carried out in a 3 0 l applikon double jacketed vessel operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr employing the bioxpert software and an applikon adi 1030 bio controller applikon delft the netherlands the reactor s working capacity was 2 5 l with an internal diameter of 12 5 cm and a water depth of 20 5 cm the overall experimental setup is comparable to the one used by rubio rincón et al 2019 two different sludge sources were used as inoculum to have a varied initial microbial community activated sludge from the biological nutrient removal plant of harnaschpolder peuldreef 4 den horn the netherlands and sludge provided by the center for microbial communities department of chemistry and bioscience aalborg university aalborg denmark the latter had a high abundance of the genus tetrasphaera whose presence was desired for their glucose utilization capability a mixture of 400 ml of these two sources was used as inoculum the reactor was operated following cycles of 8 h the cycles consisted of 3 5 h anaerobic 3 h aerobic and 1 5 h for settling and effluent withdrawal the anaerobic conditions were induced by adding dinitrogen gas during the initial 25 min of the anaerobic phase and maintained by installing a water lock at the gas outlet before the addition of n2 gas the redox potential was 200 mv ma which decreased to 240 mv ma after the supplement and reached 380 mv ma by the end of the anaerobic phase each cycle commenced with adding 1 25 l of the synthetic medium which maintained the hrt at 16 h the srt was set at 15 days as reported by rubio rincón et al 2019 which in turn with the mentioned cycles resulted in an aerobic srt of 6 25 d the temperature was set at 20 1 c and regulated by water recirculation through the reactor s double jacket using a lauda brinkmann re106 water bath chiller delran united states the ph was measured continuously by an applisens ph probe applikon delft the netherlands and maintained at 7 0 0 1 by the automatic supply of 0 4 m hcl or 0 4 m naoh when needed the dissolved oxygen concentration do was set at 20 of the saturation level via an on off function of the compressed air supply the reactor was continuously stirred utilizing an overhead mixer set at 300 rpm through the anaerobic and aerobic phases pseudo steady state conditions were considered to have been reached when the measurements of redox potential vfa and cod consumption and the mlvss mlss ratio presented no significant changes above 1 in 3 srts 45 days phosphorus removal was also contemplated but within a 10 change rate 2 2 batch tests batch tests were carried out once the reactor reached pseudo steady state conditions using glucose or acetate individually as the carbon source the tests were conducted by adding 200 ml of mixed liquor from the parent reactor taken after the aerobic phase into smaller double jacketed reactors with a working capacity of 0 5 l and connected to an applikon adi 1030 bio controller the sludge was kept aerobically until the test started and the same cycles mentioned before were repeated that is 3 5 h of anaerobic phase and 3 h of aerobic phase the temperature was controlled at 20 c ph at 7 0 and agitation at 300 rpm samples for po4 p nh 4 n doc and vfas were taken every 10 min while mlss mlvss were measured at the beginning and end of each phase oxygen uptake rate our profiles were also determined the sludge was recirculated via a biological oxygen monitor which included a do probe the recirculation was intermittently re started once the dissolved oxygen concentration stabilized or reached 2 mg l and taken up to about 8 mg l to assess the do profile decline again 2 3 synthetic media the concentrations per liter were 400 mg cod acetate and glucose in a 1 1 ratio 50 mg po 4 3 p 28 mg nh 4 n 50 mg so 4 2 19 mg k 15 mg mg2 4 mg ca 1 mg yeast extract 20 mg n allylthiourea atu to prevent nitrification since phosphorus removal was the target of the study and 300 µl of the trace elements solutions prepared following the research of smolders et al 1994a the 1 1 acetate glucose ratio was used to promote the enrichment of pao like organisms and to study the possible symbiosis among different genera acetate utilizing and glucose utilizing bacteria for the batch tests a 200 mg l cod concentration of either glucose or acetate was used other concentrations remained unchanged 2 4 chemical analyses mlss mlvss orthophosphate po4 p ammonia nh 4 n and total organic carbon toc were measured weekly at the start of each differential phase for one cycle following the standard methods described by apha et al 2005 the volatile fatty acids vfas were measured using a varian 460 gas chromatograph nieuwegein the netherlands 2 5 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters the net phosphate release mg po4 p l and phosphate release per vfa consumption ratio mol p mol c were calculated considering the concentration value when the carbon source ran out since carbon was depleted in every test thus the p release due to maintenance purposes was excluded from the observed phosphate release the kinetic parameters of interest were calculated using the linear regression method reported in smolders et al 1995 research where the maximum volumetric rates relate to the slope of the applicable data set no less than 5 experimental points were used for these calculations the phosphate biomass content fp was calculated following the study of smolders et al 1996 by using the following equation f p phosphate removed observed growth yield cod consumed mg p mg vss 2 6 fish analysis fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analyses were carried out to characterize the enriched culture and determine the most relevant communities relative abundances the ca accumulibacter genus was targeted by the probes pao 462 pao 651 and pao 846 which combined an 89 coverage of the named genus crocetti et al 2000 since the genus propionivibrio was among the most abundant in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results the probe pao 651 was also used by itself to rule out the possible overestimation of ca accumulibacter as suggested by albertsen et al 2016 thus also decreasing the coverage to 71 of the species from the genus ca accumulibacter in addition the genus ca competibacter and the gao community were targeted with the probes gaoq 431 and gaoq 989 crocetti et al 2002 when it comes to the genus tetrasphaera only probes with confirmed coverage and specificity were selected for the current research to span the three clades of the genus tet2 842 tet2 174 and elo1 1250 were chosen nguyen et al 2011 t japonica which does not belong to any clade was covered by the probe actino 1011 liu et al 2001 vectashield anti fade medium with dapi was used to preserve the sample s fluorescence and stain all organisms as suggested by nielsen 2009 vector laboratories ca usa an olympus bx51 microscope and the cell dimensions 1 5 software were used for the quantification of each probe 20 random pictures were analyzed and the standard error of the resulting mean was calculated considering the standard deviation and dividing it by the square root of the number of images analyzed 2 7 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analyses the genomic dna gdna was extracted using the qiaamp powerfecal dna kit qiagen inc ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extracted gdna was measured using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer and the qubit dsdna br assay kit by invitrogen thermo fisher scientific the netherlands the extracted gdna from the reactor and the inoculum were

57 981 sequences heatmaps were generated using ampvis2 v 2 6 5 2 8 proteome analysis sample preparation and database search for metaproteomic analysis was performed as described by kleikamp et al 2020 shotgun proteomic raw data were matched against a global bacterial database downloaded from uniprotkb using a 2 round search approach 2 9 metagenome sequencing metagenomes were shotgun sequenced on an illumina nova seq 6000 platform 2 150 bp at novogene corporation inc sacramento ca the yield was approximately 12 gb 6gb sample of raw short read sequences per library the raw amplicon and metagenome

of the biomass the reactor was operated under the described conditions for over 100 days pseudo steady state conditions were reached around day 60 fig 1 and putative fermentative conditions were reached 380 mv ma on day 15 the adaptation selection process as checked through the biomass growth took less than 10 days during the pseudo steady state operation a high net p removal efficiency of around 30 to 40 mg po4 p l was consistently maintained and the fed carbon sources were entirely anaerobically consumed the observed biomass yield was 0 28 g vss g cod giving a phosphate biomass fraction content of 0 30 mg p mg vss as mentioned all carbon sources were utilized entirely during the anaerobic stage the cod was consumed at a rate of 50 0 mg cod g vss h fig 2 as expected the anaerobic carbon consumption was correlated with an anaerobic phosphate release of 153 0 mg po4 p l at 19 9 mg po4 p g vss h table 1 once all carbon was consumed the phosphate release diminished to 2 7 mg po4 p g vss h overall the phosphate release per carbon consumed was 0 45 mol p mol c during aerobic conditions the biomass was able to uptake 195 mg po4 p l at a primary rate of 18 6 mg po4 p g vss h for the first aerobic hour and 7 8 mg po4 p g vss h the remaining time hence with these results the overall removal was 29 mg po4 p l in addition the ratio of mg cod anaerobically consumed per mg phosphorus aerobically uptake of the cycle test was 100 9 3 3 2 individual assessment of acetate and glucose on the microbial metabolism when only acetate was used as the carbon source the fed 200 mg cod l were fully consumed after 100 min of the anaerobic phase at a rate of 40 1 mg cod g vss h fig 3 table 1 as observed before acetate s putative intracellular accumulation was correlated with a net phosphate release of 100 mg po4 p l at a rate of 19 1 mg po4 p g vss h when acetate was still present in the liquid and a rate of 0 2 mg po4 p g vss h afterward the overall p vfa ratio was 0 52 mol p mol c in line with the phosphate release and acetate accumulation the vss tss ratio changed from 0 81 to 0 87 at the start and end of the anaerobic phase respectively during the aerobic phase a net phosphorus uptake of 83 7 mg po4 p l at a primary rate of 12 5 mg po4 p g vss h first aerobic hour and at a secondary rate of 6 4 mg po4 p g vss h in the remaining p up taking period were measured combining these two results the batch test did not display overall phosphorus removal since the concentration after the aerobic phase 59 mg po4 p l was higher than at the beginning of the test 40 mg po4 p l the o2 cod ratio was 0 6 on the other hand when only glucose was used as the carbon source the fed 200 mg cod l were completely consumed after 140 min of the anaerobic phase at a rate of 5 6 mg cod g vss h fig 3 table 1 the interrelated net phosphate release of 48 6 mg po4 p l at a rate of 9 8 mg po4 p g vss h while the carbon source was still present in the liquid was followed by a release at the diminished rate of 2 4 mg po4 p g vss h hence the p vfa ratio was 0 26 mol p mol c once again the phosphate release and glucose consumption were in accordance with the tss vss ratio which changed from 0 73 at the start of the anaerobic phase to 0 81 recorded by its end the net p uptake was 65 mg po4 p l h with a release rate of 7 7 mg po4 p g vss g for the first hour and 3 1 mg po4 p g vss for the remaining aerobic time coalescing both results the net p removal for this experiment was 5 mg po4 p l corresponding to 15 of the phosphorus at the beginning the o2 cod ratio was 0 5 3 3 characterization of the microbial community fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing were performed to identify the predominant microorganisms of the obtained culture and assess their relative abundance ca accumulibacter was the most abundant of the targeted populations with a relative abundance of 67 5 compared to the whole microbial population targeted by dapi followed by ca competibacter probes gaoq431 and gaoq989 which accounted for 32 4 fig 4 table 2 to gage the possible overestimation of ca accumulibacter by the closely related putative gao propionivibrio the probe pao651 was also used by itself albertsen et al 2016 in this case the result was 49 4 when evaluating the gram positive bacteria the relative abundance of actinobacteria probe actino 1011 was 8 1 while the three probes targeting the genus tetrasphaera accounted for in total 10 probes tet2 842 tet2 174 and elo1 1250 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results supported the examined trends regarding the phyla the most abundant ones in the reactor sample were proteobacteria patescibacteria and bacteroidota respectively representing 83 of the community fig 5 the most abundant family in the culture was rhodocyclaceae in which the genus ca accumulibacter was the predominant member with a relative abundance of 17 3 regarding the accounted asvs fig 5 the latter signified a sharp increase from the 2 2 present in the inoculum once again members of the family competibacteraceae specifically the genus ca competibacter were also among the most abundant both in the inoculum and the obtained culture in the latter the relative abundance of the genus was 10 4 different members of the family saccharimonadaceae also increased significantly from an initial undetectable abundance to a considerable 10 4 the genus propionivibrio amounted to 4 7 from an initial 0 9 while tetrasphaera remained constant at 0 4 data not included 3 4 possible metabolic pathways the proteomic analysis exhibited the predominance of the genus ca accumulibacter supporting the results from the fish analyses and the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and in line with the good ebpr performance that hinted a high abundance of pao like organisms of the total expressed proteins on average 52 corresponded to this genus and more specifically to three species accumulibacter phosphatis strain uw 1 accumulibacter aalborgensis and accumulibacter sp the gao bacteria competibacter denitrificans was second 6 1 followed by contendobacter odensis and propionivibrio aalborgensis 4 6 thus these four genera amounted to almost 70 of the expressed proteins lastly 0 18 of the proteins corresponded to the putative pao genus tetrasphaera represented by t australiensis t japonica and t elongata all the enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as the glyoxylate shunt malate synthase and isocitrate lyase data not shown and in the glycolysis emp pathway were present in the culture and among the most abundant of the expressed proteins table 3 the latter relates to the deep fermentation conditions reached during the reactor s operation more specifically except for the glucokinase required for the first step of glycolysis converting glucose into glucose 6 phosphate ca accumulibacter was the only genus expressing all the enzymes necessary for the named pathways the glucokinase was not characterized in any of the most abundant genera and its abundance in other genera was significantly low 0 1 contrarily to the emp pathway none of the enzymes required for the entner doudoroff ed glycolysis pathway were detected in the most abundant genera regarding the storage polymers all of the enzymes involved in the glycogen synthesis were present for ca accumulibacter but not for the other abundant genera the enzymes involved in the polyhydroxybutyrate phb synthesis acetyl coa c acyltransferase phaa acetoacetyl coa reductase phab and phb synthase phac were all detected in the genus ca accumulibacter and the species competibacter denitrificans and contendobacter odensis with the addition of the enoyl coa hydratase phaj detected in the first two in addition the enzymes methyl malonyl coa mutase and propionyl coa carboxylase involved in the synthesis of polyhydroxyvalerate phv and polyhydroxy 2 methyl butyrate ph2mb from succinyl coa were also detected table 3 3 5 metagenomic assembled genomes using samples from different stages of the reactor s operation once it had reached pseudo steady state conditions it was possible to retrieve 61 metagenomic assembled genomes mags with completeness above 50 and less than 10 of contamination the 11 mags of interest annotated with kegg orthology considering the results of the 16s rrna gene analysis and the metaproteomic analysis along with its genome size completeness and taxonomic annotation among other indicators are summarized table 4 it was possible to annotate 2 mags belonging to the rhodocyclaceae family 3 of competibacteraceae and 6 from saccharimonadaceae no member of the tetrasphaera genus or the intrasporangiaceae family was annotated the annotated mag of ca accumulibacter encoded for the majority of the genes involved in the glycolysis emp pathway except for the tpi triosephosphate isomerase and the pgk phosphoglycerate kinase table 5 the glk gene glucokinase was encoded in the mag of ca accumulibacter and ca propionivibrio but not in the remaining 9 mags of interest regarding acetate uptake and utilization the mags of ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter were the only ones that encoded the complete pathway actp acs pta and acka most mags encoded the complete glycogen synthesis pathway except for the saccharimonadaceae family mags on the other hand the pyruvate oxidation pathway from pyruvate to acetyl coa was encoded in ca accumulibacter s mag and none of the mags of interest encoded the glycolysis ed pathway the annotated mag of ca accumulibacter encoded the most amount of pha synthesis related genes with phaa phbb and phbc all present these genes were also accounted for in the mags of ca contendobacter odensis and the two ca competibacter however they were not found in the mag of ca propionivibrio mag level of completeness of 97 5 furthermore as for the phosphorus removal mentioned before the mag of ca accumulibacter encoded all necessary genes e g ppx pap adk ppk1 and pit regarding the 6 annotated mags belonging to the saccharimonadaceae family all of them lacked the first three glycolysis genes emp pathway and encoded only one gene for the ed pathway and glycogen synthesis no encoding genes were found concerning acetate uptake glucose uptake acetate utilization pyruvate oxidation pha synthesis or glucose fermentation table 5 4 discussion 4 1 biological phosphorus removal using glucose acetate fed as aforementioned the presence of glucose in the influent of an ebpr process was usually associated with a disruption of the process since ca accumulibacter was considered unable to anaerobically uptake fermentable compounds nevertheless in our study the performance of the reactor fed with glucose and acetate 1 1 ratio was comparable to a reactor with a noteworthy ebpr performance in terms of phosphorus release uptake and overall kinetic as well as stoichiometric parameters when comparing these values with reported values the specific p release of the parent reactor and the batch test with acetate fell on the high end of the reported spectrum for ebpr full scale systems table 6 the cod uptake rate of the reactor was also higher than the reported for full scale ebpr systems with a difference ranging from 6 to 82 considering respectively the lowest and highest reported values kuba et al 1997a 1997b lópez vázquez et al 2008 the p c ratio of the cycle test using glucose and acetate was frequently higher than the reported values for lab scale sbrs fed solely with acetate or comparable to schuler and jenkins 2003 smolders et al 1995 furthermore the maximum p uptake rate was reported for the parent reactor and was higher than the reported values except for the study of lópez vázquez et al 2008 on full scale wwtps 30 to 88 likewise the batch tests p uptake rates were higher than most reported values combining the anaerobic and aerobic parameters it was possible to assess that glucose and acetate s co metabolism yielded the most favorable biological phosphorus removal results regarding the operational conditions the ph decreased during the anaerobic phases consistent with the fermentation of glucose wang et al 2001 the observed yield for the cycle test was 0 28 mg vss mg cod and the phosphate content of the biomass in this case was 0 30 mg p mg vss these results in turn signify a cod p ratio of 100 9 3 table 7 thus the outcome is comparable to the cod p ratio of ca accumulibacter that was calculated using the growth yield of wentzel et al 1988 and the phosphate fraction of smolders et al 1994a therefore it also denotes the pao like behavior of the enriched community 4 2 the role of ca accumulibacter on glucose fed systems several other studies that contradict the deteriorating effect of glucose in the ebpr process have been published whether used as a supplement or although less frequently as a dominant substrate for instance wang et al 2001 claimed a good ebpr performance using glucose as the primary substrate nevertheless analyzing their results the overall phosphate removed per 100 mg of cod consumed in the system was 100 3 after operational modifications 100 1 6 without the changes which is not close to the cod p ratio of 100 8 expected for a pao culture and closer to the 100 0 9 hypothesized to be used by ohos to fulfill the growth requirements furthermore as these studies did not report any community analysis it is impossible to determine if the processes observed were performed by a single organism or via different microbial groups synergy thus in principle the partial phosphate uptake observed in those systems could have been carried out via the partial fermentation of glucose into acetate by a fermentative organism and the generated acetate could have been used by ca accumulibacter for the removal of phosphate the study of jeon and park 2000 presented a good ebpr performance of an sbr supplied solely with glucose as the carbon source they hypothesized that the overall process was carried out by two different microorganisms namely paos and lactic acid producing organisms lpos and thus a new putative metabolic pathway was presented and inferred to occur when glucose is used however recent findings using lactate as the carbon source in the ebpr process that included microbial characterization have shown neither ca accumulibacter nor tetrasphaera can solely use lactate to remove phosphorus biologically rubio rincón et al 2019 case in point santos et al 1999 elucidated the metabolism of the pao microlunatus phosphovorus and discovered that this genus could ferment glucose into acetate while testing a pure culture coinciding with the study of nakamura et al 1995 moreover it displayed high phosphorus release and uptake rates although it was not capable of anaerobic growth santos et al 1999 however in our study m phosphovorus was not present in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results or the proteomic analysis hence the observed assimilation of glucose cannot be attributed to the presence in this species culture moreover as addressed below the fermentation of glucose to acetate would generate an atp molecule thus lowering the need for hydrolyzing poly p as the energy source interestingly the study presented here was dominated by ca accumulibacter 67 according to the fish analysis based on the 0 21 mg vss mg cod biomass growth yield reported by smolders et al 1994a and our system s biomass concentration it can be calculated that at least 80 of the available cod in the system had to be utilized by ca accumulibacter thus making it the dominant microorganism in the system since the acetate glucose ratio was 1 1 this 80 cod consumption also signifies that the dominant member was either directly utilizing the glucose or relying on the presence of an ancillary secondary member fermenting the monosaccharide nonetheless the relative abundance considering the accounted asvs 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results of all other putative paos such as tetrasphaera dechloromonas microlunatus pseudomonas thiothrix halomonas and ca obscuribacter either decreased compared to the inoculum or the genus was absent from the reactor since the first can metabolize fermentable compounds an increase in their abundance was expected kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 the same can be said about gaos which can assimilate glucose however the utilized operational conditions that proved to favor the growth of paos over gaos in previous studies i e ph of 7 0 od of 20 and an hrt of 16 h seem to have successfully prevented the over proliferation of gaos in our system carvalheira et al 2014 lópez vázquez et al 2008 hence to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter can putatively utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to biologically remove phosphate 5 mg l of net p removal cod p mg mg removal ratio of 100 6 3 lastly the substantial discrepancy in relative abundance numbers observed between the two molecular methods has been discussed before by rubio rincón et al 2019 and valverde pérez et al 2016 who suggested that the studies should be supplemented with microbial activity measures in this study we carried out proteome and metagenome analyses to further elucidate the microbial composition and behavior 4 3 glucose utilization and storage concerning this study s phosphorus uptake two rates were present for each cycle and batch test fig 2 table 1 and fig 3 the primary rate encompassed the first hour of aerobic conditions and was twice as big as the secondary rate on the one hand this fact coincides with the usual observations from systems enriched with ca accumulibacter where the phosphate uptake rate depends on the fraction of polyphosphate stored welles et al 2017 however as mentioned before the 18 6 and 7 8 mg po4 p g vss h for the primary and secondary rates respectively indicate a noteworthy 58 difference which has not been reported before according to the metabolism of ca accumulibacter the phosphate uptake capacity is not solely affected by the poly p content as described by welles et al 2017 but is also affected by the utilization of the stored organic carbon henze et al 2000 the recognized storage carbons or paos are mainly phas phb phv ph2mv and ph2mb and glycogen the pha compound ultimately stored will depend on the carbon source utilized and the number of available electrons smolders et al 1994a for instance if there are enough electrons for the uptake and conversion of acetate then only phb will be produced and the tca cycle is not needed fig 6 guedes da silva et al 2020 since this is usually not the case the glyoxylate shunt is generally activated to produce reducing equivalents and as a consequence other phas are also produced guedes da silva et al 2020 in line with this different studies using propionate as the carbon source have generally reported slower phosphate uptake rates than studies fed with acetate oehmen et al 2005 rubio rincón et al 2017 as acetate yields phb and propionate more reduced than the first yields both phb and phv the stored polymer could explain the aerobic phosphate uptake difference oehmen et al 2005 therefore the change in aerobic uptake rates reported in this study could be explained by the presence of at least two organic storage polymers the different oxidation rates of these polymers would in turn be reflected by a disparate phosphorus uptake rate nevertheless contrary to propionate which is more reduced than acetate the oxidation state of glucose is equal to acetate table 8 thus the formation of phv from glucose via the known pyruvate tca cycle seems unlikely these results then lead to two hypothetical pathways either glucose is stored as glycogen or directly or indirectly fermented first to acetate by either ca accumulibacter or the possible ancillary microorganisms fermented to pyruvate and stored as pha fig 6 analyzing these hypotheses by combining the results of the annotated mag and the metaproteomic analysis we found that all of the genes and enzymes involved in the emp pathway of the glycolysis glycogen synthesis phb phv and ph2mb synthesis were either encoded or expressed by ca accumulibacter tables 3 and 5 in accordance with previous reports kristiansen et al 2013 oyserman et al 2016 thus from an enzymatic point of view ca accumulibacter expressed the necessary enzymes to store glucose as glycogen or pha since the intracellular dynamics of both glycogen and pha synthesis were induced together with the generated phosphorus release and poly p dynamics taking this into consideration we propose the glucose utilization pathway by ca accumulibacter as the most likely of the stated hypotheses fig 6 moreover it seems that the organism can perform both metabolic pathways storage and fermentation of glucose the turn on off function might depend on the anaerobically required and aerobically produced atp in this matter metabolically speaking storing glucose as pha would generate atp on the other hand storing glucose as glycogen would require atp fig 6 in principle the atp needed to store these compounds could be balanced by 50 of the glucose stored as glycogen and the remaining 50 stored as pha at the same time the excess nadh produced via pha storage could be utilized to form phv and ph2mv instead of phb if that were the case poly p hydrolysis would be unnecessary as it only generates atp during the process moreover as a ratio of 0 26 mol p mol c was observed in this study batch test performed solely with glucose it is not adequate postulation hence considering that glucose is a c6 molecule and 1 mol of atp is generated per mol of p hydrolyzed smolders et al 1994b ca accumulibacter can generate 1 5 mol of atp per mol of glucose via the poly p hydrolysis and the mol p mol c ratio observed in this study neglecting the atp needed for other anaerobic processes e g maintenance infers that about 75 of the glucose could be stored as glycogen using the atp provided via poly p hydrolysis the remaining 25 could be stored partially as glycogen and pha by balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage as aforementioned this should be related to the anaerobic atp utilization and aerobic atp formation the atp generation from an organic compound is related to its cod content and the carbon s oxidation state smolders et al 1994b concerning this matter as presented in table 8 glycogen is more reduced than pha while in principle the cod is anaerobically conserved by the paos the energy that could be generated from the oxidation of 1 mol of glycogen with respect to 1 mol of pha would be higher this difference even if unlikely could well explain why the observed growth yield of ca accumulibacter in this study is higher than those reported in previous studies table 7 finally atp s conservation would not be the only decisive factor in the storage polymer another potential factor would be the storage capacity of the organism for instance glycogen is stored within the cytoplasm while pha is stored as a long carbon chain hence the storage of the first would occupy more space as compared to pha within the available space of the organism and could play a significant role in further deciding how glucose could be stored and as such in influencing if the organism performs the hydrolysis of poly p or not unfortunately this study cannot unequally determine how much glucose has been stored as glycogen and how much as pha hence it is recommended that any follow up studies should use c labeled carbons 5 conclusions a noteworthy ebpr performance in terms of phosphorous removal and overall kinetic and stoichiometric parameters was achieved in a lab scale srt fed with glucose and acetate 1 1 ratio the dominant member was the microorganism ca accumulibacter responsible for consuming approximately 80 of the fed carbon sources the glucose was hypothesized to be directly stored by this organism predominantly as glycogen and partially as pha utilizing the atp provided via the hydrolysis of poly p and balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage other possible explanations are also discussed to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter relative

15242,ca accumulibacter was the predominant microorganism relative fish bio abundance of 67 5 in a lab scale sequential batch reactor that accomplished enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr while using glucose and acetate as the carbon sources 1 1 cod based ratio both organic compounds were completely anaerobically consumed the reactor s performance in terms of p c ratio phosphorous release and uptake and overall kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were on the high end of the reported spectrum for ebpr systems 100 9 3 net mg phosphate removal per mg cod consumed when using glucose and acetate in a 1 1 ratio the batch tests showed that to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter can putatively utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to biologically remove phosphate cod p mg mg removal ratio of 100 6 3 when using only glucose thus this research proposes that ca accumulibacter directly anaerobically stored the fed glucose primarily as glycogen by utilizing the atp provided via the hydrolysis of poly p and secondarily as pha by balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage alternative hypotheses are also discussed the reported findings could challenge the conventional theories of glucose assimilation by ca accumulibacter and can be of significance for the biological removal of phosphorus from wastewaters with high contents of fermentable compounds or low vfas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal wastewater with fermentable compounds glucose metabolism ca accumulibacter data availability all data have been deposited in the eawag research data institutional repository https opendata eawag ch and are publicly available 1 introduction the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process is widely used worldwide in municipal wastewater treatment plants it is considered an efficient and more environmentally sustainable alternative to chemical methods coats et al 2018 oehmen et al 2007 theoretically in an ebpr activated sludge system phosphorus is removed by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos paos utilize phosphorus beyond their growth requirements via the storing and hydrolysis of their polyphosphate pool thus achieving greater phosphorus incorporation into the sludge mass barnard 1975 comeau et al 1986 to promote the growth of paos the activated sludge system needs to be designed and operated so that these organisms growth is stimulated and the consequent increase in phosphorus removal is achieved barnard et al 2017 however like with any microbiological process the ebpr performance is prone to be affected by environmental and operational factors such as a significant presence of detrimental microorganisms and physicochemical properties of the wastewater gebremariam et al 2012 lópez vázquez et al 2008 regarding the latter glucose utilization has been a recurrent topic in the literature on the ebpr process cech and hartman 1993 1990 jeon and park 2000 santos et al 1999 wang et al 2002 however the attested consensus seemed that paos could not anaerobically uptake fermentable compounds such as glucose while promoting the subsequent phosphate uptake on the contrary the presence of glucose in ebpr systems was associated with an instability of the performance as in the studies of cech and hartman 1990 1993 and begum and batista 2012 different explanations were hypothesized for the deterioration of the ebpr performance when glucose is used in the first place glucose was believed to select for an undesirable group of microorganisms initially called g bacteria and later renamed glycogen accumulating organisms gaos capable of accumulating glycogen without the release of phosphate mino et al 1998 these organisms were believed to excessively proliferate under these circumstances thus outcompeting the paos considering the fact that according to the metabolic model of mino et al 1994 they are able to produce phas with a positive net balance of one mole of atp wang et al 2010 on the other hand the deterioration of the ebpr performance due to the absence of fermentative flanking species was first suggested by randall et al 1997 this study reported that paos could not ferment glucose during the anaerobic stage hence if the sugar was not pre fermented by non poly p microorganisms an ebpr failure could be expected these two explanations correlate to the reports of kong et al 2004 and nguyen et al 2011 which inferred the canonical pao ca accumulibacter usually considered vital in the ebpr process cannot uptake glucose given the absence of encoding genes for its assimilation a circumstance already hypothesized a priori by wentzel et al 1986 nonetheless a later metatranscriptomic study of ca accumulibacter has stated differently oyserman et al 2016 similarly gaos present the necessary genes for glucose assimilation the same can be said about the fermentative putative pao tetrasphaera as was first verified by kong et al 2005 and then further confirmed by nguyen et al 2011 and kristiansen et al 2013 however the presence of fermentative paos such as tetrasphaera could also prove to be detrimental to the ebpr process since an additional source of energy as atp such as the one provided via fermentation could cease the poly p hydrolysis this theory is supported by marques et al 2017 and rubio rincón et al 2019 the latter suggested that neither tetrasphaera nor ca accumulibacter could significantly store phosphate while utilizing lactate as the primary carbon source the reason behind this seems to be that no extra atp is needed for storing lactate as pha hence no poly p hydrolysis is required despite this several studies have reported a good ebpr performance while using glucose as the carbon source jeon and park 2000 santos et al 1999 wang et al 2002 in these reports withal different contradicting hypotheses were presented to explain the metabolism behind the recounted removal furthermore due to the lack of microbial characterization in the previous studies the role of ca accumulibacter was not thoroughly elucidated or discussed for this purpose we conducted a long term study by operating an anaerobic aerobic sequential batch reactor sbr using glucose and acetate as carbon sources we evaluated the results in terms of ebpr performance and the role of ca accumulibacter in glucose fed systems is analyzed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr operation the biomass enrichment was carried out in a 3 0 l applikon double jacketed vessel operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr employing the bioxpert software and an applikon adi 1030 bio controller applikon delft the netherlands the reactor s working capacity was 2 5 l with an internal diameter of 12 5 cm and a water depth of 20 5 cm the overall experimental setup is comparable to the one used by rubio rincón et al 2019 two different sludge sources were used as inoculum to have a varied initial microbial community activated sludge from the biological nutrient removal plant of harnaschpolder peuldreef 4 den horn the netherlands and sludge provided by the center for microbial communities department of chemistry and bioscience aalborg university aalborg denmark the latter had a high abundance of the genus tetrasphaera whose presence was desired for their glucose utilization capability a mixture of 400 ml of these two sources was used as inoculum the reactor was operated following cycles of 8 h the cycles consisted of 3 5 h anaerobic 3 h aerobic and 1 5 h for settling and effluent withdrawal the anaerobic conditions were induced by adding dinitrogen gas during the initial 25 min of the anaerobic phase and maintained by installing a water lock at the gas outlet before the addition of n2 gas the redox potential was 200 mv ma which decreased to 240 mv ma after the supplement and reached 380 mv ma by the end of the anaerobic phase each cycle commenced with adding 1 25 l of the synthetic medium which maintained the hrt at 16 h the srt was set at 15 days as reported by rubio rincón et al 2019 which in turn with the mentioned cycles resulted in an aerobic srt of 6 25 d the temperature was set at 20 1 c and regulated by water recirculation through the reactor s double jacket using a lauda brinkmann re106 water bath chiller delran united states the ph was measured continuously by an applisens ph probe applikon delft the netherlands and maintained at 7 0 0 1 by the automatic supply of 0 4 m hcl or 0 4 m naoh when needed the dissolved oxygen concentration do was set at 20 of the saturation level via an on off function of the compressed air supply the reactor was continuously stirred utilizing an overhead mixer set at 300 rpm through the anaerobic and aerobic phases pseudo steady state conditions were considered to have been reached when the measurements of redox potential vfa and cod consumption and the mlvss mlss ratio presented no significant changes above 1 in 3 srts 45 days phosphorus removal was also contemplated but within a 10 change rate 2 2 batch tests batch tests were carried out once the reactor reached pseudo steady state conditions using glucose or acetate individually as the carbon source the tests were conducted by adding 200 ml of mixed liquor from the parent reactor taken after the aerobic phase into smaller double jacketed reactors with a working capacity of 0 5 l and connected to an applikon adi 1030 bio controller the sludge was kept aerobically until the test started and the same cycles mentioned before were repeated that is 3 5 h of anaerobic phase and 3 h of aerobic phase the temperature was controlled at 20 c ph at 7 0 and agitation at 300 rpm samples for po4 p nh 4 n doc and vfas were taken every 10 min while mlss mlvss were measured at the beginning and end of each phase oxygen uptake rate our profiles were also determined the sludge was recirculated via a biological oxygen monitor which included a do probe the recirculation was intermittently re started once the dissolved oxygen concentration stabilized or reached 2 mg l and taken up to about 8 mg l to assess the do profile decline again 2 3 synthetic media the concentrations per liter were 400 mg cod acetate and glucose in a 1 1 ratio 50 mg po 4 3 p 28 mg nh 4 n 50 mg so 4 2 19 mg k 15 mg mg2 4 mg ca 1 mg yeast extract 20 mg n allylthiourea atu to prevent nitrification since phosphorus removal was the target of the study and 300 µl of the trace elements solutions prepared following the research of smolders et al 1994a the 1 1 acetate glucose ratio was used to promote the enrichment of pao like organisms and to study the possible symbiosis among different genera acetate utilizing and glucose utilizing bacteria for the batch tests a 200 mg l cod concentration of either glucose or acetate was used other concentrations remained unchanged 2 4 chemical analyses mlss mlvss orthophosphate po4 p ammonia nh 4 n and total organic carbon toc were measured weekly at the start of each differential phase for one cycle following the standard methods described by apha et al 2005 the volatile fatty acids vfas were measured using a varian 460 gas chromatograph nieuwegein the netherlands 2 5 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters the net phosphate release mg po4 p l and phosphate release per vfa consumption ratio mol p mol c were calculated considering the concentration value when the carbon source ran out since carbon was depleted in every test thus the p release due to maintenance purposes was excluded from the observed phosphate release the kinetic parameters of interest were calculated using the linear regression method reported in smolders et al 1995 research where the maximum volumetric rates relate to the slope of the applicable data set no less than 5 experimental points were used for these calculations the phosphate biomass content fp was calculated following the study of smolders et al 1996 by using the following equation f p phosphate removed observed growth yield cod consumed mg p mg vss 2 6 fish analysis fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analyses were carried out to characterize the enriched culture and determine the most relevant communities relative abundances the ca accumulibacter genus was targeted by the probes pao 462 pao 651 and pao 846 which combined an 89 coverage of the named genus crocetti et al 2000 since the genus propionivibrio was among the most abundant in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results the probe pao 651 was also used by itself to rule out the possible overestimation of ca accumulibacter as suggested by albertsen et al 2016 thus also decreasing the coverage to 71 of the species from the genus ca accumulibacter in addition the genus ca competibacter and the gao community were targeted with the probes gaoq 431 and gaoq 989 crocetti et al 2002 when it comes to the genus tetrasphaera only probes with confirmed coverage and specificity were selected for the current research to span the three clades of the genus tet2 842 tet2 174 and elo1 1250

fluorescence and stain all organisms as suggested by nielsen 2009 vector laboratories ca usa an olympus bx51 microscope and the cell dimensions 1 5 software were used for the quantification of each probe 20 random pictures were analyzed and the standard error of the resulting mean was calculated considering the standard deviation and dividing it by the square root of the number of images analyzed 2 7 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analyses the genomic dna gdna was extracted using the qiaamp powerfecal dna kit qiagen inc ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extracted gdna was measured using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer and the qubit dsdna br assay kit by invitrogen thermo fisher scientific the netherlands the extracted gdna from the reactor and the inoculum were

of the biomass the reactor was operated under the described conditions for over 100 days pseudo steady state conditions were reached around day 60 fig 1 and putative fermentative conditions were reached 380 mv ma on day 15 the adaptation selection process as checked through the biomass growth took less than 10 days during the pseudo steady state operation a high net p removal efficiency of around 30 to 40 mg po4 p l was consistently maintained and the fed carbon sources were entirely anaerobically consumed the observed biomass yield was 0 28 g vss g cod giving a phosphate biomass fraction content of 0 30 mg p mg vss as mentioned all carbon sources were utilized entirely during the anaerobic stage the cod was consumed at a rate of 50 0 mg cod g vss h fig 2 as expected the anaerobic carbon consumption was correlated with an anaerobic phosphate release of 153 0 mg po4 p l at 19 9 mg po4 p g vss h table 1 once all carbon was consumed the phosphate release diminished to 2 7 mg po4 p g vss h overall the phosphate release per carbon consumed was 0 45 mol p mol c during aerobic conditions the biomass was able to uptake 195 mg po4 p l at a primary rate of 18 6 mg po4 p g vss h for the first aerobic hour and 7 8 mg po4 p g vss h the remaining time hence with these results the overall removal was 29 mg po4 p l in addition the ratio of mg cod anaerobically consumed per mg phosphorus aerobically uptake of the cycle test was 100 9 3 3 2 individual assessment of acetate and glucose on the microbial metabolism when only acetate was used as the carbon source the fed 200 mg cod l were fully consumed after 100 min of the anaerobic phase at a rate of 40 1 mg cod g vss h fig 3 table 1 as observed before acetate s putative intracellular accumulation was correlated with a net phosphate release of 100 mg po4 p l at a rate of 19 1 mg po4 p g vss h when acetate was still present in the liquid and a rate of 0 2 mg po4 p g vss h afterward the overall p vfa ratio was 0 52 mol p mol c in line with the phosphate release and acetate accumulation the vss tss ratio changed from 0 81 to 0 87 at the start and end of the anaerobic phase respectively during the aerobic phase a net phosphorus uptake of 83 7 mg po4 p l at a primary rate of 12 5 mg po4 p g vss h first aerobic hour and at a secondary rate of 6 4 mg po4 p g vss h in the remaining p up taking period were measured combining these two results the batch test did not display overall phosphorus removal since the concentration after the aerobic phase 59 mg po4 p l was higher than at the beginning of the test 40 mg po4 p l the o2 cod ratio was 0 6 on the other hand when only glucose was used as the carbon source the fed 200 mg cod l were completely consumed after 140 min of the anaerobic phase at a rate of 5 6 mg cod g vss h fig 3 table 1 the interrelated net phosphate release of 48 6 mg po4 p l at a rate of 9 8 mg po4 p g vss h while the carbon source was still present in the liquid was followed by a release at the diminished rate of 2 4 mg po4 p g vss h hence the p vfa ratio was 0 26 mol p mol c once again the phosphate release and glucose consumption were in accordance with the tss vss ratio which changed from 0 73 at the start of the anaerobic phase to 0 81 recorded by its end the net p uptake was 65 mg po4 p l h with a release rate of 7 7 mg po4 p g vss g for the first hour and 3 1 mg po4 p g vss for the remaining aerobic time coalescing both results the net p removal for this experiment was 5 mg po4 p l corresponding to 15 of the phosphorus at the beginning the o2 cod ratio was 0 5 3 3 characterization of the microbial community fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing were performed to identify the predominant microorganisms of the obtained culture and assess their relative abundance ca accumulibacter was the most abundant of the targeted populations with a relative abundance of 67 5 compared to the whole microbial population targeted by dapi followed by ca competibacter probes gaoq431 and gaoq989 which accounted for 32 4 fig 4 table 2 to gage the possible overestimation of ca accumulibacter by the closely related putative gao propionivibrio the probe pao651 was also used by itself albertsen et al 2016 in this case the result was 49 4 when evaluating the gram positive bacteria the relative abundance of actinobacteria probe actino 1011 was 8 1 while the three probes targeting the genus tetrasphaera accounted for in total 10 probes tet2 842 tet2 174 and elo1 1250 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results supported the examined trends regarding the phyla the most abundant ones in the reactor sample were proteobacteria patescibacteria and bacteroidota respectively representing 83 of the community fig 5 the most abundant family in the culture was rhodocyclaceae in which the genus ca accumulibacter was the predominant member with a relative abundance of 17 3 regarding the accounted asvs fig 5 the latter signified a sharp increase from the 2 2 present in the inoculum once again members of the family competibacteraceae specifically the genus ca competibacter were also among the most abundant both in the inoculum and the obtained culture in the latter the relative abundance of the genus was 10 4 different members of the family saccharimonadaceae also increased significantly from an initial undetectable abundance to a considerable 10 4 the genus propionivibrio amounted to 4 7 from an initial 0 9 while tetrasphaera remained constant at 0 4 data not included 3 4 possible metabolic pathways the proteomic analysis exhibited the predominance of the genus ca accumulibacter supporting the results from the fish analyses and the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and in line with the good ebpr performance that hinted a high abundance of pao like organisms of the total expressed proteins on average 52 corresponded to this genus and more specifically to three species accumulibacter phosphatis strain uw 1 accumulibacter aalborgensis and accumulibacter sp the gao bacteria competibacter denitrificans was second 6 1 followed by contendobacter odensis and propionivibrio aalborgensis 4 6 thus these four genera amounted to almost 70 of the expressed proteins lastly 0 18 of the proteins corresponded to the putative pao genus tetrasphaera represented by t australiensis t japonica and t elongata all the enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as the glyoxylate shunt malate synthase and isocitrate lyase data not shown and in the glycolysis emp pathway were present in the culture and among the most abundant of the expressed proteins table 3 the latter relates to the deep fermentation conditions reached during the reactor s operation more specifically except for the glucokinase required for the first step of glycolysis converting glucose into glucose 6 phosphate ca accumulibacter was the only genus expressing all the enzymes necessary for the named pathways the glucokinase was not characterized in any of the most abundant genera and its abundance in other genera was significantly low 0 1 contrarily to the emp pathway none of the enzymes required for the entner doudoroff ed glycolysis pathway were detected in the most abundant genera regarding the storage polymers all of the enzymes involved in the glycogen synthesis were present for ca accumulibacter but not for the other abundant genera the enzymes involved in the polyhydroxybutyrate phb synthesis acetyl coa c acyltransferase phaa acetoacetyl coa reductase phab and phb synthase phac were all detected in the genus ca accumulibacter and the species competibacter denitrificans and contendobacter odensis with the addition of the enoyl coa hydratase phaj detected in the first two in addition the enzymes methyl malonyl coa mutase and propionyl coa carboxylase involved in the synthesis of polyhydroxyvalerate phv and polyhydroxy 2 methyl butyrate ph2mb from succinyl coa were also detected table 3 3 5 metagenomic assembled genomes using samples from different stages of the reactor s operation once it had reached pseudo steady state conditions it was possible to retrieve 61 metagenomic

majority of the genes involved in the glycolysis emp pathway except for the tpi triosephosphate isomerase and the pgk phosphoglycerate kinase table 5 the glk gene glucokinase was encoded in the mag of ca accumulibacter and ca propionivibrio but not in the remaining 9 mags of interest regarding acetate uptake and utilization the mags of ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter were the only ones that encoded the complete pathway actp acs pta and acka most mags encoded the complete glycogen synthesis pathway except for the saccharimonadaceae family mags on the other hand the pyruvate oxidation pathway from pyruvate to acetyl coa was encoded in ca accumulibacter s mag and none of the mags of interest encoded the glycolysis ed pathway the annotated mag of ca accumulibacter encoded the most amount of pha synthesis related genes with phaa phbb and phbc all present these genes were also accounted for in the mags of ca contendobacter odensis and the two ca competibacter however they were not found in the mag of ca propionivibrio mag level of completeness of 97 5 furthermore as for the phosphorus removal mentioned before the mag of ca accumulibacter encoded all necessary genes e g ppx pap adk ppk1 and pit regarding the 6 annotated mags belonging to the saccharimonadaceae family all of them lacked the first three glycolysis genes emp pathway and encoded only one gene for the ed pathway and glycogen synthesis no encoding genes were found concerning acetate uptake glucose uptake acetate utilization pyruvate oxidation pha synthesis or glucose fermentation table 5 4 discussion 4 1 biological phosphorus removal using glucose acetate fed as aforementioned the presence of glucose in the influent of an ebpr process was usually associated with a disruption of the process since ca accumulibacter was considered unable to anaerobically uptake fermentable compounds nevertheless in our study the performance of the reactor fed with glucose and acetate 1 1 ratio was comparable to a reactor with a noteworthy ebpr performance in terms of phosphorus release uptake and overall kinetic as well as stoichiometric parameters when comparing these values with reported values the specific p release of the parent reactor and the batch test with acetate fell on the high end of the reported spectrum for ebpr full scale systems table 6 the cod uptake rate of the reactor was also higher than the reported for full scale ebpr systems with a difference ranging from 6 to 82 considering respectively the lowest and highest reported values kuba et al 1997a 1997b lópez vázquez et al 2008 the p c ratio of the cycle test using glucose and acetate was frequently higher than the reported values for lab scale sbrs fed solely with acetate or comparable to schuler and jenkins 2003 smolders et al 1995 furthermore the maximum p uptake rate was reported for the parent reactor and was higher than the reported values except for the study of lópez vázquez et al 2008 on full scale wwtps 30 to 88 likewise the batch tests p uptake rates were higher than most reported values combining the anaerobic and aerobic parameters it was possible to assess that glucose and acetate s co metabolism yielded the most favorable biological phosphorus removal results regarding the operational conditions the ph decreased during the anaerobic phases consistent with the fermentation of glucose wang et al 2001 the observed yield for the cycle test was 0 28 mg vss mg cod and the phosphate content of the biomass in this case was 0 30 mg p mg vss these results in turn signify a cod p ratio of 100 9 3 table 7 thus the outcome is comparable to the cod p ratio of ca accumulibacter that was calculated using the growth yield of wentzel et al 1988 and the phosphate fraction of smolders et al 1994a therefore it also denotes the pao like behavior of the enriched community 4 2 the role of ca accumulibacter on glucose fed systems several other studies that contradict the deteriorating effect of glucose in the ebpr process have been published whether used as a supplement or although less frequently as a dominant substrate for instance wang et al 2001 claimed a good ebpr performance using glucose as the primary substrate nevertheless analyzing their results the overall phosphate removed per 100 mg of cod consumed in the system was 100 3 after operational modifications 100 1 6 without the changes which is not close to the cod p ratio of 100 8 expected for a pao culture and closer to the 100 0 9 hypothesized to be used by ohos to fulfill the growth requirements furthermore as these studies did not report any community analysis it is impossible to determine if the processes observed were performed by a single organism or via different microbial groups synergy thus in principle the partial phosphate uptake observed in those systems could have been carried out via the partial fermentation of glucose into acetate by a fermentative organism and the generated acetate could have been used by ca accumulibacter for the removal of phosphate the study of jeon and park 2000 presented a good ebpr performance of an sbr supplied solely with glucose as the carbon source they hypothesized that the overall process was carried out by two different microorganisms namely paos and lactic acid producing organisms lpos and thus a new putative metabolic pathway was presented and inferred to occur when glucose is used however recent findings using lactate as the carbon source in the ebpr process that included microbial characterization have shown neither ca accumulibacter nor tetrasphaera can solely use lactate to remove phosphorus biologically rubio rincón et al 2019 case in point santos et al 1999 elucidated the metabolism of the pao microlunatus phosphovorus and discovered that this genus could ferment glucose into acetate while testing a pure culture coinciding with the study of nakamura et al 1995 moreover it displayed high phosphorus release and uptake rates although it was not capable of anaerobic growth santos et al 1999 however in our study m phosphovorus was not present in the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results or the proteomic analysis hence the observed assimilation of glucose cannot be attributed to the presence in this species culture moreover as addressed below the fermentation of glucose to acetate would generate an atp molecule thus lowering the need for hydrolyzing poly p as the energy source interestingly the study presented here was dominated by ca accumulibacter 67 according to the fish analysis based on the 0 21 mg vss mg cod biomass growth yield reported by smolders et al 1994a and our system s biomass concentration it can be calculated that at least 80 of the available cod in the system had to be utilized by ca accumulibacter thus making it the dominant microorganism in the system since the acetate glucose ratio was 1 1 this 80 cod consumption also signifies that the dominant member was either directly utilizing the glucose or relying on the presence of an ancillary secondary member fermenting the monosaccharide nonetheless the relative abundance considering the accounted asvs 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing results of all other putative paos such as tetrasphaera dechloromonas microlunatus pseudomonas thiothrix halomonas and ca obscuribacter either decreased compared to the inoculum or the genus was absent from the reactor since the first can metabolize fermentable compounds an increase in their abundance was expected kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 the same can be said about gaos which can assimilate glucose however the utilized operational conditions that proved to favor the growth of paos over gaos in previous studies i e ph of 7 0 od of 20 and an hrt of 16 h seem to have successfully prevented the over proliferation of gaos in our system carvalheira et al 2014 lópez vázquez et al 2008 hence to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter can putatively utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to biologically remove phosphate 5 mg l of net p removal cod p mg mg removal ratio of 100 6 3 lastly the substantial discrepancy in relative abundance numbers observed between the two molecular methods has been discussed before by rubio rincón et al 2019 and valverde pérez et al 2016 who suggested that the studies should be supplemented with microbial activity measures in this study we carried out proteome and metagenome analyses to further elucidate the microbial composition and behavior 4 3 glucose utilization and storage concerning this study s phosphorus uptake two rates were present for each cycle and batch test fig 2 table 1 and fig 3 the primary rate encompassed the first hour of aerobic conditions and was twice as big as the secondary rate on the one hand this fact coincides with the usual observations from systems enriched with ca accumulibacter where the phosphate uptake rate depends on the fraction of polyphosphate stored welles et al 2017 however as mentioned before the 18 6 and 7 8 mg po4 p g vss h for the primary and secondary rates respectively indicate a noteworthy 58 difference which has not been reported before according to the metabolism of ca accumulibacter the phosphate uptake capacity is not solely affected by the poly p content as described by welles et al 2017 but is also affected by the utilization of the stored organic carbon henze et al 2000 the recognized storage carbons or paos are mainly phas phb phv ph2mv and ph2mb and glycogen the pha compound ultimately stored will depend on the carbon source utilized and the number of available electrons smolders et al 1994a for instance if there are enough electrons for the uptake and conversion of acetate then only phb will be produced and the tca cycle is not needed fig 6 guedes da silva et al 2020 since this is usually not the case the glyoxylate shunt is generally activated to produce reducing equivalents and as a consequence other phas are also produced guedes da silva et al 2020 in line with this different studies using propionate as the carbon source have generally reported slower phosphate uptake rates than studies fed with acetate oehmen et al 2005 rubio rincón et al 2017 as acetate yields phb and propionate more reduced than the first yields both phb and phv the stored polymer could explain the aerobic phosphate uptake difference oehmen et al 2005 therefore the change in aerobic uptake rates reported in this study could be explained by the presence of at least two organic storage polymers the different oxidation rates of these polymers would in turn be reflected by a disparate phosphorus uptake rate nevertheless contrary to propionate which is more reduced than acetate the oxidation state of glucose is equal to acetate table 8 thus the formation of phv from glucose via the known pyruvate tca cycle seems unlikely these results then lead to two hypothetical pathways either glucose is stored as glycogen or directly or indirectly fermented first to acetate by either ca accumulibacter or the possible ancillary microorganisms fermented to pyruvate and stored as pha fig 6 analyzing these hypotheses by combining the results of the annotated mag and the metaproteomic analysis we found that all of the genes and enzymes involved in the emp pathway of the glycolysis glycogen synthesis phb phv and ph2mb synthesis were either encoded or expressed by ca accumulibacter tables 3 and 5 in accordance with previous reports kristiansen et al 2013 oyserman et al 2016 thus from an enzymatic point of view ca accumulibacter expressed the necessary enzymes to store glucose as glycogen or pha since the intracellular dynamics of both glycogen and pha synthesis were induced together with the generated phosphorus release and poly p dynamics taking this into consideration we propose the glucose utilization pathway by ca accumulibacter as the most likely of the stated hypotheses fig 6 moreover it seems that the organism can perform both metabolic pathways storage and fermentation of glucose the turn on off function might depend on the anaerobically required and aerobically produced atp in this matter metabolically speaking storing glucose as pha would generate atp on the other hand storing glucose as glycogen would require atp fig 6 in principle the atp needed to store these compounds could be balanced by 50 of the glucose stored as glycogen and the remaining 50 stored as pha at the same time the excess nadh produced via pha storage could be utilized to form phv and ph2mv instead of phb if that were the case poly p hydrolysis would be unnecessary as it only generates atp during the process moreover as a ratio of 0 26 mol p mol c was observed in this study batch test performed solely with glucose it is not adequate postulation hence considering that glucose is a c6 molecule and 1 mol of atp is generated per mol of p hydrolyzed smolders et al 1994b ca accumulibacter can generate 1 5 mol of atp per mol of glucose via the poly p hydrolysis and the mol p mol c ratio observed in this study neglecting the atp needed for other anaerobic processes e g maintenance infers that about 75 of the glucose could be stored as glycogen using the atp provided via poly p hydrolysis the remaining 25 could be stored partially as glycogen and pha by balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage as aforementioned this should be related to the anaerobic atp utilization and aerobic atp formation the atp generation from an organic compound is related to its cod content and the carbon s oxidation state smolders et al 1994b concerning this matter as presented in table 8 glycogen is more reduced than pha while in principle the cod is anaerobically conserved by the paos the energy that could be generated from the oxidation of 1 mol of glycogen with respect to 1 mol of pha would be higher this difference even if unlikely could well explain why the observed growth yield of ca accumulibacter in this study is higher than those reported in previous studies table 7 finally atp s conservation would not be the only decisive factor in the storage polymer another potential factor would be the storage capacity of the organism for instance glycogen is stored within the cytoplasm while pha is stored as a long carbon chain hence the storage of the first would occupy more space as compared to pha within the available space of the organism and could play a significant role in further deciding how glucose could be stored and as such in influencing if the organism performs the hydrolysis of poly p or not unfortunately this study cannot unequally determine how much glucose has been stored as glycogen and how much as pha hence it is recommended that any follow up studies should use c labeled carbons 5 conclusions a noteworthy ebpr performance in terms of phosphorous removal and overall kinetic and stoichiometric parameters was achieved in a lab scale srt fed with glucose and acetate 1 1 ratio the dominant member was the microorganism ca accumulibacter responsible for consuming approximately 80 of the fed carbon sources the glucose was hypothesized to be directly stored by this organism predominantly as glycogen and partially as pha utilizing the atp provided via the hydrolysis of poly p and balancing its atp utilization glycogen generation and formation pha storage other possible explanations are also discussed to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a reactor enriched with ca accumulibacter relative

the target compound severely inhibited nitrification the biomass normalized nitrification rate decreased four fold in the presence of quinoline the inhibition was relieved by bioaugmenting comamonas testosteroni or rhodococcus ruber to the nitrifying biomass because the inhibition was derived from a quinoline intermediate 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq not quinoline itself nitrification was accelerated only after 2hq disappeared due to the addition of r ruber or c testosteroni r ruber was superior to c testosteroni for 2hq biodegradation and accelerating nitrification besides accelerating nitrification adding c testosteroni or r ruber led to the enrichment of nitrospira which appeared to be carrying out commamox metabolism since ammonium oxidizing bacteria were not enriched graphical

slow growing autotrophic bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2020 sterngren et al 2020 chaali et al 2021 drewnowski et al 2021 in addition nitrifying bacteria are sensitive to inhibition from recalcitrant organic compounds with the inhibition inactivating or further slowing the growth of the nitrifiers suszek opatka et al 2016 rochmah et al 2020 because many wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive effluents containing inhibitory compounds from chemical or pharmaceutical facilities the input of these un pretreated wastewaters can lead to failure of nitrification and total n removal deng et al 2017 tong et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is difficult to recover nitrification activity quickly because the nitrifiers grow slowly rittmann and mccarty 2020 a strategy to accelerate the resumption of nitrification activity is to replace damaged sludge with biomass that is acclimated to the toxicants zou et al 2019 even better would be to acclimate the biomass to the toxicants on a routine basis zou et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 both strategies have been successfully applied for recovering the activity of activated sludge damaged from inputs of phenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp and para nitrophenol pnp zou et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2021 activated sludge acclimated to phenol 2 4 6 tcp and pnp protected the nitrifiers by relieving toxicity from the three toxicants despite success in the prior studies many questions remain to be resolved for example was the input organic molecule or one of its biodegradation intermediates the main inhibitor of the nitrifiers are specific bacterial strains out of the entire community of the acclimated activated sludge especially effective at relieving inhibition in particular if a specific strain were the dominant source of detoxification cultivating it may be less costly than maintaining an entire culture of acclimated biomass here we target quinoline a nitrogenous heterocyclic compound to investigate how it inhibits nitrifiers and how isolated heterotrophic bacteria can relieve the inhibition quinoline is used in the synthesis of drugs and dyes as well as a solvents and analytical reagent felczak et al 2016 zhu et al 2021b quinoline also is one of the main components in coking wastewater xu et al 2017 which might be discharged into municipal sewers and reach wwtps lyu et al 2020 full quinoline biodegradation or mineralization requires a series of steps and the first two steps usually are mono oxygenation reactions bai et al 2015 zhu et al 2021a fig s1 in supplementary information shows the full biotransformation and mineralization pathway for quinoline and 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq is the main intermediate of quinoline mono oxygenation bai et al 2015 2hq also is used as a pharmaceutical feedstock which suggests that 2hq could exhibit inhibition to microorganisms what we do not know is if quinoline or 2hq plays the main role of inhibiting nitrifying bacteria we utilized two strains of heterotrophic bacteria that were isolated from quinoline acclimated activated sludge based on their ability to biodegrade quinoline zhu et al 2021a 2021b in this work we used them for accelerating nitrification by relieving inhibition we specifically investigated how the heterotrophic bacteria relieved inhibition to nitrification include whether quinoline or 2hq was the dominant inhibitor 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals and media preparation all chemicals were purchased from titan technology co ltd in shanghai a volume of 3 55 ml of pure quinoline liquid was diluted into 1 l of deionized water to obtain a quinoline stock solution of 30 mm a 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq stock solution was prepared by diluting 29 mg 2hq in 1 l the trace element solution was prepared as in zhu et al 2021a 2021b the mineral salts medium contained 0 25 g nah2po4 0 75 g k2hpo4 0 2 g mgso4 7h2o 0 006 g cacl2 0 001 g feso4 7h2o and 2 ml trace element solution were diluted in 1 l deionized water the

deionized water all solutions above were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before use 2 2 acclimation of nitrifying sludge activated sludge was taken from aeration tank at changqiao wastewater treatment plant of shanghai before acclimation the sludge was washed three times to remove impurities zhu et al 2021a 2021b acclimation was carried in three stages at 30 c and with a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 6 7 mg l for each stage 700 ml of spent medium was replaced with the same volume of fresh medium daily by pouring supernatant out after settling for 30 min the first stage was operated for one week during which 0 3 g glucose 1 8 ml ammonium chloride stock 14 6 mgn l 5 ml phosphate buffer solution and 2 ml trace element solution together with 300 ml sludge were fed into 1 l of medium in cylinder that was aerated the second stage was operated for ten days during which the same amount of trace element solution and buffer as the first stage were added but glucose addition was gradually decreased to zero while the ammonium chloride stock solution addition was stepwise increased up 5 ml about 40 mgn l the third stage was operated for one month during which the amount of trace element solution and buffer addition was still the same as the second stage no glucose was added and the ammonium chloride stock solution addition was still 5 ml about 40 mgn l after the three stages of acclimation the biomass was highly active in nitrification during all following experiments the acclimated sludge was continuously cultured so that fresh acclimated sludge could be utilized for every experiment 2 3 preparation of strain suspension we cultured two bacterial strains that our group had enriched based on their ability to biodegrade quinoline and its biotransformation products comamonas testosteroni mw130858 and rhodococcus ruber mw433738 zhu et al 2021a 2021b culturing of these strains was carried out in 250 ml conical flask in two stages all culture processes were operated in thermostatic oscillator at 30 c and 150 rpm in the first stage the two strains were separately inoculated in 100 ml inorganic culture medium from agar slant culture medium and 3 3 ml quinoline stock was simultaneously added into the medium after three days no quinoline was detected and then the strains were enriched by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min in the second stage the enriched strains were transferred into fresh inorganic culture media separately and 5 ml of quinoline stock was added into the same volume of fresh medium after one days quinoline was no longer detected and the biomass was settled and further concentrated by centrifugation the concentrated biomass was then washed three times using sterilized mineral salt medium zhu et al 2021b finally the strains were diluted with the sterilized normal saline to obtain a bacterial suspension with od600 1 51 0 05 2 4 nitrification and quinoline biodegradation experiments to assess nitrification and quinoline biodegradation were carried out in three sets 1 acclimated nitrifying sludge was used for nitrification rates with and without quinoline addition 2 c testosteroni and r ruber were separately added into the acclimated nitrifying sludge to investigate how c testosteroni and r ruber increased nitrification rates in the presence of quinoline 3 c testosteroni and r ruber were used for biodegradation of 2hq all experiments were carried out in a 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of medium initial ammonium and quinoline concentrations were 20 mg n l 1 4 mm and 32 25 mg l 0 25 mm respectively and the concentration of acclimated nitrifying sludge was 4 5 gdw l for set 1 and 3 0 gdw l plus 0 8 gdw l of c testosteroni or r ruber for set 2 the volume of the bacterial suspension solution was 15 v v corresponding to 0 8 gdw l in set 3 the conical flasks were put in a thermostatic oscillator at 30 c ph 7 8 8 0 and 150 rpm for these experiments during which samples were taken at one half hour or one hour intervals to measure ph volume nh4 n no2 n no3 n quinoline and 2hq each experiment was repeated two times to evaluate if the data were statistically different between the two experiments we calculated t values using the t test lu et al 2019 2020 for the three sets of experiments the acclimated nitrifying sludge was washed with tap water every time before the next experiment to remove nitrate or nitrite retained from the preceding experiment the washing method was the same as for the acclimation of sludge in section 2 2 2 5 comparison of quinoline and 2 hydroxyl quinoline for their toxicity different initial concentrations 0 15 mm 1 5 mm of quinoline and its intermediate 2hq were assayed by the luminescence of vibrio qinghaiensis to compare their toxicity the assay steps were fully the same at yu et al 2022b except that nitrobenzene and o aminophenol were replaced with quinoline and 2hq 2 6 high throughput sequencing after sets 1 and 2 were completed three samples the normal nitrifying sludge as control designated ns biomass with c testosteroni added designated ns c and biomass with r ruber added designated ns r were immediately submitted to personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china for high throughput sequencing the steps for dna extraction and sequencing were the same as that was described by zhu et al 2021b the dna concentration and purity were detected by nanodrop 2000 and the quality of dna extract was detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttragttt 3 were the upstream and downstream primers for pcr amplification to the variable region of bacterial 16s rrna gene v3 and v4 2 7 analytical methods all liquid samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm membrane filter before measurement a hplc model ultimate 3000 usa was used for measuring quinoline and 2hq at a wavelength of 275 nm for quinoline and 254 nm for 2hq the reversed phase column was zorbax sb c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm agilent the mobile phase was methanol water 70 30 v v with rate of 1 ml min and column temperature was the same 30 c ammonium nitrate and nitrite were measured with an ion chromatograph having a dionex ics 5000 dionex u s column biomass was measured by using ultraviolet spectrophotometer model uv 2550 shimadzu japan at 600 nm wavelength i e od600 total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cpn japan was used for measurement of total organic carbon toc for biomass dry weight the washed acclimated sludge of 20 ml was fed into a crucible that was dried at 105 c in oven for 12 h and then the dried residue was weighted by using electronic balance model mettler toledo oh usa after cooling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of quinoline on nitrification rates top panel of fig 1 shows nh4 n removal with and without quinoline added the bottom panel of fig 1 shows that no3 n was generated stoichiometrically in parallel with nh4 n removal thus confirming nitrification negligible nitrite n was detected which means that the no3 n generation rates also represented the nitrification rates zou et al 2019 2020 all nh4 n removal rates were fit well by zero order kinetics and the biomass normalized nitrification rate decreased four fold in the presence of quinoline 1 2 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 for without quinoline added versus 0 3 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 with quinoline added 3 2 c testosteroni and r ruber accelerated nitrification in order to relieve inhibition c testosteroni and r ruber 0 8 gdw l were separately added into the acclimated sludge 3 g dw l together with the medium containing nh4 n and quinoline the results shown in fig 2 demonstrate that the rates of nh4 n removal and no3 n generation rates were very small before 1 h for r ruber addition and 3 h for c testosteroni addition however nitrification accelerated rapidly after 1 h or 3 h biomass normalized nitrification rates were 1 3 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 and 1 9 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 corresponding to 0 8 gdw l of r ruber and c testosteroni added into 3 0 gdw l of acclimated sludge in the presence of an initial quinoline concentration of 0 25 mm comparing the results in figs 1 and 2 the normalized nitrification rates were respectively 4 3 and 6 3 fold greater for additions of r ruber and c testosteroni in the presence of an initial quinoline concentration of 0 25 mm quinoline clearly r ruber and c testosteroni relieved inhibition from quinoline the results of fig 3 explain why addition of r ruber or c testosteroni relieved inhibition quinoline added into the medium was completely biodegraded within 1 5 h in both cases the zero order kinetics of quinoline removal was the same for both 0 16 mm h however the intermediate 2hq had different fates with r ruber 2hq accumulated to only about 0 025 mm in the first 0 5 h and it disappeared by 1 h in contrast for c testosteroni addition 2hq accumulated up to 0 2 mm at 1 to 1 5 h before disappearing by 3 h this shows that the kinetics of the second mono oxygenation reaction in quinoline biodegradation fig s1 bai et al 2015 were faster than the kinetics of the first mono oxygenation reaction when r ruber was present this raises the hypothesis that the relevant functional genes were different between r ruber and c testosteroni comparing fig 2 with fig 3 makes it clear that nitrification did not accelerate until 2hq disappeared completely this implies that the inhibition of nitrification was more closely linked to 2hq than to quinoline fig s2 in supporting information shows that addition of r ruber led to 79 removal of total organic carbon toc in 2 h compared to 71 removal for c testosteroni addition and 13 removal with no addition thus the toc removals support that r ruber was more effective at mineralizing added quinoline which requires that 2hq be oxidized by the second mono oxygenation reaction fig s1 3 3 comparison of quinoline and 2hq inhibitions fig 4 shows how increasing concentrations of quinoline and 2hq increased inhibition to v qinghaiensis sp li et al 2017 yu et al 2022a 2hq had stronger inhibition particularly for the low concentration range the inhibition with v qinghaisnsis results are consistent with 2hq having stronger inhibition to nitrifying bacteria 3 4 rates of 2hq biodegradation r ruber and c testosteroni were evaluated for their ability to biodegrade 2hq as shown in fig 5 r ruber was superior to c testosterone for 2hq biodegradation r ruber had a 2hq removal rate that was 56 faster than with c testosterone this supports why 2hq disappeared within 1 h for r ruber but took 3 h for c testosterone fig 3 all calculated t values of figs 1 5 were larger than t0 005 2 9 9248 which means that bioaugmentation led to faster rates with a confidence level of 99 5 3 5 microbial communities in the nitrifying biomass fig 6 presents the abundances for top 25 bacterial genera unique 16s rdna sequences for ns nitrifying sludge ns c nitrifying sludge plus c testosteroni and ns r nitrifying sludge plus r ruber for sample ns comamonas and rhodococcus were only 0 5 and 0 2 respectively but comamonas increased to 12 0 in ns c and rhodococcus to 5 9 in ns r due to their additions comamonas also increased in ns r 3 9 and rhodococcus increased to 5 5 in ns c the best explanation for this phenomenon is that c testosteroni or r ruber created an improved environment for rhodococcus and comamonas by relieving inhibition to them alternatively it has been reported that rhodococcus was associated with nitrification and denitrification since nitrate and nitrite generated with ammonium oxidation disappeared chen et al 2012 wang et al 2022 however nitrate generation was equal to ammonium loss which indicates that denitrification was not active in addition rhodococcus played an important role in biodegrading quinoline intermediates as shown in fig s1 of si such as 2 8 dihydroxyl quinoline zhu et al 2008 which can explain why 2hq accumulated less for ns r than ns c fig 3 because abundance of rhodococcus in ns r was higher than that in ns c the nitrite oxidizing genus nitrospira al ajeel et al 2022 was important in ns 12 6 but increased substantially with relief of inhibition in ns c 22 4 and ns r 27 3 these trends further support that c testosteroni and r ruber relieved the inhibition from quinoline and especially 2hq to nitrification that nitrospira increased more for r ruber addition than c testosteroni addition is consistent with r ruber being better at relieving inhibition clearly ammonium oxidation to nitrite was occurring as nitrate production equaled ammonium loss however known ammonium oxidizing bacteria were not present among the 25 dominant species in ns ns c or ns r even though nitrification kinetics and the abundance of nitrospira increased in ns c and n r the most likely reason is that nitrospira was carrying out commamox combined ammonium and nitrite oxidation daims et al 2015 al ajeel et al 2022 genera chujaibacter and rhodanobacter were highly abundant in ns but declined in ns c and ns r chujaibacter was important in soils contaminated with polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and showed a significant positive correlation with pfas concentrations senevirathna et al 2022 the chemical structure of pfas is different from quinoline which suggests that chujaibacter was not involved quinoline biodegradation wu et al 2022 reported that the genus chujaibacter has potential for lindane degradation however lindane also is structurally different from quinoline the most likely explanation for the relative declines in chujaibacter is that r ruber or c testosteroni became more abundant rhodanobacter existed in soils containing veterinary antibiotics vas and heavy metals zhang et al 2022 huang et al 2019 found that rhodanobacter co existed in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr together with other genera that had functions for oxidizing hg0 nitrification and denitrification the relative abundance of rhodanobacter did not change greatly after c testosteroni or r ruber addition which suggests that rhodanobacter was not involved quinoline biodegradation 4 conclusion nitrification was inhibited in the presence of quinoline but the inhibition could be relieved by adding c testosteroni or r ruber to the acclimated nitrifying biomass several types of evidence showed that the main inhibitor was 2hq the first product of quinoline mono oxygenation not quinoline thus rapid biotransformation of 2hq by a second mono oxygenation reaction was the key to relieving inhibition and r ruber was superior to c testersteroni for the second mono oxygenation analysis of microbiological communities showed that abundance of comamonas and rhodococcus increased after c testosteroni or r ruber was added into ns which created an environment favorable for nitrification only one nitrifying genus nitrospira had high abundance and increased with addition of r ruber or c testeroni which suggests that nitrospira was carrying out commamox metabolism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15243,because many wastewater treatment plants receive effluents containing inhibitory compounds from chemical or pharmaceutical facilities the input of these inhibitors can lead to failure of nitrification and total n removal nitrification de facto is the more important process as it is the first step of nitrogen removal and involves slow growing autotrophic bacteria in this work quinoline the target compound severely inhibited nitrification the biomass normalized nitrification rate decreased four fold in the presence of quinoline the inhibition was relieved by bioaugmenting comamonas testosteroni or rhodococcus ruber to the nitrifying biomass because the inhibition was derived from a quinoline intermediate 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq not quinoline itself nitrification was accelerated only after 2hq disappeared due to the addition of r ruber or c testosteroni r ruber was superior to c testosteroni for 2hq biodegradation and accelerating nitrification besides accelerating nitrification adding c testosteroni or r ruber led to the enrichment of nitrospira which appeared to be carrying out commamox metabolism since ammonium oxidizing bacteria were not enriched graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification nitrifier quinoline bio inhibition biodegradation 1 introduction nitrogen removal a pressing topic in wastewater treatment yu et al 2022a oliveira et al 2021 usually is realized by combining nitrification and denitrification nitrification de facto is the more important process as it is the first step of nitrogen removal and involves slow growing autotrophic bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2020 sterngren et al 2020 chaali et al 2021 drewnowski et al 2021 in addition nitrifying bacteria are sensitive to inhibition from recalcitrant organic compounds with the inhibition inactivating or further slowing the growth of the nitrifiers suszek opatka et al 2016 rochmah et al 2020 because many wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive effluents containing inhibitory compounds from chemical or pharmaceutical facilities the input of these un pretreated wastewaters can lead to failure of nitrification and total n removal deng et al 2017 tong et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is difficult to recover nitrification activity quickly because the nitrifiers grow slowly rittmann and mccarty 2020 a strategy to accelerate the resumption of nitrification activity is to replace damaged sludge with biomass that is acclimated to the toxicants zou et al 2019 even better would be to acclimate the biomass to the toxicants on a routine basis zou et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 both strategies have been successfully applied for recovering the activity of activated sludge damaged from inputs of phenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp and para nitrophenol pnp zou et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2021 activated sludge acclimated to phenol 2 4 6 tcp and pnp protected the nitrifiers by relieving toxicity from the three toxicants despite success in the prior studies many questions remain to be resolved for example was the input organic molecule or one of its biodegradation intermediates the main inhibitor of the nitrifiers are specific bacterial strains out of the entire community of the acclimated activated sludge especially effective at relieving inhibition in particular if a specific strain were the dominant source of detoxification cultivating it may be less costly than maintaining an entire culture of acclimated biomass here we target quinoline a nitrogenous heterocyclic compound to investigate how it inhibits nitrifiers and how isolated heterotrophic bacteria can relieve the inhibition quinoline is used in the synthesis of drugs and dyes as well as a solvents and analytical reagent felczak et al 2016 zhu et al 2021b quinoline also is one of the main components in coking wastewater xu et al 2017 which might be discharged into municipal sewers and reach wwtps lyu et al 2020 full quinoline biodegradation or mineralization requires a series of steps and the first two steps usually are mono oxygenation reactions bai et al 2015 zhu et al 2021a fig s1 in supplementary information shows the full biotransformation and mineralization pathway for quinoline and 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq is the main intermediate of quinoline mono oxygenation bai et al 2015 2hq also is used as a pharmaceutical feedstock which suggests that 2hq could exhibit inhibition to microorganisms what we do not know is if quinoline or 2hq plays the main role of inhibiting nitrifying bacteria we utilized two strains of heterotrophic bacteria that were isolated from quinoline acclimated activated sludge based on their ability to biodegrade quinoline zhu et al 2021a 2021b in this work we used them for accelerating nitrification by relieving inhibition we specifically investigated how the heterotrophic bacteria relieved inhibition to nitrification include whether quinoline or 2hq was the dominant inhibitor 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals and media preparation all chemicals were purchased from titan technology co ltd in shanghai a volume of 3 55 ml of pure quinoline liquid was diluted into 1 l of deionized water to obtain a quinoline stock solution of 30 mm a 2 hydroxyl quinoline 2hq stock solution was prepared by diluting 29 mg 2hq in 1 l the trace element solution was prepared as in zhu et al 2021a 2021b the mineral salts medium contained 0 25 g nah2po4 0 75 g k2hpo4 0 2 g mgso4 7h2o 0 006 g cacl2 0 001 g feso4 7h2o and 2 ml trace element solution were diluted in 1 l deionized water the medium was sterilized at 121 c and 0 10 0 15 mpa for 20 min the ammonium chloride stock solution was prepared by diluting 30 8 g ammonium chloride in 1 l deionized water 0 58 m the sodium bicarbonate stock solution was prepared by diluting 48 g sodium bicarbonate in 1 l deionized water 0 57 m a 0 19 m phosphate buffer solution was prepared by diluting 26 1 g k2hpo4 and 5 11 g kh2po4 in 1 l deionized water all solutions above were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before use 2 2 acclimation of nitrifying sludge activated sludge was taken from aeration tank at changqiao wastewater treatment plant of shanghai before acclimation the sludge was washed three times to remove impurities zhu et al 2021a 2021b acclimation was carried in three stages at 30 c and with a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 6 7 mg l for each stage 700 ml of spent medium was replaced with the same volume of fresh medium daily by pouring supernatant out after settling for 30 min the first stage was operated for one week during which 0 3 g glucose 1 8 ml ammonium chloride stock 14 6 mgn l 5 ml phosphate buffer solution and 2 ml trace element solution together with 300 ml sludge were fed into 1 l of medium in cylinder that was aerated the second stage was operated for ten days during which the same amount of trace element solution and buffer as the first stage were added but glucose addition was gradually decreased to zero while the ammonium chloride stock solution addition was stepwise increased up 5 ml about 40 mgn l the third stage was operated for one month during which the amount of trace element solution and buffer addition was still the same as the second stage no glucose was added and the ammonium chloride stock solution addition was still 5 ml about 40 mgn l after the three stages of acclimation the biomass was highly active in nitrification during all following experiments the acclimated sludge was continuously cultured so that fresh acclimated sludge could be utilized for every experiment 2 3 preparation of strain suspension we cultured two bacterial strains that our group had enriched based on their ability to biodegrade quinoline and its biotransformation products comamonas testosteroni mw130858 and rhodococcus ruber mw433738 zhu et al 2021a 2021b culturing of these strains was carried out in 250 ml conical flask in two stages all culture processes were operated in thermostatic oscillator at 30 c and 150 rpm in the first stage the two strains were separately inoculated in 100 ml inorganic culture medium from agar slant culture medium and 3 3 ml quinoline stock was simultaneously added into the medium after three days no quinoline was detected and then the strains were enriched by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min in the second stage the enriched strains were transferred into fresh inorganic culture media separately and 5 ml of quinoline stock was added into the same volume of fresh medium after one days quinoline was no longer detected and the biomass was settled and further concentrated by centrifugation the concentrated biomass was then washed three times using sterilized mineral salt medium zhu et al 2021b finally the strains were diluted with the sterilized normal saline to obtain a bacterial suspension with od600 1 51 0 05 2 4 nitrification and quinoline biodegradation experiments to assess nitrification and quinoline biodegradation were carried out in three sets 1 acclimated nitrifying sludge was used for nitrification rates with and without quinoline addition 2 c testosteroni and r ruber were separately added into the acclimated nitrifying sludge to investigate how c testosteroni and r ruber increased nitrification rates in the presence of quinoline 3 c testosteroni and r ruber were used for biodegradation of 2hq all experiments were carried out in a 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of medium initial ammonium and quinoline concentrations were 20 mg n l 1 4 mm and 32 25 mg l 0 25 mm respectively and the concentration of acclimated nitrifying sludge was 4 5 gdw l for set 1 and 3 0 gdw l plus 0 8 gdw l of c testosteroni or r ruber for set 2 the volume of the bacterial suspension solution was 15 v v corresponding to 0 8 gdw l in set 3 the conical flasks were put in a thermostatic oscillator at 30 c ph 7 8 8 0 and 150 rpm for these experiments during which samples were taken at one half hour or one hour intervals to measure ph volume nh4 n no2 n no3 n quinoline and 2hq each experiment was repeated two times to evaluate if the data were statistically different between the two experiments we calculated t values using the t test lu et al 2019 2020 for the three sets of experiments the acclimated nitrifying sludge was washed with tap water every time before the next experiment to remove nitrate or nitrite retained from the preceding experiment the washing method was the same as for the acclimation of sludge in section 2 2 2 5 comparison of quinoline and 2 hydroxyl quinoline for their toxicity different initial concentrations 0 15 mm 1 5 mm of quinoline and its intermediate 2hq were assayed by the luminescence of vibrio qinghaiensis to compare their toxicity the assay steps were fully the same at yu et al 2022b except that nitrobenzene and o aminophenol were replaced with quinoline and 2hq 2 6 high throughput sequencing after sets 1 and 2 were completed three samples the normal nitrifying sludge as control designated ns biomass with c testosteroni added designated ns c and biomass with r ruber added designated ns r were immediately submitted to personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china for high throughput sequencing the steps for dna extraction and sequencing were the same as that was described by zhu et al 2021b the dna concentration and purity were detected by nanodrop 2000 and the quality of dna extract was detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttragttt 3 were the upstream and downstream primers for pcr amplification to the variable region of bacterial 16s rrna gene v3 and v4 2 7 analytical methods all liquid samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm membrane filter before measurement a hplc model ultimate 3000 usa was used for measuring quinoline and 2hq at a wavelength of 275 nm for quinoline and 254 nm for 2hq the reversed phase column was zorbax sb c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm agilent the mobile phase was methanol water 70 30 v v with rate of 1 ml min and column temperature was the same 30 c ammonium nitrate and nitrite were measured with an ion chromatograph having a dionex ics 5000 dionex u s column biomass was measured by using ultraviolet spectrophotometer model uv 2550 shimadzu japan at 600 nm wavelength i e od600 total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l cpn japan was used for measurement of total organic carbon toc for biomass dry weight the washed acclimated sludge of 20 ml was fed into a crucible that was dried at 105 c in oven for 12 h and then the dried residue was weighted by using electronic balance model mettler toledo oh usa after cooling 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of quinoline on nitrification rates top panel of fig 1 shows nh4 n removal with and without quinoline added the bottom panel of fig 1 shows that no3 n was generated stoichiometrically in parallel with nh4 n removal thus confirming nitrification negligible nitrite n was detected which means that the no3 n generation rates also represented the nitrification rates zou et al 2019 2020 all nh4 n removal rates were fit well by zero order kinetics and the biomass normalized nitrification rate decreased four fold in the presence of quinoline 1 2 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 for without quinoline added versus 0 3 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 with quinoline added 3 2 c testosteroni and r ruber accelerated nitrification in order to relieve inhibition c testosteroni and r ruber 0 8 gdw l were separately added into the acclimated sludge 3 g dw l together with the medium containing nh4 n and quinoline the results shown in fig 2 demonstrate that the rates of nh4 n removal and no3 n generation rates were very small before 1 h for r ruber addition and 3 h for c testosteroni addition however nitrification accelerated rapidly after 1 h or 3 h biomass normalized nitrification rates were 1 3 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 and 1 9 mg n g biomass 1 h 1 corresponding to 0 8 gdw l of r ruber and c testosteroni added into 3 0 gdw l of acclimated sludge in the presence of an initial quinoline concentration of 0 25 mm comparing the results in figs 1 and 2 the normalized nitrification rates were respectively 4 3 and 6 3 fold greater for additions of r ruber and c testosteroni in the presence of an initial quinoline concentration of 0 25 mm quinoline clearly r ruber and c testosteroni relieved inhibition from quinoline the results of fig 3 explain why addition of r ruber or c testosteroni relieved inhibition quinoline added into the medium was completely biodegraded within 1 5 h in both cases the zero order kinetics of quinoline removal was the same for both 0 16 mm h however the intermediate 2hq had different fates with r ruber 2hq accumulated to only about 0 025 mm in the first 0 5 h and it disappeared by 1 h in contrast for c testosteroni addition 2hq accumulated up to 0 2 mm at 1 to 1 5 h before disappearing by 3 h this shows that the kinetics of the second mono oxygenation reaction in quinoline biodegradation fig s1 bai et al 2015 were faster than the kinetics of the first mono oxygenation reaction when r ruber was present this raises the hypothesis that the relevant functional genes were different between r ruber and c testosteroni comparing fig 2 with fig 3 makes it clear that nitrification did not accelerate until 2hq disappeared completely this implies that the inhibition of nitrification was more closely linked to 2hq than to quinoline fig s2 in supporting information shows that addition of r ruber led to 79 removal of total organic carbon toc in 2 h compared to 71 removal for c testosteroni addition and 13 removal with no addition thus the toc removals support that r ruber was more effective at mineralizing added quinoline which requires that 2hq be oxidized by the second mono oxygenation reaction fig s1 3 3 comparison of quinoline and 2hq inhibitions fig 4 shows how increasing concentrations of quinoline and 2hq increased inhibition to v qinghaiensis sp li et al 2017 yu et al 2022a 2hq had stronger inhibition particularly for the low concentration range the inhibition with v qinghaisnsis results are consistent with 2hq having stronger inhibition to nitrifying bacteria 3 4 rates of 2hq biodegradation r ruber and c testosteroni were evaluated for their ability to biodegrade 2hq as shown in fig 5 r ruber was superior to c testosterone for 2hq biodegradation r ruber had a 2hq removal rate that was 56 faster than with c testosterone this supports why 2hq disappeared within 1 h for r ruber but took 3 h for c testosterone fig 3 all calculated t values of figs 1 5 were larger than t0 005 2 9 9248 which means that bioaugmentation led to faster rates with a confidence level of 99 5 3 5 microbial communities in the nitrifying biomass fig 6 presents the abundances for top 25 bacterial genera unique 16s rdna sequences for ns nitrifying sludge ns c nitrifying sludge plus c testosteroni and ns r nitrifying sludge plus r ruber for sample ns comamonas and rhodococcus were only 0 5 and 0 2 respectively but comamonas increased to 12 0 in ns c and rhodococcus to 5 9 in ns r due to their additions comamonas also increased in ns r 3 9 and rhodococcus increased to 5 5 in ns c the best explanation for this phenomenon is that c testosteroni or r ruber created an improved environment for rhodococcus and comamonas by relieving inhibition to them alternatively it has been reported that rhodococcus was associated with nitrification and denitrification since nitrate and nitrite generated with ammonium oxidation disappeared chen et al 2012 wang et al 2022 however nitrate generation was equal to ammonium loss which indicates that denitrification was not active in addition rhodococcus played an important role in biodegrading quinoline intermediates as shown in fig s1 of si such as 2 8 dihydroxyl quinoline zhu et al 2008 which can explain why 2hq accumulated less for ns r than ns c fig 3 because abundance of rhodococcus in ns r was higher than that in ns c the nitrite oxidizing genus nitrospira al ajeel et al 2022 was important in ns 12 6 but increased substantially with relief of inhibition in ns c 22 4 and ns r 27 3 these trends further support that c testosteroni and r ruber relieved the inhibition from quinoline and especially 2hq to nitrification that nitrospira increased more for r ruber addition than c testosteroni addition is consistent with r ruber being better at relieving inhibition clearly ammonium oxidation to nitrite was occurring as nitrate production equaled ammonium loss however known ammonium oxidizing bacteria were not present among the 25 dominant species in ns ns c or ns r even though nitrification kinetics and the abundance of nitrospira increased in ns c and n r the most likely reason is that nitrospira was carrying out commamox combined ammonium and nitrite oxidation daims et al 2015 al ajeel et al 2022 genera chujaibacter and rhodanobacter were highly abundant in ns but declined in ns c and ns r chujaibacter was important in soils contaminated with polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and showed a significant positive correlation with pfas concentrations senevirathna et al 2022 the chemical structure of pfas is different from quinoline which suggests that chujaibacter was not involved quinoline biodegradation wu et al 2022 reported that the genus chujaibacter has potential for lindane degradation however lindane also is structurally different from quinoline the most likely explanation for the relative declines in chujaibacter is that r ruber or c testosteroni became more abundant rhodanobacter existed in soils containing veterinary antibiotics vas and heavy metals zhang et al 2022 huang et al 2019 found that rhodanobacter co existed in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr together with other genera that had functions for oxidizing hg0 nitrification and denitrification the relative abundance of rhodanobacter did not change greatly after c testosteroni or r ruber addition which suggests that rhodanobacter was not involved quinoline biodegradation 4 conclusion nitrification was inhibited in the presence of quinoline but the inhibition could be relieved by adding c testosteroni or r ruber to the acclimated nitrifying biomass several types of evidence showed that the main inhibitor was 2hq the first product of quinoline mono oxygenation not quinoline thus rapid biotransformation of 2hq by a second mono oxygenation reaction was the key to relieving inhibition and r ruber was superior to c testersteroni for the second mono oxygenation analysis of microbiological communities showed that abundance of comamonas and rhodococcus increased after c testosteroni or r ruber was added into ns which created an environment favorable for nitrification only one nitrifying genus nitrospira had high abundance and increased with addition of r ruber or c testeroni which suggests that nitrospira was carrying out commamox metabolism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15244,well functioning and stable microbial communities are critical for the operation of activated sludge as wastewater treatment plants wwtps bioaugmentation represents a potentially useful approach to recover deteriorated systems or to support specific as processes but its application in full scale wwtps is generally problematic we conducted a massive transplantation in one day exchanging as from a donor to a recipient full scale wwtp with similar process type biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and performance but with differences in microbial community structure the treatment performance in the recipient plant was not compromised and the effluent quality remained stable the as community structure of the recipient plant was initially very similar to the donor as but it almost completely restored the pre transplantation structure approximately 40 days after transplantation corresponding to 3 times the solid retention time most of the unique species of donor as added to recipient as disappeared quickly although some disappeared more slowly the following months indicating some survival and potentially a time limited function in the recipient plant moreover the addition in higher abundance of most species already present in the recipient as e g the polyphosphate accumulating organisms or the reduction of the abundance of unwanted bacteria e g filamentous bacteria in the recipient plant was not successful moreover we observed similar abundance patterns after transplantation for species belonging to different functional guilds so we did not observe an increase of the functional redundancy investigations of the microbial community structure in influent wastewater revealed that for some species the abundance trends in the recipient plant were closely correlated to their abundance in the influent we showed that a very resilient microbial community was responsible for the outcome of the transplantation of as at full scale wwtp potentially as a consequence of mass immigration from influent wastewater the overall results imply that massive transplantation of as across different wwtps is not a promising strategy to permanently solve operational problems however by choosing a compatible as donor short term mitigation of serious operational problems may be possible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

process these problems include poor solid liquid separation due to filamentous microorganisms poor nitrification or challenges with biological removal of phosphorus johnston et al 2019 kristensen et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2020a wágner et al 2015 bioaugmentation has the potential to address some of these issues by adding selected microorganisms pure cultures or mixed consortia to the process tanks in order to improve operation or restore a collapsed activated sludge process dueholm et al 2015 nguyen et al 2018 in this case bioaugmentation by mixed cultures has been successfully applied to improve the nitrification process stenström and la cour jansen 2016 for the start up of full scale activated sludge processes guo et al 2010 and for the removal of pollutants from industrial wastewaters in lab scale nzila et al 2016 applications of bioaugmentation are also well known for other ecosystems such as sediments treated for the recovery from organic pollutants e g payne et al 2019 or such as the human gut to introduce well functioning microbial communities into patients with an unhealthy community in the first case a successful treatment can be characterised by the establishment of the exogenous strain in the local community despite the cell abundance of the augmented microbes decreased after bioaugmentation xu et al 2022 in the second case faecal transplantation of the human gut can be effective in treating clostridium difficile infections and other gastrointestinal problems gupta et al 2016 to our knowledge a full scale activated sludge transplantation has never been performed to evaluate whether it can be used for establishing a more healthy community in a wwtp facing operational problems bioaugmentation acts as an artificial colonization or invasion event and depending on its extent it may represent a great disturbance for the local community the local microbial community composition may remain unaffected resistant be temporarily affected but restore its original profile after some time resilient or be permanently affected even if maintaining the original process performance redundant allison and martiny 2008 such patterns have been reported in literature for different ecosystems shade et al 2012 showed that a lake microbial community affected by a major disturbance was able to recover without any permanent effect in contrast vuono et al 2016 found significant differences in the community composition and diversity in an activated sludge system pre and post disturbance event a successful bioaugmentation or transplantation in wwtps implies a partial or total change of composition of the receiving local microbial community maintaining process performance therefore resembling the case of functional redundancy even if bioaugmentation might be immediately beneficial for the local community the persistence over time of the bioaugmented bacteria is often problematic lab scale studies report that the establishment of invading communities depends on for example inoculum density or invaders abundance predation due to protozoan grazing and bacteriophages infection invaders turnover niche availability competition and higher diversity of invaders compared to local communities kinnunen et al 2016 nzila et al 2016 the role of bacterial mass immigration from influent wastewater in wwtps is rarely taken into account in relation to bioaugmentation vuono et al 2016 reported that during disturbance of an activated sludge system colonization of immigrating bacteria from the influent was successful in some cases while several activated sludge taxa not present in influent wastewater were definitively washed out from the system in a recent study we reported that in addition to biotic and abiotic parameters mass immigration can have a high impact on full scale as community assembly dottorini et al 2021 thus given the open system character of full scale wwtps mass immigration may affect the outcome of bioaugmentation to evaluate the impact of disturbance on the microbial community structure of a full scale wwtp we performed a massive bioaugmentation in the form of activated sludge transplantation in a full scale wwtp which to our knowledge has not been reported before we identified two plants in denmark and we exchanged 75 of activated sludge biomass from one plant donor to the other plant recipient the selected plants had the same process design biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal the same overall operation but some differences in community structure first we evaluated how such massive disturbance affected the performance and the overall microbial community structure of the recipient plant secondly we evaluated the outcome of transplantation successful or unsuccessful considering activated sludge community resilience and functional redundancy the successful outcome of transplantation included the possibility to retain in the recipient plant new species introduced from the donor plant unique species and the possibility to boost or mitigate shared species present in both plants e g to increase functional redundancy within important functional guilds or remove unwanted filamentous bacteria lastly we evaluated the influence of bacterial mass immigration from influent wastewater for the transplantation outcome these findings provided guidance about the possibility to carry out a full scale transplantation to solve operational problems in an as system and practical insights about the resilience of activated sludge microbial community 2 methods 2 1 characteristics of recipient donor wwtp and transplantation process the two full scale wwtps involved in transplantation were both located in odense denmark the recipient plant 36 000 pe was odense nordøst and the donor plant 410 000 pe was ejby mølle both plants were operated with biodenipho nitrogen removal and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr however they differed in the presence of the pre clarifier only present at the donor wwtp and for the received fraction of industrial wastewater 55 of cod in donor and 20 in recipient plant but the characteristics of the influent wastewater iww of the two wwtps were very similar table s1 si the sludge transplantation was carried out within a few hours in one day by trucks 20th april 2017 7 00 22 30 activated sludge of the recipient plant was emptied as much as was practically possible approx 75 of the biomass and it was filled up with activated sludge from the donor plant fig s1 si thus the new sludge composition in the recipient wwtp consisted of approx 25 original recipient activated sludge and 75 of donor activated sludge 2 2 chemical analysis and calculations process parameters were collected from both wwtps

sequencing variant asv using the midas 3 database and the autotax automated method dueholm et al 2020 to obtain midas 3 taxonomy nierychlo et al 2020b the database relies on high quality full length 16s rrna gene sequences derived from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems and it proposes unique placeholder names for almost all microorganisms to species level allowing proper identification and characterization of the microbial composition in wwtps in case of presence of unclassified species the species name was assigned combining the asv level together with the first available taxonomic level dottorini et al 2021 2 4 bioinformatics visualization ordination and data analysis were performed in r studio the ampvis2 r package andersen et al 2018 was used to load the asvs read counts table into r with its corresponding taxonomy and samples metadata samples below a minimum of 10 000 reads as well as positive and negative pcr control samples were removed yielding a

and to generate the plots are available at https github com giudott transplantation study 2 5 data pre processing prior to formal analyses the read count table was transformed to relative read abundance calculated within sample afterwards the dataset was grouped into ten sample groups table s2 si based on specific time intervals of interest within the donor and recipient plant species with a mean normalized abundance smaller than 0 01 in all ten sample groups were filtered out the species nocardioides midas s 1344 and midas g 67 asv4043 were excluded because they had increasing abundance only in the final 8 samples taken from the recipient plant denoted as r as after late in table s2 si and therefore were considered not relevant for the evaluation of transplantation the filtered dataset used for the analysis resulted in 135 samples composed of 2118 classified and unclassified species 2 6 statistical methods principal component analysis pca modeling was used i to monitor the development of the community structure in the recipient community in response to transplantation and ii to evaluate the impact of immigration in all pca models used in this manuscript the abundance values were standardized and the number of principal components was selected to explain 70 of the total variance of the standardized values each pca model in addition to conventional results such as scores and loadings also contained vector with mean values and vector with standard deviations computed for the trained data to study the development of recipient community to transplantation i samples from the donor and recipient activated sludge tanks before transplantation namely d as before and r as before where each considered to represent the steady states of each microbial community before the onset of disturbance we assumed that the state of the recipient microbial community following transplantation could be captured by studying the variance covariance structure of its abundance profile i e relative abundance data using principal component analysis specifically two independent pca models were developed one from the d as before and the other from the r as before then the measurements of species abundances from each of the three sample groups corresponding to activated sludge of recipient after transplantation namely r as after early r as after intermediate and r as after late were projected onto each pca model the measurements were standardized using mean and standard deviation of the models the inter relationship between the individual species measurements and each model were assessed using three statistics orthogonal score and total distances i e cooman s plot and visualized through distance plots pomerantsev and rodionova 2014 rodionova et al 2021 all three distance statistics were used to assess from a qualitative point of view how similar the abundance profile of a given sample was to the set of abundance profiles used for creating a corresponding pca model in this way it was possible to assess in relation to the entire dataset how close the abundance profile of a sample group of interest e g a sample from r as after late was to the profile of each of the two reference systems r as before and d as before the preliminary projection of species abundance from r as after to d as before model highlighted the presence of an outlier sample activated sludge of recipient on day 22 characterized by abnormally high relative read abundance of some species which was removed from the dataset and the analysis was repeated to evaluate the impact of immigration ii independent pca models were created for each of the 10 sample groups table s2 si using the same procedure as for the previous analysis a matrix with model distances was then computed for each pair wise combination of models by calculating a ratio of residual variances let ma be a pca model created for a dataset a and mb is a model created for a dataset b in this case one can compute following residual variances vaa residual variance computed for dataset a being projected to model ma vba residual variance computed for dataset b being projected to model ma vab residual variance computed for dataset a being projected to model mb vbb residual variance computed for dataset b being projected to model mb the distance between the models a and b can be then computed as d a b v a b v b a v a a v b b in this analysis a small distance between two models indicates that pca model created for one training set e g ma will largely explain the variation of the second training set e g b and vice versa this is possible when the two datasets have similar variance covariance structure i e two identical models have distance close to a value of 1 in order to gain insight into how individual species contributed to the model distances a discrimination power analysis was employed wold and sjöström 1977 we identified species that contributed to similarity in variance covariance structure of the two pairs of models r iww r as before and r iww r as after late by performing a discrimination power analysis and selected species with discrimination power below a threshold of 10 in both pairs in order to avoid the selection of inert species i e those which do not contribute to the individual models and thus will also have small discrimination power we also calculated for each species a variable of importance on projection score chong and jun 2005 only species with non zero vip scores were taken into account in the discrimination power analysis finally we evaluated the pearson linear correlation of the scaled mean centered relative read abundance of these selected species in 17 iww and as paired samples of recipient these samples were paired by date with maximum 3 days apart considering that the variation in iww would be reflected in as within 3 days 2 7 species residence time calculation we grouped the species added to recipient activated sludge based on their residence time after the transplantation by modeling the change in the relative read abundance of added species according to a first order kinetic model we considered activated sludge process tanks as ideal continuously stirred tank reactors and we assumed that the total biomass concentration was constant so the change of the concentration of a species over time was proportional to the species s relative read abundance therefore the relative read abundance of the added species j xj could be described as follow 1 d x j d t k x j where xj is the model fitted relative read abundance of the species j t is the time in days of the sampling point which the relative read abundance corresponds to k is first order rate constant integrating eq 1 for the rate constant over time the species relative read abundance fitted in the model is calculated as follow 2 x j x j m i n x j m a x e x p k t t 0 where xj min is the lowest relative read abundance of the species measured after transplantation xj max is the highest relative read abundance of the species measured after transplantation t0 is equal to 0 days referring to the day of transplantation the model was implemented in r studio using the non linear regression function nlm from the stats package the first order kinetic constant k was estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors the species residence time was then calculated as inverse of the first order kinetic constant from eq 2 as follow 3 s p e c i e s r e s i d e n c e t i m e 1 k to evaluate the correspondence between data and model the pearson linear correlation coefficient function cor test in r package stats r core team 2019 was computed between the species relative read abundance and the model fitted relative read abundance obtained from eq 2 along with the corresponding p value the species with significant correlation coefficients were used to visualize the density distribution of residence times to find a meaningful threshold for grouping the species detailed codes used for also this analysis are available at https github com giudott transplantation study 2 8 total sludge retention time calculation in order to compare the species residence time with the process operation of the recipient plant we calculated the daily total sludge retention time srt of the recipient plant as follow 4 s r t x i v r w a s i where x sludge biomass in the process tank expressed in total solids ts kgts m3 and measured daily for each i sampling day from 475 to 203 days of transplantation vr total volume of the two process tanks here 1750 m3 for each of the two process tanks wasi wasted activated sludge biomass expressed in ts kgts d and measured for each i sampling day from 475 to 203 days of transplantation 3 results 3 1 process performance of recipient plant remained stable with transplantation the transplantation of 75 of the activated sludge biomass in one single day was followed closely in the recipient plant to monitor possible changes in plant performance or effluent quality the effluent quality in terms of total cod total n nh4 no3 total p po4 3 and tss was not affected and was stable after the transplantation fig 1 some variations in the effluent quality were observed but they resembled the variations observed during the pre transplantation stage settling properties of the as in the process tank of the recipient plant represented by the dsvi started to deteriorate just before the transplantation rise in dsvi and continued to do so afterwards followed by an improvement this indicated poorer settleability of the as in the recipient plant both right before and after the transplantation the dsvi in the donor plant was higher between 130 200 ml g than the recipient plant prior to the transplantation fig s3 si the transplantation of this as biomass likely contributed to the rise in dsvi and worsening of the settling conditions in the recipient plant right after the transplantation removal of cod n and p remained stable after the transplantation overall these results indicated that the transplanted as biomass could carry out all key processes also in the recipient plant 3 2 the overall microbial community of recipient was resilient to transplantation 3 2 1 community structure of donor and recipient as the as microbial community structure in recipient r as and donor d as was different before and after transplantation except for an increased similarity in the early stage after transplantation days from 0 to 40 as shown by the complementary results from the nmds visualization fig 2 a and pca models fig 2b the microbial community structure of r as and d as before transplantation between days 140 and 1 was substantially different as highlighted by the separate clustering of all r as and all d as samples in nmds plot fig 2a and by the largest orthogonal distances within and across the pca models fig 2b figs s4a si s5a si these differences were reflected by the presence of species only ever seen in one plant with an average relative read abundance 0 01 referred here as unique species fig 3 a and by the different abundance of shared taxa fig 3b however the plants were characterized by approximately the same number of species with average abundance 0 01 and most of them were present in both plants fig 3a these shared species included the top 5 most abundant genera typically found in danish as wwtps trichococcus ca microthrix tetrasphaera rhodoferax and rhodobacter fig 3b these genera as examples of the whole communities showed before transplantation either similar changes of abundance over time in both plants e g tetrasphaera or showed abundance variations over time in one plant only e g rhodoferax fig s6 si the community structure in iww of both plants was also overall similar with distinct differences fig s7 si despite the different percentage of industrial load the transplantation of as from donor to recipient between days 1 and 1 induced a temporal change in the microbial community of the r as which was greater than the seasonal change observed over time in both as communities fig 2a in fact in both plants the first and last collected samples cluster close to each other after a time span of approximately 365 days indicating the recurrency of as microbial communities over the years nierychlo et al 2020a peces et al 2022 however the transplantation disrupted in r as the temporal development observed in d as moreover we observed an increase of the number of shared species between r as and d as approx 100 species more after transplantation and a decrease of the number of unique species in d as approx 50 species the number of unique species in r as remained instead approximately unchanged fig 3a both nmds and pca models suggested three stages of the overall microbial community in r as fig 2 figs s4 si s5 si in the early stage from day 1 to 40 r as had the highest similarity to d as community but r as started to diverge quickly from d as in the intermediate stage days from 40 to 150 r as diverged slowly from d as progressively increasing the similarity to r as before transplantation thus slowly restoring the pre transplantation community structure and establishing a new community steady state in the late stage after transplantation from days 150 onwards in the intermediate late stage after transplantation from day 40 the top 5 most abundant genera of as including process critical e g tetrasphaera were still present in high abundance in both plants suggesting that the main process functions were maintained fig 3b throughout all the sampling points after transplantation the differences between r as samples and r as model progressively decreased while conversely the differences between r as samples and d as model progressively increased figs s4 si s5 si these results suggested that although the as community composition of r as became more similar to d as community as a consequence of the transplantation the microbial composition of r as showed resilience quickly transitioning towards the pre transplantation r as community structure all through the sampling points 3 3 transplanted species in recipient plant showed different patterns of resilience 3 3 1 transplantation of unique and abundant species was retained only temporarily to evaluate the impact of transplantation at species level we investigated the possibility to add and maintain in r as abundant species which were not present before transplantation unique species in d as among the 402 unique species in d as fig 3a we identified species in d as with a relative read abundance higher than 0 1 49 species on average before transplantation the unique species could be grouped based on their residence time within the recipient plant into species with low medium and high residence time including 27 14 and 8 species respectively after transplantation most of these species 41 out of 49 83 7 had an overall residence time of 42 7 25 5 days table s3 si corresponding to approximately 3 times the srt of 15 days of the recipient plant fig s7 si therefore these species with low and medium residence time fig 4 were removed from the r as almost like inert particles in as among the added species with high residence time fig 4 only a few unique species 4 5 were maintained in r as at the introduced abundance which was anyway low in r as 0 1 other species with high residence time showed a progressively decreasing abundance in r as indicating inability to be retained in the recipient plant fig 4 fig s8 si whether or not these species were ultimately removed from r as is not known due to the lack of further sampling points to evaluate the possibility to mitigate bulking problems of full scale wwtps we investigated as well the possibility to remove abundant but unwanted bacteria such as certain filamentous bacteria we selected 14 unique and abundant 0 1 species present in r as including filamentous species which were removed by the transplantation also in this case most species restored the pre transplantation abundance after 1 2 months while few other species stayed in r as but in low abundance fig s9 si 3 3 2 the functional redundancy of species within guilds could not be boosted to evaluate the possibility to increase and boost the functional redundancy of microbial communities in wwtps we investigated the abundance variation over time of species belonging to guilds paos gaos nitrifiers filaments which were added to r as with transplantation these species were either not present in r as before transplantation unique species of d as or were present in both r as and d as shared species in the first case transplantation would increase the functional redundancy within their guild in the second case transplantation would boost the abundance and the redundancy within the guild the 53 shared species belonging to guilds were present in similar and or low abundances in both plants except for some of the most abundant species fig 5 we focused on species within the pao guild because they had well pronounced differences in abundances in r as and d as fig 5 and because of the key importance of paos for the two ebpr as systems the added unique and shared species belonging to paos did not remain in r as at the transplanted abundance but gradually restored their pre transplantation abundance within 200 days fig 6 this indicated that unique and shared pao species e g tetrasphaera midas s 220 and tetrasphaera midas s 5 could not thrive in the r as at the transplanted abundance the results for paos confirmed previous observations at species level and we found similar results for species belonging to the other guilds figs s10 si s11 si in particular we consistently observed the lack of establishment of transplanted abundances i e resilience of microbial community in r as for different species within the same guild fig 6 fig s10 si e g tetrasphaera midas s 5 and tessaracoccus midas s 307 within paos different species within the same genus e g t midas s 45 and t elongata within tetrasphaera genus fig s10 si different genera within the same guild e g tetrasphaera dechloromonas ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus among paos fig s10 si 3 4 immigration from the wastewater may affect the community resilience of recipient to evaluate if the resilience of r as community to transplantation was influenced by microbial mass immigration we investigated the overall microbial community structure of influent wastewater of donor d iww and recipient r iww in relation to d as and r as sample groups table s2 si d iww and r iww were more similar to each other throughout the whole sampling period than compared to their corresponding d as and r as samples model distance 20 comparing as models to each of the two iww models the overall microbial community structure of r as and d as throughout time early intermediate and late stage was more similar to its own influent r iww and d iww respectively as indicated for example by a lower distance of all r as sample groups to r iww model compared to the distance of d as samples to r iww model fig 7 even if this is less obvious for the donor plant the results suggested that the microbial structure of recipient as was reflected by the structure of iww from the same plant after transplantation the microbial community of r as in the early stage became more similar to both r iww and d iww compared to before transplantation the distance of r as before and r as after early to r iww and to d iww model decreases from 95 6 2 9 to 65 2 0 9 and from 222 5 11 3 to 139 5 2 3 respectively probably as a consequence of transplantation however from the intermediate until the late stage after transplantation r as community already restored the similarity to r iww almost to the same level as before the transplantation r as before this confirmed the results seen previously for r as sample groups fig 2 figs s4 si s5 si and suggested that continuous immigration of bacteria from r iww might play a role in maintaining the overall community structure of r as also after transplantation to evaluate at species level the impact of immigration for transplantation we investigated the abundance trend of species in both r iww and r as interestingly we found that for some species the abundance trend in as resembled the abundance trend in iww over time as indicated by the pearson linear correlation coefficient of their scaled abundance which was significantly high for some species e g ruminococcaceae asv3228 ca microthrix parvicella tetrasphaera midas s 5 fig 8 the relative read abundance of species in iww was generally much lower than in the as but even when lower than 0 01 it showed a strong linear correlation with abundance in r as among the top 5 species contributing the most to the similarity between r as before and r as after late some had a significant strong correlation with iww abundance e g ruminococcaceae asv3228 fig 8a for the unique species of donor added to r as e g ca amarolinea midas s 1 the linear correlation of abundances was not strong probably because these species were generally absent in the r iww and could not contribute to maintaining the transplanted abundance in r as fig 8b fig s12 si the well known filamentous and foaming genera ca microthrix and gordonia included species with a strong abundance correlation between r iww and r as r 0 7 fig 8c indicating a strong impact of the iww 4 discussion to explore the impact of disturbance on the microbial community structure of a full scale wwtp we carried out a massive bioaugmentation in the form of as biomass transplantation between two full scale wwtps with nutrient removal the two wwtps had overall the same design operation and functional guilds representing a perfect test case for biomass transplantation with the aim to evaluate how a massive disturbance affects resilience and functional redundancy of the recipient microbial community this provided practical insights about the possibility to exchange taxa to increase or boost the functional redundancy within functional guilds introducing new species and to change the abundance levels of wanted or unwanted species to improve process performance the microbial community of as recipient demonstrated overall an unexpectedly strong resilience to the transplantation disturbance and restored almost completely its pre transplantation structure composition and abundance within a short time 1 2 months contrary to what was found in other disturbance responses of as systems vuono et al 2015 we hypothesize that a longer period of observation than the one of 6 months shown in this study would have shown a full restoration of the pre transplantation community structure even if minor differences could be expected moreover despite the temporary changes of community structure after transplantation the recipient community was able to ensure stability of process performances likely through functional redundancy of the local and transplanted community as shown in other studies wang et al 2021 the transient worsening of the settling properties in the recipient plant right after the transplantation were probably due to an increasing content of the filamentous ca microthrix both in the transplanted as from donor which also had a higher dsvi than the recipient and in the recipient itself where the abundance of ca microthrix started to increase before transplantation nierychlo et al 2020b wágner et al 2022 our overall results were in contrast to studies of successful establishment of new immigrating colonizer bacteria in wwtp after disturbance vuono et al 2016 but are in accordance with studies that acknowledged the difficulty to successfully implement bioaugmentation in full scale wwtps herrero and stuckey 2015 park et al 2008 our results indicated that the resilience of the as recipient community was characterized by the lack of establishment of the vast majority of the added new species by removing 75 of the original as biomass the added new species transplanted from a plant with similar conditions ebpr niche were expected to be able to grow and to outcompete the local communities in recipient 25 of biomass as a consequence of higher population size both relative read abundance and biomass concentration herrero and stuckey 2015 kinnunen et al 2016 however the results showed that most of the unique species of donor plant added to the recipient plant new species for the recipient were progressively removed from the recipient with a removal rate often resembling the one of inert particles that is by following the srt of the recipient plant this suggested that the newly added species added were not able to occupy a niche and or to compete with the local existing community in fact even if the same function can be carried out by alternative taxa as an effect of functional redundancy it is known that environmental factors can shape the possibility to grow of a certain taxonomic group within a functional group louca et al 2018 in our case environmental conditions such as the organic load the inorganic composition of influent wastewater and the operational parameters were very similar in both donor and recipient plant the industrial load of the plants was different and we do not have detailed information about the organic composition but we do not expect this to play a major role in shaping the communities in as and iww as the overall community structure was very similar in donor and recipient plant before transplantation moreover the engineering resilience of the as system against a disturbance was already observed and it was proposed to occur through ecological resilience which is the selection of bacteria able to restore the condition before disturbance pérez et al 2019 similarly our results indicated that the local community was resilient and we did not observe the boost of functional redundancy within guilds by permanently changing the abundance of transplanted species shared between the two plants such as unwanted filamentous bacteria ca microthrix and gordonia and species from functional guilds such as the paos an alternative explanation for the outcome of the transplantation is the role of microbial immigration recently we described that immigration strongly affects both composition and abundance of community members in as dottorini et al 2021 which could explain the very strong resilience of as systems and consequently the unsuccessful bioaugmentation studies reported also elsewhere in particular the abundance of species in as correlated well either with the abundance of the same species in iww or with the abundance of a group of species in iww the latter being the case of the majority of species in as dottorini et al 2021 similarly our results are partially in accordance with the first case where the abundance of some species in as of recipient supported by immigration correlated well with the species abundance in iww such as for species belonging to guilds while the second case was not investigated here the unique species found in as of each plant were presumably only present in the as plants because they were continuously added by their respective iww as indicated by the high similarity in pca model between communities of as and iww within the same plant we hypothesize that when the unique species of activated sludge from the donor were transplanted to the recipient plant they were either washed out or progressively removed because their presence in as was not supported by continuous immigration from the recipient iww similarly the abundance of some species in as of recipient supported by immigration correlated well with the species abundance in iww such as for species belonging to guilds disentangling the factors affecting the outcome of transplantation was however difficult for several reasons first it was practically not possible to remove the whole activated sludge biomass of the recipient plant but 25 of the biomass remained in the recipient plant thus potentially masking the real impact of transplantation at species level secondly the microbial community of many as plants exhibit strong temporal seasonal variations griffin and wells 2017 peces et al 2022 that may mask other processes such as the transplantation in our study both as plants showed some seasonal variations both at the overall community level and at species level as for ca microthrix which is indeed known to increase in abundance in spring nierychlo et al 2021 thus it was difficult to assess whether abundance variations after transplantation for some species were caused by transplantation or normal seasonal variations finally but not less importantly analyses of the microbial community structure in iww is difficult as the species that are growing in the as are present only in very low abundance in the iww often close to detection level and therefore difficult to quantify dottorini et al 2021 however as discussed above our observations provided support to the hypothesis that immigration could potentially be responsible for the outcome of transplantation where the lack of persistence of a newly added species to the as recipient could be explained by the lack of continuous immigration of that species from iww the strong resilience of the recipient as community implies that the application of a one time transplantation in a suspended growth system such as as wwtps does not represent a proper long term solution to possible operational problems as our results suggest this is likely due to the effect of mass immigration from the recipient plant but the influence of organic compounds in influent unknown in this study could not be excluded however importantly the fact that the overall operational performance of the recipient plant was not impaired by the transplantation indicated that the activity of the transplanted community worked very well over time despite the disturbance probably because of intrinsic functional redundancy partially determined by the immigration this suggested that for example severe operational problems at wwtps related to the microbial activity e g community deterioration caused by the presence of toxic chemicals could be temporarily solved altering a compromised or problematic community structure by adding significant amounts of compatible biomass and so possibly mitigating full scale problems in addition transplantation could be applied to speed up the performance of newly constructed as plants similarly to bioaugmentation approaches guo et al 2010 in both examples the transplanted community should ideally be as similar as possible compatible to the receiving as community before the break down or start up however when this is not possible as from a plant with similar process design and or similar functional guilds could also help to restore or initiate its function for these applications a database covering community composition of wwtps in the same region or country would be useful to evaluate the best match between plants with the criteria just mentioned such database exists for danish wwtps as part of the midas project where we have recorded the normal community structure and temporal variations for several years nierychlo et al 2020a the database represents the starting point to explore theoretical and practical aspects of microbial ecology in as systems such as as transplantation 5 conclusions we conducted a massive transplantation of activated sludge between two full scale wwtps with similar process type biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and performance but with some differences in microbial community structure the microbial community in the recipient plant showed a strong resilience and most of the community structure was restored within 1 2 months the treatment performance was not compromised and the effluent quality remained stable we did not observe a stable addition of new species to potentially introduce new functions or to boost functional redundancy moreover we did not observe a permanent increase of the abundance of shared species e g the paos nor a reduction of the abundance of unwanted bacteria e g filamentous bacteria in the recipient plant the microbial community structure of as suggested a close connection to their respective iww communities which may explain the high resilience of the plant microbial immigration is therefore an important aspect to consider for the application of transplantation applications and bioaugmentation in general in as systems even if the community structure cannot be permanently altered massive bioaugmentation of as across different wwtps may solve acute operational problems by selecting a compatible as donor plant which should have the same functional guilds similar process design and operation and if possible similar immigrating community authors contributions phaln msb and mn designed the full scale experiment phenn and msb

15244,well functioning and stable microbial communities are critical for the operation of activated sludge as wastewater treatment plants wwtps bioaugmentation represents a potentially useful approach to recover deteriorated systems or to support specific as processes but its application in full scale wwtps is generally problematic we conducted a massive transplantation in one day exchanging as from a donor to a recipient full scale wwtp with similar process type biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and performance but with differences in microbial community structure the treatment performance in the recipient plant was not compromised and the effluent quality remained stable the as community structure of the recipient plant was initially very similar to the donor as but it almost completely restored the pre transplantation structure approximately 40 days after transplantation corresponding to 3 times the solid retention time most of the unique species of donor as added to recipient as disappeared quickly although some disappeared more slowly the following months indicating some survival and potentially a time limited function in the recipient plant moreover the addition in higher abundance of most species already present in the recipient as e g the polyphosphate accumulating organisms or the reduction of the abundance of unwanted bacteria e g filamentous bacteria in the recipient plant was not successful moreover we observed similar abundance patterns after transplantation for species belonging to different functional guilds so we did not observe an increase of the functional redundancy investigations of the microbial community structure in influent wastewater revealed that for some species the abundance trends in the recipient plant were closely correlated to their abundance in the influent we showed that a very resilient microbial community was responsible for the outcome of the transplantation of as at full scale wwtp potentially as a consequence of mass immigration from influent wastewater the overall results imply that massive transplantation of as across different wwtps is not a promising strategy to permanently solve operational problems however by choosing a compatible as donor short term mitigation of serious operational problems may be possible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

al 2020 nierychlo et al 2020a wágner et al 2015 bioaugmentation has the potential to address some of these issues by adding selected microorganisms pure cultures or mixed consortia to the process tanks in order to improve operation or restore a collapsed activated sludge process dueholm et al 2015 nguyen et al 2018 in this case bioaugmentation by mixed cultures has been successfully applied to improve the nitrification process stenström and la cour jansen 2016 for the start up of full scale activated sludge processes guo et al 2010 and for the removal of pollutants from industrial wastewaters in lab scale nzila et al 2016 applications of bioaugmentation are also well known for other ecosystems such as sediments treated for the recovery from organic pollutants e g payne et al 2019 or such as the human gut to introduce well functioning microbial communities into patients with an unhealthy community in the first case a successful treatment can be characterised by the establishment of the exogenous strain in the local community despite the cell abundance of the augmented microbes decreased after bioaugmentation xu et al 2022 in the second case faecal transplantation of the human gut can be effective in treating clostridium difficile infections and other gastrointestinal problems gupta et al 2016 to our knowledge a full scale activated sludge transplantation has never been performed to evaluate whether it can be used for establishing a more healthy community in a wwtp facing operational problems bioaugmentation acts as an artificial colonization or invasion event and depending on its extent it may represent a great disturbance for the local community the local microbial community composition may remain unaffected resistant be temporarily affected but restore its original profile after some time resilient or be permanently affected even if maintaining the original process performance redundant allison and martiny 2008 such patterns have been reported in literature for different ecosystems shade et al 2012 showed that a lake microbial community affected by a major disturbance was able to recover without any permanent effect in contrast vuono et al 2016 found significant differences in the community composition and diversity in an activated sludge system pre and post disturbance event a successful bioaugmentation or transplantation in wwtps implies a partial or total change of composition of the receiving local microbial community maintaining process performance therefore resembling the case of functional redundancy even if bioaugmentation might be immediately beneficial for the local community the persistence over time of the bioaugmented bacteria is often problematic lab scale studies report that the establishment of invading communities depends on for example inoculum density or invaders abundance predation due to protozoan grazing and bacteriophages infection invaders turnover niche availability competition and higher diversity of invaders compared to local communities kinnunen et al 2016 nzila et al 2016 the role of bacterial mass immigration from influent wastewater in wwtps is rarely taken into account in relation to bioaugmentation vuono et al 2016 reported that during disturbance of an activated sludge system colonization of immigrating bacteria from the influent was successful in some cases while several activated sludge taxa not present in influent wastewater were definitively washed out from the system in a recent study we reported that in addition to biotic and abiotic parameters mass immigration can have a high impact on full scale as community assembly dottorini et al 2021 thus given the open system character of full scale wwtps mass immigration may affect the outcome of bioaugmentation to evaluate the impact of disturbance on the microbial community structure of a full scale wwtp we performed a massive bioaugmentation in the form of activated sludge transplantation in a full scale wwtp which to our knowledge has not been reported before we identified two plants in denmark and we exchanged 75 of activated sludge biomass from one plant donor to the other plant recipient the selected plants had the same process design biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal the same overall operation but some differences in community structure first we evaluated how such massive disturbance affected the performance and the overall microbial community structure of the recipient plant secondly we evaluated the outcome of transplantation successful or unsuccessful considering activated sludge community resilience and functional redundancy the successful outcome of transplantation included the possibility to retain in the recipient plant new species introduced from the donor plant unique species and the possibility to boost or mitigate shared species present in both plants e g to increase functional redundancy within important functional guilds or remove unwanted filamentous bacteria lastly we evaluated the influence of bacterial mass immigration from influent wastewater for the transplantation outcome these findings provided guidance about the possibility to carry out a full scale transplantation to solve operational problems in an as system and practical insights about the resilience of activated sludge microbial community 2 methods 2 1 characteristics of recipient donor wwtp and transplantation process the two full scale wwtps involved in transplantation were both located in odense denmark the recipient plant 36 000 pe was odense nordøst and the donor plant 410 000 pe was ejby mølle both plants were operated with biodenipho nitrogen removal and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr however they differed in the presence of the pre clarifier only present at the donor wwtp and for the received fraction of industrial wastewater 55 of cod in donor and 20 in recipient plant but the characteristics of the influent wastewater iww of the two wwtps were very similar table s1 si the sludge transplantation was carried out within a few hours in one day by trucks 20th april 2017 7 00 22 30 activated sludge of the recipient plant was emptied as much as was practically possible approx 75 of the biomass and it was filled up with activated sludge from the donor plant fig s1 si thus the new sludge composition in the recipient wwtp consisted of approx 25 original recipient activated sludge and 75 of donor activated sludge 2 2 chemical analysis and calculations process parameters were collected from both wwtps from 31 12 2015 to 08 11 2017 by means of online sensor data and laboratory measurements chemical analyses of biomass samples were performed at the laboratory of the wwtps nanocolor standard test kits from macherey nagel düren germany were used to measure cod chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen n total phosphorus p in the influent wastewater and effluent water measurements from influent and effluent were used to calculate cod removal n removal and p removal the spectrophotometer used for analysis was nanocolor uv vis ii from macherey nagel düren germany the online sensors used for the analysis of phosphate po4 3 ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and total suspended solids tss were analyzed by p700iq analyzer ammolyt plus 700 iq nitralyt plus 700 iq and visolid 700 iq from wtw xylem analytics weilheim germany respectively diluted sludge volume index dsvi was measured according to the standard methods apha et al 2012 2 3 bacterial community analysis and identification biomass samples of activated sludge as and influent wastewater iww from both full scale wwtp were collected regularly over one year fig s2 si table s2 si for a total of 135 samples as samples were collected from 01 12 2016 to 09 11 2017 as grab samples from the process tank after collection as samples were stored in 2 ml tubes iww samples were collected from 03 04 2017 to 26 07 2017 as subsamples of 24 h flow proportional samples approximately on the same day as activated sludge samples of the same plant after collection iww samples were stored in 50 ml tubes both as and iww samples were kept frozen at 20 c until analysis dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was performed for each collected as and iww samples detailed protocols for the dna extraction from activated sludge version aau wwtp dna v7 1 and wastewater influent version aau ww dna v1 0 can be found on https www midasfieldguide org guide protocols briefly prior to dna extraction 0 5 ml of activated sludge and 15 ml of influent wastewater samples were homogenized using heidolph rzr 2020 heidolph instruments germany with glass teflon tissue grinder 15 ml of influent wastewater samples were filtered through 0 2 µm polycarbonate membrane to immobilize bacteria for dna extraction dna extraction from both activated sludge and influent wastewater samples was performed using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa fastprep 24 mp biomedicals usa was used for bead beating of the samples for 4 times 40 s at 6 m s the extracted dna was stored at 20 c until library preparation bacterial v1 v3 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed for both the activated sludge and influent wastewater samples using the protocol aau b16s v1 2 available on https www midasfieldguide org guide protocols briefly the extracted dna quality was evaluated using nanodrop1000 thermo fisher scientific usa and with tapestation 2200 agilent usa gel electrophoresis the dna concentration was measured with qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa and on an infinite m1000 pro tecan switzerland microplate reader amplicon libraries were generated with v1 v3 primers with the following sequences 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 lane 1991 534r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 muyzer et al 1993 amplicon library pcr was run in duplicates for each sample with approximately 10 ng of extracted dna the pcr program was run at 95 c for 2 min then 30 cycles of 95 c for 20 s 56 c for 30 s 72 c for 60 s followed by at 72 c for 5 min the amplicon libraries were cleaned up and the samples were pooled the pooled library was sequenced on miseq illumina usa and the generated raw amplicon sequences were processed using ampproc5 1 workflow https github com eyashiro ampproc taxonomy was assigned to each amplicon sequencing variant asv using the midas 3 database and the autotax automated method dueholm et al 2020 to obtain midas 3 taxonomy nierychlo et al 2020b the database relies on high quality full length 16s rrna gene sequences derived from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems and it proposes unique placeholder names for almost all microorganisms to species level allowing proper identification and characterization of the microbial composition in wwtps in case of presence of unclassified species the species name was assigned combining the asv level together with the first available taxonomic level dottorini et al 2021 2 4 bioinformatics visualization ordination and data analysis were performed in r studio the ampvis2 r package andersen et al 2018 was used to load the asvs read counts table into r with its corresponding taxonomy and samples metadata samples below a minimum of 10 000 reads as well as positive and negative pcr control samples were removed yielding a dataset of 135 samples with 24 967 93 612 read counts mean 54 087 14 765 read counts per sample including 12 344 classified and unclassified species the main analysis was carried out as follow non metric multidimensional scaling nmds visualization analysis was performed with the ampvis2 package using bray curtis dissimilarity distance measure without data transformation visualization of time series data was performed with the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 heatmaps were generated with ampvis2 package andersen et al 2018 venn diagram were generated with ggvenndiagram package gao et al 2021 the scatterplots were generated with ggpubr package kassambara 2019 principal component analysis were performed using the mdatools r package kucheryavskiy 2020 detailed codes used to analyse the data and to generate the plots are available at https github com giudott transplantation study 2 5 data pre processing prior to formal analyses the read count table was transformed to relative read abundance calculated within sample afterwards the dataset was grouped into ten sample groups table s2 si based on specific time intervals of interest within the donor and recipient plant species with a mean normalized abundance smaller than 0 01 in all ten sample groups were filtered out the species nocardioides midas s 1344 and midas g 67 asv4043 were excluded because they had increasing abundance only in the final 8 samples taken from the recipient plant denoted as r as after late in table s2 si and therefore were considered not relevant for the evaluation of transplantation the filtered dataset used for the analysis resulted in 135 samples composed of 2118 classified and unclassified species 2 6 statistical methods principal component analysis pca modeling was used i to monitor the development of the community structure in the recipient community in response to transplantation and ii to evaluate the impact of immigration in all pca models used in this manuscript the abundance values were standardized and the number of principal components was selected to explain 70 of the total variance of the standardized values each pca model in addition to conventional results such as scores and loadings also contained vector with mean values and vector with standard deviations computed for the trained data to study the development of recipient community to transplantation i samples from the donor and recipient activated sludge tanks before transplantation namely d as before and r as before where each considered to represent the steady states of each microbial community before the onset of disturbance we assumed that the state of the recipient microbial community following transplantation could be captured by studying the variance covariance structure of its abundance profile i e relative abundance data using principal component analysis specifically two independent pca models were developed one from the d as before and the other from the r as before then the measurements of species abundances from each of the three sample groups corresponding to activated sludge of recipient after transplantation namely r as after early r as after intermediate and r as after late were projected onto each pca model the measurements were standardized using mean and standard deviation of the models the inter relationship between the individual species measurements and each model were assessed using three statistics orthogonal score and total distances i e cooman s plot and visualized through distance plots pomerantsev and rodionova 2014 rodionova et al 2021 all three distance statistics were used to assess from a qualitative point of view how similar the abundance profile of a given sample was to the set of abundance profiles used for creating a corresponding pca model in this way it was possible to assess in relation to the entire dataset how close the abundance profile of a sample group of interest e g a sample from r as after late was to the profile of each of the two reference systems r as before and d as before the preliminary projection of species abundance from r as after to d as before model highlighted the presence of an outlier sample activated sludge of recipient on day 22 characterized by abnormally high relative read abundance of some species which was removed from the dataset and the analysis was repeated to evaluate the impact of immigration ii independent pca models were created for each of the 10 sample groups table s2 si using the same procedure as for the previous analysis a matrix with model distances was then computed for each pair wise combination of models by calculating a ratio of residual variances let ma be a pca model created for a dataset a and mb is a model created for a dataset b in this case one can compute following residual variances vaa residual variance computed for dataset a being projected to model ma vba residual variance computed for dataset b being projected to model ma vab residual variance computed for dataset a being projected to model mb vbb residual variance computed for dataset b being projected to model mb the distance between the models a and b can be then computed as d a b v a b v b a v a a v b b in this analysis a small distance between two models indicates that pca model created for one training set e g ma will largely explain the variation of the second training set e g b and vice versa this is possible when the two datasets have similar variance covariance structure i e two identical models have distance close to a value of 1 in order to gain insight into how individual species contributed to the model distances a discrimination power analysis was employed wold and sjöström 1977 we identified species that contributed to similarity in variance covariance structure of the two pairs of models r iww r as before and r iww r as after late by performing a discrimination power analysis and selected species with discrimination power below a threshold of 10 in both pairs in order to avoid the selection of inert species i e those which do not contribute to the individual models and thus will also have small discrimination power we also calculated for each species a variable of importance on projection score chong and jun 2005 only species with non zero vip scores were taken into account in the discrimination power analysis finally we evaluated the pearson linear correlation of the scaled mean centered relative read abundance of these selected species in 17 iww and as paired samples of recipient these samples were paired by date with maximum 3 days apart considering that the variation in iww would be reflected in as within 3 days 2 7 species residence time calculation we grouped the species added to recipient activated sludge based on their residence time after the transplantation by modeling the change in the relative read abundance of added species according to a first order kinetic model we considered activated sludge process tanks as ideal continuously stirred tank reactors and we assumed that the total biomass concentration was constant so the change of the concentration of a species over time was proportional to the species s relative read abundance therefore the relative read abundance of the added species j xj could be described as follow 1 d x j d t k x j where xj is the model fitted relative read abundance of the species j t is the time in days of the sampling point which the relative read abundance corresponds to k is first order rate constant integrating eq 1 for the rate constant over time the species relative read abundance fitted in the model is calculated as follow 2 x j x j m i n x j m a x e x p k t t 0 where xj min is the lowest relative read abundance of the species measured after transplantation xj max is the highest relative read abundance of the species measured after transplantation t0 is equal to 0 days referring to the day of transplantation the model was implemented in r studio using the non linear regression function nlm from the stats package the first order kinetic constant k was estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors the species residence time was then calculated as inverse of the first order kinetic constant from eq 2 as follow 3 s p e c i e s r e s i d e n c e t i m e 1 k to evaluate the correspondence between data and model the pearson linear correlation coefficient function cor test in r package stats r core team 2019 was computed between the species relative read abundance and the model fitted relative read abundance obtained from eq 2 along with the corresponding p value the species with significant correlation coefficients were used to visualize the density distribution of residence times to find a meaningful threshold for grouping the species detailed codes used for also this analysis are available at https github com giudott transplantation study 2 8 total sludge retention time calculation in order to compare the species residence time with the process operation of the recipient plant we calculated the daily total sludge retention time srt of the recipient plant as follow 4 s r t x i v r w a s i where x sludge biomass in the process tank expressed in total solids ts kgts m3 and measured daily for each i sampling day from 475 to 203 days of transplantation vr total volume of the two process tanks here 1750 m3 for each of the two process tanks wasi wasted activated sludge biomass expressed in ts kgts d and measured for each i sampling day from 475 to 203 days of transplantation 3 results 3 1 process performance of recipient plant remained stable with transplantation the transplantation of 75 of the activated sludge biomass in one single day was followed closely in the recipient plant to monitor possible changes in plant performance or effluent quality the effluent quality in terms of total cod total n nh4 no3 total p po4 3 and tss was not affected and was stable after the transplantation fig 1 some variations in the effluent quality were observed but they resembled the variations observed during the pre transplantation stage settling properties of the as in the process tank of the recipient plant represented by the dsvi started to deteriorate just before the transplantation rise in dsvi and continued to do so afterwards followed by an improvement this indicated poorer settleability of the as in the recipient plant both right before and after the transplantation the dsvi in the donor plant was higher between 130 200 ml g than the recipient plant prior to the transplantation fig s3 si the transplantation of this as biomass likely contributed to the rise in dsvi and worsening of the settling conditions in the recipient plant right after the transplantation removal of cod n and p remained stable after the transplantation overall these results indicated that the transplanted as biomass could carry out all key processes also in the recipient plant 3 2 the overall microbial community of recipient was resilient to transplantation 3 2 1 community structure of donor and recipient as the as microbial community structure in recipient r as and donor d as was different before and after transplantation except for an increased similarity in the early stage after transplantation days from 0 to 40 as shown by the complementary results from the nmds visualization fig 2 a and pca models fig 2b the microbial community structure of r as and d as before transplantation between days 140 and 1 was substantially different as highlighted by the separate clustering of all r as and all d as samples in nmds plot fig 2a and by the largest orthogonal distances within and across the pca models fig 2b figs s4a si s5a si these differences were reflected by the presence of species only ever seen in one plant with an average relative read abundance 0 01 referred here as unique species fig 3 a and by the different abundance of shared taxa fig 3b however the plants were characterized by approximately the same number of species with average abundance 0 01 and most of them were present in both plants fig 3a these shared species included the top 5 most abundant genera typically found in danish as wwtps trichococcus ca microthrix tetrasphaera rhodoferax and rhodobacter fig 3b these genera as examples of the whole communities showed before transplantation either similar changes of abundance over time in both plants e g tetrasphaera or showed abundance variations over time in one plant only e g rhodoferax fig s6 si the community structure in iww of both plants was also overall similar with distinct differences fig s7 si despite the different percentage of industrial load the transplantation of as from donor to recipient between days 1 and 1 induced a temporal change in the microbial community of the r as which was greater than the seasonal change observed over time in both as communities fig 2a in fact in both plants the first and last collected samples cluster close to each other after a time span of approximately 365 days indicating the recurrency of as microbial communities over the years nierychlo et al 2020a peces et al 2022 however the transplantation disrupted in r as the temporal development observed in d as moreover we observed an increase of the number of shared species between r as and d as approx 100 species more after transplantation and a decrease of the number of unique species in d as approx 50 species the number of unique species in r as remained instead approximately unchanged fig 3a both nmds and pca models suggested three stages of the overall microbial community in r as fig 2 figs s4 si s5 si in the early stage from day 1 to 40 r as had the highest similarity to d as community but r as started to diverge quickly from d as in the intermediate stage days from 40 to 150 r as diverged slowly from d as progressively increasing the similarity to r as before transplantation thus slowly restoring the pre transplantation community structure and establishing a new community steady state in the late stage after transplantation from days 150 onwards in the intermediate late stage after transplantation from day 40 the top 5 most abundant genera of as including process critical e g tetrasphaera were still present in high abundance in both plants suggesting that the main process functions were maintained fig 3b throughout all the sampling points after transplantation the differences between r as samples and r as model progressively decreased while conversely the differences between r as samples and d as model progressively increased figs s4 si s5 si these results suggested that although the as community composition of r as became more similar to d as community as a consequence of the transplantation the microbial composition of r as showed resilience quickly transitioning towards the pre transplantation r as community structure all through the sampling points 3 3 transplanted species in recipient plant showed different patterns of resilience 3 3 1 transplantation of unique and abundant species was retained only temporarily to evaluate the impact of transplantation at species level we investigated the possibility to add and maintain in r as abundant species which were not present before transplantation unique species in d as among the 402 unique species in d as fig 3a we identified species in d as with a relative read abundance higher than 0 1 49 species on average before transplantation the unique species could be grouped based on their residence time within the recipient plant into species with low medium and high residence time including 27 14 and 8 species respectively after transplantation most of these species 41 out of 49 83 7 had an overall residence time of 42 7 25 5 days table s3 si corresponding to approximately 3 times the srt of 15 days of the recipient plant fig s7 si therefore these species with low and medium residence time fig 4 were removed from the r as almost like inert particles in as among the added species with high residence time fig 4 only a few unique species 4 5 were maintained in r as at the introduced abundance which was anyway low in r as 0 1 other species with high residence time showed a progressively decreasing abundance in r as indicating inability to be retained in the recipient plant fig 4 fig s8 si whether or not these species were ultimately removed from r as is not known due to the lack of further sampling points to evaluate the possibility to mitigate bulking problems of full scale wwtps we investigated as well the possibility to remove abundant but unwanted bacteria such as certain filamentous bacteria we selected 14 unique and abundant 0 1 species present in r as including filamentous species which were removed by the transplantation also in this case most species restored the pre transplantation abundance after 1 2 months while few other species stayed in r as but in low abundance fig s9 si 3 3 2 the functional redundancy of species within guilds could not be boosted to evaluate the possibility to increase and boost the functional redundancy of microbial communities in wwtps we investigated the abundance variation over time of species belonging to guilds paos gaos nitrifiers filaments which were added to r as with transplantation these species were either not present in r as before transplantation unique species of d as or were present in both r as and d as shared species in the first case transplantation would increase the functional redundancy within their guild in the second case transplantation would boost the abundance and the redundancy within the guild the 53 shared species belonging to guilds were present in similar and or low abundances in both plants except for some of the most abundant species fig 5 we focused on species within the pao guild because they had well pronounced differences in abundances in r as and d as fig 5 and because of the key importance of paos for the two ebpr as systems the added unique and shared species belonging to paos did not remain in r as at the transplanted abundance but gradually restored their pre transplantation abundance within 200 days fig 6 this indicated that unique and shared pao species e g tetrasphaera midas s 220 and tetrasphaera midas s 5 could not thrive in the r as at the transplanted abundance the results for paos confirmed previous observations at species level and we found similar results for species belonging to the other guilds figs s10 si s11 si in particular we consistently observed the lack of establishment of transplanted abundances i e resilience of microbial community in r as for different species within the same guild fig 6 fig s10 si e g tetrasphaera midas s 5 and tessaracoccus midas s 307 within paos different species within the same genus e g t midas s 45 and t elongata within tetrasphaera genus fig s10 si different genera within the same guild e g tetrasphaera dechloromonas ca accumulibacter tessaracoccus among paos fig s10 si 3 4 immigration from the wastewater may affect the community resilience of recipient to evaluate if the resilience of r as community to transplantation was influenced by microbial mass immigration we investigated the overall microbial community structure of influent wastewater of donor d iww and recipient r iww in relation to d as and r as sample groups table s2 si d iww and r iww were more similar to each other throughout the whole sampling period than compared to their corresponding d as and r as samples model distance 20 comparing as models to each of the two iww models the overall microbial community structure of r as and d as throughout time early intermediate and late stage was more similar to its own influent r iww and d iww respectively as indicated for example by a lower distance of all r as sample groups to r iww model compared to the distance of d as samples to r iww model fig 7 even if this is less obvious for the donor plant the results suggested that the microbial structure of recipient as was reflected by the structure of iww from the same plant after transplantation the microbial community of r as in the early stage became more similar to both r iww and d iww compared to before transplantation the distance of r as before and r as after early to r iww and to d iww model decreases from 95 6 2 9 to 65 2 0 9 and from 222 5 11 3 to 139 5 2 3 respectively probably as a consequence of transplantation however from the intermediate until the late stage after transplantation r as community already restored the similarity to r iww almost to the same level as before the transplantation r as before this confirmed the results seen previously for r as sample groups fig 2 figs s4 si s5 si and suggested that continuous immigration of bacteria from r iww might play a role in maintaining the overall community structure of r as also after transplantation to evaluate at species level the impact of immigration for transplantation we investigated the abundance trend of species in both r iww and r as interestingly we found that for some species the abundance trend in as resembled the abundance trend in iww over time as indicated by the pearson linear correlation coefficient of their scaled abundance which was significantly high for some species e g ruminococcaceae asv3228 ca microthrix parvicella tetrasphaera midas s 5 fig 8 the relative read abundance of species in iww was generally much lower than in the as but even when lower than 0 01 it showed a strong linear correlation with abundance in r as among the top 5 species contributing the most to the similarity between r as before and r as after late some had a significant strong correlation with iww abundance e g ruminococcaceae asv3228 fig 8a for the unique species of donor added to r as e g ca amarolinea midas s 1 the linear correlation of abundances was not strong probably because these species were generally absent in the r iww and could not contribute to maintaining the transplanted abundance in r as fig 8b fig s12 si the well known filamentous and foaming genera ca microthrix and gordonia included species with a strong abundance correlation between r iww and r as r 0 7 fig 8c indicating a strong impact of the iww 4 discussion to explore the impact of disturbance on the microbial community structure of a full scale wwtp we carried out a massive bioaugmentation in the form of as biomass transplantation between two full scale wwtps with nutrient removal the two wwtps had overall the same design operation and functional guilds representing a perfect test case for biomass transplantation with the aim to evaluate how a massive disturbance affects resilience and functional redundancy of the recipient microbial community this provided practical insights about the possibility to exchange taxa to increase or boost the functional redundancy within functional guilds introducing new species and to change the abundance levels of wanted or unwanted species to improve process performance the microbial community of as recipient demonstrated overall an unexpectedly strong resilience to the transplantation disturbance and restored almost completely its pre transplantation structure composition and abundance within a short time 1 2 months contrary to what was found in other disturbance responses of as systems vuono et al 2015 we hypothesize that a longer period of observation than the one of 6 months shown in this study would have shown a full restoration of the pre transplantation community structure even if minor differences could be expected moreover despite the temporary changes of community structure after transplantation the recipient community was able to ensure stability of process performances likely through functional redundancy of the local and transplanted community as shown in other studies wang et al 2021 the transient worsening of the settling properties in the recipient plant right after the transplantation were probably due to an increasing content of the filamentous ca microthrix both in the transplanted as from donor which also had a higher dsvi than the recipient and in the recipient itself where the abundance of ca microthrix started to increase before transplantation nierychlo et al 2020b wágner et al 2022 our overall results were in contrast to studies of successful establishment of new immigrating colonizer bacteria in wwtp after disturbance vuono et al 2016 but are in accordance with studies that acknowledged the difficulty to successfully implement bioaugmentation in full scale wwtps herrero and stuckey 2015 park et al 2008 our results indicated that the resilience of the as recipient community was characterized by the lack of establishment of the vast majority of the added new species by removing 75 of the original as biomass the added new species transplanted from a plant with similar conditions ebpr niche were expected to be able to grow and to outcompete the local communities in recipient 25 of biomass as a consequence of higher population size both relative read abundance and biomass concentration herrero and stuckey 2015 kinnunen et al 2016 however the results showed that most of the unique species of donor plant added to the recipient plant new species for the recipient were progressively removed from the recipient with a removal rate often resembling the one of inert particles that is by following the srt of the recipient plant this suggested that the newly added species added were not able to occupy a niche and or to compete with the local existing community in fact even if the same function can be carried out by alternative taxa as an effect of functional redundancy it is known that environmental factors can shape the possibility to grow of a certain taxonomic group within a functional group louca et al 2018 in our case environmental conditions such as the organic load the inorganic composition of influent wastewater and the operational parameters were very similar in both donor and recipient plant the industrial load of the plants was different and we do not have detailed information about the organic composition but we do not expect this to play a major role in shaping the communities in as and iww as the overall community structure was very similar in donor and recipient plant before transplantation moreover the engineering resilience of the as system against a disturbance was already observed and it was proposed to occur through ecological resilience which is the selection of bacteria able to restore the condition before disturbance pérez et al 2019 similarly our results indicated that the local community was resilient and we did not observe the boost of functional redundancy within guilds by permanently changing the abundance of transplanted species shared between the two plants such as unwanted filamentous bacteria ca microthrix and gordonia and species from functional guilds such as the paos an alternative explanation for the outcome of the transplantation is the role of microbial immigration recently we described that immigration strongly affects both composition and abundance of community members in as dottorini et al 2021 which could explain the very strong resilience of as systems and consequently the unsuccessful bioaugmentation studies reported also elsewhere in particular the abundance of species in as correlated well either with the abundance of the same species in iww or with the abundance of a group of species in iww the latter being the case of the majority of species in as dottorini et al 2021 similarly our results are partially in accordance with the first case where the abundance of some species in as of recipient supported by immigration correlated well with the species abundance in iww such as for species belonging to guilds while the second case was not investigated here the unique species found in as of each plant were presumably only present in the as plants because they were continuously added by their respective iww as indicated by the high similarity in pca model between communities of as and iww within the same plant we hypothesize that when the unique species of activated sludge from the donor were transplanted to the recipient plant they were either washed out or progressively removed because their presence in as was not supported by continuous immigration from the recipient iww similarly the abundance of some species in as of recipient supported by immigration correlated well with the species abundance in iww such as for species belonging to guilds disentangling the factors affecting the outcome of transplantation was however difficult for several reasons first it was practically not possible to remove the whole activated sludge biomass of the recipient plant but 25 of the biomass remained in the recipient plant thus potentially masking the real impact of transplantation at species level secondly the microbial community of many as plants exhibit strong temporal seasonal variations griffin and wells 2017 peces et al 2022 that may mask other processes such as the transplantation in our study both as plants showed some seasonal variations both at the overall community level and at species level as for ca microthrix which is indeed known to increase in abundance in spring nierychlo et al 2021 thus it was difficult to assess whether abundance variations after transplantation for some species were caused by transplantation or normal seasonal variations finally but not less importantly analyses of the microbial community structure in iww is difficult as the species that are growing in the as are present only in very low abundance in the iww often close to detection level and therefore difficult to quantify dottorini et al 2021 however as discussed above our observations provided support to the hypothesis that immigration could potentially be responsible for the outcome of transplantation where the lack of persistence of a newly added species to the as recipient could be explained by the lack of continuous immigration of that species from iww the strong resilience of the recipient as community implies that the application of a one time transplantation in a suspended growth system such as as wwtps does not represent a proper long term solution to possible operational problems as our results suggest this is likely due to the effect of mass immigration from the recipient plant but the influence of organic compounds in influent unknown in this study could not be excluded however importantly the fact that the overall operational performance of the recipient plant was not impaired by the transplantation indicated that the activity of the transplanted community worked very well over time despite the disturbance probably because of intrinsic functional redundancy partially determined by the immigration this suggested that for example severe operational problems at wwtps related to the microbial activity e g community deterioration caused by the presence of toxic chemicals could be temporarily solved altering a compromised or problematic community structure by adding significant amounts of compatible biomass and so possibly mitigating full scale problems in addition transplantation could be applied to speed up the performance of newly constructed as plants similarly to bioaugmentation approaches guo et al 2010 in both examples the transplanted community should ideally be as similar as possible compatible to the receiving as community before the break down or start up however when this is not possible as from a plant with similar process design and or similar functional guilds could also help to restore or initiate its function for these applications a database covering community composition of wwtps in the same region or country would be useful to evaluate the best match between plants with the criteria just mentioned such database exists for danish wwtps as part of the midas project where we have recorded the normal community structure and temporal variations for several years nierychlo et al 2020a the database represents the starting point to explore theoretical and practical aspects of microbial ecology in as systems such as as transplantation 5 conclusions we conducted a massive transplantation of activated sludge between two full scale wwtps with similar process type biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and performance but with some differences in microbial community structure the microbial community in the recipient plant showed a strong resilience and most of the community structure was restored within 1 2 months the treatment performance was not compromised and the effluent quality remained stable we did not observe a stable addition of new species to potentially introduce new functions or to boost functional redundancy moreover we did not observe a permanent increase of the abundance of shared species e g the paos nor a reduction of the abundance of unwanted bacteria e g filamentous bacteria in the recipient plant the microbial community structure of as suggested a close connection to their respective iww communities which may explain the high resilience of the plant microbial immigration is therefore an important aspect to consider for the application of transplantation applications and bioaugmentation in general in as systems even if the community structure cannot be permanently altered massive bioaugmentation of as across different wwtps may solve acute operational problems by selecting a compatible as donor plant which should have the same functional guilds similar process design and operation and if possible similar immigrating community authors contributions phaln msb and mn designed the full scale experiment phenn and msb
