21580,fluid structure interaction fsi problems are often encountered in ocean science and technology in this present an implicit immersed boundary ib method combined with lattice boltzmann method lbm and finite element method fem is presented for the strong coupled simulations of fluid structure interaction velocity field is solved rapidly by lattice boltzmann bgk equations without external force and the deformation of a flexible structure was computed by fem fluid structure coupling was processed by immersed boundary implicit forced method the resulting combination gives an easy to use inexpensive and accurate technique to solve fsi problems simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary can be calculated directly and acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time lag between the fluid solver and solid solver several examples including flow over a static and deformable plate and the flow problems of an oscillating and cantilever flexible plate were simulated and analyzed the results agree well with the previous experimental and numerical investigations which indicate the ib lb fem proposed in this paper is an efficient and reliable fluid structure interaction numerical simulation method keywords immersed boundary method lattice boltzmann method finite element method fluid structure interaction strong coupled 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi problems are ubiquitous in all fields of nature and engineering such as the aquatic or vegetation swing in the ocean hussey et al 2015 mattis et al 2015 marine artificial structure deformation or vibration wang et al 2019 smith et al 2018 piperno and farhat 2001 and they are also extremely complicated due to its nonlinear nature and interaction between each other chakrabarti 2005 dowell and hall 2001 morand and ohayon 1995 an efficient accurate and robust computational approach is thus essential for the analysis and design systems in science and engineering over that last few decades substantial efforts have been focused on the development of modeling and simulating techniques for fsi problems brummelen and geuzaine 2010 wang and yan 2010 body fitted and moving mesh approaches yao et al 2015 gao and hu 2009 have been widely used for solving fsi problems these methods mainly include arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method ale sahin and mohseni 2009 wang et al 2013 2014 bueno et al 2015 basting et al 2017 and the deforming spatial domain stabilized space time dsd sst method tezduyar et al 1992a b johnson and tezduyar 1994 tezduyar 2001 tezduyar and sathe 2007 tian 2014 moving mesh approaches require mesh update methods that usually consists of two demands move the mesh as long as possible and remesh it as needed dukowicz and kodis 1987 rosis et al 2013 margolin and shashkov 2003 in order to maintain the element quality near moving boundaries or solid surfaces the moving mesh methods are based on ale approaches which is designed to solve hirt et al 1974 hughes et al 1981 donea et al 1982 fsi problems the fluid mesh is not fixed but follows the motion of the solid by mapping which is calculated based on the current position of the solid it is proved that ale methods are robust and accurate for engineering applications involving mesh movement the dsd sst method is one of the earliest space time formulation methods involving moving boundaries and interfaces and it is based on a stabilized finite element formula written in the spatiotemporal domain of fluid mechanics tezduyar 1991 first demonstrated the dsd sst method which allows spatial domain changes at various time levels and can be effectively applied to fluid dynamics computations involving moving boundaries and interfaces since then the dsd sst formulation has been widely used to simulate problems involving fsi and moving boundaries bazilevs et al 2013 provide a comprehensive introduction to the history latest technologies and practical applications of ale and dsd sst methods for fsi problems body fitted method has the advantage of satisfying kinematic constraints by construction so it has high order accuracy near the boundary however problems arise whenever strong deformations and large displacements or even topological changes of the interface lead to a degeneration of the computational mesh those above problems harm both condition of discrete process and the accuracy of the results therefore applying the body fitted methods to complex engineered systems require dedicated solutions to maintain the quality of the fluid mesh one method is to remesh that is when the distortion of the mesh becomes too serious all or part of the fluid domain is automatically re discretized in space tezduyar et al 1995 johnson and tezduyar 1999 takizawa et al 2014a so in recent years takizawa et al 2014b extends dsd sst methods which will include the true topological changes without remeshing but so far only applies to the problems with known beforehand or prescribed boundary motion for these reasons another different type of fsi solution method non body fitted approaches have become a popular alternative to fsi solution i e an immersed boundary method ibm were introduced by peskin et al peskin 1972 peskin 1977 peskin and printz 1993 it was used to study blood flows in and out from a beating heart it has since been extensively studied extended and applied to a wide variety of other fsi problems for example biomechanics doddi and bagchi 2009 le 2010 yazdani and bagchi 2013 ye et al 2016 the fluid machines posa et al 2011 kang et al 2012 bai et al 2014 tsai and colonius 2016 heat transfer nagendra et al 2014 xia et al 2015 eshghinejadfard and thevenin 2016 magnetic particles flows zhang et al 2014 ke et al 2017 ido et al 2017 nature disasters guo and cao 2019 the motions of oscillating hydrofoil huang and sung 2010 wang et al 2018a li et al 2018 the immersed type of methods solves the fluid equations in whole physical domain with an additional term of fictitious force representing the effects of the immersed boundary acting on the moving fluid no slip conditions are imposed on these immersed boundaries the location of which is updated using the velocities of the moving structure obtained by a structure solver the background fluid equations are solved by a fixed eulerian grid in the whole domain and the structure is solved by an independent lagrangian mesh overlaying on the eulerian grid the moving immersed boundary is tracked properly to couple these two compared with the moving mesh methods ibms have three advantages 1 fast and separate grid generation for fluid and solid without requirement of grid to be consistent with the fluid structure interface which will arbitrarily deform and move at large scales for solids or have very complex shapes and 2 the use of efficient and mature flow solvers on the fixed grid 3 the need for mesh update is completely eliminated the immersed structure can be either rigid or flexible a boundary or a body with finite volume although ibm is simple and efficient because a fixed mesh type solver is used the navier stokes equations are relatively difficult to solve fortunately lattice boltzmann method lbm chen and doolen 1998 he and luo 1997 is an alternative computational method based on the dynamics of particles since 1990s lbm as a fluid solver to replace solving the n s equations has been widely used in solving partial differential equations of engineering problems there are many studies for fsi problems using the lbm rosis et al 2013 kwon 2008 garcia et al 2011 based on fixed grid and interpolation to accomplish the various physical scenarios which are described in literatures chen and doolen 1998 he and luo 1997 without the need for interpolation and re meshing flouris et al 2018 presented an original 2nd order curved space lattice boltzmann fluid solver however the complex and moving boundaries are more difficult to deal for lbm but this is a distinguish advantage for ibm meanwhile lbm is also basically a fixed mesh type solver therefore lbm can be conveniently associated with ibm which can be called immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm for solving the fsi problems ib lbm has significant advantages include rapidly solving the fluid velocity with lbm and handing the complex moving boundaries with ibm feng and michaelides 2004 2005 are the first who attempt using ib lbm to simulate particulate flows including collisions since then the method is getting better and a set of improved ib lbm were developed shu et al 2007 wu and shu 2012 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2018b finite element method fem is widely used for computing the deformation of flexible body there are a number of earlier studies which are combining fem with immersed domain method and lbm tian et al 2011 favier et al 2014 li and favier 2017 on fluid flexible structure interactions however the application of the fem and lbm combine with ib method for fluid flexible structure interactions has few report in which the fluid force is only directly acted on the solid boundary or ib boundary therefore in this paper we combine a suitable ib lbm based on structural grids system with fem to develop a stable and efficient immersed boundary lattice boltzmann finite element method ib lb fem for simulating widespread fsi problems the main advantage of the method is its non slip boundary conditions which can be satisfied perfectly by enforced velocity on the boundary and the body forces which are acting on the immersed boundary are solved directly for solving the deformations of the flexible structure the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 is the simple introduction of the governing equations section 3 1 gives the fluid solver including lbm for solving flow field and ibm for solving body force section 3 2 introduces the structural solver of fem section 3 3 introduces ibm for solving body force acted on ib boundary section 3 4 shows the fluid structure interaction procedure for proposed ib lb fem section 4 and section 5 present respectively the validation and benchmark cases and the conclusions 2 governing equations as illustrated in fig 1 a solid body ω s with its boundary γ f s i or γ s that may change in time is placed on top of the fluid domain ω f as a result the fluid grid does not have to match at the fluid solid interface and hence a cartesian grid can be used for the fluid domain if needed the fluid is modeled using eulerian description and the solid using the lagrangian description the kinematic constraint at the interface between fluid and the solid can be enforced via lagrange multipliers 2 1 governing equations for fluids the governing equations for incompressible newtonian fluids are the navier stokes n s equations which are stated as follows in compact cartesian vector notation 1 v f 0 in ω f 2 ρ f v f σ f g e x t f in ω f v f where the superscript f stands for fluid g f is the fluid velocity ρ f is the body force on the fluid σ f is the fluid density and is the divergence operator the pseudo stress σ f μ f v f p i is given by 3 σ f μ f v f p i in which μ f is the fluid dynamical viscosity p is pressure density i is the unit matrix and is the gradient operator 2 2 governing equations for solids the governing equation for incompressible elastic solids in the current configuration is stated as 4 ρ s v s σ s g e x t s in ω s where the superscript s stands for solids ρ s is the solid density v s is the solid velocity g s is the body force on the solid and σ s is cauchy s stress that relates to the displacements in the solid via constitutive laws and the strain displacement relations liu and quek 2003 2 3 governing equations at the interface conditions have to be satisfied at the fluid structure interface denoted as γ f s i first the displacements should be the same along the interface namely 5 d f d s on γ f s i where d f and d s are the displacement of fluid and solid particle respectively the second one is the no slip condition which enforces that the fluid at interface moves at the same velocity as the boundary of the solid namely 6 v f v s on γ f s i based on the principle of virtual work and the theorem of lagrange multiplier eqs 2 and 4 may be combined into a single weak form as 7 ω s ρ s v s σ s g e x t s δ d s d v ω f ρ f v f σ f g e x t f δ d f d v γ f s i g f s i δ d s δ d f d v 0 where g f s i are the vector of lagrange multipliers which relates to the coupling forces in the original formulation of the ibm invented by peskin 1977 2002 the structure is represented as an immersed boundary which does occupy a finite volume thus we have ω s γ s γ f s i and the fluid domain becomes the entire computational domain ω ω f consequently eq 7 becomes 8 γ s ρ s v s σ s g e x t s g f s i δ d s d v ω ρ f v f σ f g e x t f g f s i l f γ s δ d f d v 0 where the function l f γ s is defined as 9 l f γ s 1 if on γ s 0 other eq 8 yields two independent equations 10 ρ s v s σ s g e x t s g f s i 0 in γ s 11 ρ f v f σ f g e x t f g f s i l f γ s 0 in ω in the traditional ib method the fsi force g f si is computed in the whole solid domain explicitly using eq 10 the computed force is then imposed on to eq 11 which is solved to yield fluid motion once the fluid velocity is solved the velocity of the solid is determined by applying the no slip condition of eq 6 the location of the boundary γ s is then updated by using the solid velocity in the existing implicit ib lbm method the flow is calculated by lbm the body forces caused by the immersed body are not calculated in advance but are implicitly determined using a corrected velocity field that precisely satisfies the conditions of no slip and no penetration at the fluid structure interface simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary directly acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time gap between the fluid solver and solid solver in a numerical implementation the discontinuous function l f γ s can be replaced by a continuous discrete delta function which typically has compact support over a band of grid points neighboring γ s the use of a discrete delta function can be also regarded as an interpolation of the fsi force from the immersed boundary to the fluid domain the same discrete delta function is applied to interpolate the velocity from the fluid domain to the immersed boundary as a result the interface is numerically represented by a thin layer of finite depth the location of the boundary γ s is then updated according the displacement of solid solver 3 methodology 3 1 lattice boltzmann method for fluid flow by using the bgk model eq 1 and eq 2 are satisfied by using lb equation and proper equilibrium distribution function the lb equation without body force g f has the following form 12 f α x ⅇ α δ t t δ t f α x t τ 1 f α x t f α e q x t where f α x t and f α e q x t are density distribution function and corresponding equilibrium at position x and time t respectively ⅇ α is the velocity vector in each nine directions in the two dimensional 2d for the popular d 2 q 9 model τ is the dimensionless relaxation time parameter related to the kinematic viscosity by υ c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t where c s is the speed of sound which is 1 3 for this model δ x 1 0 is lattice size and δ t 1 0 is time step the velocity set as follows delouei et al 2014 13 ⅇ α 0 0 c 1 0 c 0 1 c 1 0 c 0 1 c 1 1 c 1 1 c 1 1 c 1 1 c in order to properly map the n s equation in mesoscale in lbm the equilibrium distribution function is expressed as follows delouei et al 2014 14 f α e q w α ρ f 1 3 c 2 ⅇ α v f 9 2 c 4 ⅇ α v f 2 3 2 c 2 v f v f where c δ x δ t w α is the weighting function which is selected such that w α 1 9 for α 1 2 3 4 w α 1 36 for α 5 6 7 8 and w 9 4 9 the macroscopic properties of the fluid define as follows 15 ρ α 1 9 f α ρ v f α 1 9 f α e α p ρ c s 2 3 2 structural solver in this study using finite element method fem solve the deformation of elastic body for fem a series of triangles namely finite triangular elements represent the flexible solid so the eq 10 can be expressed as in a semi discrete solid equations in matrix form at a time step 16 m s d n 1 s c s d n 1 s k s d n 1 s g n 1 s where d n 1 s d n 1 s and d n 1 s are the total displacement velocity and acceleration matrix of the solid at time level n 1 respectively d n 1 s d x 1 d y 1 d x i d y i d x n d y n t in which the d x i and d y i are the ith node s displacement in x and y directions in 2d cases additional m s c s and k s are the mass matrix the dampness matrix and stiffness matrix respectively g n 1 s is the external force vector matrix namely the fluid force g f si acted on the solid boundary nodes on the fsi interface in this work the newmark algorithm newmark 1959 is implemented which is based on the following approximations at time level n 1 17 d n 1 s 1 β δ t 2 d n 1 s d n s 1 β δ t d n s 1 2 β 1 d n s 18 d n 1 s γ β δ t d n 1 s d n s γ β 1 d n s δ t 2 γ β 2 d n s with the time step size δ t and the newmark parameters β 0 5 and γ 0 3 3 fe lb coupling algorithm via an implicit ib method without mesh computational process ib method is used to satisfy the no slip boundary condition between fluid and flexible solid in fact the interaction between the fluid and the flexible structure consists of two parts one is the interpolation of fluid velocity on the boundary points the other is the distribution of body force calculated from momentum exchange onto the bulk fluid in the conventional ibm the force density g f s i l f γ s is determined in advance in the fictitious fluid domain and then the corrected velocity v n 1 is obtained by solving the n s equation with additional momentum source however there is no guarantee that the velocity at the ib point interpolated from this corrected velocity v n 1 always satisfies the non slip boundary condition this drawback can be overcome by the implicit method the basic idea of the implicit method is that the force density g f s i l f γ s is considered as unknown which is evaluated implicitly in such a way that the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected velocity v n 1 at the eulerian grids equals to the given velocity of ib point wu and shu 2009 for convenience the fluid structure interaction force g f s i l f γ s in eq 11 is replaced by boundary body force density term g f similarly the fluid structure interaction force g f s i in eq 10 is replaced by solid boundary body force density term g s which can be expressed as 19 g f x t ω s g s x s t δ x x s t d ω where x and x are representing the euler coordinate of fluid fields entire computational domain and ib points s is lagrangian coordinate of solid boundary respectively δ x x s t is the smooth delta function suppose that the ib is represented by a set of points x i b i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized by a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y h which is shown in fig 2 furthermore we define two functions c j i and d i j which represent the interpolation and distribution functions respectively 20 c j i c x i b i x j 1 h 2 φ x i b i x j h φ y i b i y j h 21 d i j d x j x i b i 1 h 2 φ x j x i b i h φ y j y i b i h where 22 φ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 0 r note that the distribution function c j i maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids on the other hand the interpolation function d i j projects the physical field from the cartesian grids back to the ib points note that from eq 19 that the force density g f at the eulerian point is distributed from the boundary force g s through the dirac delta function interpolation eq 19 can be written in the discrete form as 23 g f x j t i c j i g s x i b i t δ s i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ s i is the i th segment boundary discrete volume according the second newtonian law we can know the force acting on fluid points 24 g f ρ f δ v δ t it is clear that adding a forcing term g f is equivalent to making a correction δ v in the velocity field substituting eq 23 into eq 24 we have 25 δ v x j t 1 ρ f i c j i g s x i b i t δ s i δ t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n it is noted that the unknowns in eq 25 are the boundary forces to satisfy the non slip boundary condition the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function d i j must be equal to the boundary velocity v x i b i t at the same position namely 26 v x i b i t j d i j v n 1 f x j t δ x δ y δ t j 1 2 n i 1 2 m here v n 1 f x j t is the velocity at the j th eulerian grid point of next time step expressed as the sum of intermediate velocity v f x j t and velocity correction δ v f x j t namely 27 v n 1 f x j t v f x j t δ v f x j t the immediate velocity v f x j t has obtained in section 3 1 follow this v n 1 f x j t and v f x j t note v n 1 f and v f below respectively substituting eqs 25 and 27 into eq 26 gives 28 v x i b i t j v f x j t d i j h 2 j i d i j δ s i c j i g s x i b i t δ t h 2 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the equation system for the boundary force is now formed which can be further written in the following matrix form as 29 a g n 1 s b where 30 a δ t h 2 d 11 δ s 1 d 12 δ s 1 d 1 n δ s 1 d 21 δ s 2 d 22 δ s 2 d 2 n δ s 2 d m 1 δ s m d m 2 δ s m d m n δ s m c 11 c 12 c 1 m c 21 c 22 c 2 m c n 1 c n 2 c n m 31 b u b 1 u b 2 u b m h 2 d 11 d 12 d 1 n d 21 d 22 d 2 n d m 1 d m 2 d m n v 1 f v 2 f v n f 32 g n 1 s g n 1 s 1 g n 1 s 2 g n 1 s m the unknown boundary force g s x i b i t at all ib points are obtained simultaneously which are then substituted into eqs 25 and 27 to calculate the velocity correction δ v f x j t and the velocity v n 1 f x j t respectively at next time step in fact the boundary force g s x i b i t at all ib points are also obtained simultaneously we can solve the solid governing eq 16 where g s x i b i t can also be seen the load of fluid acting on the solid boundary 3 4 computational procedure for proposed ib lbm fem as an implicit coupling procedure it consists in resolving a system of coupling equations involving the solid and fluid equations and the continuity conditions at the interface as well the details of the ib lbm fem algorithm for fluid flexible structure interaction are step 1 implement the lbm procedure with known fluid velocity at the n th step calculate the density ρ predicted velocity v f and pressure p on eulerian nodes using the lbm eqs 12 15 step 2 using the boundary force eqs 25 27 and 29 solve the boundary force g n 1 s the correct velocity δ v f x j t and the velocity v n 1 f x j t at the n 1 th step respectively step 3 perform the fem to calculate the deformation of the structure using the solid eq 16 combined with the newark eqs 17 and 18 and update the positions and velocities of structure note that in this step the load vector equal to the body force g n 1 s act on the ib nodes step 4 go back to step 1 and repeat it until obtaining the desired accuracy 4 results and discussion to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method four verification cases are performed 1 flow over a rigid plate employing the ib lbm 2 flow around a flexible plate using the ib lb fem 3 the vibration of flexible cantilever beam with an initial perturbation and 4 the deformation of a vertical cantilever elastic beam a linear elasticity material for solid is used in all cases 4 1 flow over a fixed rigid plate in this section using ib lbm analyze newtonian fluid flowing over a small thin plate with length of d and thickness of ε 0 08 d the plate is located at the middle of the flow channel fig 3 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions the channel length is l 30 d and its height is h 16 d the drag coefficients vortex length and flow characteristics are evaluated for a range of reynolds number r e which is defined as r e u d υ the drag coefficient is based on pressure force acting on the plate in cross flow and given as c d 0 d δ p d l 0 5 ρ f u 2 d where u is the uniform inlet flow velocity υ is the kinematic viscosity ρ f is the fluid density δ p is the pressure difference across the plate thickness and the value of p is obtained referring as the work of afra et al 2018 i e the pressure of p at a lagrangian node is obtained by interpolating from its closest four eulerian nodes the non dimensional time t defined as t t u d the meaning of t in the following sections is same fig 4 shows the evolution of the drag coefficients against t for different meshes of 1200 640 cells 1500 800 cells and 2100 1120 cells at re 30 the results show that the grid convergence have nothing to do with the mesh density but it is relate to the accuracy and the medium mesh can satisfy enough in this case the number of solid boundary nodes are 108 and eulerian grid have 1500 800 lattice cells lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size here c s 2 1 3 d 50 and u 0 05 fig 5 shows the streamlines for different reynolds numbers a pair of symmetric vortex are formed behind the plate when the reynolds number is less than 35 and the length of vortex is longer with the increase of reynolds number table 1 shows a comparison of the present ib lbm predictions for drag coefficient and vortex length with the earlier numerical and experimental results in et al 1995 afra et al 2018 dennis et al 1993 it is shown that the predicted drag coefficients and vortex lengths behind the plate as a function of the reynolds number are in good agreement with the earlier results reported their maximal relative error are respectively 5 66 and 8 80 compared with the published results fig 6 shows the evolution of the streamlines against the time t for reynolds number re 30 40 and 100 respectively a pair of symmetric vortex is formed behind the plate at the earlier stage of all simulations and the vortex is stretched with the increasing of computed steps finally we can see that the vortex shapes are different for different reynolds numbers at a steady flow stage fig 7 shows the length of the wake against the time t for reynolds number re 30 40 and 100 respectively it is shown that the length of wake reach to a stabilized value more rapidly for lower reynolds number and the length of the wake is more for higher reynolds number at a same time in the initial evolution stage 4 2 flow over a flexible plate in this section assuming the newtonian fluid flow over a deformable plate is in a laminar regime the deformation of a vertical flexible plate under two ends fixed is studied fig 8 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions here a plate thickness of ε 0 08 d is assumed the channel length is l 30 d and the passage width is changed to h 4 d young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols e and μ μ 1 3 the drag coefficients vortex length and flow characteristics are evaluated for a range of reynolds number the reynolds number drag coefficients and lift coefficients express as follows 33 r e u d υ c d f x 0 5 ρ f u 2 d c l f y 0 5 ρ f u 2 d where u is the uniform inlet flow velocity υ is the kinematic viscosity ρ f is the fluid density f x is the drag forces and f y is the lift forces in this case solid mesh contain 279 nodes and 448 elements the number of solid boundary nodes are 108 and eulerian grid have 1500 200 lattice cells lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size in this study we used the value of c d as a criterion the solution stops when this parameter reaches a steady state the number of iterations varies depending on the physical parameters such as r e and rigidity to prevent the numerical instability in the early time steps the uniform flow is gradually increasing from zero to a steady value of u namely u t u sin 0 5 π t t for t t where t is in lbm units and t is selected in the range 10 3 to 1 10 4 time steps depending on the order of magnitude of plate elastic modulus e that is the value of t is increased with decreasing of the rigidity of the plate to enhance the numerical stability fig 9 gives the stabilized condition of the minimum value of t min and the maximum relative displacement δ max d of point b for different young s modulus e at re 100 it is shown that the smaller of the young s modulus e the larger of minimum value of t min we also investigated that the numerical computation is hard to stability when e 3 10 3 fig 10 and fig 11 respectively show the streamlines at three non dimensional times and the temporal evolution of the mid point of the plate point b for e 5 10 3 pa at four different reynolds numbers here the non dimensional deviation from equilibrium state δ d is shown as a function of non dimensional time t t u d fig 10 shows that a pair of vortex is formed behind the elastic plate when r e is less than 35 otherwise the vortexes begin to drop off from the plate which agrees with reliable results afra et al 2018 meanwhile we can see that the vortexes fall off earlier for r e 100 and 50 than interim r e 35 because the latter is local in the critical scope between steady and unsteady flow the unsteady performance of the drop of the vortexes is acutest for re 100 and the fluid flow is developing when the non dimensional time t 90 we can also find from fig 11 that the deformation for the unsteady flow r e 100 is larger than the complete steady flow r e 30 and the interim critical flow r e 35 and 50 are all less than the latter r e 30 two plateaus are appeared at near the time instants t 1 and t 40 for re 100 duo to the developing flow the shake of the plate for r e 100 is periodic however for r e 35 and 50 the plate is shaking but the periodicity is not obvious 4 3 the vibration of a flexible plate from an initial perturbation in a cavity we farther validated the present code with the vibration of a vertical flexible plate which was initially perturbed in a cavity fig 12 shows the computational domain and boundary conditions solid mesh include 348 elements and 229 nodes and eulerian grid have 1000 250 lattice cells the length and the thickness of the flexible plate are 1 0 m and 0 06 m respectively the plate has the following material properties elastic modulus e 2 5 10 6 p a density of the plate ρ s 2550 k g m 3 density of the fluid ρ f 1 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosities of the fluid μ 1 0 k g m s the plate was initially perturbed with a uniformly distributed load of 30 n m until t 0 5 s we compared the results of the present scheme with the results of literatures lee et al 2012 gluck et al 2001 namkoong et al 2005 in fig 13 the damped displacement slopes and frequencies were in good agreement with the results of the previous researcher the maximum relative error of the peak displacement and frequencies are 7 36 and 3 48 respectively which further verifies that the present method has the advantages of simple grid division higher efficiency and easy to implement under the same computational accuracy 4 4 flow over a vertical cantilever elastic beam the study of a cantilever beam is a classical problem in solid mechanics timoshenko and young 1968 that has been applied in studies of a wide range of applications such as estimating the flow induced deflection pozrikidis 2010 and study the biological flows involving ciliated surfaces pozrikidis 2011 in this section deformation of a vertical cantilever elastic beam in the presence of cross flow is simulated fig 14 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols e and μ μ 0 4 solid mesh include 858 elements and 534 nodes and eulerian grid have 3000 500 lattice cells respectively lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size at the channel entrance velocity is a uniform flow as described in section 4 2 same strategy is used for preventing the numerical instability for the cases of e 2 10 8 p a with different reynolds number fig 15 shows the evolutions of the drag coefficients and displacements of the point in upper left corner of the beam point a we can see that the higher the reynolds number is the smaller the drag coefficient and the displacement of beam are we also see that the scale of backflow region below the beam and behind the free end is larger for higher reynolds numbers than the lower s as shown in fig 16 4 5 flow over an elastic ellipsoid the studies of an approximate sphere of elasticity such as the cells deformation in the blood vessels and the collision of sediment particles in the flow are a classical problem in the problems of fluid elastic solid interaction the deformation of an elastic ellipsoid in the presence of cross flow is computed in this section fig 19 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions the center o of the ellipsoid is fixed d equal to the length of 24 lattices the young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols of e and μ μ 0 4 the solid meshes include 528 elements and 294 nodes and the eulerian grids have 1800 800 lattice cells respectively fig 20 shows the boundary position of the elastic ellipsoid for different reynolds numbers and young s modulus at t 42 the deformation is increasing with the increase of reynolds numbers and the decrease of young s modulus fig 21 and fig 22 give the boundary velocities of the elastic ellipsoid and the vortex for different time instants at e 1 9 10 6 pa and re 1000 respectively the deformation is large and complex vortex shedding phenomenon is appearing the vortexes are separating from the elastic ellipsoid and the distributions of the boundary velocities are irregular fig 23 show the velocity of the leading edge point against time at e 1 9 10 6 pa and re 1000 which shows a good stability of whole computational process 5 conclusions and the future work in this study the ib lbm combined with fem was developed for the simulation of fsi problems the fluid field was simulated by lbm with bgk model without considering the body force and the direct implicit forcing ibm was used to compute the body force and satisfy non slip boundary conditions between fluid and flexible structure the fem was used to compute the deformation of a flexible structure with the boundary forces the body force caused by the immersed boundary is not pre calculated but implicitly determined using a corrected velocity field that accurately satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions on the fluid structure interface simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary directly acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time lag between the fluid solver and solid solver the validity of the proposed method was verified by several numerical tests and the method is easy to implement and can be used for solving widespread fsi problems in the future another more stable and efficient fluid flexible solid interaction solver should be developed especial for higher reynolds number such as the turbulent model is combined with the ib method the single relaxation time srt bgk model is replaced by the multi relaxation time mrt model with non uniform lattice grid and a higher oder fem is used for solving the deformation of the solid and so on besides many engineering applications such as the vibration of the oil pipeline swinging of aquatic plants fish propeller and biological system coupling can be further studied credit

21580,fluid structure interaction fsi problems are often encountered in ocean science and technology in this present an implicit immersed boundary ib method combined with lattice boltzmann method lbm and finite element method fem is presented for the strong coupled simulations of fluid structure interaction velocity field is solved rapidly by lattice boltzmann bgk equations without external force and the deformation of a flexible structure was computed by fem fluid structure coupling was processed by immersed boundary implicit forced method the resulting combination gives an easy to use inexpensive and accurate technique to solve fsi problems simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary can be calculated directly and acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time lag between the fluid solver and solid solver several examples including flow over a static and deformable plate and the flow problems of an oscillating and cantilever flexible plate were simulated and analyzed the results agree well with the previous experimental and numerical investigations which indicate the ib lb fem proposed in this paper is an efficient and reliable fluid structure interaction numerical simulation method keywords immersed boundary method lattice boltzmann method finite element method fluid structure interaction strong coupled 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi problems are ubiquitous in all fields of nature and engineering such as the aquatic or vegetation swing in the ocean hussey et al 2015 mattis et al 2015 marine artificial structure deformation or vibration wang et al 2019 smith et al 2018 piperno and farhat 2001 and they are also extremely complicated due to its nonlinear nature and interaction between each other chakrabarti 2005 dowell and hall 2001 morand and ohayon 1995 an efficient accurate and robust computational approach is thus essential for the analysis and design systems in science and engineering over that last few decades substantial efforts have been focused on the development of modeling and simulating techniques for fsi problems brummelen and geuzaine 2010 wang and yan 2010 body fitted and moving mesh approaches yao et al 2015 gao and hu 2009 have been widely used for solving fsi problems these methods mainly include arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method ale sahin and mohseni 2009 wang et al 2013 2014 bueno et al 2015 basting et al 2017 and the deforming spatial domain stabilized space time dsd sst method tezduyar et al 1992a b johnson and tezduyar 1994 tezduyar 2001 tezduyar and sathe 2007 tian 2014 moving mesh approaches require mesh update methods that usually consists of two demands move the mesh as long as possible and remesh it as needed dukowicz and kodis 1987 rosis et al 2013 margolin and shashkov 2003 in order to maintain the element quality near moving boundaries or solid surfaces the moving mesh methods are based on ale approaches which is designed to solve hirt et al 1974 hughes et al 1981 donea et al 1982 fsi problems the fluid mesh is not fixed but follows the motion of the solid by mapping which is calculated based on the current position of the solid it is proved that ale methods are robust and accurate for engineering applications involving mesh movement the dsd sst method is one of the earliest space time formulation methods involving moving boundaries and interfaces and it is based on a stabilized finite element formula written in the spatiotemporal domain of fluid mechanics tezduyar 1991 first demonstrated the dsd sst method which allows spatial domain changes at various time levels and can be effectively applied to fluid dynamics computations involving moving boundaries and interfaces since then the dsd sst formulation has been widely used to simulate problems involving fsi and moving boundaries bazilevs et al 2013 provide a comprehensive introduction to the history latest technologies and practical applications of ale and dsd sst methods for fsi problems body fitted method has the advantage of satisfying kinematic constraints by construction so it has high order accuracy near the boundary however problems arise whenever strong deformations and large displacements or even topological changes of the interface lead to a degeneration of the computational mesh those above problems harm both condition of discrete process and the accuracy of the results therefore applying the body fitted methods to complex engineered systems require dedicated solutions to maintain the quality of the fluid mesh one method is to remesh that is when the distortion of the mesh becomes too serious all or part of the fluid domain is automatically re discretized in space tezduyar et al 1995 johnson and tezduyar 1999 takizawa et al 2014a so in recent years takizawa et al 2014b extends dsd sst methods which will include the true topological changes without remeshing but so far only applies to the problems with known beforehand or prescribed boundary motion for these reasons another different type of fsi solution method non body fitted approaches have become a popular alternative to fsi solution i e an immersed boundary method ibm were introduced by peskin et al peskin 1972 peskin 1977 peskin and printz 1993 it was used to study blood flows in and out from a beating heart it has since been extensively studied extended and applied to a wide variety of other fsi problems for example biomechanics doddi and bagchi 2009 le 2010 yazdani and bagchi 2013 ye et al 2016 the fluid machines posa et al 2011 kang et al 2012 bai et al 2014 tsai and colonius 2016 heat transfer nagendra et al 2014 xia et al 2015 eshghinejadfard and thevenin 2016 magnetic particles flows zhang et al 2014 ke et al 2017 ido et al 2017 nature disasters guo and cao 2019 the motions of oscillating hydrofoil huang and sung 2010 wang et al 2018a li et al 2018 the immersed type of methods solves the fluid equations in whole physical domain with an additional term of fictitious force representing the effects of the immersed boundary acting on the moving fluid no slip conditions are imposed on these immersed boundaries the location of which is updated using the velocities of the moving structure obtained by a structure solver the background fluid equations are solved by a fixed eulerian grid in the whole domain and the structure is solved by an independent lagrangian mesh overlaying on the eulerian grid the moving immersed boundary is tracked properly to couple these two compared with the moving mesh methods ibms have three advantages 1 fast and separate grid generation for fluid and solid without requirement of grid to be consistent with the fluid structure interface which will arbitrarily deform and move at large scales for solids or have very complex shapes and 2 the use of efficient and mature flow solvers on the fixed grid 3 the need for mesh update is completely eliminated the immersed structure can be either rigid or flexible a boundary or a body with finite volume although ibm is simple and efficient because a fixed mesh type solver is used the navier stokes equations are relatively difficult to solve fortunately lattice boltzmann method lbm chen and doolen 1998 he and luo 1997 is an alternative computational method based on the dynamics of particles since 1990s lbm as a fluid solver to replace solving the n s equations has been widely used in solving partial differential equations of engineering problems there are many studies for fsi problems using the lbm rosis et al 2013 kwon 2008 garcia et al 2011 based on fixed grid and interpolation to accomplish the various physical scenarios which are described in literatures chen and doolen 1998 he and luo 1997 without the need for interpolation and re meshing flouris et al 2018 presented an original 2nd order curved space lattice boltzmann fluid solver however the complex and moving boundaries are more difficult to deal for lbm but this is a distinguish advantage for ibm meanwhile lbm is also basically a fixed mesh type solver therefore lbm can be conveniently associated with ibm which can be called immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm for solving the fsi problems ib lbm has significant advantages include rapidly solving the fluid velocity with lbm and handing the complex moving boundaries with ibm feng and michaelides 2004 2005 are the first who attempt using ib lbm to simulate particulate flows including collisions since then the method is getting better and a set of improved ib lbm were developed shu et al 2007 wu and shu 2012 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2018b finite element method fem is widely used for computing the deformation of flexible body there are a number of earlier studies which are combining fem with immersed domain method and lbm tian et al 2011 favier et al 2014 li and favier 2017 on fluid flexible structure interactions however the application of the fem and lbm combine with ib method for fluid flexible structure interactions has few report in which the fluid force is only directly acted on the solid boundary or ib boundary therefore in this paper we combine a suitable ib lbm based on structural grids system with fem to develop a stable and efficient immersed boundary lattice boltzmann finite element method ib lb fem for simulating widespread fsi problems the main advantage of the method is its non slip boundary conditions which can be satisfied perfectly by enforced velocity on the boundary and the body forces which are acting on the immersed boundary are solved directly for solving the deformations of the flexible structure the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 is the simple introduction of the governing equations section 3 1 gives the fluid solver including lbm for solving flow field and ibm for solving body force section 3 2 introduces the structural solver of fem section 3 3 introduces ibm for solving body force acted on ib boundary section 3 4 shows the fluid structure interaction procedure for proposed ib lb fem section 4 and section 5 present respectively the validation and benchmark cases and the conclusions 2 governing equations as illustrated in fig 1 a solid body ω s with its boundary γ f s i or γ s that may change in time is placed on top of the fluid domain ω f as a result the fluid grid does not have to match at the fluid solid interface and hence a cartesian grid can be used for the fluid domain if needed the fluid is modeled using eulerian description and the solid using the lagrangian description the kinematic constraint at the interface between fluid and the solid can be enforced via lagrange multipliers 2 1 governing equations for fluids the governing equations for incompressible newtonian fluids are the navier stokes n s equations which are stated as follows in compact cartesian vector notation 1 v f 0 in ω f 2 ρ f v f σ f g e x t f in ω f v f where the superscript f stands for fluid g f is the fluid velocity ρ f is the body force on the fluid σ f is the fluid density and is the divergence operator the pseudo stress σ f μ f v f p i is given by 3 σ f μ f v f p i in which μ f is the fluid dynamical viscosity p is pressure density i is the unit matrix and is the gradient operator 2 2 governing equations for solids the governing equation for incompressible elastic solids in the current configuration is stated as 4 ρ s v s σ s g e x t s in ω s where the superscript s stands for solids ρ s is the solid density v s is the solid velocity g s is the body force on the solid and σ s is cauchy s stress that relates to the displacements in the solid via constitutive laws and the strain displacement relations liu and quek 2003 2 3 governing equations at the interface conditions have to be satisfied at the fluid structure interface denoted as γ f s i first the displacements should be the same along the interface namely 5 d f d s on γ f s i where d f and d s are the displacement of fluid and solid particle respectively the second one is the no slip condition which enforces that the fluid at interface moves at the same velocity as the boundary of the solid namely 6 v f v s on γ f s i based on the principle of virtual work and the theorem of lagrange multiplier eqs 2 and 4 may be combined into a single weak form as 7 ω s ρ s v s σ s g e x t s δ d s d v ω f ρ f v f σ f g e x t f δ d f d v γ f s i g f s i δ d s δ d f d v 0 where g f s i are the vector of lagrange multipliers which relates to the coupling forces in the original formulation of the ibm invented by peskin 1977 2002 the structure is represented as an immersed boundary which does occupy a finite volume thus we have ω s γ s γ f s i and the fluid domain becomes the entire computational domain ω ω f consequently eq 7 becomes 8 γ s ρ s v s σ s g e x t s g f s i δ d s d v ω ρ f v f σ f g e x t f g f s i l f γ s δ d f d v 0 where the function l f γ s is defined as 9 l f γ s 1 if on γ s 0 other eq 8 yields two independent equations 10 ρ s v s σ s g e x t s g f s i 0 in γ s 11 ρ f v f σ f g e x t f g f s i l f γ s 0 in ω in the traditional ib method the fsi force g f si is computed in the whole solid domain explicitly using eq 10 the computed force is then imposed on to eq 11 which is solved to yield fluid motion once the fluid velocity is solved the velocity of the solid is determined by applying the no slip condition of eq 6 the location of the boundary γ s is then updated by using the solid velocity in the existing implicit ib lbm method the flow is calculated by lbm the body forces caused by the immersed body are not calculated in advance but are implicitly determined using a corrected velocity field that precisely satisfies the conditions of no slip and no penetration at the fluid structure interface simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary directly acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time gap between the fluid solver and solid solver in a numerical implementation the discontinuous function l f γ s can be replaced by a continuous discrete delta function which typically has compact support over a band of grid points neighboring γ s the use of a discrete delta function can be also regarded as an interpolation of the fsi force from the immersed boundary to the fluid domain the same discrete delta function is applied to interpolate the velocity from the fluid domain to the immersed boundary as a result the interface is numerically represented by a thin layer of finite depth the location of the boundary γ s is then updated according the displacement of solid solver 3 methodology 3 1 lattice boltzmann method for fluid flow by using the bgk model eq 1 and eq 2 are satisfied by using lb equation and proper equilibrium distribution function the lb equation without body force g f has the following form 12 f α x ⅇ α δ t t δ t f α x t τ 1 f α x t f α e q x t where f α x t and f α e q x t are density distribution function and corresponding equilibrium at position x and time t respectively ⅇ α is the velocity vector in each nine directions in the two dimensional 2d for the popular d 2 q 9 model τ is the dimensionless relaxation time parameter related to the kinematic viscosity by υ c s 2 τ 0 5 δ t where c s is the speed of sound which is 1 3 for this model δ x 1 0 is lattice size and δ t 1 0 is time step the velocity set as follows delouei et al 2014 13 ⅇ α 0 0 c

macroscopic properties of the fluid define as follows 15 ρ α 1 9 f α ρ v f α 1 9 f α e α p ρ c s 2 3 2 structural solver in this study using finite element method fem solve the deformation of elastic body for fem a series of triangles namely finite triangular elements represent the flexible solid so the eq 10 can be expressed as in a semi discrete solid equations in matrix form at a time step 16 m s d n 1 s c s d n 1 s k s d n 1 s g n 1 s where d n 1 s d n 1 s and d n 1 s are the total displacement velocity and acceleration matrix of the solid at time level n 1 respectively d n 1 s d x 1 d y 1 d x i d y i d x n d y n t in which the d x i and d y i are the ith node s displacement in x and y directions in 2d cases additional m s c s and k s are the mass matrix the dampness matrix and stiffness matrix respectively g n 1 s is the external force vector matrix namely the fluid force g f si acted on the solid boundary nodes on the fsi interface in this work the newmark algorithm newmark 1959 is implemented which is based on the following approximations at time level n 1 17 d n 1 s 1 β δ t 2 d n 1 s d n s 1 β δ t d n s 1 2 β 1 d n s 18 d n 1 s γ β δ t d n 1 s d n s γ β 1 d n s δ t 2 γ β 2 d n s with the time step size δ t and the newmark parameters β 0 5 and γ 0 3 3 fe lb coupling algorithm via an implicit ib method without mesh computational process ib method is used to satisfy the no slip boundary condition between fluid and flexible solid in fact the interaction between the fluid and the flexible structure consists of two parts one is the interpolation of fluid velocity on the boundary points the other is the distribution of body force calculated from momentum exchange onto the bulk fluid in the conventional ibm the force density g f s i l f γ s is determined in advance in the fictitious fluid domain and then the corrected velocity v n 1 is obtained by solving the n s equation with additional momentum source however there is no guarantee that the velocity at the ib point interpolated from this corrected velocity v n 1 always satisfies the non slip boundary condition this drawback can be overcome by the implicit method the basic idea of the implicit method is that the force density g f s i l f γ s is considered as unknown which is evaluated implicitly in such a way that the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected velocity v n 1 at the eulerian grids equals to the given velocity of ib point wu and shu 2009 for convenience the fluid structure interaction force g f s i l f γ s in eq 11 is replaced by boundary body force density term g f similarly the fluid structure interaction force g f s i in eq 10 is replaced by solid boundary body force density term g s which can be expressed as 19 g f x t ω s g s x s t δ x x s t d ω where x and x are representing the euler coordinate of fluid fields entire computational domain and ib points s is lagrangian coordinate of solid boundary respectively δ x x s t is the smooth delta function suppose that the ib is represented by a set of points x i b i i 1 2 m and the fluid field is discretized by a fixed uniform cartesian mesh x j j 1 2 n with mesh spacing δ x δ y h which is shown in fig 2 furthermore we define two functions c j i and d i j which represent the interpolation and distribution functions respectively 20 c j i c x i b i x j 1 h 2 φ x i b i x j h φ y i b i y j h 21 d i j d x j x i b i 1 h 2 φ x j x i b i h φ y j y i b i h where 22 φ r 1 8 3 2 r 1 4 r 4 r 2 0 r 1 1 8 5 2 r 7 12 r 4 r 2 1 r 2 0 2 0 r note that the distribution function c j i maps the physical field from the ib points to the cartesian grids on the other hand the interpolation function d i j projects the physical field from the cartesian grids back to the ib points note that from eq 19 that the force density g f at the eulerian point is distributed from the boundary force g s through the dirac delta function interpolation eq 19 can be written in the discrete form as 23 g f x j t i c j i g s x i b i t δ s i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where δ s i is the i th segment boundary discrete volume according the second newtonian law we can know the force acting on fluid points 24 g f ρ f δ v δ t it is clear that adding a forcing term g f is equivalent to making a correction δ v in the velocity field substituting eq 23 into eq 24 we have 25 δ v x j t 1 ρ f i c j i g s x i b i t δ s i δ t i 1 2 m j 1 2 n it is noted that the unknowns in eq 25 are the boundary forces to satisfy the non slip boundary condition the velocity at the ib point interpolated from the corrected fluid velocity field via the smooth delta function d i j must be equal to the boundary velocity v x i b i t at the same position namely 26 v x i b i t j d i j v n 1 f x j t δ x δ y δ t j 1 2 n i 1 2 m here v n 1 f x j t is the velocity at the j th eulerian grid point of next time step expressed as the sum of intermediate velocity v f x j t and velocity correction δ v f x j t namely 27 v n 1 f x j t v f x j t δ v f x j t the immediate velocity v f x j t has obtained in section 3 1 follow this v n 1 f x j t and v f x j t note v n 1 f and v f below respectively substituting eqs 25 and 27 into eq 26 gives 28 v x i b i t j v f x j t d i j h 2 j i d i j δ s i c j i g s x i b i t δ t h 2 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the equation system for the boundary force is now formed which can be further written in the following matrix form as 29 a g n 1 s b where 30 a δ t h 2 d 11 δ s 1 d 12 δ s 1 d 1 n δ s 1 d 21 δ s 2 d 22 δ s 2 d 2 n δ s 2 d m 1 δ s m d m 2 δ s m d m n δ s m c 11 c 12 c 1 m c 21 c 22 c 2 m c n 1 c n 2 c n m 31 b u b 1 u b 2 u b m h 2 d 11 d 12 d 1 n d 21 d 22 d 2 n d m 1 d m 2 d m n v 1 f v 2 f v n f 32 g n 1 s g n 1 s 1 g n 1 s 2 g n 1 s m the unknown boundary force g s x i b i t at all ib points are obtained simultaneously which are then substituted into eqs 25 and 27 to calculate the velocity correction δ v f x j t and the velocity v n 1 f x j t respectively at next time step in fact the boundary force g s x i b i t at all ib points are also obtained simultaneously we can solve the solid governing eq 16 where g s x i b i t can also be seen the load of fluid acting on the solid boundary 3 4 computational procedure for proposed ib lbm fem as an implicit coupling procedure it consists in resolving a system of coupling equations involving the solid and fluid equations and the continuity conditions at the interface as well the details of the ib lbm fem algorithm for fluid flexible structure interaction are step 1 implement the lbm procedure with known fluid velocity at the n th step calculate the density ρ predicted velocity v f and pressure p on eulerian nodes using the lbm eqs 12 15 step 2 using the boundary force eqs 25 27 and 29 solve the boundary force g n 1 s the correct velocity δ v f x j t and the velocity v n 1 f x j t at the n 1 th step respectively step 3 perform the fem to calculate the deformation of the structure using the solid eq 16 combined with the newark eqs 17 and 18 and update the positions and velocities of structure note that in this step the load vector equal to the body force g n 1 s act on the ib nodes step 4 go back to step 1 and repeat it until obtaining the desired accuracy 4 results and discussion to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method four verification cases are performed 1 flow over a rigid plate employing the ib lbm 2 flow around a flexible plate using the ib lb fem 3 the vibration of flexible cantilever beam with an initial perturbation and 4 the deformation of a vertical cantilever elastic beam a linear elasticity material for solid is used in all cases 4 1 flow over a fixed rigid plate in this section using ib lbm analyze newtonian fluid flowing over a small thin plate with length of d and thickness of ε 0 08 d the plate is located at the middle of the flow channel fig 3 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions the channel length is l 30 d and its height is h 16 d the drag coefficients vortex length and flow characteristics are evaluated for a range of reynolds number r e which is defined as r e u d υ the drag coefficient is based on pressure force acting on the plate in cross flow and given as c d 0 d δ p d l 0 5 ρ f u 2 d where u is the uniform inlet flow velocity υ is the kinematic viscosity ρ f is the fluid density δ p is the pressure difference across the plate thickness and the value of p is obtained referring as the work of afra et al 2018 i e the pressure of p at a lagrangian node is obtained by interpolating from its closest four eulerian nodes the non dimensional time t defined as t t u d the meaning of t in the following sections is same fig 4 shows the evolution of the drag coefficients against t for different meshes of 1200 640 cells 1500 800 cells and 2100 1120 cells at re 30 the results show that the grid convergence have nothing to do with the mesh density but it is relate to the accuracy and the medium mesh can satisfy enough in this case the number of solid boundary nodes are 108 and eulerian grid have 1500 800 lattice cells lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size here c s 2 1 3 d 50 and u 0 05 fig 5 shows the streamlines for different reynolds numbers a pair of symmetric vortex are formed behind the plate when the reynolds number is less than 35 and the length of vortex is longer with the increase of reynolds number table 1 shows a comparison of the present ib lbm predictions for drag coefficient and vortex length with the earlier numerical and experimental results in et al 1995 afra et al 2018 dennis et al 1993 it is shown that the predicted drag coefficients and vortex lengths behind the plate as a function of the reynolds number are in good agreement with the earlier results reported their maximal relative error are respectively 5 66 and 8 80 compared with the published results fig 6 shows the evolution of the streamlines against the time t for reynolds number re 30 40 and 100 respectively a pair of symmetric vortex is formed behind the plate at the earlier stage of all simulations and the vortex is stretched with the increasing of computed steps finally we can see that the vortex shapes are different for different reynolds numbers at a steady flow stage fig 7 shows the length of the wake against the time t for reynolds number re 30 40 and 100 respectively it is shown that the length of wake reach to a stabilized value more rapidly for lower reynolds number and the length of the wake is more for higher reynolds number at a same time in the initial evolution stage 4 2 flow over a flexible plate in this section assuming the newtonian fluid flow over a deformable plate is in a laminar regime the deformation of a vertical flexible plate under two ends fixed is studied fig 8 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions here a plate thickness of ε 0 08 d is assumed the channel length is l 30 d and the passage width is changed to h 4 d young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols e and μ μ 1 3 the drag coefficients vortex length and flow characteristics are evaluated for a range of reynolds number the reynolds number drag coefficients and lift coefficients express as follows 33 r e u d υ c d f x 0 5 ρ f u 2 d c l f y 0 5 ρ f u 2 d where u is the uniform inlet flow velocity υ is the kinematic viscosity ρ f is the fluid density f x is the drag forces and f y is the lift forces in this case solid mesh contain 279 nodes and 448 elements the number of solid boundary nodes are 108 and eulerian grid have 1500 200 lattice cells lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size in this study we used the value of c d as a criterion the solution stops when this parameter reaches a steady state the number of iterations varies depending on the physical parameters such as r e and rigidity to prevent the numerical instability in the early time steps the uniform flow is gradually increasing from zero to a steady value of u namely u t u sin 0 5 π t t for t t where t is in lbm units and t is selected in the range 10 3 to 1 10 4 time steps depending on the order of magnitude of plate elastic modulus e that is the value of t is increased with decreasing of the rigidity of the plate to enhance the numerical stability fig 9 gives the stabilized condition of the minimum value of t min and the maximum relative displacement δ max d of point b for different young s modulus e at re 100 it is shown that the smaller of the young s modulus e the larger of minimum value of t min we also investigated that the numerical computation is hard to stability when e 3 10 3 fig 10 and fig 11 respectively show the streamlines at three non dimensional times and the temporal evolution of the mid point of the plate point b for e 5 10 3 pa at four different reynolds numbers here the non dimensional deviation from equilibrium state δ d is shown as a function of non dimensional time t t u d fig 10 shows that a pair of vortex is formed behind the elastic plate when r e is less than 35 otherwise the vortexes begin to drop off from the plate which agrees with reliable results afra et al 2018 meanwhile we can see that the vortexes fall off earlier for r e 100 and 50 than interim r e 35 because the latter is local in the critical scope between steady and unsteady flow the unsteady performance of the drop of the vortexes is acutest for re 100 and the fluid flow is developing when the non dimensional time t 90 we can also find from fig 11 that the deformation for the unsteady flow r e 100 is larger than the complete steady flow r e 30 and the interim critical flow r e 35 and 50 are all less than the latter r e 30 two plateaus are appeared at near the time instants t 1 and t 40 for re 100 duo to the developing flow the shake of the plate for r e 100 is periodic however for r e 35 and 50 the plate is shaking but the periodicity is not obvious 4 3 the vibration of a flexible plate from an initial perturbation in a cavity we farther validated the present code with the vibration of a vertical flexible plate which was initially perturbed in a cavity fig 12 shows the computational domain and boundary conditions solid mesh include 348 elements and 229 nodes and eulerian grid have 1000 250 lattice cells the length and the thickness of the flexible plate are 1 0 m and 0 06 m respectively the plate has the following material properties elastic modulus e 2 5 10 6 p a density of the plate ρ s 2550 k g m 3 density of the fluid ρ f 1 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosities of the fluid μ 1 0 k g m s the plate was initially perturbed with a uniformly distributed load of 30 n m until t 0 5 s we compared the results of the present scheme with the results of literatures lee et al 2012 gluck et al 2001 namkoong et al 2005 in fig 13 the damped displacement slopes and frequencies were in good agreement with the results of the previous researcher the maximum relative error of the peak displacement and frequencies are 7 36 and 3 48 respectively which further verifies that the present method has the advantages of simple grid division higher efficiency and easy to implement under the same computational accuracy 4 4 flow over a vertical cantilever elastic beam the study of a cantilever beam is a classical problem in solid mechanics timoshenko and young 1968 that has been applied in studies of a wide range of applications such as estimating the flow induced deflection pozrikidis 2010 and study the biological flows involving ciliated surfaces pozrikidis 2011 in this section deformation of a vertical cantilever elastic beam in the presence of cross flow is simulated fig 14 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols e and μ μ 0 4 solid mesh include 858 elements and 534 nodes and eulerian grid have 3000 500 lattice cells respectively lattice size is equivalent to the ib discretization size at the channel entrance velocity is a uniform flow as described in section 4 2 same strategy is used for preventing the numerical instability for the cases of e 2 10 8 p a with different reynolds number fig 15 shows the evolutions of the drag coefficients and displacements of the point in upper left corner of the beam point a we can see that the higher the reynolds number is the smaller the drag coefficient and the displacement of beam are we also see that the scale of backflow region below the beam and behind the free end is larger for higher reynolds numbers than the lower s as shown in fig 16 4 5 flow over an elastic ellipsoid the studies of an approximate sphere of elasticity such as the cells deformation in the blood vessels and the collision of sediment particles in the flow are a classical problem in the problems of fluid elastic solid interaction the deformation of an elastic ellipsoid in the presence of cross flow is computed in this section fig 19 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions the center o of the ellipsoid is fixed d equal to the length of 24 lattices the young s modulus and the poisson ratio are respectively represented by symbols of e and μ μ 0 4 the solid meshes include 528 elements and 294 nodes and the eulerian grids have 1800 800 lattice cells respectively fig 20 shows the boundary position of the elastic ellipsoid for different reynolds numbers and young s modulus at t 42 the deformation is increasing with the increase of reynolds numbers and the decrease of young s modulus fig 21 and fig 22 give the boundary velocities of the elastic ellipsoid and the vortex for different time instants at e 1 9 10 6 pa and re 1000 respectively the deformation is large and complex vortex shedding phenomenon is appearing the vortexes are separating from the elastic ellipsoid and the distributions of the boundary velocities are irregular fig 23 show the velocity of the leading edge point against time at e 1 9 10 6 pa and re 1000 which shows a good stability of whole computational process 5 conclusions and the future work in this study the ib lbm combined with fem was developed for the simulation of fsi problems the fluid field was simulated by lbm with bgk model without considering the body force and the direct implicit forcing ibm was used to compute the body force and satisfy non slip boundary conditions between fluid and flexible structure the fem was used to compute the deformation of a flexible structure with the boundary forces the body force caused by the immersed boundary is not pre calculated but implicitly determined using a corrected velocity field that accurately satisfies the no slip and no penetration conditions on the fluid structure interface simultaneously the body force on the immersed boundary directly acts as the load for structure solver so the displacement of structure can be obtained at the same time which is avoid the time lag between the fluid solver and solid solver the validity of the proposed method was verified by several numerical tests and the method is easy to implement and can be used for solving widespread fsi problems in the future another more stable and efficient fluid flexible solid interaction solver should be developed especial for higher reynolds number such as the turbulent model is combined with the ib method the single relaxation time srt bgk model is replaced by the multi relaxation time mrt model with non uniform lattice grid and a higher oder fem is used for solving the deformation of the solid and so on besides many engineering applications such as the vibration of the oil pipeline swinging of aquatic plants fish propeller and biological system coupling can be further studied credit

21581,vortex induced vibration viv responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces inspired by giant cactus are numerically studied and the range of reynolds number is 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the dynamic response of the structure adopts newmark beta method the effects of the height ratios k s d k s is the height of the bionic structure on viv suppression are discussed in detail and five different height ratios k s d include t1 k s d 0 000 t2 k s d 0 025 t3 k s d 0 050 t4 k s d 0 075 and t5 k s d 0 100 the viv response process is characterized by four sub regions region i region ii region iii and region iv as the height ratios of the bionic structures increase the range of the large amplitude motion region gradually decreases and the lock in range is smaller the maximum amplitude ratio in cross flow direction decreases from 1 50 t1 to 0 75 t5 and it reduces by about 50 the maximum in line amplitude ratio decreases from 0 35 t1 to 0 12 t5 which reduces by about 65 7 for t1 and t2 the jump phenomenon of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii however the jump phenomenon of frequency ratio occurs between region i and region ii for t3 t4 and t5 the

energy engineering and ocean engineering ding et al 2015 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2019 because viv is related to the structural design in many practical projects viv has attracted more and more concern when the vortex shedding frequency approaches to the natural frequency of the structure a large amplitude motion is observed called lock in or vortex synchronization dorogi and baranyi 2018 especially lock in causes more serious consequence for a low mass damping system which is one of the important factors in fatigue failure and structure instability franzini et al 2018 wang et al 2020 there are many numerical and experimental investigations on viv suppression viv suppression methods are divided into two categories based on the presence or absence of energy input rashidi et al 2016 zdravkovich 1981 if energy input is required the suppression method is an active method on the contrary the suppression method is a passive method some typical examples of active methods are electrical methods artana et al 2003 feedback control methods carini et al 2014 rotary oscillation lee and lee 2008 suction and blowing muralidharan et al 2013 thermal effect chatterjee d 2014 and synthetic jets wang et al 2019 b obviously the active methods are more complex and costly however the passive methods are simpler and are used in practical engineering the following mainly introduces some typical examples of passive control zhu and yao 2015 have done a lot of researches on the control rods using numerical methods and the effects of reynolds number diameter ratio d d control rod number n and spacing ratio g d on viv suppression were investigated the results showed that placing some control rods at the appropriate positions could suppress viv response well and the optimal parameters were d d 0 15 n 9 and g d 0 6 law and jaiman 2017 studied the low drag wake stabilization devices on viv suppression using numerical methods and four new wake devices were presented the results showed that c shaped device not only reduced the drag force of the system but also prevented the occurrence of galloping in the high reynolds number range wang et al 2018 presented a flexible plate installed on the cylinder and the results showed that viv responses were controlled sui et al 2016 experimentally studied the cylinder attached with helical strakes on viv suppression and the maximum suppression efficiency reached up to 98 huera huarte 2017 investigated the wire meshes on viv suppression and the maximum suppression efficiency of amplitude responses was more than 95 and the drag coefficient could be reduced by up to 20 zhu et al 2017 presented a free to rotate triangular fairing on viv suppression and results showed that the characteristic length and the rotational friction have great influence on viv suppression in addition to the above passive control methods by installing additional devices viv suppression can also be achieved by directly changing the surface of the structure gao et al 2018 studied the different surface roughness of the cylinder and four different roughness values k s d 0 0 005 0 010 and 0 020 were presented the results showed that the cross flow amplitude decreased with the increase of the surface roughness and the viv response region was only divided into two branches the surface roughness on viv suppression were also studied experimentally by kiu et al 2011 law and jaiman 2018 investigated the spanwise grooves on viv suppression and the cross flow amplitude was suppressed up to 37 and the drag coefficient was reduced by about 25 huang 2011 presented a triple starting helical groove on viv suppression and the depth of the groove is 0 16d and the width is 0 2d the results showed that the cross flow vibration amplitude was reduced by about 64 the structural features of giant cactus in the desert are critical to their survival and giant cactus in the desert are as show in fig 1 some ribs and spines can not only play an important role in control of water evaporation from the plants but also help to decrease wind loads and to prevent wind damage and uprooting by changing the flow around the plant the drag coefficient and the fluctuating lift coefficient could be effectively reduced the classical ribbed cylinder has 24 v shaped grooves yamagishi and oki 2005 there are some investigations on the aerodynamic characteristics of the cactus inspired cylinders however whether a circular cylinder with bionic surface inspired by giant cactus have better hydrodynamic characteristics whether viv responses of the cylinder with the bionic surface can be suppressed furthermore whether the height characteristics of the bionic surfaces can affect viv responses therefore a circular cylinder with the bionic surface inspired by giant cactus are investigated on viv suppression and the height ratios of the bionic surface are investigated in detail in this study viv responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces of different height ratios are numerically studied the numerical simulation is resolved using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the problem description is shown in section 2 and the computational method is shown in section 3 the effects of the bionic surfaces with different height ratios on viv suppression are discussed in section 4 section 5 shows some important conclusions 2 problem description 2 1 investigated geometries a cylinder two dampers and two springs are included in the two degree of freedom 2 dof viv system as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b is a schematic diagram of a cylinder with the bionic surface fig 2 c is the geometry of the bionic structure k is the spring stiffness and c is the system damping the height of the bionic surface is k s the bionic surface is composed of many ribs and the number of ribs is usually 10 30 yamagishi and oki 2005 the number of ribs n is 16 in this study the shape of the bionic structure is triangle as shown in fig 2 c and the angle of the arc corresponding to the bottom edge of the bionic structure is θ when n 16 θ 2π 0 05 yamagishi and oki 2005 d is the outer diameter of the cylinder which keeps the same for all cases d s is the inner diameter of the cylinder in most previous studies the inner diameter d s was a more general choice for the definition of bare cylinder and usually kept the same however there were also some studies about grooves on the surface of the cylinder when the effect of grooves on the flow around the cylinder was studied the outer diameter d was usually selected because the area in in line direction will not change when k s and d s change if the outer diameter d is selected this selection method is helpful to compare the changes in the drag force and drag coefficient law and jaiman 2018 the five different height ratios k s d of the bionic surface are investigated including 0 0 025 0 050 0 075 and 0 100 table 1 shows the parameters of 2 dof system the vibration in in line direction and the vibration in the cross flow direction is all considered in 2 dof viv system 2 2 motion equations in order to resolve the 2 dof viv response the mass spring damper model is established the equations of system can be expressed as wang et al 2019 c 1 m x c x k x f x t 2 m y c y k y f y t where 3 m m d 2 4 π ρ l 4 m m m a d d 5 m a d d c a d 2 4 π ρ l 6 c 2

for the cylinder zhu et al 2017 3 computational method 3 1 mathematical model the two dimensional unsteady rans equations in conjunction with sst k ω turbulence model are used in numerical simulation wang et al 2019 b user defined functions udf are embedded in fluent for resolving the viv response the vibration responses of the structure are resolved by using the newmark β method in udf pasetto et al 2019 in order to solve velocity and displacement two parameters α and β are introduced the two basic equations are expresses as follows 8 u t δ t u t u t δ t 1 2 β u t β u t δ t δ t 2 9 u t δ t u t

δ t u t α β 1 u t α 2 β 1 δ t u t c δt is the time step the above equations are solved using the c language and the c language algorithms are written in udf in order to solve the fluid force acting on the structure 2d rans equations and sst k ω turbulence model are adopted in fluent then the acceleration velocity and displacement of the structure are solved in udf finally the mesh of the computational domain is updated based on new motion state fig 3 shows the process of numerical calculation 3 2 the validation of mesh dependence fig 4 shows the computational domain which includes four sub regions external flow field sub domain x slipway and y slipway the range of this domain is 60d length in the in flow direction and 40d width in the cross flow direction and the blocking ratio is 0 025 the blocking ratio is w d and w is the width 40d in the cross flow direction when w d is less than 0 05 the influence of the width of the computational domain on the numerical calculation is less gao et al 2018 the ranges of four sub regions are set as shown in fig 4 the boundary conditions are set as follows the inlet is the velocity inlet u u v 0 the outlet is the outflow u x 0 v x 0 and the side wall is the symmetry boundary u y 0 v 0 the mesh is updated using the layer method and the specific steps of this method have been shown in the author s previous papers wang et al 2019 b wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2020 the moving boundary is described by an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme which makes the computational mesh around the structure moving along with the viv system wang et al 2019 c the interfaces are adopted to connect the different mesh regions the sub domain and cylinder wall move up and down together the sub domain y slipway x slipway and external flow field are tessellated with different shapes of meshes the y slipway x slipway and external flow field are meshed with quadrilateral grids the sub domain is meshed with triangular grids the boundary layer meshes around the cylinder are quadrilateral grids to improve the accuracy on resolving the flow around the structure the layers of boundary layer mesh are 25 and the growth ratio of boundary layer mesh is 1 05 the height of the first layer is determined by y which is expressed as 14 y 0 172 δ y d r e 0 9 where δy is height of the first layer mesh based on the previous research wang et al 2019 c y is less than 1 the mesh has a greater impact on the results of numerical calculations so the mesh dependence needs to be verified five different mesh densities are shown in table 2 including 3 0 104 q1 6 0 104 q2 9 0 104 q3 1 2 105 q4 and 1 5 105 q5 the percentage in brackets is the comparison of this mesh to the previous mesh when the differences of a y d and f s f n between the two meshes are less than 0 1 the influence of the mesh on the calculation results can be negligible gao et al 2018 the mesh changes from q4 to q5 the difference percentages of a y d and f s f n are 0 05 and 0 04 therefore the mesh q5 can be adopted and fig 5 shows the meshes 3 3 the validation of numerical model the experimental data jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the similar numerical data gao et al 2018 kang et al 2019 are referenced to verify the accuracy of the numerical methods in this paper the range of reduced velocity is 2 u r u r u f n d 14 and the results of the numerical model verification are shown in fig 6 the fast fourier transform fft of lift coefficient can get vortex shedding frequency f s jauvtis and williamson used three branches to distinguish the viv response region which are the initial branch u r 4 0 the upper branch 4 u r 8 0 and the lower branch u r 8 0 jauvtis and williamson 2004 from the upper branch to the lower branch the amplitude ratio decreases abruptly while the frequency ratio increases abruptly the reduced velocity where this phenomenon occurs is at 6 u r 8 jauvtis and williamson 2004 this phenomenon is also observed at u r 7 0 in this paper obviously there are some differences between the results of the numerical model in this paper and results in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the possible reasons are the differences in reynolds number the reason for the difference of reynolds number in this paper is that the diameter of cylinder is larger than that in experiment and the velocity range is the same for them the u r is calculated by the change of f n in the gao s numerical model gao et al 2018 and the reynolds number fixed at 5000 in numerical verification the reynolds number or the reduced velocity can be selected in the expression of x coordinate because the reynolds number cannot be exactly the same the expression of x coordinate in fig 6 selects the reduced velocity the numerical solution in this paper can clearly show three branches and the lock in region can also be clearly shown compared with the prediction accuracy of amplitude response the prediction accuracy of frequency response is higher the frequency ratio response is in good agreement with that in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the u r is calculated by the change of u in the jauvtis s experimental model jauvtis and williamson 2004 kang s numerical model kang et al 2019 and the numerical model in this paper two different ranges of reynolds number were provided in kang s model including 5 8 103 re 4 08 104 and 1 305 103 re 9 18 104 the amplitude ratio response is in good agreement with that in kang studies kang et al 2019 therefore the numerical scheme in this paper is acceptable 4 results and discussion 4 1 cylinder response the cross flow amplitude responses and the vortex shedding frequency responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces of five different height ratios k s d are shown in fig 8 when the vortex shedding frequency f s approaches the natural frequency f n of the structure the lock in of viv response occurs jauvtis and williamson 2004 the vortex shedding frequency f s of viv response is obtained by fast fourier transform fft of the lift force for a large mass ratio structure m o 100 in air the lock in occurs when f s f n 1 0 and the range of the lock in region is very small feng 1968 however the range of lock in region for a low mass ratio structure m o 10 is lager in water khalak and williamson 1999 compared with that in air the natural frequency of the structure is the frequency in still water the flow around the structure is changed when the structure vibrates and the additional mass also has a greater impact on a low mass ratio structure in water jauvtis and williamson 2004 therefore the lock in still occurs when f s f n is far from 1 and this phenomenon is more clearly observed in water when the mass ratio is smaller wang et al 2019 c the viv response region is usually divided into three branches khalak and williamson 1999 including a lock in region the upper branch and two other regions the initial branch and the lower branch in order to show the lock in region more clearly the lock in region is divided into two in fig 7 the viv response region is divided into four regions as shown in table 3 in region i the frequency ratios of the different cylinders show a rapid upward trend and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 the amplitude ratios also show a rapid upward trend and the maximum amplitude ratios are about 0 6 the amplitude ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 is more than that of t1 when 3 0 u r 4 5 in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are close to 1 0 and then more than 1 0 however the frequency ratio of t5 is more than 1 0 at u r 4 5 the frequency ratio of t4 is more than 1 0 at u r 5 0 the frequency ratio of t3 is more than 1 0 at u r 6 0 and the frequency ratio of t1 and t2 is more than 1 0 at u r 7 0 the lock in phenomenon gradually occurs in advanced as the height ratio of the bionic surface increases the amplitude ratios show a rapid upward trend for t1 t2 and t3 the amplitude ratio of t1 reaches the maximum value of 1 5 at u r 7 0 the amplitude ratio of t2 reaches the maximum value of 1 3 at u r 6 5 and the amplitude ratio of t3 reaches the maximum value of 0 9 at u r 5 5 for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are less than 8 0 and the amplitude ratio changes gently the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio decreases from 1 5 t1 to 0 75 t5 which reduces by about 50 in region iii the frequency ratios of the different cylinders are more than 1 0 and near a more stable value therefore they are in a stable lock in region for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are similar to that in region ii and they do not increase and remains stability however the amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 reduce first and then remains stability the stable amplitude ratio of t1 is about 1 0 and the stable amplitude ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are about 0 8 in region iv the amplitude ratios begin to decrease rapidly however the amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 begin to decrease at u r 11 0 the amplitude ratio of t4 begins to decrease at u r 10 0 and the amplitude ratio of t5 begins to decrease at u r 9 0 at the same time the jump of frequency ratios for t4 and t5 occurs when u r 10 11 obviously the range of the lock in region is smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 as reduced velocity u r increases the cross flow amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 0 figs 8 11 show the time histories of viv responses and four typical reduced velocities u r 3 0 6 0 9 0 and 13 0 are selected based on the viv response region fig 8 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i in region i the amplitude ratios and frequency ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are similar the maximum cross flow amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are about 0 15 the maximum cross flow amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 10 the frequency ratios of t2 and t3 are less than that of t1 and the frequency ratios of t4 and t5 are more than that of t1 fig 9 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 and t2 are near 1 0 but they are less than 1 0 however the frequency ratios of t3 t4 and t5 are more than 1 0 the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks the maximum amplitude ratio of t1 are about 1 2 the maximum amplitude ratio of t2 is about 1 1 and the maximum amplitude ratios of t3 t4 and t5 are about 0 75 fig 10 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 9 0 re 3 6 104 in region iii in region iii the frequency ratio of t1 is more than 1 0 and the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks the frequency ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are also more than 1 0 and the frequency spectrum of lift coefficient has three peaks the appearance of multi peaks is related to the bionic surface which may change the flow around the cylinder the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio of t1 is about 1 0 and they are about 0 75 for t2 t3 t4 and t5 fig 11 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv in region iv the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are far away from 1 0 the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks for t1 and t2 however the frequency spectrum of amplitude ratio is lower than that of the lift coefficient for t3 and the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient is about twice that of the amplitude ratio the main peak values of frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient and the amplitude ratio coincide again for t4 and t5 but the main peak values of frequency spectrum of t4 and t5 are more than that of t1 viv responses of t4 and t5 are characterized by the high frequency ratio and the low amplitude ratio in region iv 4 2 vortex force and vortex pattern in order to better analyze the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient in section 4 1 the lift force coefficient is further analyzed and vortex pattern is analyzed the total lift force consists of the vortex force f vortex and the potential force f potential the vortex force is caused by the vortex shedding and the potential force is caused by the potential added mass force govardhan and williamson 2000 obviously the vortex force is related to the vortex pattern the total lift force can be expressed as 15 f y t f v o r t e x t f p o t e n t i a l t normalizing all the forces by ρu2dl 2 eq 15 can be expressed as 16 c y t c v o r t e x t c p o t e n t i a l t where c potential t can be expressed as 17 c p o t e n t i a l t 2 π 3 a y t d u f s d 2 in which a y t is the vibrate amplitude in cross flow direction f s is the vortex shedding frequency c potential t is always in phase with a y t the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders are shown in figs 12 15 the vorticity is defined as ω u y v x fig 12 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i in region i the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are in phase the relationship between the total lift force coefficient c l t and the vortex force coefficient c vortex t is c l t c vortex t so the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 2s modes and 2s mode means that two vortices shed in each cycle 2s mode is similar to carmen vortex and this phenomenon also appeared in the experiments of khalak and williamson 1999 the potential force coefficient is very small so the cross flow vibrate amplitude is very small the maximum potential force coefficients of t4 and t5 are slightly smaller than that of t1 t2 and t3 fig 13 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii in region ii the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase at the same time the vortex force coefficients of t1 and t2 have two peaks which is why the two peaks appears in fig 9 the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t3 t4 and t5 are close to π therefore the total lift force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 decrease obviously and the bionic surface improves the flow characteristics around the cylinder the vortex patterns of t1 and t2 are still 2s modes but the vortex patterns of t3 t4 and t5 are 2p modes 2p mode means that two vortices shed from each side of the cylinder in each half cycle fig 14 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 10 0 re 4 0 104 in region iii in region iii the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all about π with the increase of the height ratio of the bionic surface the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients decrease gradually the vortex pattern of t1 is 2p mode but the vortex patterns of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are p s modes p s mode means that three vortices shed in each cycle and two vortices shed from one side of the cylinder and only one vortex shed from other side of the cylinder in the lock in region the strength of vortices increases and the effect on the cylinder also increases the vortex mode is more complex in the lock in region fig 15 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv in region iv the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase however the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are in phase the relationship between the total lift force coefficient c l t and the vortex force coefficient c vortex t is c l t c vortex t so the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force for t3 t4 and t5 the potential force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are very small so the cross flow vibrate amplitudes are very small the vortex force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are smaller than that of t1 and t2 therefore the bionic surface can well suppress the viv response the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all 2s modes in this region 4 3 frequency ratio and vortex phase in order to understand the transition of vortex pattern the vortex phase between the vortex force and the cross flow amplitude ratio based on the vortex shedding frequency ratio f s f n the vortex phase can be expressed as govardhan and williamson 2000 18 t a n φ v o r t e x 2 ξ f s f n 1 f s f n 2 where φ vortex is the vortex phase the vortex phases of five different cylinders are shown in fig 16 for a smooth cylinder t1 k s d 0 0 the vortex pattern is 2s mode in region i region ii and region iv the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is 2p mode in region iii in region i and region ii the frequency ratio is near 1 0 but it is not more than 1 0 when the frequency ratio is more than 1 0 the jump of frequency ratio occurs and the vortex phase jump from about 0 to about 180 in this process the phase difference between the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients jumps from 0 to π for t2 k s d 0 025 the vortex pattern is 2s mode in region i region ii and region iv the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is p s mode in region iii the vortex force coefficient of t2 is smaller than that of t1 and the vortex pattern is changed because of the bionic surface for t3 k s d 0 050 t4 k s d 0 075 and t5 k s d 0 100 the vortex patterns are 2s modes in region i and region iv however the vortex patterns are 2p modes in region ii and they are p s modes in region iii the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region i and region ii for t3 t4 and t5 therefore the jump of frequency ratio occurs earlier for t3 t4 and t5 compared with that for t1 and t2 it can be seen from fig 16 that the jump of the frequency ratio gradually occurs earlier as the height ratio increases 4 4 general discussion the in line amplitude responses of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 17 the in line amplitude response of a smooth cylinder was studied in the jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 which is referenced in fig 17 t1 is also a smooth cylinder and the in line amplitude ratio of t1 are good agree with that of jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 in region i the in line amplitude ratios of t1 and t2 have similar trends increasing first and then decreasing the change trends of t4 and t5 are opposite to that of t1 and t2 and the possible causes are that the bionic surfaces change the flow around the structure the in line amplitude ratios are less than 0 2 in region ii the fluctuation trends of t1 t2 and t3 are similar which show an upward trend the maximum in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are approximately 0 35 at u r 7 0 0 22 at u r 6 8 and 0 20 at u r 5 5 however the maximum in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 16 at u r 4 0 and 0 12 at u r 4 0 the in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 decrease rapidly in region ii and then keep at a stable value which is about 0 025 in region iii the in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are reduced to about 0 0 the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 decrease rapidly and the maximum in line amplitude ratios are less than 0 1 in region iv because viv response is far away the lock in region the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are very small the following conclusions can be drawn based on the above analysis 1 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum in line amplitude ratios gradually decrease 2 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the range of the large amplitude motion region gradually decreases 3 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum in line amplitude ratio occurs earlier 4 the maximum in line amplitude ratio decreases from 0 35 t1 to 0 12 t5 which reduces by about 65 7 the mean drag coefficients of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 18 in region i the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 and t3 have similar trends increasing first and then decreasing the change trends of t4 and t5 are opposite to that of t1 t2 and t3 this phenomenon results the same fluctuation trends of the in line amplitude ratios when u r 3 0 the mean drag coefficients and the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 show an upward trend which was observed in jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 in region ii the fluctuation trends of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are similar showing an upward trend the maximum mean drag coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 3 0 at u r 7 0 3 0 at u r 6 8 2 5 at u r 5 5 2 3 at u r 5 0 and 2 25 at u r 4 5 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum mean drag coefficient occurs gradually earlier the mean drag coefficients of a stationary cylinder is about 1 0 in this reynolds number range jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu et al 2017 and the maximum mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder is about 3 0 which has a threefold increase over that of the stationary cylinder the similar phenomenon has been also observed in previous studies jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu et al 2017 due to the vortex induced vibration response of the bare cylinder the peak mean drag coefficient of the structure is quite large when the vibration amplitude is very large in the lock in region however the mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder in viv response region is close to the that of the stationary cylinder when the vibration amplitude is very low in region iii the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 show a downward trend in region iv the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 keep at a low value in particular the mean drag coefficient of t5 is reduced to about 0 8 at u r 10 0 the maximum drag coefficient decreases from 3 0 t1 to 2 25 t5 which reduce by about 25 the motion trajectories of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 19 the typical motion trajectory of eight shaped is observed for t1 however as ur increases the size of eight shaped increases first and then decreases the range of eight shaped figure for t1 is 0 01m a x 0 01m 0 002m a y 0 002m at u r 2 0 the range of eight shaped figure is 0 02m a x 0 06m 0 12m a y 0 12m at u r 6 0 and the range of eight shaped figure is 0 063m a x 0 075m 0 09m a y 0 09m at u r 12 0 as ur increases the in line vibration displacement increases and the central location of the in line vibration is about 0 005m for t1 at u r 2 0 0 030 m at u r 6 0 0 066 m at u r 12 0 for t2 the motion trajectories are ellipse shaped at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and raindrop shaped at u r 12 0 for t3 the motion trajectories are disordered at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and eight shaped at u r 12 0 for t4 and t5 the motion trajectories are eight shaped at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and line shaped at u r 12 0 when u r 6 0 lock in region the motion trajectories of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all the eight shaped but the ranges of motion trajectories are smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 in particular the in line amplitude of t4 and t5 is close to 0 at u r 12 0 4 5 discussion on control mechanism of the bionic surface in sections 4 1 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 the effect of the bionic surface on the vortex induced vibration responses are discussed in detailed however the control mechanism of the bionic structure needs to be further understood so the flow characteristics around the bionic surface are analyzed fig 20 shows the vorticity contours and pressure contours around the bionic surface because the boundary layer separation occurs on the cylinder surface there will be vortex shedding behind the cylinder generally there is a vortex shedding on the upper surface r1 and a vortex shedding on the lower surface respectively r2 as shown in fig 21 and the direction of the vortex is opposite the distance between the two vortices is l obviously the interaction between the two vortices is very strong when l is very small both vortices r1 and r2 are low pressure vortices as shown fig 20 b and the strength of the low pressure vortex is v the comparison of distances between the two vortices of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 is l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 the bionic structure destroys the wake behind the cylinder because the coupling strength of two vortices is reduced the comparison of coupling strength of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 is v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 when v decreases the viv response is suppressed according to the previous research law and jaiman 2017 the splitter plate can prevent the interaction of r1 and r2 which is helpful for suppressing viv responses as show in fig 21 b because l 5 is bigger than l 1 as shown in fig 21 a and c the interaction of r1 and r2 is suppressed according to the above analysis the viv responses can be suppressed by the bionic structure the streamlines around the bionic structure are shown in fig 22 based on fig 22 a the formation area of the boundary layer separation is between p1 and p2 the bionic structure destroys the boundary layer separation between p1 and p2 as shown in fig 22 b and c when the height of bionic structure is more than a certain value the boundary layer separation occurs at the sharp point of the ribs the formation of the smaller vortices is observed between the two sharp points as shown in fig 22 d and e fig 22 f is the schematic diagram of streamline of t5 as shown in fig 22 f a small vortex is generated between the two sharp points and the flow will move away from the wall surface after passing the sharp point because the smaller vortices can improve the flow characteristics around the cylinder the area of the low pressure on the cylinder wall is smaller as shown fig 20 b 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration viv of the cylinders with bionic surfaces inspired by giant cactus are numerically studied and the range of reynolds number is 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is adopted for numerical calculation and the dynamic response of the structure adopts newmark beta method the effects of different height ratios of the bionic surfaces on viv suppression are discussed in detail the following conclusions are justified 1 based on the viv responses the viv response region is divided into four regions in region i the frequency ratios of the different cylinders show a rapid upward trend and the amplitude ratios also show a rapid upward trend in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon gradually occurs in advanced as the height ratio of the bionic surface increases the amplitude ratios show a rapid upward trend for t1 t2 and t3 the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio decreases from 1 5 t1 to 0 75 t5 which reduces by about 50 in region iii the frequency ratios of the cylinders are more than 1 0 and they are in a stable lock in region for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are similar to that in region ii and they do not increase and remains stability in region iv the amplitude ratios begin to decrease rapidly the range of the lock in region is smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 2 in region i the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are in phase and the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 2s modes in region ii the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t3 t4 and t5 are close to π the vortex patterns of t1 and t2 are still 2s modes but the vortex patterns of t3 t4 and t5 are 2p modes in region iii the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all about π with the increase of the height ratio of the bionic surface the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients decrease gradually the vortex pattern of t1 is 2p mode but the vortex patterns of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are p s modes the vortex mode is more complex in the lock in region in region iv the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase 3 for a smooth cylinder t1 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii when the frequency ratio is more than 1 0 the jump of frequency ratio occurs and the vortex phase jump from about 0 to about 180 for t2 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is p s mode in region iii for t3 t4 and t5 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region i and region ii the jump of frequency ratio occurs earlier for t3 t4 and t5 compared with that for t1 and t2 the author provides a method that may be used in engineering practice and provides some rules that can be used in engineering practice there are many parameters of the bionic structure that may affect the viv responses including the number of ribs n the height ratio k s d and the shapes of the ribs in this paper the parameters of the bionic structure studied are n 16 and 0 k s d 0 1 according to the

21581,vortex induced vibration viv responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces inspired by giant cactus are numerically studied and the range of reynolds number is 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the

energy engineering and ocean engineering ding et al 2015 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2019 because viv is related to the structural design in many practical projects viv has attracted more and more concern when the vortex shedding frequency approaches to the natural frequency of the structure a large amplitude motion is observed called lock in or vortex synchronization dorogi and baranyi 2018 especially lock in causes more serious consequence for a low mass damping system which is one of the important factors in fatigue failure and structure instability franzini et al 2018 wang et al 2020 there are many numerical and experimental investigations on viv suppression viv suppression methods are divided into two categories based on the presence or absence of energy input rashidi et al 2016 zdravkovich 1981 if energy input is required the suppression method is an active method on the contrary the suppression method is a passive method some typical examples of active methods are electrical methods artana et al 2003 feedback control methods carini et al 2014 rotary oscillation lee and lee 2008 suction and blowing muralidharan et al 2013 thermal effect chatterjee d 2014 and synthetic jets wang et al 2019 b obviously the active methods are more complex and costly however the passive methods are simpler and are used in practical engineering the following mainly introduces some typical examples of passive control zhu and yao 2015 have done a lot of researches on the control rods using numerical methods and the effects of reynolds number diameter ratio d d control rod number n and spacing ratio g d on viv suppression were investigated the results showed that placing some control rods at the appropriate positions could suppress viv response well and the optimal parameters were d d 0 15 n 9 and g d 0 6 law and jaiman 2017 studied the low drag wake stabilization devices on viv suppression using numerical methods and four new wake devices were presented the results showed that c shaped device not only reduced the drag force of the system but also prevented the occurrence of galloping in the high reynolds number range wang et al 2018 presented a flexible plate installed on the cylinder and the results showed that viv responses were controlled sui et al 2016 experimentally studied the cylinder attached with helical strakes on viv suppression and the maximum suppression efficiency reached up to 98 huera huarte 2017 investigated the wire meshes on viv suppression and the maximum suppression efficiency of amplitude responses was more than 95 and the drag coefficient could be reduced by up to 20 zhu et al 2017 presented a free to rotate triangular fairing on viv suppression and results showed that the characteristic length and the rotational friction have great influence on viv suppression in addition to the above passive control methods by installing additional devices viv suppression can also be achieved by directly changing the surface of the structure gao et al 2018 studied the different surface roughness of the cylinder and four different roughness values k s d 0 0 005 0 010 and 0 020 were presented the results showed that the cross flow amplitude decreased with the increase of the surface roughness and the viv response region was only divided into two branches the surface roughness on viv suppression were also studied experimentally by kiu et al 2011 law and jaiman 2018 investigated the spanwise grooves on viv suppression and the cross flow amplitude was suppressed up to 37 and the drag coefficient was reduced by about 25 huang 2011 presented a triple starting helical groove on viv suppression and the depth of the groove is 0 16d and the width is 0 2d the results showed that the cross flow vibration amplitude was reduced by about 64 the structural features of giant cactus in the desert are critical to their survival and giant cactus in the desert are as show in fig 1 some ribs and spines can not only play an important role in control of water evaporation from the plants but also help to decrease wind loads and to prevent wind damage and uprooting by changing the flow around the plant the drag coefficient and the fluctuating lift coefficient could be effectively reduced the classical ribbed cylinder has 24 v shaped grooves yamagishi and oki 2005 there are some investigations on the aerodynamic characteristics of the cactus inspired cylinders however whether a circular cylinder with bionic surface inspired by giant cactus have better hydrodynamic characteristics whether viv responses of the cylinder with the bionic surface can be suppressed furthermore whether the height characteristics of the bionic surfaces can affect viv responses therefore a circular cylinder with the bionic surface inspired by giant cactus are investigated on viv suppression and the height ratios of the bionic surface are investigated in detail in this study viv responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces of different height ratios are numerically studied the numerical simulation is resolved using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the problem description is shown in section 2 and the computational method is shown in section 3 the effects of the bionic surfaces with different height ratios on viv suppression are discussed in section 4 section 5 shows some important conclusions 2 problem description 2 1 investigated geometries a cylinder two dampers and two springs are included in the two degree of freedom 2 dof viv system as shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b is a schematic diagram of a cylinder with the bionic surface fig 2 c is the geometry of the bionic structure k is the spring stiffness and c is the system damping the height of the bionic surface is k s the bionic surface is composed of many ribs and the number of ribs is usually 10 30 yamagishi and oki 2005 the number of ribs n is 16 in this study the shape of the bionic structure is triangle as shown in fig 2 c and the angle of the arc corresponding to the bottom edge of the bionic structure is θ when n 16 θ 2π 0 05 yamagishi and oki 2005 d is the outer diameter of the cylinder which keeps the same for all cases d s is the inner diameter of the cylinder in most previous studies the inner diameter d s was a more general choice for the definition of bare cylinder and usually kept the same however there were also some studies about grooves on the surface of the cylinder when the effect of grooves on the flow around the cylinder was studied the outer diameter d was usually selected because the area in in line direction will not change when k s and d s change if the outer diameter d is selected this selection method is helpful to compare the changes in the drag force and drag coefficient law and jaiman 2018 the five different height ratios k s d of the bionic surface are investigated including 0 0 025 0 050 0 075 and 0 100 table 1 shows the parameters of 2 dof system the vibration in in line direction and the vibration in the cross flow direction is all considered in 2 dof viv system 2 2 motion equations in order to resolve the 2 dof viv response the mass spring damper model is established the equations of system can be expressed as wang et al 2019 c 1 m x c x k x f x t 2 m y c y k y f y t where 3 m m d 2 4 π ρ l 4 m m m a d d 5 m a d d c a d 2 4 π ρ l 6 c 2

for the cylinder zhu et al 2017 3 computational method 3 1 mathematical model the two dimensional unsteady rans equations in conjunction with sst k ω turbulence model are used in numerical simulation wang et al 2019 b user defined functions udf are embedded in fluent for resolving the viv response the vibration responses of the structure are resolved by using the newmark β method in udf pasetto et

the structure 2d rans equations and sst k ω turbulence model are adopted in fluent then the acceleration velocity and displacement of the structure are solved in udf finally the mesh of the computational domain is updated based on new motion state fig 3 shows the process of numerical calculation 3 2 the validation of mesh dependence fig 4 shows the computational domain which includes four sub regions external flow field sub domain x slipway and y slipway the range of this domain is 60d length in the in flow direction and 40d width in the cross flow direction and the blocking ratio is 0 025 the blocking ratio is w d and w is the width 40d in the cross flow direction when w d is less than 0 05 the influence of the width of the computational domain on the numerical calculation is less gao et al 2018 the ranges of four sub regions are set as shown in fig 4 the boundary conditions are set as follows the inlet is the velocity inlet u u v 0 the outlet is the outflow u x 0 v x 0 and the side wall is the symmetry boundary u y 0 v 0 the mesh is updated using the layer method and the specific steps of this method have been shown in the author s previous papers wang et al 2019 b wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2020 the moving boundary is described by an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme which makes the computational mesh around the structure moving along with the viv system wang et al 2019 c the interfaces are adopted to connect the different mesh regions the sub domain and cylinder wall move up and down together the sub domain y slipway x slipway and external flow field are tessellated with different shapes of meshes the y slipway x slipway and external flow field are meshed with quadrilateral grids the sub domain is meshed with triangular grids the boundary layer meshes around the cylinder are quadrilateral grids to improve the accuracy on resolving the flow around the structure the layers of boundary layer mesh are 25 and the growth ratio of boundary layer mesh is 1 05 the height of the first layer is determined by y which is expressed as 14 y 0 172 δ y d r e 0 9 where δy is height of the first layer mesh based on the previous research wang et al 2019 c y is less than 1 the mesh has a greater impact on the results of numerical calculations so the mesh dependence needs to be verified five different mesh densities are shown in table 2 including 3 0 104 q1 6 0 104 q2 9 0 104 q3 1 2 105 q4 and 1 5 105 q5 the percentage in brackets is the comparison of this mesh to the previous mesh when the differences of a y d and f s f n between the two meshes are less than 0 1 the influence of the mesh on the calculation results can be negligible gao et al 2018 the mesh changes from q4 to q5 the difference percentages of a y d and f s f n are 0 05 and 0 04 therefore the mesh q5 can be adopted and fig 5 shows the meshes 3 3 the validation of numerical model the experimental data jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the similar numerical data gao et al 2018 kang et al 2019 are referenced to verify the accuracy of the numerical methods in this paper the range of reduced velocity is 2 u r u r u f n d 14 and the results of the numerical model verification are shown in fig 6 the fast fourier transform fft of lift coefficient can get vortex shedding frequency f s jauvtis and williamson used three branches to distinguish the viv response region which are the initial branch u r 4 0 the upper branch 4 u r 8 0 and the lower branch u r 8 0 jauvtis and williamson 2004 from the upper branch to the lower branch the amplitude ratio decreases abruptly while the frequency ratio increases abruptly the reduced velocity where this phenomenon occurs is at 6 u r 8 jauvtis and williamson 2004 this phenomenon is also observed at u r 7 0 in this paper obviously there are some differences between the results of the numerical model in this paper and results in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the possible reasons are the differences in reynolds number the reason for the difference of reynolds number in this paper is that the diameter of cylinder is larger than that in experiment and the velocity range is the same for them the u r is calculated by the change of f n in the gao s numerical model gao et al 2018 and the reynolds number fixed at 5000 in numerical verification the reynolds number or the reduced velocity can be selected in the expression of x coordinate because the reynolds number cannot be exactly the same the expression of x coordinate in fig 6 selects the reduced velocity the numerical solution in this paper can clearly show three branches and the lock in region can also be clearly shown compared with the prediction accuracy of amplitude response the prediction accuracy of frequency response is higher the frequency ratio response is in good agreement with that in the experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the u r is calculated by the change of u in the jauvtis s experimental model jauvtis and williamson 2004 kang s numerical model kang et al 2019 and the numerical model in this paper two different ranges of reynolds number were provided in kang s model including 5 8 103 re 4 08 104 and 1 305 103 re 9 18 104 the amplitude ratio response is in good agreement with that in kang studies kang et al 2019 therefore the numerical scheme in this paper is acceptable 4 results and discussion 4 1 cylinder response the cross flow amplitude responses and the vortex shedding frequency responses of the cylinders with the bionic surfaces of five different height ratios k s d are shown in fig 8 when the vortex shedding frequency f s approaches the natural frequency f n of the structure the lock in of viv response occurs jauvtis and williamson 2004 the vortex shedding frequency f s of viv response is obtained by fast fourier transform fft of the lift force for a large mass ratio structure m o 100 in air the lock in occurs when f s f n 1 0 and the range of the lock in region is very small feng 1968 however the range of lock in region for a low mass ratio structure m o 10 is lager in water khalak and williamson 1999 compared with that in air the natural frequency of the structure is the frequency in still water the flow around the structure is changed when the structure vibrates and the additional mass also has a greater impact on a low mass ratio structure in water jauvtis and williamson 2004 therefore the lock in still occurs when f s f n is far from 1 and this phenomenon is more clearly observed in water when the mass ratio is smaller wang et al 2019 c the viv response region is usually divided into three branches khalak and williamson 1999 including a lock in region the upper branch and two other regions the initial branch and the lower branch in order to show the lock in region more clearly the lock in region is divided into two in fig 7 the viv response region is divided into four regions as shown in table 3 in region i the frequency ratios of the different cylinders show a rapid upward trend and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 the amplitude ratios also show a rapid upward trend and the maximum amplitude ratios are about 0 6 the amplitude ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 is more than that of t1 when 3 0 u r 4 5 in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are close to 1 0 and then more than 1 0 however the frequency ratio of t5 is more than 1 0 at u r 4 5 the frequency ratio of t4 is more than 1 0 at u r 5 0 the frequency ratio of t3 is more than 1 0 at u r 6 0 and the frequency ratio of t1 and t2 is more than 1 0 at u r 7 0 the lock in phenomenon gradually occurs in advanced as the height ratio of the bionic surface increases the amplitude ratios show a rapid upward trend for t1 t2 and t3 the amplitude ratio of t1 reaches the maximum value of 1 5 at u r 7 0 the amplitude ratio of t2 reaches the maximum value of 1 3 at u r 6 5 and the amplitude ratio of t3 reaches the maximum value of 0 9 at u r 5 5 for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are less than 8 0 and the amplitude ratio changes gently the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio decreases from 1 5 t1 to 0 75 t5 which reduces by about 50 in region iii the frequency ratios of the different cylinders are more than 1 0 and near a more stable value therefore they are in a stable lock in region for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are similar to that in region ii and they do not increase and remains stability however the amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 reduce first and then remains stability the stable amplitude ratio of t1 is about 1 0 and the stable amplitude ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are about 0 8 in region iv the amplitude ratios begin to decrease rapidly however the amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 begin to decrease at u r 11 0 the amplitude ratio of t4 begins to decrease at u r 10 0 and the amplitude ratio of t5 begins to decrease at u r 9 0 at the same time the jump of frequency ratios for t4 and t5 occurs when u r 10 11 obviously the range of the lock in region is smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 as reduced velocity u r increases the cross flow amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 0 figs 8 11 show the time histories of viv responses and four typical reduced velocities u r 3 0 6 0 9 0 and 13 0 are selected based on the viv response region fig 8 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i in region i the amplitude ratios and frequency ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are similar the maximum cross flow amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are about 0 15 the maximum cross flow amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 10 the frequency ratios of t2 and t3 are less than that of t1 and the frequency ratios of t4 and t5 are more than that of t1 fig 9 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 and t2 are near 1 0 but they are less than 1 0 however the frequency ratios of t3 t4 and t5 are more than 1 0 the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks the maximum amplitude ratio of t1 are about 1 2 the maximum amplitude ratio of t2 is about 1 1 and the maximum amplitude ratios of t3 t4 and t5 are about 0 75 fig 10 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 9 0 re 3 6 104 in region iii in region iii the frequency ratio of t1 is more than 1 0 and the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks the frequency ratios of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are also more than 1 0 and the frequency spectrum of lift coefficient has three peaks the appearance of multi peaks is related to the bionic surface which may change the flow around the cylinder the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio of t1 is about 1 0 and they are about 0 75 for t2 t3 t4 and t5 fig 11 shows the time histories of viv responses when u r 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv in region iv the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are far away from 1 0 the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient has two peaks for t1 and t2 however the frequency spectrum of amplitude ratio is lower than that of the lift coefficient for t3 and the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient is about twice that of the amplitude ratio the main peak values of frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient and the amplitude ratio coincide again for t4 and t5 but the main peak values of frequency spectrum of t4 and t5 are more than that of t1 viv responses of t4 and t5 are characterized by the high frequency ratio and the low amplitude ratio in region iv 4 2 vortex force and vortex pattern in order to better analyze the frequency spectrum of the lift coefficient in section 4 1 the lift force coefficient is further analyzed and vortex pattern is analyzed the total lift force consists of the vortex force f vortex and the potential force f potential the vortex force is caused by the vortex shedding and the potential force is caused by the potential added mass force govardhan and williamson 2000 obviously the vortex force is related to the vortex pattern the total lift force can be expressed as 15 f y t f v o r t e x t f p o t e n t i a l t normalizing all the forces by ρu2dl 2 eq 15 can be expressed as 16 c y t c v o r t e x t c p o t e n t i a l t where c potential t can be expressed as 17 c p o t e n t i a l t 2 π 3 a y t d u f s d 2 in which a y t is the vibrate amplitude in cross flow direction f s is the vortex shedding frequency c potential t is always in phase with a y t the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders are shown in figs 12 15 the vorticity is defined as ω u y v x fig 12 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i in region i the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are in phase the relationship between the total lift force coefficient c l t and the vortex force coefficient c vortex t is c l t c vortex t so the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 2s modes and 2s mode means that two vortices shed in each cycle 2s mode is similar to carmen vortex and this phenomenon also appeared in the experiments of khalak and williamson 1999 the potential force coefficient is very small so the cross flow vibrate amplitude is very small the maximum potential force coefficients of t4 and t5 are slightly smaller than that of t1 t2 and t3 fig 13 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii in region ii the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase at the same time the vortex force coefficients of t1 and t2 have two peaks which is why the two peaks appears in fig 9 the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t3 t4 and t5 are close to π therefore the total lift force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 decrease obviously and the bionic surface improves the flow characteristics around the cylinder the vortex patterns of t1 and t2 are still 2s modes but the vortex patterns of t3 t4 and t5 are 2p modes 2p mode means that two vortices shed from each side of the cylinder in each half cycle fig 14 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 10 0 re 4 0 104 in region iii in region iii the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all about π with the increase of the height ratio of the bionic surface the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients decrease gradually the vortex pattern of t1 is 2p mode but the vortex patterns of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are p s modes p s mode means that three vortices shed in each cycle and two vortices shed from one side of the cylinder and only one vortex shed from other side of the cylinder in the lock in region the strength of vortices increases and the effect on the cylinder also increases the vortex mode is more complex in the lock in region fig 15 shows the time histories of the total lift force coefficients the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients and the vortex patterns of five different cylinders when u r 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv in region iv the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase however the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are in phase the relationship between the total lift force coefficient c l t and the vortex force coefficient c vortex t is c l t c vortex t so the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force for t3 t4 and t5 the potential force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are very small so the cross flow vibrate amplitudes are very small the vortex force coefficients of t3 t4 and t5 are smaller than that of t1 and t2 therefore the bionic surface can well suppress the viv response the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all 2s modes in this region 4 3 frequency ratio and vortex phase in order to understand the transition of vortex pattern the vortex phase between the vortex force and the cross flow amplitude ratio based on the vortex shedding frequency ratio f s f n the vortex phase can be expressed as govardhan and williamson 2000 18 t a n φ v o r t e x 2 ξ f s f n 1 f s f n 2 where φ vortex is the vortex phase the vortex phases of five different cylinders are shown in fig 16 for a smooth cylinder t1 k s d 0 0 the vortex pattern is 2s mode in region i region ii and region iv the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is 2p mode in region iii in region i and region ii the frequency ratio is near 1 0 but it is not more than 1 0 when the frequency ratio is more than 1 0 the jump of frequency ratio occurs and the vortex phase jump from about 0 to about 180 in this process the phase difference between the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients jumps from 0 to π for t2 k s d 0 025 the vortex pattern is 2s mode in region i region ii and region iv the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is p s mode in region iii the vortex force coefficient of t2 is smaller than that of t1 and the vortex pattern is changed because of the bionic surface for t3 k s d 0 050 t4 k s d 0 075 and t5 k s d 0 100 the vortex patterns are 2s modes in region i and region iv however the vortex patterns are 2p modes in region ii and they are p s modes in region iii the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region i and region ii for t3 t4 and t5 therefore the jump of frequency ratio occurs earlier for t3 t4 and t5 compared with that for t1 and t2 it can be seen from fig 16 that the jump of the frequency ratio gradually occurs earlier as the height ratio increases 4 4 general discussion the in line amplitude responses of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 17 the in line amplitude response of a smooth cylinder was studied in the jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 which is referenced in fig 17 t1 is also a smooth cylinder and the in line amplitude ratio of t1 are good agree with that of jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 in region i the in line amplitude ratios of t1 and t2 have similar trends increasing first and then decreasing the change trends of t4 and t5 are opposite to that of t1 and t2 and the possible causes are that the bionic surfaces change the flow around the structure the in line amplitude ratios are less than 0 2 in region ii the fluctuation trends of t1 t2 and t3 are similar which show an upward trend the maximum in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 are approximately 0 35 at u r 7 0 0 22 at u r 6 8 and 0 20 at u r 5 5 however the maximum in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are about 0 16 at u r 4 0 and 0 12 at u r 4 0 the in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 decrease rapidly in region ii and then keep at a stable value which is about 0 025 in region iii the in line amplitude ratios of t4 and t5 are reduced to about 0 0 the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 decrease rapidly and the maximum in line amplitude ratios are less than 0 1 in region iv because viv response is far away the lock in region the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are very small the following conclusions can be drawn based on the above analysis 1 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum in line amplitude ratios gradually decrease 2 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the range of the large amplitude motion region gradually decreases 3 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum in line amplitude ratio occurs earlier 4 the maximum in line amplitude ratio decreases from 0 35 t1 to 0 12 t5 which reduces by about 65 7 the mean drag coefficients of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 18 in region i the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 and t3 have similar trends increasing first and then decreasing the change trends of t4 and t5 are opposite to that of t1 t2 and t3 this phenomenon results the same fluctuation trends of the in line amplitude ratios when u r 3 0 the mean drag coefficients and the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 and t3 show an upward trend which was observed in jauvtis and williamson s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 in region ii the fluctuation trends of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are similar showing an upward trend the maximum mean drag coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 3 0 at u r 7 0 3 0 at u r 6 8 2 5 at u r 5 5 2 3 at u r 5 0 and 2 25 at u r 4 5 as the height ratios of the bionic surface increase the maximum mean drag coefficient occurs gradually earlier the mean drag coefficients of a stationary cylinder is about 1 0 in this reynolds number range jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu et al 2017 and the maximum mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder is about 3 0 which has a threefold increase over that of the stationary cylinder the similar phenomenon has been also observed in previous studies jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu et al 2017 due to the vortex induced vibration response of the bare cylinder the peak mean drag coefficient of the structure is quite large when the vibration amplitude is very large in the lock in region however the mean drag coefficient of the bare cylinder in viv response region is close to the that of the stationary cylinder when the vibration amplitude is very low in region iii the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 show a downward trend in region iv the mean drags coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 keep at a low value in particular the mean drag coefficient of t5 is reduced to about 0 8 at u r 10 0 the maximum drag coefficient decreases from 3 0 t1 to 2 25 t5 which reduce by about 25 the motion trajectories of the cylinders with different bionic surfaces are shown in fig 19 the typical motion trajectory of eight shaped is observed for t1 however as ur increases the size of eight shaped increases first and then decreases the range of eight shaped figure for t1 is 0 01m a x 0 01m 0 002m a y 0 002m at u r 2 0 the range of eight shaped figure is 0 02m a x 0 06m 0 12m a y 0 12m at u r 6 0 and the range of eight shaped figure is 0 063m a x 0 075m 0 09m a y 0 09m at u r 12 0 as ur increases the in line vibration displacement increases and the central location of the in line vibration is about 0 005m for t1 at u r 2 0 0 030 m at u r 6 0 0 066 m at u r 12 0 for t2 the motion trajectories are ellipse shaped at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and raindrop shaped at u r 12 0 for t3 the motion trajectories are disordered at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and eight shaped at u r 12 0 for t4 and t5 the motion trajectories are eight shaped at u r 2 0 eight shaped at u r 6 0 and line shaped at u r 12 0 when u r 6 0 lock in region the motion trajectories of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all the eight shaped but the ranges of motion trajectories are smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 in particular the in line amplitude of t4 and t5 is close to 0 at u r 12 0 4 5 discussion on control mechanism of the bionic surface in sections 4 1 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 the effect of the bionic surface on the vortex induced vibration responses are discussed in detailed however the control mechanism of the bionic structure needs to be further understood so the flow characteristics around the bionic surface are analyzed fig 20 shows the vorticity contours and pressure contours around the bionic surface because the boundary layer separation occurs on the cylinder surface there will be vortex shedding behind the cylinder generally there is a vortex shedding on the upper surface r1 and a vortex shedding on the lower surface respectively r2 as shown in fig 21 and the direction of the vortex is opposite the distance between the two vortices is l obviously the interaction between the two vortices is very strong when l is very small both vortices r1 and r2 are low pressure vortices as shown fig 20 b and the strength of the low pressure vortex is v the comparison of distances between the two vortices of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 is l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 the bionic structure destroys the wake behind the cylinder because the coupling strength of two vortices is reduced the comparison of coupling strength of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 is v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 when v decreases the viv response is suppressed according to the previous research law and jaiman 2017 the splitter plate can prevent the interaction of r1 and r2 which is helpful for suppressing viv responses as show in fig 21 b because l 5 is bigger than l 1 as shown in fig 21 a and c the interaction of r1 and r2 is suppressed according to the above analysis the viv responses can be suppressed by the bionic structure the streamlines around the bionic structure are shown in fig 22 based on fig 22 a the formation area of the boundary layer separation is between p1 and p2 the bionic structure destroys the boundary layer separation between p1 and p2 as shown in fig 22 b and c when the height of bionic structure is more than a certain value the boundary layer separation occurs at the sharp point of the ribs the formation of the smaller vortices is observed between the two sharp points as shown in fig 22 d and e fig 22 f is the schematic diagram of streamline of t5 as shown in fig 22 f a small vortex is generated between the two sharp points and the flow will move away from the wall surface after passing the sharp point because the smaller vortices can improve the flow characteristics around the cylinder the area of the low pressure on the cylinder wall is smaller as shown fig 20 b 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration viv of the cylinders with bionic surfaces inspired by giant cactus are numerically studied and the range of reynolds number is 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is adopted for numerical calculation and the dynamic response of the structure adopts newmark beta method the effects of different height ratios of the bionic surfaces on viv suppression are discussed in detail the following conclusions are justified 1 based on the viv responses the viv response region is divided into four regions in region i the frequency ratios of the different cylinders show a rapid upward trend and the amplitude ratios also show a rapid upward trend in region ii the frequency ratios of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon gradually occurs in advanced as the height ratio of the bionic surface increases the amplitude ratios show a rapid upward trend for t1 t2 and t3 the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio decreases from 1 5 t1 to 0 75 t5 which reduces by about 50 in region iii the frequency ratios of the cylinders are more than 1 0 and they are in a stable lock in region for t4 and t5 the amplitude ratios are similar to that in region ii and they do not increase and remains stability in region iv the amplitude ratios begin to decrease rapidly the range of the lock in region is smaller for t4 and t5 compared with that of t1 2 in region i the vortex force coefficients the potential force coefficients of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are in phase and the total lift force mainly comes from the vortex force the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are 2s modes in region ii the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t3 t4 and t5 are close to π the vortex patterns of t1 and t2 are still 2s modes but the vortex patterns of t3 t4 and t5 are 2p modes in region iii the phase differences between the potential force coefficients and the vortex force coefficients for t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 are all about π with the increase of the height ratio of the bionic surface the vortex force coefficients and the potential force coefficients decrease gradually the vortex pattern of t1 is 2p mode but the vortex patterns of t2 t3 t4 and t5 are p s modes the vortex mode is more complex in the lock in region in region iv the total lift force coefficients and the potential force coefficients of t1 and t2 are out of phase 3 for a smooth cylinder t1 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii when the frequency ratio is more than 1 0 the jump of frequency ratio occurs and the vortex phase jump from about 0 to about 180 for t2 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region ii and region iii and the vortex pattern is p s mode in region iii for t3 t4 and t5 the jump of frequency ratio occurs between region i and region ii the jump of frequency ratio occurs earlier for t3 t4 and t5 compared with that for t1 and t2 the author provides a method that may be used in engineering practice and provides some rules that can be used in engineering practice there are many parameters of the bionic structure that may affect the viv responses including the number of ribs n the height ratio k s d and the shapes of the ribs in this paper the parameters of the bionic structure studied are n 16 and 0 k s d 0 1 according to the results of this paper the parameters of the bionic structure can be optimized which is helpful to reduce the maximum cross flow amplitude ratio this is a very hard work and it is being researched by

21582,the energy double system eds is a two degree of freedom 2dof nearshore point absorber wave energy converter wec it is composed of a heaving float and a surging paddle which are interconnected and each one has its own power take off pto in this work a numerical model of the eds was developed on the basis of the existent laboratory model which had already been the object of several studies at the politecnico di milano firstly a general mechanical scheme of the eds was developed which is simplified with respect to the laboratory model this is a mass spring damper 2dof system described by a couple of equations linearized around the equilibrium position once that the mechanical equivalence with the laboratory model was established the simplified eds geometry was set in a computational fluid dynamics cfd model together with the experimental boundary conditions the eds is placed in shallow water depth along a sloping beach undergoing regular waves numerical results fairly agree with the experimental ones although slightly overestimate the energy absorption of the float 20 and the paddle 10 finally new cases were simulated different values of pto damping and random waves were tested keywords wave energy wec eds numerical model cfd shallow water 1 introduction wave energy is a promising renewable resource although today the technology to exploit it is still developing through research and prototyping and have not reach the commercial scale deployment yet ahamed et al 2020 this is probably due to the important issues connected with the harnessing of this type of energy such as the high temporal variability of the source the survivability in extreme events the availability of grid connection aderinto and li 2018 according to the type and location of the wave energy converter wec some of these issues can be relatively be more or less important for example wecs designed for shallow water depths are less exposed to storms and can deal with waves more directionally concentrated folley and whittaker 2009 on the other hand modelling a wec in the offshore zone at least in the early stage can be simpler because linear wave theory can be assumed dean and darlymple 1991 as well as for their location offshore nearshore shoreline wecs are usually classified according to their working principle oscillating body oscillating water column owc overtopping and to their orientation with respect to the oncoming wave point absorber attenuator terminator falcao 2010 lópez et al 2013 a review of the performances of the different wave energy converters can be found in aderinto and li 2019 as in other problems concerning fluid mechanics the analytical experimental and numerical approaches are usually used to model and study wecs the analytical approach is based on potential flow model where the flow is incompressible and irrotational with the adoption of the mass conservation principle the governing equation of the wave field is the laplace s equation for the velocity potential φ linear wave theory represents the simplest solution of the laplace equation and it is the most used approach in the analytical wec modelling the common approach is to hypothesize that the fluid structure interaction can be described through the linear superimposition of a wave radiation potential oscillating body in still liquid and a wave diffraction potential fixed body in a wave field analytical solutions are possible only for simple geometries of the domain and of the floating bodies several analytical studies exist in the literature among all hulme 1982 calculated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a floating hemisphere the experimental approach is based on the application of the buckingham π theorem by using froude similarity as the reynolds number is almost always very high it is possible to model and study the wec at a laboratory scale unlike the analytical approach the experimental approach allows to deal with complex geometries and nonlinear fluid structure interaction many experimental studies can be found in the literature sheng et al 2014 summarize the characteristics of wec physical modelling the numerical approach is based on the computational resolution of a variable number of discretized equations that rule the problem reviews of the numerical methods for wecs can be found in li and yu 2012 and folley et al 2012 two main types of numerical methods are used in wec modelling those based on boundary element method bem and the cfd bem is based on the potential flow theory the laplace equation is written in the integral form by the usage of green s theorem and after the setting of the boundary condition the velocity field can be numerically computed in a fixed number of points placed on the submerged body surface the methods that rely on bem have been the most used in wec numerical simulations they can mainly be subdivided in frequency and time domain models frequency domain models are totally linear while time domain models can deal with nonlinear external forces the main bem advantages are the low computational effort if compared to cfd and the possibility to treat complex geometries that the analytical method cannot handle on the other hand the application field of this method is limited to inviscid flow therefore it cannot catch viscous drag slamming effects and wave breaking in order to make bem models capable of treating viscous drag some authors corrected the mathematical model with a nonlinear contribute calculated in agreement with the morison equation zurkinden et al 2014 used bem simulations to reproduce the behaviour of the wavestar www wavestarenergy com firstly with a linear model and then with a nonlinear one which included the drag term in the conclusions it was stated that the second model could forecast the maximum solicitations and displacements with higher accuracy the other main numerical approach is the computational fluid dynamics cfd which basis on the a resolution of the navier stokes equations cfd is employed in situations where nonlinearities cannot be neglected for instance yu and li 2013 used this model to investigate the effects of the viscous drag and the overtopping phenomena on the performance of a two body floating point absorber wec demonstrating their significant influence on the power output babajani et al 2016 used cfd to investigate the influence of the distance between two point absorber wecs searasers on their heaving performances when a wave propagates in their arrangement line eskilsson et al 2014 used cfd to study the wavedragon a terminator wec that involves complex phenomena such as overtopping wave slamming and turbulence that other methods cannot represent similar phenomena are involved in the terminator type wecs as in the obrec studied by musa et al 2017 and the seawave slot cone generator studied by vicinanza et al 2015 and buccino et al 2016 in which the cfd simulations give similar results to those experimentally obtained nonlinearities are also heavily involved in extreme conditions palm et al 2013 used cfd to simulate the coupled motion of a floating wec and its mooring cables in violent sea condition in order to verify the cables design through the quantification of the forces acting on them cfd has also the advantage of the availability of particular post processing softwares that provide comfortable representations of different parameters in the study carried out by elhanafi et al 2017 an owc wec cfd was used to visualize and investigate the vorticity of the fluid around the entrance of the owc this analysis of the flow field could allowed a better understanding of the relationship the hydrodynamic performance of owc and some design parameters free surface air pressure and airflow rate in this work the energy double system eds a 2dof oscillating body wec for shallow waters negri and malavasi 2018 was numerically modelled cfd was employed due to the nonlinearity of the waves in shallow waters and of the interaction between the fluid and the bodies the commercial cfd code flow 3d was used eds is composed of a float and a paddle both supported by an arm pivoted above the water level to a fixed structure fig 1 the float is a pitching heaving body rotating around this fixed pivot similar to wavestar the paddle is a pitching surging body rotating around a second pivot placed on the arm the eds is designed to work in the nearshore zone where the mass transport of the waves can push a light paddle in the proximity of the free surface the simple idea behind eds is to maximize the absorbed energy using two different bodies since none of them considered separately is resonant with the waves the float harnesses the vertical component of the wave force while the paddle harnesses the horizontal one a laboratory model of eds has already been developed at the hydraulics laboratory of politecnico di milano in negri et al 2013 and negri and malavasi 2018 the model was tested in various configurations and at various locations along a sloping beach for a water depth h f d 0 6 which was the minimum depth that prevented the paddle from hitting the bottom the parameters investigated and optimized included the distance between float and paddle the immersion of the paddle and the damping applied to the float negri and malavasi 2018 showed that eds has a higher cwr than a similar wec without the paddle and this advantage increases as water depth decreases the numerical model of the eds was developed and verified on the basis of its laboratory model in this way a useful tool for making virtual experiments and further optimizing the eds has been achieved the implementation of eds in the numerical software involved some modifications with respect to the laboratory model in order to generalize and simplify the eds structure in particular by eliminating the features of the laboratory model that were only necessary to the laboratory experimentation this operation required a prior mathematical modelling of eds motion which allowed to define the rules for realizing equivalent eds models in particular the parameters affecting the eds motion were detected and set equal in the experimental and numerical models these parameters are a function of the geometry and the mass distribution in the eds the paper is organized as follows section 2 contains the just above mentioned mathematical and numerical modelling of the eds system starting from the laboratory model section 3 contains the numerical modelling of regular waves in shallow waters basing on the waves measured in laboratory the procedure for building the spectrum of shallow water random waves used in the final numerical simulations energetically equivalent to shallow water regular waves the numerical setup for the discretization of the domain section 4 contains the results of the numerical simulations firstly two experimental cases with monochromatic waves are reproduced with the numerical model then new cases are simulated varying the mechanical properties of the eds and using random waves section 5 contains the concluding remarks and possible future developments 2 modelling of the eds in this section a numerical model of eds is built on the basis of the existing physical model at the hydraulics laboratory of the politecnico di milano since some simplifications were made in the numerical eds it was necessary to establish an equivalence criterion between the experimental and numerical model this outcome was achieved by building an intermediate mathematical model of eds where its mechanical properties are expressed in the equation of motion 2 1 experimental model of the eds the laboratory model and the scheme of the eds are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the model can be divided into two subsystems the float one and the paddle one the two degrees of freedom are the rotational angle of the float beam ha around the pivot o and the rotational angle of the paddle beam mn around the pivot c the float subsystem of the laboratory model is composed of the float a hollow solid designed with a spherical cap and a cylinder the beam ha rigidly attached to the float and pivoted in o a leverage system aimed at activating the damping system beams gj and gw with hinges in b and g and the damping system itself which is a heaving disc rigidly attached to the beam gw inside a cylinder filled with oil the float diameter d is equal to 0 204 m the total height of the float is 0 137 m beams gj and its hinges allow to transform the rotation of the main beam ha into the vertical motion of the gw beam the friction between the beam and the sleeve is avoided with linear bearing the draft of the float d f at rest is equal to 0 06 m the main characteristics of the elements composing the float subsystem are presented in table 1 the paddle subsystem is composed of the paddle itself a secondary beam mn rigidly attached to the paddle and the paddle damping system the paddle has a cylindrical shape with radius 0 104 m and a chord of 0 12 m the draft of the paddle d p at rest is equal to 0 09 m the beam mn is hinged on the beam ha in the point c the paddle damper is inserted between pivots f at the ground and d on beam mn it is a heaving disc point p rigidly attached to the beam up which relatively moves in a cylinder filled with oil supported by beam dq the beams up and qd stay aligned thanks to a sleeve installed between them with respect to the eds laboratory model investigated in negri and malavasi 2018 in this work the paddle pto reacts against a fixed frame instead of reacting on the main arm the main parameters which describe this subsystem are reported in table 2 each damping system simulates a pto power take off and consist of a heaving disc moving in cylindrical container filled with oil when the disc is moving a dissipative damping force is also generated the discs do not seal the cylinders wall the motion and the force of each damper was acquired through distance sensor and load cell placed on it since such damping systems also generate inertia fluid added mass and buoyancy forces a procedure was used to extract the damping force from the total force recorded negri and malavasi 2018 the energy absorbed by the float or by the paddle between instant t 1 and t 2 was calculated as eq 1 1 e i t 1 t 2 f d i t x i t d t where i is an index 1 stands for float 2 stands for paddle f d is the damping force recorded and x is the relative velocity between the disc and the cylinder 2 2 mathematical model of the eds the laboratory model of the eds had some features that only fulfilled practical laboratory requirements in particular the damping systems and their leverages were laboratory solutions to simulate the ptos and measuring the absorbed mechanical energy and they do not resemble the prototype ptos those elements do not get in touch with the fluid and therefore they do not influence the fluid structure interaction of the eds therefore before implementing the eds in the numerical software it is reasonable to simplify its geometry considering only the components that actually get in touch with the water and the other essential parts of the system which are the connecting arms between the float the paddle and the ground although this choice requires an additional theoretical modelling of the eds in order to establish a mechanical equivalence between the laboratory eds and the numerical eds it facilitates the numerical implementation of the eds and more importantly produces a more general realistic exploitable model fig 4 shows the mechanical scheme of the simplified eds the two degrees of freedom are the angles θ 1 and θ 2 the main simplifications with respect to the laboratory model are the following the float damping system and its leverages is replaced with a torsional linear damping b 1 applied in the pivot o and a supplementary inertia applied on the float subsystem the paddle damping system is replaced with a translational linear damping b 2 applied between pivots f and d and a supplementary inertia applied to the paddle subsystem the part cn of the secondary arm is eliminated and replaced with supplementary inertia of the secondary arm in order to complete the model it is necessary to detect the mechanical parameters inertia damping stiffness parameters that characterize it and to calculate their equivalent values in the laboratory model to do this the equation of motion must be derived the two degrees of freedom are defined as follows eqs 2 and 3 2 θ 1 α 0 α 3 θ 2 β β 0 where α and β are the angles that define the position of the two subsystem as indicated in fig 4 α 0 and β 0 are the values related to the static equilibrium arrangement of the system the equations of motion according to the lagrangian mechanics are the following eq 4 4 d d t l θ 1 l θ 1 d θ 1 f 1 d d t l θ 2 l θ 2 d θ 2 f 2 where l k e p e is the lagrangian expressed as the difference between the kinematic energy and the potential energy d is the dissipative function and f the forcing of the system the scheme in fig 4 highlights the reference systems used and indicatively shows the two points g 1 and g 2 barycentres of the float and the paddle subsystems respectively the kinetic energy is expressed as follows eq 5 5 k e 1 2 i 1 θ 1 2 1 2 i 2 θ 2 2 1 2 m 2 oc 2 θ 1 2 2 θ 1 θ 2 oc ℓ 2 g where i 1 represents the moment of inertia of the float subsystem around the pivot o while m 2 and i 2 are the mass and the moment of inertia around the pivot c of the paddle subsystem respectively the supplementary inertia previously mentioned is taken into account in i 1 and i 2 the potential energy is dependent from the position of the system and can be modelled as follows eq 6 6 p e k 1 0 θ 1 k 2 0 θ 2 1 2 k 1 1 θ 1 2 k 1 2 θ 1 θ 2 1 2 k 2 2 θ 2 2 where the parameters k are the stiffness coefficients of the system k 1 1 and k 2 2 express the restoring moments generated in a hinge o for k 1 1 c for k 2 2 from an activation of the degree of freedom of the same hinge k 1 2 equal to k 2 1 express the restoring moments created in a hinge by an activation of the degree of freedom connected to the other hinge k 1 0 and k 2 0 express the moments in the two hinges in the reference configuration θ 1 θ 2 since the reference condition is the static equilibrium these two coefficients are null the restoring moments are static moments and they stem from hydrostatic buoyancy forces on immersed parts of eds and gravitational forces weight of the parts of the eds the coefficients k can be calculated from the static equilibrium of the system by expressing the static moments m o and m c around hinges o and c respectively since the static moments of the system are not linearly proportional to the rotations for example the wetted area section of the float is not constant with θ 1 the stiffness coefficients are approximated with the derivative of the static moments with respect to the rotation coordinates as follows eqs 7 8 9 and 10 7 k 1 1 d m o θ 1 θ 2 d θ 1 8 k 2 2 d m c θ 1 θ 2 d θ 2 9 k 1 2 d m o θ 1 θ 2 d θ 2 10 k 2 1 d m c θ 1 θ 2 d θ 1 the static moments are calculated as the sum of the gravitational and buoyance moments analytical expressions of the moments could be defined as function of θ 1 and θ 2 only eqs 11 and 12 11 m o α β m 1 g x g 1 α γ v 1 α x s 1 α m 2 g x c α γ v 2 α β x c α 12 m c α β m 2 g x g 2 β γ v 2 α β x s 2 α β where m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the two subsystem v 1 and v 2 the submerged volumes and s 1 and s 2 are the barycentre of the submerged volumes eqs 7 12 are not expanded due to their length the dissipative function is expressed as follows eq 13 13 d 1 2 b 1 θ 1 2 1 2 b 2 x 2 2 in which b 1 expresses with a constant value the torque damping of the float subsystem around the o pivot obtained from an energetically equivalence with experimental damping of the float not constant during a cycle of oscillation in a similar way b 2 represents the damping of the paddle damper and it is a constant value energetically equivalent to the paddle damper it is important to underline that for each of the two tested wave conditions these parameters assume different values after all the calculations the motion equation has the following shape eqs 14 15 16 17 18 and 19 14 m y b y k y f 15 y θ 1 θ 2 16 m i 1 m 2 oc 2 m 2 oc ℓ 2 g m 2 oc ℓ 2 g i 2 17 b b 1 b 2 oc 2 sin 2 α ψ b 2 oc cd sin α ψ cos β ψ b 2 oc cd sin α ψ cos β ψ b 2 oc 2 cos 2 β ψ 18 k k 1 1 k 1 2 k 2 1 k 2 2 19 f f 1 f 2 where the quantity ℓ 2g is equal to eq 20 20 ℓ 2 g y 2 g cos β x 2 g sin β sin α x 2 g cos β y 2 g sin β cos α and ψ is the inclination of the paddle damper it was assumed that the simplified model and the laboratory model of eds behave the same if the following conditions are verified the equilibrium condition at rest is the same same angles α 0 β 0 the matrices m b k are the same the shape of the immersed parts is the same the boundary conditions are the same oncoming waves and bottom configuration to calculate the equivalent values of m b and k of the laboratory model some simplifications were necessary for what regards the matrix m the inertia given by the float experimental damping system was included in the i 1 inertia moment and is obtained by linearizing according to θ 1 the kinematic of the damping system and its leverage the inertia given by the paddle experimental damping system was included in the other three terms of the matrix and calculated with linearization as well for what regards the matrix b equivalent linear damping was a posteriori calculated from the experimental tests as follows eqs 21 and 22 21 b 1 e 1 ω π θ 1 2 22 b 2 e 2 ω π a x 2 2 in which e 1 and e 2 are the absorbed energies during a cycle of oscillation by the float and the paddle damping systems respectively ω is the pulsation θ 1 is the first harmonic amplitude of the float rotation angle and a x 2 is the first harmonic amplitude of the paddle damping system elongation the matrixes related to the experimental model have the values reported in table 3 2 3 numerical model of the eds the implementation of a solid object in the cfd software requires the specification of the mass distribution of that object in order to insert the simplified geometry of the eds into the cfd software it was therefore necessary to calculate a mass distribution consistent with the geometry of the simplified model and that produces the same values of the three matrices m b k before that it is necessary to briefly explain how the cfd software allows the setting of solid moving objects the gmo general moving object model activated in flow 3d provides the creation of the so called component a unique rigid body as a sum of subcomponents that is to say objects with elementary shapes components can therefore be created as a sum and difference of subcomponents but a component with a complex shape might also be implemented importing a geometry file stl two components are created the float component and the paddle one the software requires the assignment of a numerical value to the following parameters for the float component mass position of the barycentre and moment of inertia these parameters must be chosen so that each value of matrices m b k is the same than that of table 3 and eds configuration at static equilibrium is the same same angles α 0 and β 0 for each of the two waves it was necessary to assign a value to the following 10 parameters of the numerical model of the eds m 1 mass of the float component x g 1 x coordinate of the float component barycentre y g 1 y coordinate of the float component barycentre i 1 moment of inertia of the float component with respect to its fixed axis of rotation pivot o b 1 linear torque damping of the damper of the float m 2 mass of the paddle component x g 2 x coordinate of the paddle component barycentre y g 2 y coordinate of the paddle component barycentre i 2 g barycentric moment of inertia of the paddle component b 2 linear translational damping of the paddle component damper the imposition of equality of the three matrixes m b k leads to 7 equations 3 equations for m matrix extra diagonal terms are equal 2 equations for k matrix extra diagonal terms are purely determined from the geometries of the two subsystems as none of the 10 parameters reported previously appear in their definition 2 equations for b matrix simply equating the damping values it is here anticipated a problem related to the numerical discretization of the domain that is in part mitigated through this equivalence procedure the paddle of the lab model is very thin 2 mm if compared to the length of the channel 14 m in the numerical domain extremely small cells dimension of 1 5 mm at least would be necessary to fully capture the geometry of the paddle and allow a proper solution of the rans equations and the distribution of the pressure around the body even with a proper connection with bigger cell sizes the simulation would take unsustainably long computational times it was therefore decided to thicken the paddle from the rear side in order to keep the same surface for the incoming wave in order to allow bigger cells and easier computations the new thickness of the paddle was 6 mm the imposition of the same static equilibrium condition adds 2 more equations becoming the total number of equations equal to 9 the input parameters of the numerical model are 10 the system is therefore undetermined so there is some freedom in setting the input parameters however two constraints encounter a conflict the equality of the extra diagonal terms of the inertia matrix m and the equality of the second diagonal term of the stiffness matrix k this happens since the geometry of the numerical paddle subsystem is slightly different from the experimental one as explained previously this is also the cause of the difference between the extra diagonal terms of the stiffness matrix k one of the constraints must be sacrificed the decision is to neglect the equality between the extra diagonal terms of the inertia matrix because they influence the motion in a much less effective way rather than the diagonal terms two more constraints are needed to determine the set of parameters of the numerical model it is then decided to arbitrarily assign two values the mass of the float subsystem and the mass of the paddle subsystem in a way that barycentres are in reasonable positions in table 4 and table 5 the mechanical parameters of the numerical eds are reported the experimental and numerical matrices of motion are reported in table 6 the procedure shown up to here fulfil to the general problem of building a mechanical system equivalent to the laboratory model also regardless of the numerical modelling from here on the issues of the numerical modelling specific to the cfd software are discussed the scheme of the numerical model is reported in fig 5 in setting the numerical options the user can decide to assign whether a coupled motion with the fluid enabling the desired degrees of freedom or an imposed law of motion furthermore it is possible to enable a model which simulates collisions between different components two components were created the float component and the paddle one the float component reproduces faithfully the shapes and the dimension of the float and the arm connecting the float to the pivot o while everything present behind the pivot o is not intentionally reproduced for the reasons explained previously a coupled motion with the fluid is assigned to this component and the only one degree of freedom activated is the rotational angle around the pivot o the rotational damping system in pivot o is simulated with a torsion spring name of the tool in the software around it and it connects the movable float component and the fixed geometry of the domain with a null elastic coefficient and a specific constant linear damping the paddle component reproduces the paddle and the beam cm which connects it to the arm of the float the cn piece of beam and the damping system from u to d are not implemented in the geometry following the same criteria reported previously a coupled motion with the fluid and the three degrees of freedom of the xy plain are assigned to the component the translational damping system is realized with a linear spring which links the fixed point f with the movable point d of the paddle component in a similar way as the damper of the float component the creation of the moving hinge requires a clear explanation in flow 3d there is not a specific tool able to represent a moving hinge between separate components therefore as suggested from flow 3d user s site 2017 a spring is employed to simulate the moving hinge the ends of this theoretical spring are given the same coordinates but one is attached to the float component beam oa and the other one to the paddle component beam ce the stiffness assigned has to be calibrated in order to avoid large elongations caused by excessively low values and instabilities during the computations caused by excessively high values after few trials it was discovered that a value equal to 40 000 kg s2 avoided instabilities and led to displacements smaller than half a millimetre 3 numerical setup in this section the numerical settings for the simulation of the waves and for the discretization of the domain are presented in particular the behaviour of two regular waves along a sloping beach previously measured in the laboratory is numerically reproduced along a sloping beach then a method is presented for creating an energetically equivalent shallow water random wave which will be used in section 4 3 for investigating the behaviour of the eds in a real sea state finally the mesh of the numerical domain and the applied boundary conditions are presented 3 1 wave modelling the equivalence between the experimental and the numerical models of eds was established by considering the inertia solid spring gravitational hydrostatic damping external matrices of the lagrangian equations of motion see previous chapter it should be noted that the added mass and the hydrodynamic damping were not included in that matrices the aim of that procedure was to give to the numerical eds model the same mechanical properties of the experimental eds model the forcing of the eds is produced by the fluid structure interaction between waves and eds itself since that also the geometry of the immersed parts of eds float and paddle are the same in the experimental and numerical models of eds it is expected that the behaviour of eds and the wave field generated by the fluid structure interaction are the same if the undisturbed wave field is the same in the experiments and in the numerical simulations fig 6 shows the laboratory wave flume it is equipped with a vertical piston wavemaker and a beach with a slope of 6 8 its width is 1 m and the distance between the toe of the beach and the wavemaker is about 20 m as sketched in fig 6 the position of the eds is also indicated it must be remarked that both experimental and numerical waves were measured without the eds in the wave flume two regular waves were considered for this study their properties are reported in table 7 considering the scale factor 1 25 of the laboratory model float diameter of about 5 m at real scale the laboratory waves represent real scale waves with power for unit width of 34 and 59 kw m respectively for wave 1 and wave 2 which are values compatible with energetically significant sea sites the numerical domain was created in order to geometrically reproduce the experimental wave flume except for the length of the wave flume before the sloping beach which was reduced in order to decrease the computational effort of the simulation the length of the part of the channel before the beach was shortened to 10 m total length of the numerical channel was 14 m boundary conditions of symmetry were assigned to the lateral sides of the channel and a wave boundary condition was set for the side opposite to the beach fig 7 this condition required the definition of the type of wave linear stokes and cnoidal fourier series method stokes fenton s fifth oder theory solitary wave or random wave and the parameters characterising the wave given the non linearity of the experimental waves as shown in fig 8 it was decided to employ two types stokes and cnoidal fourier series method and stokes fenton s fifth order theory the parameters assigned are the ones obtained from the experimental data table 7 as initial condition the water level position and the hydrostatic pressure distribution were imposed different combinations of meshes and numerical settings were adopted in order to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the model and to detect the most reliable and sustainable model which can give results close to the experimental ones without unnecessarily long computational periods of time all the studied combinations of the wave 1 are reported in table 8 and those of wave 2 are reported in table 9 in the name of the simulation cases wb1 or wb2 stands for wave boundary 1 or 2 the subsequent small letter indicates the method which was utilized the subsequent number indicates the size of the numerical mesh 1 4 coarser finer apart from the cell size and the wave model fourier or fenton it was decided to investigate the influence of other models in order to have a wider sensitivity analysis turbulence model vof advection model and momentum advection approximation for what concerns the turbulence model two of the most widely used methods were tested the rng κ ε and the κ ω turbulence models regarding the fluid interface vof advection approximations two models were taken into account automatic that chooses the best fit option depending on the number of fluids and the presence of a sharp interface and split lagrangian a more recent method that in flow 3 d user manual 2016 is considered to produce lower cumulative volume error than the other vof advection approximations but it may generate a bigger volume error when the general moving objects model is activated for what regards the momentum advection approximation both first order and second order methods were tested more details about all the mentioned models can be found in flow 3 d user manual 2016 the reliability of the numerical model was evaluated by analysing the local wave height in several probes displaced along the beach one every 10 cm in particular in the zone where eds is placed x 2 15 2 33 that are the positions of the paddle and the float local wave height is calculated as the mean difference between crests and troughs the last two columns of tables 8 and 9 report the index ε eq 23 which expresses the rms of the difference between the numerical and experimental local wave heights along a portion of the domain with respect to the incident wave height ε was evaluated near the eds x 2 1 2 4 m and on a larger stretch of channel 0 5 5 8 m 23 ε x x 1 x 2 h l o c n u m x h l o c e x p x 2 x h where x 1 and x 2 are the extremities of the stretch of the domain considered and x is the number of points included between x 1 and x 2 h l o c n u m x and h l o c e x p x are the numerical and experimental local wave heights at location x h is the incident wave height reported in table 7 which was measured in the laboratory tests and set as input in the numerical simulations wave data was analysed through a self referenced phase average similarly to the method reported in negri et al 2011 the phase average is performed by averaging stationary oscillations therefore it is necessary to neglect the data close to the initial boundary condition for both waves the first 100 s were left out the results of the cfd computation and the subsequent post process are graphically reported in fig 9 fig 10 wave 1 and fig 11 fig 12 wave 2 numerical simulations generally reproduce quite well the experimental oscillation of the local wave height due to wave reflection both as regards the amplitude and the spatial frequency of the oscillation the results are better for wave 1 and generally for finer mesh the position of the wave breaking point identified as the wave height maximum closest to the shore is well reproduced except for some cases with coarse mesh wb1 f1 wb2 a1 almost all the results with waves 1 and 2 display maximum local discrepancies generally smaller than 10 with respect to the experimental results average differences ε are smaller than 10 except for the case wb2 a1 it is noted that the two wave types stokes and cnoidal fourier series method and stokes fenton s fifth order theory used in the definition of the wave boundary condition almost lead to the same results other parameters being equal among the simulation with wave 1 case wb1 a4 shows the smallest values of the difference ε between the numerical and experimental wave heights both near the eds system x 2 1 2 4 m and along a longer section of the channel x 0 5 5 8 m the better performance of this model might be due to the adoption of a finer mesh and of models that are generally considered to work well in most cases such as the rng κ ε turbulence model or the first order momentum advection as also reported in the flow 3d user manual 2016 for wave 2 the results are not univocal the minimum values of ε near the eds system and considering a longer section of the channel do not belong to the same case case wb2 a4 same settings of wb1 a4 except the wave characteristics gives the minimum value of ε near the eds x 2 15 2 33 on a larger domain x 0 5 5 8 case wb2 g3 gives the minimum value of ε in order to keep the same setting for the two waves wb2 a4 was chosen to simulate wave 2 at the end of this analysis the chosen method was finest mesh rng κ ω turbulence model automatic vof advection model fourier series method for wave modelling stokes and cnoidal wave first order approximation for momentum advection which corresponds to the cases wb1 a4 for wave 1 and wb2 a4 for wave 2 in tables 8 and 9 the line corresponding to the chosen setting are highlighted in figs 9 12 the series corresponding to the chosen setting is a black solid line with circles fig 13 shows the phase averaged wave profiles at the float position non dimensionalized according to the respective incident wave height and period the numerical simulation fairly agrees with the experimental measurement 3 2 random sea state modelling in shallow waters the numerical model here developed was verified on experiments performed with regular waves see section 4 1 after that the numerical model was used for studying the behaviour of eds with random waves two random sea states energetically equivalent to the two regular waves 1 and 2 were numerically modelled the spectra of the two sea states were obtained and later imposed as random wave boundary condition in the numerical domain the wave spectrum represents the relationship between the wave spectral density s m2s and the wave angular frequency ω rad s some of the most important parameters characterising the spectrum are the significant wave height h s and the energy period t e which have the following definitions eqs 24 and 25 respectively 24 h s 4 m 0 25 t e 2 π m 1 m 0 where the quantity m n is equal to eq 26 26 m n 0 s ω ω n d ω in general the power associated to a wave is defined as the product of the wave energy and the group celerity for a wave spectrum the power is defined by eq 27 27 p t o t ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω in the case of shallow waters as the one of the present study sheng and li 2017 propose to adopt a single modification coefficient c h depending only on the energy period t e to take into account the shoaling phenomenon that the random waves face eq 28 28 c h ω 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h k 0 k where k is the wave number equal to 2 π l where l is the wavelength which itself depends on ω k 0 is the deep water wave number and h is the static water depth the wave power in shallow waters is calculated as eq 29 29 p t o t s h a l l o w w a t e r s 1 2 ρ g 2 0 s ω ω c h ω d ω 1 64 π ρ g 2 h s 2 t e c h t

are calculated as eqs 31 and 32 respectively 31 α e ω ω p 2 2 ω p 2 σ 2 32 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p where ω p h s and γ are parameters that require an assignment h s is assumed equal to h 2 in which h stands for the wave height of the regular wave ω p the angular frequency associated to the peak period and γ the peak enhancement factor were set in order to have the wave energy period and the wave power respectively equal to wave period and the wave power of the regular waves reported previously table 7 two wave spectra were defined their parameters are reported in table 10 and their shape is reported in fig 14 3 3 numerical setup for eds in the numerical setup particular attention was given to the mesh the considerable difference between the smallest and the biggest scale of interest 6 mm of the paddle width and 14 m of the wave flume length respectively is a problem that has to be managed properly in order to avoid excessively heavy simulations firstly it is decided to cover only half of the numerical domain assuming that the fluid velocity field is symmetric with respect to the eds plain of symmetry moreover different type of meshes are employed in order to provide finer computation where needed a 3d fine mesh is used near the eds and is nested in a rougher 3d mesh which is itself linked to two 2d meshes onshore and offshore as depicted in fig 15 and fig 16 the dimensions of the cell sizes and the boundary conditions are reported in table 11 4 results in this section the numerical results are showed firstly the numerical simulations of the experimental cases are presented comparison with the experimental results are shown in order to verify the goodness of the numerical model then new configurations of the eds are numerically simulated several simulations with different values of paddle damping are performed in order to optimize that parameter moreover simulations with random sea waves are performed 4 1 validation of the experimental cases in order to verify the goodness of the numerical model a comparison with the available experimental quantities was performed the numerical results were phase averaged in a similar way to the one adopted for the wave analysis 3 1 the behaviour of the two subsystems float and paddle for wave 1 are respectively reported in fig 17 and fig 18 for each subsystem position velocity damping torque force and absorbed power during the mean oscillation cycle are shown mean and global properties of the motion of the float and paddle are reported in table 12 and table 13 similar results of the second wave setup are reported in fig 19 fig 20 table 14 and table 15 concerning the float subsystem figs 17 and 19 a qualitative agreement between the experimental and the numerical results can be observed however the slight overestimations of the numerical model related to the rotational amplitudes of about 5 10 lead to clearer discrepancies of the absorbed energy of about 20 25 as it can be seen in tables 14 and 15 both in the numerical and experimental models the upward phase is shorter and more energetic than the downward phase upward phase includes 60 of the total energy absorbed by the float the duration of the downward phase is slightly longer in the numerical model and also the ratio between the energy absorbed in the downward and upward phases is higher in the numerical model the motion of the float reflects the shape of the local wave height which is characterized by a wave crest significantly higher and narrower than the through as shown in fig 13 the mean dynamic position of the float is found below the static position angle of rotation α increases as the float goes down for wave 1 fig 17 the downward motion of the float t 0 7 1 45 s shows quite different properties in the numerical and experimental models velocity damping torque and absorbed power of the experimental model are characterized by a complex behaviour not as smooth as those in the numerical results because of this there are maximum instantaneous differences of about 0 05 rad s in the angular velocity of about 1 nm in the damping torque and of about 0 15 w in the absorbed power this is reasonably due to the fact that the numerical eds has linear external damping while the experimental eds has non linear external damping for wave 2 fig 19 the differences between the numerical and the experimental model tends to resemble the ones related to the wave 1 however the main parameters reported in table 14 show higher discrepancies rotational amplitude is overestimated by about 11 instead of the 6 of the wave 1 and cycle energy is overestimated by about 30 instead of the 22 of the wave 1 for what regards the paddle subsystem the most evident difference between the experimental and the numerical model is the mean dynamic value of the rotational angle whilst the shape of the curves are rather similar figs 18 and 20 the same holds also for the position of the damper in the numerical eds the paddle stays on average closer to the float looking at the other quantities velocity damping force absorbed power it can be noticed that as for the float the numerical results tend to be smoother than the experimental ones in particular for both waves there are maximum differences of about 0 02 m s in the elongation velocity of the damper of about 1 n in the damping force and of about 0 15 w in the absorbed power the rotational amplitude of motion of the paddle is overestimated in the numerical model for wave 1 7 and underestimated for wave 2 3 as it can be seen in tables 13 and 15 the total energy absorbed by the paddle is overestimated for wave 1 10 and similar for wave 2 the energy absorbed in the motion towards the shore is significantly higher than that in the motion towards offshore 60 70 of the total energy absorbed by the paddle is in the motion towards the shore the most energetic phase is shorter similarly to the float this is very evident for wave 2 where the motion towards offshore lasts almost double the motion towards the shore fig 20 these relationships are similar in the numerical and experimental models float and paddle are almost in phase which means that the float rises when the paddle goes towards the shore the phase lag calculated by the numerical simulations is similar to the experimental one additional numerical simulation of the eds without the paddle were performed but not here reported and the results showed that the motion amplitude and absorbed energy of the float resulted overestimated as well similarly to the case of complete eds the most probable cause of these differences between numerical and experimental results is the damping of float and paddle in fig 21 and fig 22 the experimental ratio between the torque force and the velocity angular velocity is shown for the float paddle with wave 1 it can be seen that the experimental ratio between damping force and velocity has a lot of variability with respect to the energetically equivalent linear damping this is due to the nonlinear behaviour of the experimental damping systems 4 2 optimization of the paddle damping in this section several simulations are performed with different values of the paddle damping the paddle damping had not been optimized yet in the experimental model unlike in the experimental model in the numerical model it is easy to change this parameter and thus optimize its value in particular for both the regular waves used in this work the damping is halved and doubled with respect to the previously reported values of equivalent linear damping of the paddle the results show that this parameter does not sensitively affect the behaviour of the float subsystem energy absorption undergoes variation smaller than 2 although amplitude of motion and damping force is very dependent on it the higher the damping the smaller the motion amplitude and the larger the damping force it is found that higher damping tends to anticipate the inversion points of the paddle with respect to the inversion points of the float higher damping also leads to a smaller mean dynamic angle of the paddle meaning that the paddle stays closer to the shore the main results are shown in table 16 and 17 and figs 23 26 4 3 eds behaviour in random waves in this section the results with random waves are shown the numerical settings of the model damping meshes turbulence models are the same as the previous cases except for the wave boundary condition simulations of 100 s were considered starting from a static condition instantaneous absorbed power and total absorbed energy of the two subsystems are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 it is clear from fig 27 that the power absorbed by float and paddle tend to be synchronous like in the experiments with regular waves the instantaneous power is significantly variable with time nonetheless it is possible to identify a linear trend in the total absorbed energy after few tenths of seconds fig 28 shows the linear interpolation of the total energy absorbed performed discarding the initial 15 s the slope of those lines is the average increasing rate of total absorbed energy which is the average absorbed power the choice of the time window to calculate the average absorbed power does not considerably affect the result the same analysis is repeated for the random sea state 2 and the final values of the average absorbed power are reported in table 18 and table 19 the logical prevision of a power decrease in random waves is observed the random wave overall power equal to that of the correspondent regular wave is not associated to a unique wave for which damping of float and paddle was optimized but it is distributed over different waves characterized by different periods in particular it can be noticed that the float undergoes the most effective power decrease because its higher inertia with respect to that of the paddle makes it more sensitive to the change of the forcing period furthermore for random sea state 2 the efficiency reduction is higher and this is related to the occurrence of overtopping phenomena that hinders the float rise 5 conclusions in this work the behaviour of eds a two oscillating body wec for shallow waters was numerically investigated through cfd a laboratory model of the eds had been already studied at the politecnico di milano negri and malavasi 2018 the numerical model was built on the basis of the laboratory model the numerical eds was simplified and generalized with respect to the experimental one the geometry of the parts immersed in water were kept the same of the experimental eds except the thickness of the paddle which was slightly increased in order to limit the mesh discretization to keep the mechanical equivalence between the two models of eds the linearized equation of motion of the numerical eds has been written and the equivalent inertia damping and hydrostatic terms of the experimental eds have been calculated and set for the numerical eds moreover the same static position of the experimental eds in still water was set in the numerical eds these constraints provided the equations of the mass distribution of the numerical eds which were the input data needed to characterize the numerical eds in the cfd software part of the experimental domain a wave flume with a sloping beach where eds was placed were also reproduced in the numerical model the properties of the two experimental regular waves measured without the eds being in the channel were used as wave boundary condition at the beginning of the numerical channel in the cfd software several simulations without the eds were performed and a sensitivity analysis was carried out over many parameters the results lead to stable and robust results optimal results were obtained with this set on numerical parameters fine meshes rng κ ε turbulence model automatic vof advection model fourier series method for the wave modelling first order approximation for momentum advection in particular the behaviour of the wave height along the shore was observed and the discrepancies with respect to the experimental results were generally lower than 10 later the complete numerical model has been used to simulate two experimental tests of the eds with waves on the basis of which it has been validated results showed good agreement between the two models the motion amplitude of the float and the paddle were within 10 of the experimental values the amplitude of the damping force of float and paddle were within 25 of the experimental values the duration and energy repartition of the two phases of motion of float and paddle upward and downward for the float forward and backward for the paddle were similar the energy absorbed by the float was 20 higher in the cfd results due to a larger motion amplitude of the float about 5 for both waves the main difference between numerical and experimental results was the mean dynamic angle of the paddle subsystem in the numerical results the paddle stayed on average closer to the float of about 11 the main cause of these discrepancies is probably the simplification adopted in the representation of the damping the nonlinear experimental damping might cause different effects with respect to the numerical constant damping even if energetically equivalent this hypothesis may be verified in the future through the implementation in the cfd software of a method for providing a time variable or angle variable or velocity variable damping cfd showed to be a flexible tool to easily test new conditions concerning both the wec configuration and the waves indeed an optimization study of paddle damping was easily carried out by simulating various eds configurations with different values of the paddle damping results show that this parameter influences the power absorbed by the paddle and phase lag between float and paddle while it does not affect the float motion furthermore the numerical model was also used to test eds with random waves two wave spectra were shaped in order to be energetically equivalent to the two regular waves previously tested as expected the energy productions decreased 24 and 34 respectively for the two random sea states the usefulness of the developed cfd model is evident because the time and resources needed to experimentally perform such tests would be certainly higher therefore further optimization of the eds will be performed especially investigating the parameters that are not easily experimentally variable like the distribution of the mass between the float and paddle subsystems and the shape and dimension of the paddle besides a more accurate optimization of the eds through this numerical model another future work will be the implementation of a time variable damping in the numerical code this will allow to exactly reproduce the experimental damping force and further improve the validation of the cfd model moreover the possibility of using of a time variable damping will allow the development and verification of a control strategy probably based on the latching mechanism moreover the numerical model will be used to analyse the behaviour of several eds in modular configuration and to forecast the energy production of eds in real sea sites credit authorship contribution statement eliseo marchesi

21582,the energy double system eds is a two degree of freedom 2dof nearshore point absorber wave energy converter wec it is composed of a heaving float and a surging paddle which are interconnected and each one has its own power take off pto in this work a numerical model of the eds was developed on the basis of the existent laboratory model which had already been the object of several studies at the politecnico di milano firstly a general mechanical scheme of the eds was developed which is simplified with respect to the laboratory model this is a mass spring damper 2dof system described by a couple of equations linearized around the equilibrium position once that the mechanical equivalence with the laboratory model was established the simplified eds geometry was set in a computational fluid dynamics cfd model together with the experimental boundary conditions the eds is placed in shallow water depth along a sloping beach undergoing regular waves numerical results fairly agree with the experimental ones although slightly overestimate the energy absorption of the float 20 and the paddle 10 finally new cases were simulated different values of pto damping and random waves were tested keywords wave energy wec eds numerical model cfd shallow water 1 introduction wave energy is a promising renewable resource although today the technology to exploit it is still developing through research and prototyping and have not reach the commercial scale deployment yet ahamed et al 2020 this is probably due to the important issues connected with the harnessing of this type of energy such as the high temporal variability of the source the survivability in extreme events the availability of grid connection aderinto and li 2018 according to the type and location of the wave energy converter wec some of these issues can be relatively be more or less important for example wecs designed for shallow water depths are less exposed to storms and can deal with waves more directionally concentrated folley and whittaker 2009 on the other hand modelling a wec in the offshore zone at least in the early stage can be simpler because linear wave theory can be assumed dean and darlymple 1991 as well as for their location offshore nearshore shoreline wecs are usually classified according to their working principle oscillating body oscillating water column owc overtopping and to their orientation with respect to the oncoming wave point absorber attenuator terminator falcao 2010 lópez et al 2013 a review of the performances of the different wave energy converters can be found in aderinto and li 2019 as in other problems concerning fluid mechanics the analytical experimental and numerical approaches are usually used to model and study wecs the analytical approach is based on potential flow model where the flow is incompressible and irrotational with the adoption of the mass conservation principle the governing equation of the wave field is the laplace s equation for the velocity potential φ linear wave theory represents the simplest solution of the laplace equation and it is the most used approach in the analytical wec modelling the common approach is to hypothesize that the fluid structure interaction can be described through the linear superimposition of a wave radiation potential oscillating body in still liquid and a wave diffraction potential fixed body in a wave field analytical solutions are possible only for simple geometries of the domain and of the floating bodies several analytical studies exist in the literature among all hulme 1982 calculated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a floating hemisphere the experimental approach is based on the application of the buckingham π theorem by using froude similarity as the reynolds number is almost always very high it is possible to model and study the wec at a laboratory scale unlike the analytical approach the experimental approach allows to deal with complex geometries and nonlinear fluid structure interaction many experimental studies can be found in the literature sheng et al 2014 summarize the characteristics of wec physical modelling the numerical approach is based on the computational resolution of a variable number of discretized equations that rule the problem reviews of the numerical methods for wecs can be found in li and yu 2012 and folley et al 2012 two main types of numerical methods are used in wec modelling those based on boundary element method bem and the cfd bem is based on the potential flow theory the laplace equation is written in the integral form by the usage of green s theorem and after the setting of the boundary condition the velocity field can be numerically computed in a fixed number of points placed on the submerged body surface the methods that rely on bem have been the most used in wec numerical simulations they can mainly be subdivided in frequency and time domain models frequency domain models are totally linear while time domain models can deal with nonlinear external forces the main bem advantages are the low computational effort if compared to cfd and the possibility to treat complex geometries that the analytical method cannot handle on the other hand the application field of this method is limited to inviscid flow therefore it cannot catch viscous drag slamming effects and wave breaking in order to make bem models capable of treating viscous drag some authors corrected the mathematical model with a nonlinear contribute calculated in agreement with the morison equation zurkinden et al 2014 used bem simulations to reproduce the behaviour of the wavestar www wavestarenergy com firstly with a linear model and then with a nonlinear one which included the drag term in the conclusions it was stated that the second model could forecast the maximum solicitations and displacements with higher accuracy the other main numerical approach is the computational fluid dynamics cfd which basis on the a resolution of the navier stokes equations cfd is employed in situations where nonlinearities cannot be neglected for instance yu and li 2013 used this model to investigate the effects of the viscous drag and the overtopping phenomena on the performance of a two body floating point absorber wec demonstrating their significant influence on the power output babajani et al 2016 used cfd to investigate the influence of the distance between two point absorber wecs searasers on their heaving performances when a wave propagates in their arrangement line eskilsson et al 2014 used cfd to study the wavedragon a terminator wec that involves complex phenomena such as overtopping wave slamming and turbulence that other methods cannot represent similar phenomena are involved in the terminator type wecs as in the obrec studied by musa et al 2017 and the seawave slot cone generator studied by vicinanza et al 2015 and buccino et al 2016 in which the cfd simulations give similar results to those experimentally obtained nonlinearities are also heavily involved in extreme conditions palm et al 2013 used cfd to simulate the coupled motion of a floating wec and its mooring cables in violent sea condition in order to verify the cables design through the quantification of the forces acting on them cfd has also the advantage of the availability of particular post processing softwares that provide comfortable representations of different parameters in the study carried out by elhanafi et al 2017 an owc wec cfd was used to visualize and investigate the vorticity of the fluid around the entrance of the owc this analysis of the flow field could allowed a better understanding of the relationship the hydrodynamic performance of owc and some design parameters free surface air pressure and airflow rate in this work the energy double system eds a 2dof oscillating body wec for shallow waters negri and malavasi 2018 was numerically modelled cfd was employed due to the nonlinearity of the waves in shallow waters and of the interaction between the fluid and the bodies the commercial cfd code flow 3d was used eds is composed of a float and a paddle both supported by an arm pivoted above the water level to a fixed structure fig 1 the float is a pitching heaving body rotating around this fixed pivot similar to wavestar the paddle is a pitching surging body rotating around a second pivot placed on the arm the eds is designed to work in the nearshore zone where the mass transport of the waves can push a light paddle in the proximity of the free surface the simple idea behind eds is to maximize the absorbed energy using two different bodies since none of them considered separately is resonant with the waves the float harnesses the vertical component of the wave force while the paddle harnesses the horizontal one a laboratory model of eds has already been developed at the hydraulics laboratory of politecnico di milano in negri et al 2013 and negri and malavasi 2018 the model was tested in various configurations and at various locations along a sloping beach for a water depth h f d 0 6 which was the minimum depth that prevented the paddle from hitting the bottom the parameters investigated and optimized included the distance between float and paddle the immersion of the paddle and the damping applied to the float negri and malavasi 2018 showed that eds has a higher cwr than a similar wec without the paddle and this advantage increases as water depth decreases the numerical model of the eds was developed and verified on the basis of its laboratory model in this way a useful tool for making virtual experiments and further optimizing the eds has been achieved the implementation of eds in the numerical software involved some modifications with respect to the laboratory model in order to generalize and simplify the eds structure in particular by eliminating the features of the laboratory model that were only necessary to the laboratory experimentation this operation required a prior mathematical modelling of eds motion which allowed to define the rules for realizing equivalent eds models in particular the parameters affecting the eds motion were detected and set equal in the experimental and numerical models these parameters are a function of the geometry and the mass distribution in the eds the paper is organized as follows section 2 contains the just above mentioned mathematical and numerical modelling of the eds system starting from the laboratory model section 3 contains the numerical modelling of regular waves in shallow waters basing on the waves measured in laboratory the procedure for building the spectrum of shallow water random waves used in the final numerical simulations energetically equivalent to shallow water regular waves the numerical setup for the discretization of the domain section 4 contains the results of the numerical simulations firstly two experimental cases with monochromatic waves are reproduced with the numerical model then new cases are simulated varying the mechanical properties of the eds and using random waves section 5 contains the concluding remarks and possible future developments 2 modelling of the eds in this section a numerical model of eds is built on the basis of the existing physical model at the hydraulics laboratory of the politecnico di milano since some simplifications were made in the numerical eds it was necessary to establish an equivalence criterion between the experimental and numerical model this outcome was achieved by building an intermediate mathematical model of eds where its mechanical properties are expressed in the equation of motion 2 1 experimental model of the eds the laboratory model and the scheme of the eds are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively the model can be divided into two subsystems the float one and the paddle one the two degrees of freedom are the rotational angle of the float beam ha around the pivot o and the rotational angle of the paddle beam mn around the pivot c the float subsystem of the laboratory model is composed of the float a hollow solid designed with a spherical cap and a cylinder the beam ha rigidly attached to the float and pivoted in o a leverage system aimed at activating the damping system beams gj and gw with hinges in b and g and the damping system itself which is a heaving disc rigidly attached to the beam gw inside a cylinder filled with oil the float diameter d is equal to 0 204 m the total height of the float is 0 137 m beams gj and its hinges allow to transform the rotation of the main beam ha into the vertical motion of the gw beam the friction between the beam and the sleeve is avoided with linear bearing the draft of the float d f at rest is equal to 0 06 m the main characteristics of the elements composing the float subsystem are presented in table 1 the paddle subsystem is composed of the paddle itself a secondary beam mn rigidly attached to the paddle and the paddle damping system the paddle has a cylindrical shape with radius 0 104 m and a chord of 0 12 m the draft of the paddle d p at rest is equal to 0 09 m the beam mn is hinged on the beam ha in the point c the paddle damper is inserted between pivots f at the ground and d on beam mn it is a heaving disc point p rigidly attached to the beam up which relatively moves in a cylinder filled with oil supported by beam dq the beams up and qd stay aligned thanks to a sleeve installed between them with respect to the eds laboratory model investigated in negri and malavasi 2018 in this work the paddle pto reacts against a fixed frame instead of reacting on the main arm the main parameters which describe this subsystem are reported in table 2 each damping system simulates a pto power take off and consist of a heaving disc moving in cylindrical container filled with oil when the disc is moving a dissipative damping force is also generated the discs do not seal the cylinders wall the motion and the force of each damper was acquired through distance sensor and load cell placed on it since such damping systems also generate inertia fluid added mass and buoyancy forces a procedure was used to extract the damping force from the total force recorded negri and malavasi 2018 the energy absorbed by the float or by the paddle between instant t 1 and t 2 was calculated as eq 1 1 e i t 1 t 2 f d i t x i t d t where i is an index 1 stands for float 2 stands for paddle f d is the damping force recorded and x is the relative velocity between the disc and the cylinder 2 2 mathematical model of the eds the laboratory model of the eds had some features that only fulfilled practical laboratory requirements in particular the damping systems and their leverages were laboratory solutions to simulate the ptos and measuring the absorbed mechanical energy and they do not resemble the prototype ptos those elements do not get in touch with the fluid and therefore they do not influence the fluid structure interaction of the eds therefore before implementing the eds in the numerical software it is reasonable to simplify its geometry considering only the components that actually get in touch with the water and the other essential parts of the system which are the connecting arms between the float the paddle and the ground although this choice requires an additional theoretical modelling of the eds in order to establish a mechanical equivalence between the laboratory eds and the numerical eds it facilitates the numerical implementation of the eds and more importantly produces a more general realistic exploitable model fig 4 shows the mechanical scheme of the simplified eds the two degrees of freedom are the angles θ 1 and θ 2 the main simplifications with respect to the laboratory model are the following the float damping system and its leverages is replaced with a torsional linear damping b 1 applied in the pivot o and a supplementary inertia applied on the float subsystem the paddle damping system is replaced with a translational linear damping b 2 applied between pivots f and d and a supplementary inertia applied to the paddle subsystem the part cn of the secondary arm is eliminated and replaced with supplementary inertia of the secondary arm in order to complete the model it is necessary to detect the mechanical parameters inertia damping stiffness parameters that characterize it and to calculate their equivalent values in the laboratory model to do this the equation of motion must be derived the two degrees of freedom are defined as follows eqs 2 and 3 2 θ 1 α 0 α 3 θ 2 β β 0 where α and β are the angles that define the position of the two subsystem as indicated in fig 4 α 0 and β 0 are the values related to the static equilibrium arrangement of the system the equations of motion according to the lagrangian mechanics are the following eq 4 4 d d t l θ 1 l θ 1 d θ 1 f 1 d d t l θ 2 l θ 2 d θ 2 f 2 where l k e p e is the lagrangian expressed as the difference between the kinematic energy and the potential energy d is the dissipative function and f the forcing of the system the scheme in fig 4 highlights the reference systems used and indicatively shows the two points g 1 and g 2 barycentres of the float and the paddle subsystems respectively the kinetic energy is expressed as follows eq 5 5 k e 1 2 i 1 θ 1 2 1 2 i 2 θ 2 2 1 2 m 2 oc 2 θ 1 2 2 θ 1 θ 2 oc ℓ 2 g where i 1 represents the moment of inertia of the float subsystem around the pivot o while m 2 and i 2 are the mass and the moment of inertia around the pivot c of the paddle subsystem respectively the supplementary inertia previously mentioned is taken into account in i 1 and i 2 the potential energy is dependent from the position of the system and can be modelled as follows eq 6 6 p e k 1 0 θ 1 k 2 0 θ 2 1 2 k 1 1 θ 1 2 k 1 2 θ 1 θ 2 1 2 k 2 2 θ 2 2 where the parameters k are the stiffness coefficients of the system k 1 1 and k 2 2 express the restoring moments generated in a hinge o for k 1 1 c for k 2 2 from an activation of the degree of freedom of the same hinge k 1 2 equal to k 2 1 express the restoring moments created in a hinge by an activation of the degree of freedom connected to the other hinge k 1 0 and k 2 0 express the moments in the two hinges in the reference configuration θ 1 θ 2 since the reference condition is the static equilibrium these two coefficients are null the restoring moments are static moments and they stem from hydrostatic buoyancy forces on immersed parts of eds and gravitational forces weight of the parts of the eds the coefficients k can be calculated from the static equilibrium of the system by expressing the static moments m o and m c around hinges o and c respectively since the static moments of the system are not linearly proportional to the rotations for example the wetted area section of the float is not constant with θ 1 the stiffness coefficients are approximated with the derivative of the static moments with respect to the rotation coordinates as follows eqs 7 8 9 and 10 7 k 1 1 d m o θ 1 θ 2 d θ 1 8 k 2 2 d m c θ 1 θ 2 d θ 2 9 k 1 2 d m o θ 1 θ 2 d θ 2 10 k 2 1 d m c θ 1 θ 2 d θ 1 the static moments are calculated as the sum of the gravitational and buoyance moments analytical expressions of the moments could be defined as function of θ 1 and θ 2 only eqs 11 and 12 11 m o α β m 1 g x g 1 α γ v 1 α x s 1 α m 2 g x c α γ v 2 α β x c α 12 m c α β m 2 g x g 2 β γ v 2 α β x s 2 α β where m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the two subsystem v 1 and v 2 the submerged volumes and s 1 and s 2 are the barycentre of the submerged volumes eqs 7 12 are not expanded due to their length the dissipative function is expressed as follows eq 13 13 d 1 2 b 1 θ 1 2 1 2 b 2 x 2 2 in which b 1 expresses with a constant value the torque damping of the float subsystem around the o pivot obtained from an energetically equivalence with experimental damping of the float not constant during a cycle of oscillation in a similar way b 2 represents the damping of the paddle damper and it is a constant value energetically equivalent to the paddle damper it is important to underline that for each of the two tested wave conditions these parameters assume different values after all the calculations the motion equation has the following shape eqs 14 15 16 17 18 and 19 14 m y b y k y f 15 y θ 1 θ 2 16 m i 1 m 2 oc 2 m 2 oc ℓ 2 g m 2 oc ℓ 2 g i 2 17 b b 1 b 2 oc 2 sin 2 α ψ b 2 oc cd sin α ψ cos β ψ b 2 oc cd sin α ψ cos β ψ b 2 oc 2 cos 2 β ψ 18 k k 1 1 k 1 2 k 2 1 k 2 2 19 f f 1 f 2 where the quantity ℓ 2g is equal to eq 20 20 ℓ 2 g y 2 g cos β x 2 g sin β sin α x 2 g cos β y 2 g sin β cos α and ψ is the inclination of the paddle damper it was assumed that the simplified model and the laboratory model of eds behave the same if the following conditions are verified the equilibrium condition at rest is the same same angles α 0 β 0 the matrices m b k are the same the shape of the immersed parts is the same the boundary conditions are the same oncoming waves and bottom configuration to calculate the equivalent values of m b and k of the laboratory model some simplifications were necessary for what regards the matrix m the inertia given by the float experimental damping system was included in the i 1 inertia moment and is obtained by linearizing according to θ 1 the kinematic of the damping system and its leverage the inertia given by the paddle experimental damping system was included in the other three terms of the matrix and calculated with linearization as well for what regards the matrix b equivalent linear damping was a posteriori calculated from the experimental tests as follows eqs 21 and 22 21 b 1 e 1 ω π θ 1 2 22 b 2 e 2 ω π a x 2 2 in which e 1 and e 2 are the absorbed energies during a cycle of oscillation by the float and the paddle damping systems respectively ω is the pulsation θ 1 is the first harmonic amplitude of the float rotation angle and a x 2 is the first harmonic amplitude of the paddle damping system elongation the matrixes related to the experimental model have the values reported in table 3 2 3 numerical model of the eds the implementation of a solid object in the cfd software requires the specification of the mass distribution of that object in order to insert the simplified geometry of the eds into the cfd software it was therefore necessary to calculate a mass distribution consistent with the geometry of the simplified model and that produces the same values of the three matrices m b k before that it is necessary to briefly explain how the cfd software allows the setting of solid moving objects the gmo general moving object model activated in flow 3d provides the creation of the so called component a unique rigid body as a sum of subcomponents that is to say objects with elementary shapes components can therefore be created as a sum and difference of subcomponents but a component with a complex shape might also be implemented importing a geometry file stl two components are created the float component and the paddle one the software requires the assignment of a numerical value to the following parameters for the float component mass position of the barycentre and moment of inertia these parameters must be chosen so that each value of matrices m b k is the same than that of table 3 and eds configuration at static equilibrium is the same same angles α 0 and β 0 for each of the two waves it was necessary to assign a value to the following 10 parameters of the numerical model of the eds m 1 mass of the float component x g 1 x coordinate of the float component barycentre y g 1 y coordinate of the float component barycentre i 1 moment of inertia of the float component with respect to its fixed axis of rotation pivot o b 1 linear torque damping of the damper of the float m 2 mass of the paddle component x g 2 x coordinate of the paddle component barycentre y g 2 y coordinate of the paddle component barycentre i 2 g barycentric moment of inertia of the paddle component b 2 linear translational damping of the paddle component damper the imposition of equality of the three matrixes m b k leads to 7 equations 3 equations for m matrix extra diagonal terms are equal 2 equations for k matrix extra diagonal terms are purely determined from the geometries of the two subsystems as none of the 10 parameters reported previously appear in their definition 2 equations for b matrix simply equating the damping values it is here anticipated a problem related to the numerical discretization of the domain that is in part mitigated through this equivalence procedure the paddle of the lab model is very thin 2 mm if compared to the length of the channel 14 m in the numerical domain extremely small cells dimension of 1 5 mm at least would be necessary to fully capture the geometry of the paddle and allow a proper solution of the rans equations and the distribution of the pressure around the body even with a proper connection with bigger cell sizes the simulation would take unsustainably long computational times it was therefore decided to thicken the paddle from the rear side in order to keep the same surface for the incoming wave in order to allow bigger cells and easier computations the new thickness of the paddle was 6 mm the imposition of the same static equilibrium condition adds 2 more equations becoming the total number of equations equal to 9 the input parameters of the numerical model are 10 the system is therefore undetermined so there is some freedom in setting the input parameters however two constraints encounter a conflict the equality of the extra diagonal terms of the inertia matrix m and the equality of the second diagonal term of the stiffness matrix k this happens since the geometry of the numerical paddle subsystem is slightly different from the experimental one as explained previously this is also the cause of the difference between the extra diagonal terms of the stiffness matrix k one of the constraints must be sacrificed the decision is to neglect the equality between the extra diagonal terms of the inertia matrix because they influence the motion in a much less effective way rather than the diagonal terms two more constraints are needed to determine the set of parameters of the numerical model it is then decided to arbitrarily assign two values the mass of the float subsystem and the mass of the paddle subsystem in a way that barycentres are in reasonable positions in table 4 and table 5 the mechanical parameters of the numerical eds are reported the experimental and numerical matrices of motion are reported in table 6 the procedure shown up to here fulfil to the general problem of building a mechanical system equivalent to the laboratory model also regardless of the numerical modelling from here on the issues of the numerical modelling specific to the cfd software are discussed the scheme of the numerical model is reported in fig 5 in setting the numerical options the user can decide to assign whether a coupled motion with the fluid enabling the desired degrees of freedom or an imposed law of motion furthermore it is possible to enable a model which simulates collisions between different components two components were created the float component and the paddle one the float component reproduces faithfully the shapes and the dimension of the float and the arm connecting the float to the pivot o while everything present behind the pivot o is not intentionally reproduced for the reasons explained previously a coupled motion with the fluid is assigned to this component and the only one degree of freedom activated is the rotational angle around the pivot o the rotational damping system in pivot o is simulated with a torsion spring name of the tool in the software around it and it connects the movable float component and the fixed geometry of the domain with a null elastic coefficient and a specific constant linear damping the paddle component reproduces the paddle and the beam cm which connects it to the arm of the float the cn piece of beam and the damping system from u to d are not implemented in the geometry following the same criteria reported previously a coupled motion with the fluid and the three degrees of freedom of the xy plain are assigned to the component the translational damping system is realized with a linear spring which links the fixed point f with the movable point d of the paddle component in a similar way as the damper of the float component the creation of the moving hinge requires a clear explanation in flow 3d there is not a specific tool able to represent a moving hinge between separate components therefore as suggested from flow 3d user s site 2017 a spring is employed to simulate the moving hinge the ends of this theoretical spring are given the same coordinates but one is attached to the float component beam oa and the other one to the paddle component beam ce the stiffness assigned has to be calibrated in order to avoid large elongations caused by excessively low values and instabilities during the computations caused by excessively high values after few trials it was discovered that a value equal to 40 000 kg s2 avoided instabilities and led to displacements smaller than half a millimetre 3 numerical setup in this section the numerical settings for the simulation of the waves and for the discretization of the domain are presented in particular the behaviour of two regular waves along a sloping beach previously measured in the laboratory is numerically reproduced along a sloping beach then a method is presented for creating an energetically equivalent shallow water random wave which will be used in section 4 3 for investigating the behaviour of the eds in a real sea state finally the mesh of the numerical domain and the applied boundary conditions are presented 3 1 wave modelling the equivalence between the experimental and the numerical models of eds was established by considering the inertia solid spring gravitational hydrostatic damping external matrices of the lagrangian equations of motion see previous chapter it should be noted that the added mass and the hydrodynamic damping were not included in that matrices the aim of that procedure was to give to the numerical eds model the same mechanical properties of the experimental eds model the forcing of the eds is produced by the fluid structure interaction between waves and eds itself since that also the geometry of the immersed parts of eds float and paddle are the same in the experimental and numerical models of eds it is expected that the behaviour of eds and the wave field generated by the fluid structure interaction are the same if the undisturbed wave field is the same in the experiments and in the numerical simulations fig 6 shows the laboratory wave flume it is equipped with a vertical piston wavemaker and a beach with a slope of 6 8 its width is 1 m and the distance between the toe of the beach and the wavemaker is about 20 m as sketched in fig 6 the position of the eds is also indicated it must be remarked that both experimental and numerical waves were measured without the eds in the wave flume two regular waves were considered for this study their properties are reported in table 7 considering the scale factor 1 25 of the laboratory model float diameter of about 5 m at real scale the laboratory waves represent real scale waves with power for unit width of 34 and 59 kw m respectively for wave 1 and wave 2 which are values compatible with energetically significant sea sites the numerical domain was created in order to geometrically reproduce the experimental wave flume except for the length of the wave flume before the sloping beach which was reduced in order to decrease the computational effort of the simulation the length of the part of the channel before the beach was shortened to 10 m total length of the numerical channel was 14 m boundary conditions of symmetry were assigned to the lateral sides of the channel and a wave boundary condition was set for the side opposite to the beach fig 7 this condition required the definition of the type of wave linear stokes and cnoidal fourier series method stokes fenton s fifth oder theory solitary wave or random wave and the parameters characterising the wave given the non linearity of the experimental waves as shown in fig 8 it was decided to employ two types stokes and cnoidal fourier series method and stokes fenton s fifth order theory the parameters assigned are the ones obtained from the experimental data table 7 as initial condition the water level position and the hydrostatic pressure distribution were imposed different combinations of meshes and numerical settings were adopted in order to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the model and to detect the most reliable and sustainable model which can give results close to the experimental ones without unnecessarily long computational periods of time all the studied combinations of the wave 1 are reported in table 8 and those of wave 2 are reported in table 9 in the name of the simulation cases wb1 or wb2 stands for wave boundary 1 or 2 the subsequent small letter indicates the method which was utilized the subsequent number indicates the size of the numerical mesh 1 4 coarser finer apart from the cell size and the wave model fourier or fenton it was decided to investigate the influence of other models in order to have a wider sensitivity analysis turbulence model vof advection model and momentum advection approximation for what concerns the turbulence model two of the most widely used methods were tested the rng κ ε and the κ ω turbulence models regarding the fluid interface vof advection approximations two models were taken into account automatic that chooses the best fit option depending on the number of fluids and the presence of a sharp interface and split lagrangian a more recent method that in flow 3 d user manual 2016 is considered to produce lower cumulative volume error than the other vof advection approximations but it may generate a bigger volume error when the general moving objects model is activated for what regards the momentum advection approximation both first order and second order methods were tested more details about all the mentioned models can be found in flow 3 d user manual 2016 the reliability of the numerical model was evaluated by analysing the local wave height in several probes displaced along the beach one every 10 cm in particular in the zone where eds is placed x 2 15 2 33 that are the positions of the paddle and the float local wave height is calculated as the mean difference between crests and troughs the last two columns of tables 8 and 9 report the index ε eq 23 which expresses the rms of the difference between the numerical and experimental local wave heights along a portion of the domain with respect to the incident wave height ε was evaluated near the eds x 2 1 2 4 m and on a larger stretch of channel 0 5 5 8 m 23 ε x x 1 x 2 h l o c n u m x h l o c e x p x 2 x h where x 1 and x 2 are the extremities of the stretch of the domain considered and x is the number of points included between x 1 and x 2 h l o c n u m x and h l o c e x p x are the numerical and experimental local wave heights at location x h is the incident wave height reported in table 7 which was measured in the laboratory tests and set as input in the numerical simulations wave data was analysed through a self referenced phase average similarly to the method reported in negri et al 2011 the phase average is performed by averaging stationary oscillations therefore it is necessary to neglect the data close to the initial boundary condition for both waves the first 100 s were left out the results of the cfd computation and the subsequent post process are graphically reported in fig 9 fig 10 wave 1 and fig 11 fig 12 wave 2 numerical simulations generally reproduce quite well the experimental oscillation of the local wave height due to wave reflection both as regards the amplitude and the spatial frequency of the oscillation the results are better for wave 1 and generally for finer mesh the position of the wave breaking point identified as the wave height maximum closest to the shore is well reproduced except for some cases with coarse mesh wb1 f1 wb2 a1 almost all the results with waves 1 and 2 display maximum local discrepancies generally smaller than 10 with respect to the experimental results average differences ε are smaller than 10 except for the case wb2 a1 it is noted that the two wave types stokes and cnoidal fourier series method and stokes fenton s fifth order theory used in the definition of the wave boundary condition almost lead to the same results other parameters being equal among the simulation with wave 1 case wb1 a4 shows the smallest values of the difference ε between the numerical and experimental wave heights both near the eds system x 2 1 2 4 m and along a longer section of the channel x 0 5 5 8 m the better performance of this model might be due to the adoption of a finer mesh and of models that are generally considered to work well in most cases such as the rng κ ε turbulence model or the first order momentum advection as also reported in the flow 3d user manual 2016 for wave 2 the results are not univocal the minimum values of ε near the eds system and considering a longer section of the channel do not belong to the same case case wb2 a4 same settings of wb1 a4 except the wave characteristics gives the minimum value of ε near the eds x 2 15 2 33 on a larger domain x 0 5 5 8 case wb2 g3 gives the minimum value of ε in order to keep the same setting for the two waves wb2 a4 was chosen to simulate wave 2 at the end of this analysis the chosen method was finest mesh rng κ ω turbulence model automatic vof advection model fourier series method for wave modelling stokes and cnoidal wave first order approximation for momentum advection which corresponds to the cases wb1 a4 for wave 1 and wb2 a4 for wave 2 in tables 8 and 9 the line corresponding to the chosen setting are highlighted in figs 9 12 the series corresponding to the chosen setting is a black solid line with circles fig 13 shows the phase averaged wave profiles at the float position non dimensionalized according to the respective incident wave height and period the numerical simulation fairly agrees with the experimental measurement 3 2 random sea state modelling in shallow waters the numerical model here developed was verified on experiments performed with regular waves see section 4 1 after that the numerical model was used for studying the behaviour of eds with random waves two random sea states energetically equivalent to the two regular waves 1 and 2 were numerically modelled the spectra of the two sea states were obtained and later imposed as random wave boundary condition in the numerical domain the wave spectrum represents the relationship between the wave spectral density s m2s and the wave angular frequency ω rad s some of the most important parameters characterising the spectrum are the significant wave height h s and the energy period t e which have the following definitions eqs 24 and 25 respectively 24 h s 4 m 0 25 t e 2 π m 1 m 0 where the quantity m n is equal to eq 26 26 m n 0 s ω ω n d ω in general the power associated to a wave is defined as the product of the wave energy and the group celerity for a wave spectrum the power is defined by eq 27 27 p t o t ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω in the case of shallow waters as the one of the present study sheng and li 2017 propose to adopt a single modification coefficient c h depending only on the energy period t e to take into account the shoaling phenomenon that the random waves face eq 28 28 c h ω 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h k 0 k where k is the wave number equal to 2 π l where l is the wavelength which itself depends on ω k 0 is the deep water wave number and h is the static water depth the wave power in shallow waters is calculated as eq 29 29 p t o t s h a l l o w w a t e r s 1 2 ρ g 2 0 s ω ω c h ω d ω 1 64 π ρ g 2 h s 2 t e c h t

are calculated as eqs 31 and 32 respectively 31 α e ω ω p 2 2 ω p 2 σ 2 32 σ 0 07 f o r ω ω p 0 09 f o r ω ω p where ω p h s and γ are parameters that require an assignment h s is assumed equal to h 2 in which h stands for the wave height of the regular wave ω p the angular frequency associated to the peak period and γ the peak enhancement factor were set in order to have the wave energy period and the wave power respectively equal to wave period and the wave power of the regular waves reported previously table 7 two wave spectra were defined their parameters are reported in table 10 and their shape is reported in fig 14 3 3 numerical setup for eds in the numerical setup particular attention was given to the mesh the considerable difference between the smallest and the biggest scale of interest 6 mm of the paddle width and 14 m of the wave flume length respectively is a problem that has to be managed properly in order to avoid excessively heavy simulations firstly it is decided to cover only half of the numerical domain assuming that the fluid velocity field is symmetric with respect to the eds plain of symmetry moreover different type of meshes are employed in order to provide finer computation where needed a 3d fine mesh is used near the eds and is nested in a rougher 3d mesh which is itself linked to two 2d meshes onshore and offshore as depicted in fig 15 and fig 16 the dimensions of the cell sizes and the boundary conditions are reported in table 11 4 results in this section the numerical results are showed firstly the numerical simulations of the experimental cases are presented comparison with the experimental results are shown in order to verify the goodness of the numerical model then new configurations of the eds are numerically simulated several simulations with different values of paddle damping are performed in order to optimize that parameter moreover simulations with random sea waves are performed 4 1 validation of the experimental cases in order to verify the goodness of the numerical model a comparison with the available experimental quantities was performed the numerical results were phase averaged in a similar way to the one adopted for the wave analysis 3 1 the behaviour of the two subsystems float and paddle for wave 1 are respectively reported in fig 17 and fig 18 for each subsystem position velocity damping torque force and absorbed power during the mean oscillation cycle are shown mean and global properties of the motion of the float and paddle are reported in table 12 and table 13 similar results of the second wave setup are reported in fig 19 fig 20 table 14 and table 15 concerning the float subsystem figs 17 and 19 a qualitative agreement between the experimental and the numerical results can be observed however the slight overestimations of the numerical model related to the rotational amplitudes of about 5 10 lead to clearer discrepancies of the absorbed energy of about 20 25 as it can be seen in tables 14 and 15 both in the numerical and experimental models the upward phase is shorter and more energetic than the downward phase upward phase includes 60 of the total energy absorbed by the float the duration of the downward phase is slightly longer in the numerical model and also the ratio between the energy absorbed in the downward and upward phases is higher in the numerical model the motion of the float reflects the shape of the local wave height which is characterized by a wave crest significantly higher and narrower than the through as shown in fig 13 the mean dynamic position of the float is found below the static position angle of rotation α increases as the float goes down for wave 1 fig 17 the downward motion of the float t 0 7 1 45 s shows quite different properties in the numerical and experimental models velocity damping torque and absorbed power of the experimental model are characterized by a complex behaviour not as smooth as those in the numerical results because of this there are maximum instantaneous differences of about 0 05 rad s in the angular velocity of about 1 nm in the damping torque and of about 0 15 w in the absorbed power this is reasonably due to the fact that the numerical eds has linear external damping while the experimental eds has non linear external damping for wave 2 fig 19 the differences between the numerical and the experimental model tends to resemble the ones related to the wave 1 however the main parameters reported in table 14 show higher discrepancies rotational amplitude is overestimated by about 11 instead of the 6 of the wave 1 and cycle energy is overestimated by about 30 instead of the 22 of the wave 1 for what regards the paddle subsystem the most evident difference between the experimental and the numerical model is the mean dynamic value of the rotational angle whilst the shape of the curves are rather similar figs 18 and 20 the same holds also for the position of the damper in the numerical eds the paddle stays on average closer to the float looking at the other quantities velocity damping force absorbed power it can be noticed that as for the float the numerical results tend to be smoother than the experimental ones in particular for both waves there are maximum differences of about 0 02 m s in the elongation velocity of the damper of about 1 n in the damping force and of about 0 15 w in the absorbed power the rotational amplitude of motion of the paddle is overestimated in the numerical model for wave 1 7 and underestimated for wave 2 3 as it can be seen in tables 13 and 15 the total energy absorbed by the paddle is overestimated for wave 1 10 and similar for wave 2 the energy absorbed in the motion towards the shore is significantly higher than that in the motion towards offshore 60 70 of the total energy absorbed by the paddle is in the motion towards the shore the most energetic phase is shorter similarly to the float this is very evident for wave 2 where the motion towards offshore lasts almost double the motion towards the shore fig 20 these relationships are similar in the numerical and experimental models float and paddle are almost in phase which means that the float rises when the paddle goes towards the shore the phase lag calculated by the numerical simulations is similar to the experimental one additional numerical simulation of the eds without the paddle were performed but not here reported and the results showed that the motion amplitude and absorbed energy of the float resulted overestimated as well similarly to the case of complete eds the most probable cause of these differences between numerical and experimental results is the damping of float and paddle in fig 21 and fig 22 the experimental ratio between the torque force and the velocity angular velocity is shown for the float paddle with wave 1 it can be seen that the experimental ratio between damping force and velocity has a lot of variability with respect to the energetically equivalent linear damping this is due to the nonlinear behaviour of the experimental damping systems 4 2 optimization of the paddle damping in this section several simulations are performed with different values of the paddle damping the paddle damping had not been optimized yet in the experimental model unlike in the experimental model in the numerical model it is easy to change this parameter and thus optimize its value in particular for both the regular waves used in this work the damping is halved and doubled with respect to the previously reported values of equivalent linear damping of the paddle the results show that this parameter does not sensitively affect the behaviour of the float subsystem energy absorption undergoes variation smaller than 2 although amplitude of motion and damping force is very dependent on it the higher the damping the smaller the motion amplitude and the larger the damping force it is found that higher damping tends to anticipate the inversion points of the paddle with respect to the inversion points of the float higher damping also leads to a smaller mean dynamic angle of the paddle meaning that the paddle stays closer to the shore the main results are shown in table 16 and 17 and figs 23 26 4 3 eds behaviour in random waves in this section the results with random waves are shown the numerical settings of the model damping meshes turbulence models are the same as the previous cases except for the wave boundary condition simulations of 100 s were considered starting from a static condition instantaneous absorbed power and total absorbed energy of the two subsystems are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 it is clear from fig 27 that the power absorbed by float and paddle tend to be synchronous like in the experiments with regular waves the instantaneous power is significantly variable with time nonetheless it is possible to identify a linear trend in the total absorbed energy after few tenths of seconds fig 28 shows the linear interpolation of the total energy absorbed performed discarding the initial 15 s the slope of those lines is the average increasing rate of total absorbed energy which is the average absorbed power the choice of the time window to calculate the average absorbed power does not considerably affect the result the same analysis is repeated for the random sea state 2 and the final values of the average absorbed power are reported in table 18 and table 19 the logical prevision of a power decrease in random waves is observed the random wave overall power equal to that of the correspondent regular wave is not associated to a unique wave for which damping of float and paddle was optimized but it is distributed over different waves characterized by different periods in particular it can be noticed that the float undergoes the most effective power decrease because its higher inertia with respect to that of the paddle makes it more sensitive to the change of the forcing period furthermore for random sea state 2 the efficiency reduction is higher and this is related to the occurrence of overtopping phenomena that hinders the float rise 5 conclusions in this work the behaviour of eds a two oscillating body wec for shallow waters was numerically investigated through cfd a laboratory model of the eds had been already studied at the politecnico di milano negri and malavasi 2018 the numerical model was built on the basis of the laboratory model the numerical eds was simplified and generalized with respect to the experimental one the geometry of the parts immersed in water were kept the same of the experimental eds except the thickness of the paddle which was slightly increased in order to limit the mesh discretization to keep the mechanical equivalence between the two models of eds the linearized equation of motion of the numerical eds has been written and the equivalent inertia damping and hydrostatic terms of the experimental eds have been calculated and set for the numerical eds moreover the same static position of the experimental eds in still water was set in the numerical eds these constraints provided the equations of the mass distribution of the numerical eds which were the input data needed to characterize the numerical eds in the cfd software part of the experimental domain a wave flume with a sloping beach where eds was placed were also reproduced in the numerical model the properties of the two experimental regular waves measured without the eds being in the channel were used as wave boundary condition at the beginning of the numerical channel in the cfd software several simulations without the eds were performed and a sensitivity analysis was carried out over many parameters the results lead to stable and robust results optimal results were obtained with this set on numerical parameters fine meshes rng κ ε turbulence model automatic vof advection model fourier series method for the wave modelling first order approximation for momentum advection in particular the behaviour of the wave height along the shore was observed and the discrepancies with respect to the experimental results were generally lower than 10 later the complete numerical model has been used to simulate two experimental tests of the eds with waves on the basis of which it has been validated results showed good agreement between the two models the motion amplitude of the float and the paddle were within 10 of the experimental values the amplitude of the damping force of float and paddle were within 25 of the experimental values the duration and energy repartition of the two phases of motion of float and paddle upward and downward for the float forward and backward for the paddle were similar the energy absorbed by the float was 20 higher in the cfd results due to a larger motion amplitude of the float about 5 for both waves the main difference between numerical and experimental results was the mean dynamic angle of the paddle subsystem in the numerical results the paddle stayed on average closer to the float of about 11 the main cause of these discrepancies is probably the simplification adopted in the representation of the damping the nonlinear experimental damping might cause different effects with respect to the numerical constant damping even if energetically equivalent this hypothesis may be verified in the future through the implementation in the cfd software of a method for providing a time variable or angle variable or velocity variable damping cfd showed to be a flexible tool to easily test new conditions concerning both the wec configuration and the waves indeed an optimization study of paddle damping was easily carried out by simulating various eds configurations with different values of the paddle damping results show that this parameter influences the power absorbed by the paddle and phase lag between float and paddle while it does not affect the float motion furthermore the numerical model was also used to test eds with random waves two wave spectra were shaped in order to be energetically equivalent to the two regular waves previously tested as expected the energy productions decreased 24 and 34 respectively for the two random sea states the usefulness of the developed cfd model is evident because the time and resources needed to experimentally perform such tests would be certainly higher therefore further optimization of the eds will be performed especially investigating the parameters that are not easily experimentally variable like the distribution of the mass between the float and paddle subsystems and the shape and dimension of the paddle besides a more accurate optimization of the eds through this numerical model another future work will be the implementation of a time variable damping in the numerical code this will allow to exactly reproduce the experimental damping force and further improve the validation of the cfd model moreover the possibility of using of a time variable damping will allow the development and verification of a control strategy probably based on the latching mechanism moreover the numerical model will be used to analyse the behaviour of several eds in modular configuration and to forecast the energy production of eds in real sea sites credit authorship contribution statement eliseo marchesi

21583,the main objective of this work has been the validation of a methodology to calculate the stress intensity factors sifs in prospective cracks of offshore mooring chains under service conditions for this purpose the analytic methods described in the bs7910 have been compared with those calculated by the conventional finite element method fem by means of contour integrals and by the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software first an axially loaded cylinder has been studied in order to determine the correlation between different methods for a simple case as well as to establish the most suited finite element methodology then the real case of a mooring chain has been studied including the residual stresses induced in the manufacturing process finally numerical simulations and experimental results have been compared results justify the use of numerical methods specifically the use of contour integrals for the calculation of stress intensity factors sifs in offshore mooring chains keywords fracture stress intensity factors sifs extended finite element method xfem offshore mooring chains residual stresses 1 introduction offshore mooring chains are used to anchor petroleum platforms that work permanently for 20 40 years a typical mooring line is composed of chain sections at their ends and a wire section in the middle furthermore chains are selected for the ends because these are the most critical locations regarding structural integrity it is in the area of waves and in the area of contact with the ocean floor where the greatest loads corrosion phenomena fatigue and wear are concentrated besides the oil and gas growing demand causes the offshore industry to move increasingly towards more hostile environments and more aggressive situations greater depths the presence of hurricanes arctic temperatures etc in this context with long term projects and aggressive conditions it is very important to ensure the structural integrity of the entire mooring line in recent years several investigations have been carried out about the frequency of failures their locations main causes inspection and certification needs brown et al 2010 ma et al 2013 gordon et al 2014 fontaine et al 2014 these studies conclude that fatigue and corrosion are the main degradation phenomena that affect the structural integrity of mooring chains fracture mechanics provides a tool for assessing the criticality of flaws in structures linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm is the basic theory of fracture it was originated by griffith 1921 and completed by irwin 1957 the theory characterizes the stress field around cracks and provides analytical solutions to quantify these stress fields in general crack growth behaviour is evaluated using analytical methods based on approximated formulations and also via numerical methods that use the finite element analysis in this work both analytical and numerical methods have been used for the calculation of stress intensity factors sifs the solutions proposed by the british standard bs7910 2013 have been compared with those calculated using the conventional finite element method fem by means of contour integrals and alternatively using the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software finally the results obtained by different methods have been compared therefore the main contribution of the paper is the validation of a methodology to calculate the stress intensity factors sifs in prospective cracks of offshore mooring chains under service conditions which is not currently available in literature 2 calculation of stress intensity factors in this section the analytical solutions described in bs7910 have been compared with those based on finite element methods for this purpose different crack geometries and load configurations have been studied first an axially loaded cylinder has been evaluated in order to determine the correlation between analytical and numerical results for a simple case as well as to establish the most appropriate finite element model configuration then the real case of a mooring chain has been studied including the residual stresses induced in the last manufacturing step the bs7910 2013 bs 7910 2015 which is the guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures is a commonly accepted standard in the offshore industry even though it has been proven that other sif solutions give more accurate results on round bars toribio et al 2009 this guide indicates in its annex m the equations for the calculation of sifs the stress intensity factor sif in the bs7910 is calculated as 1 k i y σ π a with a division between primary and secondary geometric factors 2 y σ y σ p y σ s 3 y σ p m f w k t m m k m m m p m k t b m k b m b p b k m 1 p m 4 y σ s m m q m m b q b where k i is the sif the m s are geometric factors f w is the finite width correction factor k m s are stress concentration factors p m and p b are the primary membrane and bending stresses respectively and q m and q b are the secondary membrane and bending stresses respectively the detailed expressions of these parameters for the cases analysed in this work i e surface cracks in a cylinder with straight or semi circular crack fronts are given in the appendix regarding numerical simulations both the conventional finite element method fem and the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software have been used in the conventional fem the crack is modelled by a seam and the program calculates the potential energy released along the crack front during its propagation per unit area by means of contour integrals j integral according to the following equation see fig 1 5 j γ w n 1 u i x 1 σ i j n j d s where w is the elastic strain energy density σ i j n j is the traction vector u i the displacement vector and γ is a contour traversed in a counter clockwise direction starting at the bottom surface of the crack and ending at any point on the top surface of the crack j is path independent when contours are taken around the crack tip rice 1968 the contour integral j is equivalent to the potential energy release rate g associated with crack growth atkinson and eshelby 1968 so it is possible to relate it to the stress intensity factors sifs in the case of linear elasticity by means of the following equation 6 j g 1 ν 2 e k i 2 k i i 2 1 ν e k i i i 2 where e is the young s modulus ν is the poisson s ratio and k i k ii and k iii are the sifs for mode i mode ii and mode iii of fracture respectively there are some previous contributions reported in the literature where the sifs were successfully computed for sharp and blunt v notches even with coarse meshes based on the averaged strain energy density sed lazzarin et al 2008 2010 the sed criterion is based on the precise definition of the control volume where the strain energy is averaged in berto and lazzarin 2014 a review of the analytical background of the sed approach is presented for different loading modes the described criteria are compared and some remarks useful for future applications in this area are reported the contour integral method j integral presents a drawback when different fracture modes coexist along the crack front since it is not possible to obtain the specific sifs values for each one therefore in this section it has been considered that only fracture mode i acts the sifs have been calculated using the following equation 7 j 1 ν 2 e k i 2 where k i is the sif value for mode i of deformation e is the young s modulus and ν is the poisson s ratio besides the extended finite element method xfem was first introduced by belytschko and black 1999 it is an extension of the conventional finite element method based on the concept of partition of unity suggested by melenk and babuska 1996 it has the advantage that its formulation extends the piecewise polynomial function space of conventional finite element methods with extra enrichment functions at the crack tip that represent the stress singularity these enrichment functions provide sifs values directly for the different fracture modes for an isotropic linear elastic material these enrichment functions typically consist of two sets of functions first a discontinuous heaviside function is used to represent the displacement jump across crack surfaces second a set of near tip asymptotic functions is used to model the stress singularity around the crack tip both the crack tip enrichment and the heaviside function are multiplied by the conventional finite element shape functions the xfem displacement interpolation function with the partition of unity enrichment is 8 u x i ε n n i x u i h x a i α 1 4 f α x b i α where n i x are the usual nodal shape functions u i is the conventional nodal displacement vector associated with the continuous part of the model the second term is the product of the nodal enriched degree of freedom vector a i and the heaviside function h x finally the third term is the product of the nodal enriched degree of freedom vector b i α and the associated elastic asymptotic crack tip functions f α x see eq 10 below thus the first term on the right hand side applies to all nodes in the model the second term applies to the nodes whose shape function is cut by crack surfaces and the third term is applied only to nodes whose shape function is cut by the crack tip the heaviside function accounts for the displacement jump across the crack surfaces here x is an integration gauss point x is the closest point to x on the crack face n is the unit normal to the crack at x and r θ denote a polar coordinate system located at the crack tip θ 0 is tangent to the crack see fig 2 9 h x 1 if x x n 0 1 otherwise finally the asymptotic crack functions f α x for an isotropic and linear elastic material are given by 10 f α x α 1 4 r sin θ 2 r cos θ 2 r sin θ sin θ 2 r sin θ cos θ 2 in contrast to the conventional finite element method this enriched formulation allows the crack to be modelled independently of the mesh since the asymptotic elastic solution associated to the sifs is incorporated directly to the interpolation scheme it can be used to perform contour integral evaluations for an arbitrary stationary crack without the need for refining the mesh around the crack tip in addition it allows simulating crack initiation and propagation of a discrete crack along an arbitrary solution dependent path without the need of re meshing the crack each time it grows 2 1 cylinder with uniaxial load first a cracked cylinder loaded uniaxially has been studied see fig 3 this study has been used to determine the correlation between analytical and numerical results for a simple case as well as to establish the most suited finite element model configuration in fig 3 f is the applied load l is the length of the cylinder and a is depth of the crack table 1 summarizes the material parameters the geometry and the loading condition used in all the finite element calculations cylinder length crack shape and depth and boundary conditions will vary in the different simulations although a semi elliptical crack is known as a common crack type for round bars a semi circular crack and a straight crack have been considered extreme cases of the semi elliptical crack commonly cracks initiate from stress rising pits in mooring chains which have a semispherical shape then due to the sifs distribution along the crack front the cracks grow adopting a straight crack front for each crack geometry three different depths 10 mm 25 mm and 50 mm and two different load configurations have been studied in the first configuration the load f has been applied in a distributed way on the surfaces of the ends of the cylinder the total resultant force at each end equals f which can move and rotate freely in the second configuration the load f has been applied as a point load restricting the movement of the ends of the cylinder only in the direction of the load finally different lengths of the cylinder 200 1000 2000 5000 and 10000 mm have been studied in order to evaluate its influence on the results the equations of the bs for sifs calculation in straight and semi circular crack geometries in cylindrical sections are single parameter it is only necessary to know the ratio a r of the crack depth a to the section s radius r note that the crack is assumed to have a radius equal to the depth a it should be noticed that the bs guide provides closed form expressions for the sifs obtained by fitting to numerical solutions developed by a number of authors when solutions are available for different points along the crack front the bs fitting lies between the maximum and minimum sif values in particular in the case of a semi circular crack the highest value is located at the free edge while in the case of a straight crack it is located at the centre of the crack front as will be shown later the particularization of the general equations 2 4 for straight and semi circular crack fronts can be found in the bs7910 2013 bs 7910 2015 regarding numerical simulations two different approaches have been used for crack insertion in the finite element model in order to compare both results the first approach has been through a seam crack while the second has been through the extended finite element method xfem for seam crack modelling it is necessary to select the surface that represents the faces of the crack and to define the crack front as well as to select the first contour integral see figs 4 and 5 the modelling of the xfem crack is shown in fig 6 table 2 and table 3 compare the results for different load configurations in the case of 50 mm semi circular crack and 50 mm straight crack respectively there is some dispersion in the results obtained by xfem specifically in those values obtained in the free edges of the crack depending on the chosen values different contours around the crack the results can vary around 5 mpa m the difficulty to define the sifs close to the free surfaces in three dimensional problems due to 3d effects where the boundary conditions that lead to the definition of the sifs are not satisfied is well known in academy see for instance the contributions done by campagnolo et al 2015 berto et al berto and campagnolo 2015 marangon et al 2015 and kotousov et al 2013 but this has not been accounted for in this work as can be seen the best configuration is clearly the one with the distributed load and free movement the configuration with the point load and restricted movement is strongly dependent on the length of the cylinder and tends to the same result as the other configuration as the cylinder becomes longer therefore from now on the first configuration with the distributed load and free movement will be used besides sif distribution along the crack front for the cases of 50 mm semi circular crack and 50 mm straight crack are shown in fig 7 as mentioned above in the case of a semi circular crack the highest sif is located at the free edges while in the case of a straight crack this maximum is at the central point of the crack front the numerical analytical correlation for different crack geometries and crack depths is shown in table 4 there is an excellent correlation between the two numerical approaches both for the maximum and minimum values of the sif along the crack front regarding the comparison between the numerical solutions and the analytical estimates provided by the fitting expressions used in bs7910 note that in all cases the latter estimates are between the maximum and minimum values computed with the two numerical methods this is in accordance with the procedure followed to generate the bs expressions as explained above 2 2 real mooring chain once the results obtained by different methods have been satisfactorily contrasted for the simple case of the cylinder at the same time as the correct load configuration has been established the case of a real mooring chain has been studied the mooring chains of offshore structures are defined by their diameter and grade of material the diameters can range from 70 mm to 220 mm and material grades are classified from r3 to r6 according to their ultimate strength 690 mpa for r3 and 1100 mpa for r6 with these data the chain is identified and other parameters are determined such as the geometry dimensions etc of all of them the proof load and the breaking load are of special interest for calculating the sifs on the one hand the proof load is part of the manufacturing process and is used to check the state of the welding section as well as to adapt the geometry of the chain to its final dimensions as a consequence the process generates a residual stress field in the component on the other hand the breaking load is the maximum load that a chain must hold and therefore taking into account the different safety coefficients it defines the maximum load the component will hold during its life in service in this case the sifs have been calculated for a chain of 165 mm of diameter the length and width are 990 mm 6 times the diameter and 553 mm 3 35 times the diameter respectively and a material grade of r5 where the proof load and the breaking load are 18699 kn and 26833 kn respectively the working load has been set at 5366 6 kn 20 of the breaking load fig 8 shows the distribution of the maximum principal stresses when the chain is axially subjected to the working load and identifies the locations where the stress concentration is maximum called the hot spots the three main locations are the outer part of the crown the inside of the bend and the inner part of the straight zone the analysis has been performed in six different ways in order to assess the influence of the residual stresses and the material grade in the first two cases the proof load has been eliminated and only the working load has been applied assuming an elastic material case 1 or an elastic plastic material case 2 in the rest of the cases both loads have been applied proof load subsequent unloading and working load the proof load has been simulated assuming an elastic plastic material and the residual stresses resulting from this analysis have been applied as an initial condition for the working load in case 3 and case 4 the proof load is applied without a crack in the model while in case 5 and case 6 the proof load is applied with a crack already inserted in the model actually these latter cases are not realistic since there are inspection processes before and after the proof load therefore at the time that the proof load is applied and when the chain leaves the factory it is free of defects then it is during its use in service when cracks initiate by fatigue and can propagate to a depth like those studied the working load is always applied with the crack already inserted in the model the only difference between case 3 and case 4 and between case 5 and case 6 is the type of material used for the working load being linear elastic for case 3 and case 5 and elastic plastic for case 4 and case 6 the elastic plastic behaviour of the material has been defined according to a ramberg osgood hardening law equation 11 the material parameters used in the simulations are shown in table 5 11 ε σ e α σ e σ σ 0 n 1 where ε is the strain σ is the stress e is the young s modulus σ0 is the yield strength and α and n are constants that depend on the material for the calculation of sifs the crown and bend have been selected as prospective cracked zones as they are the locations with the highest stresses in each of them two different cracks have been located see fig 9 the selected crack depths represent intermediate states during the fatigue process of the links due to the low working load of the chains with respect to their breaking strength cracks grow to a higher depth before final failure examples of this can be found in ref fernández et al 2014 the ni604 r00 fatigue of top chain of mooring lines due to in plane and out of plane bending marine offshore 2014 specifies that at least three chain links have to be considered one for analysis a half for applying the load and another half as a retaining component the code is valid for top chain links attached to the structure where the loads are applied in multiaxial directions however in our study the link is supposed to be in the catenary where it works under pure tension therefore a simplified model has been considered for the numerical simulations and only the contact between two half chains has been modelled taking advantage of symmetry see fig 10 the numerical simulations were also performed with two quarter chains but as the crack was inside or near the plane of symmetry numerical results were greatly affected the chains in seawater have been assigned a normal hard contact and a friction penalty coefficient of 0 3 based on the work by rampi et al 2016 and jean et al 2005 see fig 11 the default coulomb friction model has been used this relates the maximum allowable frictional shear stress across an interface to the contact pressure between the contacting bodies two contacting surfaces can carry shear stresses up to a certain magnitude at which sliding of the surfaces starts the ratio of the critical shear stress to the contact pressure is known as the coefficient of friction finally the mesh has been refined in the area where the crack has been inserted see figs 12 and 13 finally the boundary conditions and load application in the finite element model are shown in fig 14 fig 15 shows the comparison between the von mises stress distribution obtained with elastic material and working load and the one that remains after the complete case elastic plastic material proof load unloading and working load in addition fig 16 shows the von mises stress field residual stresses remaining in the component after the proof load and the subsequent unloading up to 100 n before applying the working load in this case the locations of the hot spots exhibit compressive residual stresses specifically in the crown zone see fig 17 highlighting the importance of the proof load in the stress field of the chain during its use in service a more detailed study of these stress distributions is presented in fig 18 for the crown zone of the chain and in fig 19 for the bend zone of the chain the abscissa of fig 18 represents the distance travelled along the middle line of the section of the crown from the external surface where the hot spot is localized to the inner zone where the link contacts its adjacent as a consequence of the residual stresses caused by the proof load the stress in the middle line of the section varies it shape as the new applied load increases in the absence of the new applied load represented by 0 of the proof load denoted 0 pl in the inset of the figure the stresses are compressive in the external zone and tensile in the contact zone besides when the working load is approximately 29 of the proof load the stresses are practically zero in the external zone and close to zero in the contact region above that load tensile stresses appear in the external zone and compressive stresses in the contact area fig 19 shows the same study for the bend zone the abscissa being the distance travelled by the middle line of the section from the hot spot point to the diametrically opposite point of the section in the bend zone there is also a transition point in the hot spot where the compressive stresses become tensile stresses however in the external zone distance of 165 mm the component always works under compressive stresses the numerical results obtained for the different load cases and material properties by means of contour integrals and by the xfem are shown in tables 6 8 and figs 20 23 the model with an 80 mm straight crack in the crown and elastic plastic material did not converge in the xfem simulation in general the results obtained by the seam crack modelling are more consistent than those obtained by the xfem crack modelling regarding the influence of the elastic plastic material this is only observed in the calculations carried out by means of contour integrals seam crack being its influence virtually null in the calculations carried out by the xfem technique since only isotropic elastic materials are supported for a stationary crack simulia user assistance 2018 in this method it is observed that the sifs are lower for the 40 mm semi circular crack in both zones with elastic plastic material specifically in the corners of the crack front where the stresses are higher its influence on the sifs for the 80 mm straight cracks are much smaller regarding the influence of the residual stresses there are no major changes in the results obtained for the cracks in the bend zone while stresses are considerably reduced for the 40 mm semi circular crack in the crown zone since the compressive residual stresses are considerably higher in this area however no clear trend is observed for the results obtained for the 80 mm straight crack in the crown zone this may be caused by the proximity of the crack to the region of residual stresses generated by the contact between both links see fig 24 finally the simulations in which the test load has been applied with the crack already inserted in the model provide values of sifs much lower than in the rest of the cases for the sif calculations based on the formulations of the bs7910 the stresses acting on the middle line where the crack is located have been used without considering the stresses in the rest of the section to this purpose the stresses on the middle line are linearized resulting in the membrane and bending stresses which are introduced into the bs formulations to obtain the sifs sif results for different crack geometries with elastic material are shown in table 9 the corresponding sif values for the case of elastic plastic material are shown in table 10 unlike the case of the cylinder where the solutions provided by the bs guide are in good agreement with the numerical results in the case of actual chains with complex geometries and subject to complex stress fields the closed form expressions of the bs guide differ substantially from the more precise numerical solutions see tables 6 8 and tables 9 and 10 3 comparison with experimental results over the last few years vicinay has performed intensive research work on the fatigue phenomenon in real mooring chains fernández et al 2014 by extracting the last stage of these fatigue tests actual chain failure data can be obtained which allows the validation of the developed simulation methodology for this purpose the sifs along the crack front at the moment of failure and the toughness of the material have been compared three fatigue tests have been carried out with different chain diameters and crack locations bend and crown for these tests the geometry loads and crack depths are known so the stress intensity factors can be calculated the tests carried out are the following test 1 165 mm r5 chain with a crack of 120 mm depth in the bend see fig 25 test 2 120 mm r5 chain with a crack of 74 mm depth in the bend test 3 146 mm r4 chain with a crack of 100 mm depth in the crown the toughness of both r4 and r5 materials has been obtained from the standards for offshore mooring chain dnvgl cp 0237 2018 the charpy v notch and ctod requirements for r4 and r5 base material have been converted to fracture toughness in terms of kmat according to the bs7910 guide bs 7910 2015 as a result the expected toughness for r4 and r5 materials is between 100 and 270 mpa m three new fe models have been created to carry out the validation the simulation for each model consists of two different steps proof load without crack in order to obtain the residual stress field rupture limit with the crack in order to calculate the sifs table 11 includes the results of the calculations where the stress intensity factors in the centre of the crack are shown the average working stress for the three tests was between 79 5 mpa and 119 mpa which is approximately the 8 12 of the elastic limit of the materials considering that fatigue without plastic collapse was the main failure mechanism therefore the resulting sifs can be considered a good estimate of the toughness of the materials for their respective thicknesses the resulting stress intensity factors range from 179 to 227 mpa m which is between the scatter of 100 270 mpa m expected for these materials 4 conclusions based on the obtained results the following conclusions can be derived the analytical solutions described in the bs7910 have been successfully reproduced by finite element calculations fem and xfem for a case of simple geometry and loading uniaxially loaded cracked cylinder the analytical solutions described in the bs7910 could not be adapted to the calculations of sifs in mooring chains due to the complexity of the operating stress fields which cannot be well approximated by a combination of uniform and bending stresses a specific methodology has been developed and validated for the calculations of stress intensity factors sifs in real mooring chains that takes into account the residual stresses induced in the last stage of the manufacturing process the best results are the ones obtained by means of contour integrals seam crack modelling for the cases in which the test load is simulated with an elastic plastic material description without crack and then the working load is applied with the crack already inserted in the fe model and with the residual stresses induced in the previous analysis as an initial condition cases 3 and 4 in the text regarding xfem there is some dispersion in the results therefore the results justify the use of numerical methods and specifically the use of contour integrals seam crack modelling for the calculation of sifs in mooring chains the validated methodology and the calculated sifs can be used for mooring integrity management the developed methodology enables the evaluation of the integrity and reliability of the component as well as the programming of inspection and maintenance periods in addition the obtained results can be used to assess crack growth and the remaining life of the moorings based on fatigue crack propagation paris type laws for this purpose a numerical integration of the paris law by blocks can be carried out to calculate the number of cycles needed to propagate a crack from a certain initial length to another under a variable load this has been performed for the assessment of real chain ibekwe et al 2018 moreover the sifs for other crack dimensions that represent different fatigue stages can be computed using the developed methodology to improve the accuracy of the results in addition the xfem based lefm approach implemented in the abaqus software can be used to asses fatigue crack growth furthermore the capabilities of this approach to simulate fatigue crack growth in complex stress fields using the paris law have already been validated bergara et al 2017 2019 credit authorship contribution statement a bergara conceptualization

21583,the main objective of this work has been the validation of a methodology to calculate the stress intensity factors sifs in prospective cracks of offshore mooring chains under service conditions for this purpose the analytic methods described in the bs7910 have been compared with those calculated by the conventional finite element method fem by means of contour integrals and by the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software first an axially loaded cylinder has been studied in order to determine the correlation between different methods for a simple case as well as to establish the most suited finite element methodology then the real case of a mooring chain has been studied including the residual stresses induced in the manufacturing process finally numerical simulations and experimental results have been compared results justify the use of numerical methods specifically the use of contour integrals for the calculation of stress intensity factors sifs in offshore mooring chains keywords fracture stress intensity factors sifs extended finite element method xfem offshore mooring chains residual stresses 1 introduction offshore mooring chains are used to anchor petroleum platforms that work permanently for 20 40 years a typical mooring line is composed of chain sections at their ends and a wire section in the middle furthermore chains are selected for the ends because these are the most critical locations regarding structural integrity it is in the area of waves and in the area of contact with the ocean floor where the greatest loads corrosion phenomena fatigue and wear are concentrated besides the oil and gas growing demand causes the offshore industry to move increasingly towards more hostile environments and more aggressive situations greater depths the presence of hurricanes arctic temperatures etc in this context with long term projects and aggressive conditions it is very important to ensure the structural integrity of the entire mooring line in recent years several investigations have been carried out about the frequency of failures their locations main causes inspection and certification needs brown et al 2010 ma et al 2013 gordon et al 2014 fontaine et al 2014 these studies conclude that fatigue and corrosion are the main degradation phenomena that affect the structural integrity of mooring chains fracture mechanics provides a tool for assessing the criticality of flaws in structures linear elastic fracture mechanics lefm is the basic theory of fracture it was originated by griffith 1921 and completed by irwin 1957 the theory characterizes the stress field around cracks and provides analytical solutions to quantify these stress fields in general crack growth behaviour is evaluated using analytical methods based on approximated formulations and also via numerical methods that use the finite element analysis in this work both analytical and numerical methods have been used for the calculation of stress intensity factors sifs the solutions proposed by the british standard bs7910 2013 have been compared with those calculated using the conventional finite element method fem by means of contour integrals and alternatively using the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software finally the results obtained by different methods have been compared therefore the main contribution of the paper is the validation of a methodology to calculate the stress intensity factors sifs in prospective cracks of offshore mooring chains under service conditions which is not currently available in literature 2 calculation of stress intensity factors in this section the analytical solutions described in bs7910 have been compared with those based on finite element methods for this purpose different crack geometries and load configurations have been studied first an axially loaded cylinder has been evaluated in order to determine the correlation between analytical and numerical results for a simple case as well as to establish the most appropriate finite element model configuration then the real case of a mooring chain has been studied including the residual stresses induced in the last manufacturing step the bs7910 2013 bs 7910 2015 which is the guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures is a commonly accepted standard in the offshore industry even though it has been proven that other sif solutions give more accurate results on round bars toribio et al 2009 this guide indicates in its annex m the equations for the calculation of sifs the stress intensity factor sif in the bs7910 is calculated as 1 k i y σ π a with a division between primary and secondary geometric factors 2 y σ y σ p y σ s 3 y σ p m f w k t m m k m m m p m k t b m k b m b p b k m 1 p m 4 y σ s m m q m m b q b where k i is the sif the m s are geometric factors f w is the finite width correction factor k m s are stress concentration factors p m and p b are the primary membrane and bending stresses respectively and q m and q b are the secondary membrane and bending stresses respectively the detailed expressions of these parameters for the cases analysed in this work i e surface cracks in a cylinder with straight or semi circular crack fronts are given in the appendix regarding numerical simulations both the conventional finite element method fem and the extended finite element method xfem implemented in the abaqus 2018 software have been used in the conventional fem the crack is modelled by a seam and the program calculates the potential energy released along the crack front during its propagation per unit area by means of contour integrals j integral according to the following equation see fig 1 5 j γ w n 1 u i x 1 σ i j n j d s where w is the elastic strain energy density σ i j n j is the traction vector u i the displacement vector and γ is a contour traversed in a counter clockwise direction starting at the bottom surface of the crack and ending at any point on the top surface of the crack j is path independent when contours are taken around the crack tip rice 1968 the contour integral j is equivalent to the potential energy release rate g associated with crack growth atkinson and eshelby 1968 so it is possible to relate it to the stress intensity factors sifs in the case of linear elasticity by means of the following equation 6 j g 1 ν 2 e k i 2 k i i 2 1 ν e k i i i 2 where e is the young s modulus ν is the poisson s ratio and k i k ii and k iii are the sifs for mode i mode ii and mode iii of fracture respectively there are some previous contributions reported in the literature where the sifs were successfully computed for sharp and blunt v notches even with coarse meshes based on the averaged strain energy density sed lazzarin et al 2008 2010 the sed criterion is based on the precise definition of the control volume where the strain energy is averaged in berto and lazzarin 2014 a review of the analytical background of the sed approach is presented for different loading modes the described criteria are compared and some remarks useful for future applications in this area are reported the contour integral method j integral presents a drawback when different fracture modes coexist along the crack front since it is not possible to obtain the specific sifs values for each one therefore in this section it has been considered that only fracture mode i acts the sifs have been calculated using the following equation 7 j 1 ν 2 e k i 2 where k i is the sif value for mode i of deformation e is the young s modulus and ν is the poisson s ratio besides the extended finite element method xfem was first introduced by belytschko and black 1999 it is an extension of the conventional finite element method based on the concept of partition of unity suggested by melenk and babuska 1996 it has the advantage that its formulation extends the piecewise polynomial function space of conventional finite element methods with extra enrichment functions at the crack tip that represent the stress singularity these enrichment functions provide sifs values directly for the different fracture modes for an isotropic linear elastic material these enrichment functions typically consist of two sets of functions first a discontinuous heaviside function is used to represent the displacement jump across crack surfaces second a set of near tip asymptotic functions is used to model the stress singularity around the crack tip both the crack tip enrichment and the heaviside function are multiplied by the conventional finite element shape functions the xfem displacement interpolation function with the partition of unity enrichment is 8 u x i ε n n i x u i h x a i α 1 4 f α x b i α where n i x are the usual nodal shape functions u i is the conventional nodal displacement vector associated with the continuous part of the model the second term is the product of the nodal enriched degree of freedom vector a i and the heaviside function h x finally the third term is the product of the nodal enriched degree of freedom vector b i α and the associated elastic asymptotic crack tip functions f α x see eq 10 below thus the first term on the right hand side applies to all nodes in the model the second term applies to the nodes whose shape function is cut by crack surfaces and the third term is applied only to nodes whose shape function is cut by the crack tip the heaviside function accounts for the displacement jump across the crack surfaces here x is an integration gauss point x is the closest point to x on the crack face n is the unit normal to the crack at x and r θ denote a polar coordinate system located at the crack tip θ 0 is tangent to the crack see fig 2 9 h x 1 if x x n 0 1 otherwise finally the asymptotic crack functions f α x for an isotropic and linear elastic material are given by 10 f α x α 1 4 r sin θ 2 r cos θ 2 r sin θ sin θ 2 r sin θ cos θ 2 in contrast to the conventional finite element method this enriched formulation allows the crack to be modelled independently of the mesh since the asymptotic elastic solution associated to the sifs is incorporated directly to the interpolation scheme it can be used to perform contour integral evaluations for an arbitrary stationary crack without the need for refining the mesh around the crack tip in addition it allows simulating crack initiation and propagation of a discrete crack along an arbitrary solution dependent path without the need of re meshing the crack each time it grows 2 1 cylinder with uniaxial load first a cracked cylinder loaded uniaxially has been studied see fig 3 this study has been used to determine the correlation between analytical and numerical results for a simple case as well as to establish the most suited finite element model configuration in fig 3 f is the applied load l is the length of the cylinder and a is depth of the crack table 1 summarizes the material parameters the geometry and the loading condition used in all the finite element calculations cylinder length crack shape and depth and boundary conditions will vary in the different simulations although a semi elliptical crack is known as a common crack type for round bars a semi circular crack and a straight crack have been considered extreme cases of the semi elliptical crack commonly cracks initiate from stress rising pits in mooring chains which have a semispherical shape then due to the sifs distribution along the crack front the cracks grow adopting a straight crack front for each crack geometry three different depths 10 mm 25 mm and 50 mm and two different load configurations have been studied in the first configuration the load f has been applied in a distributed way on the surfaces of the ends of the cylinder the total resultant force at each end equals f which can move and rotate freely in the second configuration the load f has been applied as a point load restricting the movement of the ends of the cylinder only in the direction of the load finally different lengths of the cylinder 200 1000 2000 5000 and 10000 mm have been studied in order to evaluate its influence on the results the equations of the bs for sifs calculation in straight and semi circular crack geometries in cylindrical sections are single parameter it is only necessary to know the ratio a r of the crack depth a to the section s radius r note that the crack is assumed to have a radius equal to the depth a it should be noticed that the bs guide provides closed form expressions for the sifs obtained by fitting to numerical solutions developed by a number of authors when solutions are available for different points along the crack front the bs fitting lies between the maximum and minimum sif values in particular in the case of a semi circular crack the highest value is located at the free edge while in the case of a straight crack it is located at the centre of the crack front as will be shown later the particularization of the general equations 2 4 for straight and semi circular crack fronts can be found in the bs7910 2013 bs 7910 2015 regarding numerical simulations two different approaches have been used for crack insertion in the finite element model in order to compare both results the first approach has been through a seam crack while the second has been through the extended finite element method xfem for seam crack modelling it is necessary to select the surface that represents the faces of the crack and to define the crack front as well as to select the first contour integral see figs 4 and 5 the modelling of the xfem crack is shown in fig 6 table 2 and table 3 compare the results for different load configurations in the case of 50 mm semi circular crack and 50 mm straight crack respectively there is some dispersion in the results obtained by xfem specifically in those values obtained in the free edges of the crack depending on the chosen values different contours around the crack the results can vary around 5 mpa m the difficulty to define the sifs close to the free surfaces in three dimensional problems due to 3d effects where the boundary conditions that lead to the definition of the sifs are not satisfied is well known in academy see for instance the contributions done by campagnolo et al 2015 berto et al berto and campagnolo 2015 marangon et al 2015 and kotousov et al 2013 but this has not been accounted for in this work as can be seen the best configuration is clearly the one with the distributed load and free movement the configuration with the point load and restricted movement is strongly dependent on the length of the cylinder and tends to the same result as the other configuration as the cylinder becomes longer therefore from now on the first configuration with the distributed load and free movement will be used besides sif distribution along the crack front for the cases of 50 mm semi circular crack and 50 mm straight crack are shown in fig 7 as mentioned above in the case of a semi circular crack the highest sif is located at the free edges while in the case of a straight crack this maximum is at the central point of the crack front the numerical analytical correlation for different crack geometries and crack depths is shown in table 4 there is an excellent correlation between the two numerical approaches both for the maximum and minimum values of the sif along the crack front regarding the comparison between the numerical solutions and the analytical estimates provided by the fitting expressions used in bs7910 note that in all cases the latter estimates are between the maximum and minimum values computed with the two numerical methods this is in accordance with the procedure followed to generate the bs expressions as explained above 2 2 real mooring chain once the results obtained by different methods have been satisfactorily contrasted for the simple case of the cylinder at the same time as the correct load configuration has been established the case of a real mooring chain has been studied the mooring chains of offshore structures are defined by their diameter and grade of material the diameters can range from 70 mm to 220 mm and material grades are classified from r3 to r6 according to their ultimate strength 690 mpa for r3 and 1100 mpa for r6 with these data the chain is identified and other parameters are determined such as the geometry dimensions etc of all of them the proof load and the breaking load are of special interest for calculating the sifs on the one hand the proof load is part of the manufacturing process and is used to check the state of the welding section as well as to adapt the geometry of the chain to its final dimensions as a consequence the process generates a residual stress field in the component on the other hand the breaking load is the maximum load that a chain must hold and therefore taking into account the different safety coefficients it defines the maximum load the component will hold during its life in service in this case the sifs have been calculated for a chain of 165 mm of diameter the length and width are 990 mm 6 times the diameter and 553 mm 3 35 times the diameter respectively and a material grade of r5 where the proof load and the breaking load are 18699 kn and 26833 kn respectively the working load has been set at 5366 6 kn 20 of the breaking load fig 8 shows the distribution of the maximum principal stresses when the chain is axially subjected to the working load and identifies the locations where the stress concentration is maximum called the hot spots the three main locations are the outer part of the crown the inside of the bend and the inner part of the straight zone the analysis has been performed in six different ways in order to assess the influence of the residual stresses and the material grade in the first two cases the proof load has been eliminated and only the working load has been applied assuming an elastic material case 1 or an elastic plastic material case 2 in the rest of the cases both loads have been applied proof load subsequent unloading and working load the proof load has been simulated assuming an elastic plastic material and the residual stresses resulting from this analysis have been applied as an initial condition for the working load in case 3 and case 4 the proof load is applied without a crack in the model while in case 5 and case 6 the proof load is applied with a crack already inserted in the model actually these latter cases are not realistic since there are inspection processes before and after the proof load therefore at the time that the proof load is applied and when the chain leaves the factory it is free of defects then it is during its use in service when cracks initiate by fatigue and can propagate to a depth like those studied the working load is always applied with the crack already inserted in the model the only difference between case 3 and case 4 and between case 5 and case 6 is the type of material used for the working load being linear elastic for case 3 and case 5 and elastic plastic for case 4 and case 6 the elastic plastic behaviour of the material has been defined according to a ramberg osgood hardening law equation 11 the material parameters used in the simulations are shown in table 5 11 ε σ e α σ e σ σ 0 n 1 where ε is the strain σ is the stress e is the young s modulus σ0 is the yield strength and α and n are constants that depend on the material for the calculation of sifs the crown and bend have been selected as prospective cracked zones as they are the locations with the highest stresses in each of them two different cracks have been located see fig 9 the selected crack depths represent intermediate states during the fatigue process of the links due to the low working load of the chains with respect to their breaking strength cracks grow to a higher depth before final failure examples of this can be found in ref fernández et al 2014 the ni604 r00 fatigue of top chain of mooring lines due to in plane and out of plane bending marine offshore 2014 specifies that at least three chain links have to be considered one for analysis a half for applying the load and another half as a retaining component the code is valid for top chain links attached to the structure where the loads are applied in multiaxial directions however in our study the link is supposed to be in the catenary where it works under pure tension therefore a simplified model has been considered for the numerical simulations and only the contact between two half chains has been modelled taking advantage of symmetry see fig 10 the numerical simulations were also performed with two quarter chains but as the crack was inside or near the plane of symmetry numerical results were greatly affected the chains in seawater have been assigned a normal hard contact and a friction penalty coefficient of 0 3 based on the work by rampi et al 2016 and jean et al 2005 see fig 11 the default coulomb friction model has been used this relates the maximum allowable frictional shear stress across an interface to the contact pressure between the contacting bodies two contacting surfaces can carry shear stresses up to a certain magnitude at which sliding of the surfaces starts the ratio of the critical shear stress to the contact pressure is known as the coefficient of friction finally the mesh has been refined in the area where the crack has been inserted see figs 12 and 13 finally the boundary conditions and load application in the finite element model are shown in fig 14 fig 15 shows the comparison between the von mises stress distribution obtained with elastic material and working load and the one that remains after the complete case elastic plastic material proof load unloading and working load in addition fig 16 shows the von mises stress field residual stresses remaining in the component after the proof load and the subsequent unloading up to 100 n before applying the working load in this case the locations of the hot spots exhibit compressive residual stresses specifically in the crown zone see fig 17 highlighting the importance of the proof load in the stress field of the chain during its use in service a more detailed study of these stress distributions is presented in fig 18 for the crown zone of the chain and in fig 19 for the bend zone of the chain the abscissa of fig 18 represents the distance travelled along the middle line of the section of the crown from the external surface where the hot spot is localized to the inner zone where the link contacts its adjacent as a consequence of the residual stresses caused by the proof load the stress in the middle line of the section varies it shape as the new applied load increases in the absence of the new applied load represented by 0 of the proof load denoted 0 pl in the inset of the figure the stresses are compressive in the external zone and tensile in the contact zone besides when the working load is approximately 29 of the proof load the stresses are practically zero in the external zone and close to zero in the contact region above that load tensile stresses appear in the external zone and compressive stresses in the contact area fig 19 shows the same study for the bend zone the abscissa being the distance travelled by the middle line of the section from the hot spot point to the diametrically opposite point of the section in the bend zone there is also a transition point in the hot spot where the compressive stresses become tensile stresses however in the external zone distance of 165 mm the component always works under compressive stresses the numerical results obtained for the different load cases and material properties by means of contour integrals and by the xfem are shown in tables 6 8 and figs 20 23 the model with an 80 mm straight crack in the crown and elastic plastic material did not converge in the xfem simulation in general the results obtained by the seam crack modelling are more consistent than those obtained by the xfem crack modelling regarding the influence of the elastic plastic material this is only observed in the calculations carried out by means of contour integrals seam crack being its influence virtually null in the calculations carried out by the xfem technique since only isotropic elastic materials are supported for a stationary crack simulia user assistance 2018 in this method it is observed that the sifs are lower for the 40 mm semi circular crack in both zones with elastic plastic material specifically in the corners of the crack front where the stresses are higher its influence on the sifs for the 80 mm straight cracks are much smaller regarding the influence of the residual stresses there are no major changes in the results obtained for the cracks in the bend zone while stresses are considerably reduced for the 40 mm semi circular crack in the crown zone since the compressive residual stresses are considerably higher in this area however no clear trend is observed for the results obtained for the 80 mm straight crack in the crown zone this may be caused by the proximity of the crack to the region of residual stresses generated by the contact between both links see fig 24 finally the simulations in which the test load has been applied with the crack already inserted in the model provide values of sifs much lower than in the rest of the cases for the sif calculations based on the formulations of the bs7910 the stresses acting on the middle line where the crack is located have been used without considering the stresses in the rest of the section to this purpose the stresses on the middle line are linearized resulting in the membrane and bending stresses which are introduced into the bs formulations to obtain the sifs sif results for different crack geometries with elastic material are shown in table 9 the corresponding sif values for the case of elastic plastic material are shown in table 10 unlike the case of the cylinder where the solutions provided by the bs guide are in good agreement with the numerical results in the case of actual chains with complex geometries and subject to complex stress fields the closed form expressions of the bs guide differ substantially from the more precise numerical solutions see tables 6 8 and tables 9 and 10 3 comparison with experimental results over the last few years vicinay has performed intensive research work on the fatigue phenomenon in real mooring chains fernández et al 2014 by extracting the last stage of these fatigue tests actual chain failure data can be obtained which allows the validation of the developed simulation methodology for this purpose the sifs along the crack front at the moment of failure and the toughness of the material have been compared three fatigue tests have been carried out with different chain diameters and crack locations bend and crown for these tests the geometry loads and crack depths are known so the stress intensity factors can be calculated the tests carried out are the following test 1 165 mm r5 chain with a crack of 120 mm depth in the bend see fig 25 test 2 120 mm r5 chain with a crack of 74 mm depth in the bend test 3 146 mm r4 chain with a crack of 100 mm depth in the crown the toughness of both r4 and r5 materials has been obtained from the standards for offshore mooring chain dnvgl cp 0237 2018 the charpy v notch and ctod requirements for r4 and r5 base material have been converted to fracture toughness in terms of kmat according to the bs7910 guide bs 7910 2015 as a result the expected toughness for r4 and r5 materials is between 100 and 270 mpa m three new fe models have been created to carry out the validation the simulation for each model consists of two different steps proof load without crack in order to obtain the residual stress field rupture limit with the crack in order to calculate the sifs table 11 includes the results of the calculations where the stress intensity factors in the centre of the crack are shown the average working stress for the three tests was between 79 5 mpa and 119 mpa which is approximately the 8 12 of the elastic limit of the materials considering that fatigue without plastic collapse was the main failure mechanism therefore the resulting sifs can be considered a good estimate of the toughness of the materials for their respective thicknesses the resulting stress intensity factors range from 179 to 227 mpa m which is between the scatter of 100 270 mpa m expected for these materials 4 conclusions based on the obtained results the following conclusions can be derived the analytical solutions described in the bs7910 have been successfully reproduced by finite element calculations fem and xfem for a case of simple geometry and loading uniaxially loaded cracked cylinder the analytical solutions described in the bs7910 could not be adapted to the calculations of sifs in mooring chains due to the complexity of the operating stress fields which cannot be well approximated by a combination of uniform and bending stresses a specific methodology has been developed and validated for the calculations of stress intensity factors sifs in real mooring chains that takes into account the residual stresses induced in the last stage of the manufacturing process the best results are the ones obtained by means of contour integrals seam crack modelling for the cases in which the test load is simulated with an elastic plastic material description without crack and then the working load is applied with the crack already inserted in the fe model and with the residual stresses induced in the previous analysis as an initial condition cases 3 and 4 in the text regarding xfem there is some dispersion in the results therefore the results justify the use of numerical methods and specifically the use of contour integrals seam crack modelling for the calculation of sifs in mooring chains the validated methodology and the calculated sifs can be used for mooring integrity management the developed methodology enables the evaluation of the integrity and reliability of the component as well as the programming of inspection and maintenance periods in addition the obtained results can be used to assess crack growth and the remaining life of the moorings based on fatigue crack propagation paris type laws for this purpose a numerical integration of the paris law by blocks can be carried out to calculate the number of cycles needed to propagate a crack from a certain initial length to another under a variable load this has been performed for the assessment of real chain ibekwe et al 2018 moreover the sifs for other crack dimensions that represent different fatigue stages can be computed using the developed methodology to improve the accuracy of the results in addition the xfem based lefm approach implemented in the abaqus software can be used to asses fatigue crack growth furthermore the capabilities of this approach to simulate fatigue crack growth in complex stress fields using the paris law have already been validated bergara et al 2017 2019 credit authorship contribution statement a bergara conceptualization

21584,in order to achieve accurate identification of structural damages the structure health monitoring shm has been developed rapidly for the jacket platform during the latest decades however the damage detection in structure health monitoring should consider the variation caused by ocean environmental conditions many researchers have shown that the cross correlation function is a good approach in extracting structural characteristics by proceeding it between the vibration responses from various structural locations besides the principal component analysis pca method has been proved effective in eliminating the environmental variations as a consequence this paper proposes an approach in developing a pca based method for identifying the structural state from the feature vector constructed by cross correlation functions the proposed method was firstly applied on detecting the damage of numerical model of a jacket platform in the bohai sea subsequently a scaled model of the studied jacket platform was made and model tests were carried out to validate the proposed method after summarizing the damage detection results of numerical simulations and model tests it can be concluded that the proposed method behaves good in different damage scenarios under the random wave excitations and the accuracy varies with the damage location and severity keywords damage detection structure health monitoring wave excitations cross correlation pca based 1 introduction steel jacket platform is the most common used type of structures in offshore resources exploration wisch 1998 this kind of structure is exposed in harsh environments and unexpected structural damages may occur during their service lives and probably lead the structure into a dangerous situation to ensure the structural safety inspections at regular intervals are therefore mandatory pérez et al 2017 however by now the inspections are always costly and dangerous especially for the underwater cases hillis and courtney 2011 farrar and worden 2013 for such reason vibration based structure health monitoring shm technologies have been developed for offshore structures wang et al 2018 this type of technologies is based on the fundamental theory that damages lead changes of structural stiffness and consequently change its dynamic properties michael et al 2018 since early 1970s serials of approaches have been carried out in developing vibration based shm technologies for damage detections of jacket platforms many approaches have been performed through estimating the modal parameters including the natural frequencies mode shapes modal strain energy and so on doebling et al 1998 roitman et al 2004 minette et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however unlike those land structures these kinds of methods always meet great difficulties in the applications on offshore platforms reliable estimation of the modal parameters essentially lies on the accurate response measurements for all the key positions of the structure i e all the key members or joints for jacket structure li et al 2007 which is hard and unrealistic to be achieved on an offshore platform besides as described in nichols 2003 due to the low frequency nature of sea waves they tend to produce structural response data that are ill suited to a modal based approach on considering the limitation of modal based technique many approaches have been made to explore new damage indicators trendafilova et al 2015 asgarian et al 2016 hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 among which the cross correlation between two measuring positions has attracted extensive attentions serials of applications for structural damage detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of using cross correlation function for example navarro et al 2018 utilized cross correlation function to extract the damage sensitive feature for different kinds of structures the feasibility and sensitivity of their approaches have been validated respectively for different damage scenarios feng et al 2015 developed a damage indicator based on the normalized cross correlation function in detecting the damages of metro tunnel structure subjected to impact excitations li and law 2008 proposed a method to quantify the severity of the damages based on the wavelet packet energy of cross correlation function of the measured acceleration responses in most of these works the cross correlation function is extracted from the response under white noise excitations or impact excitations however the offshore platform is primarily subjected to unstable random wave excitation and thus the damage detecting behavior of cross correlation function under such excitations needs to be further investigated in real applications monitoring of the jacket platform requires consideration of environmental effects gillich et al 2019 unstable wave excitations are the dominant environmental effect that influences the structural responses changes of wave parameters i e wave height wave direction etc may generate higher changes in the feature parameters than the effects from damages in early state and thus it becomes difficult to distinguish the changes from the combination of these two types of causes in order to eliminate the influence of environmental effects many approaches have also been proposed and one of the widely used methods is the principal component analysis pca mujica et al 2008 explored the use of pca with t2 statistic and q statistic in order to detect and distinguish damages in a wing aircraft section and an aluminum beam santos et al 2013 proposed an approach for structural damage classification through pca and cluster analysis as known pca based method is to reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension while revealing some hidden and simplified patterns that often underlie it tibaduiza et al 2013 in the process of damage detection pca methods are introduced by projecting the features onto the space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues moreover new obtained features which are unaffected by environmental variations but still effective in identifying damage can be obtained however for detecting structural damages most of the pca based methods are associated with excluding the changes due to temperature variations yan et al 2005a b bellino et al 2010 few works concerned on the variations of the external excitation conditions consequently the effectiveness of pca based method also needs to be further analyzed under this situation the objective of this paper is to present a method for detecting damages in a jacket platform using a combination of the cross correlation function and pca based method this method is performed based on three steps the first step is to extract the basic damage sensitive features through the cross correlation function the second is performing the data projections process by pca method the last step is establishing an outlier algorithm by testing the sensitivity of each pc to wave conditions and extracting potentially mono damage sensitive pcs as damage indicator the following parts of the paper are organized as follows first of all the proposed method is introduced in section 2 secondly in section 3 the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a jacket platform located in the bohai sea through numerical analyses and the application of this method under the influence of noise is also discussed and summarized in section 4 subsequently validation of the method is performed through a serial of model tests in section 5 and the detailed discussions are carried out in section 6 finally in section 7 concluding remarks are summarized 2 the damage detection method 2 1 bases of choosing cross correlation as damage sensitive feature the theoretical background supporting cross correlation function as damage sensitive feature is from the natural excitation technique next the basic principle of next states that the cross correlation function is seen to be a sum of decaying sinusoids which have the same characteristics as the system s impulse response function full derivation of the method has been made by james et al 1995 and here a brief illustration will be made firstly for an n degree of freedom system the equations for the vibration of a structure can be expressed as 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m is the n n mass matrix c is the n n damping matrix k is the n n stiffness matrix x t x t x t is the displacement vector velocity vector and acceleration vector respectively f t is the external force vector the cross correlation function between two dynamic response measurements at different positions i and j is defined as 2 r i j k δ t e x i k t x j k t δ t where e is the expectation operation δt is the time lag x ik t and x jk t represent the responses at location i and j excited by an input force f k t at position k respectively t is the duration of the dynamic process after certain transformations the cross correlation function can be written as 3 r i j k δ t r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t δ t g r t δ t σ g s t τ e f k σ f k τ d σ d τ where n is the number of modal modes the superscripts r and s represent the rth and sth modal respectively ϕ is the modal shape vector g r t 1 m r ω d r exp ζ r ω n r t sin ω d r t is the impulse response function related with the rth modal ω d is the damped natural frequency ω n is the natural frequency ζ is the modal damping ratio and m is the modal mass for sea wave excitation which is a band limited and unstable stochastic process the item e f k σ f k τ should be rewritten as 4 e f k σ f k τ r k w δ t ℱ 1 s k ω where s k ω is the wave force power spectral densities psd and r k w δ t is the auto correlation function of wave force it can be noted that r k w δ t is calculated by inverse fourier transform of s k ω it is generally known that the psd of wave force is a transformation of wave spectrum after acting on a structure many researching works have been made in establishing proper wave spectrums and most of the proposed wave spectrums have the following general expression 5 s η ω a ω m exp b ω n γ α where η represents the wave height m ranges from 5 to 6 and n is usually 2 or 4 neumann 1953 bretschneider 1959 pierson and moskowitz 1964 hasselmann et al 1973 goda 2008 γ α is a frequency dependent factor that controls the sharpness of the peak a and b are constants related with significant wave height and wave peak frequency for the case of γ α 1 the corresponding spectrum represents to fully developed wind waves such as neumann spectrum pierson moskowitz spectrum and so on while for other γ α values the corresponding spectrum just represents un fully developed wind waves i e the jonswap spectrum and then s k ω is calculated by 6 s k ω t f ω 2 s η ω where t f ω is the transfer function of wave force and can be represented as t f d p w d the variables d p w d are related with structural dimensions wave parameters water depth and so on by substituting eq 5 6 into it eq 4 is transformed into the following form 7 ℱ 1 s k ω 1 2 π 0 t f ω 2 a ω m exp b ω n γ α exp i ω δ t d ω and the new expression of the r i j k δt can be obtained by substituting eq 7 into eq 3 for sea wave excitation 8 r i j k δ t r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t δ t g r t δ t σ g s t τ 1 2 π 0 t f ω 2 a ω m exp b ω n γ α exp i ω δ t d ω d σ d τ under the influence of sea wave excitation it can be found that the cross correlation function has become an unstable process from eq 8 meanwhile the stable structural modal information is hidden by the unstable stochastic behavior however such stochasticity can be eliminated by setting time lag δt as zero 9 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t g r t σ g s t τ 0 s k ω d ω d σ d τ in the above simplified expression the independent integration 0 s k ω d ω represents the energy of the wave force let e wk representing this item we can get the following expression 10 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n e w k ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t g r t σ g s t τ d σ d τ changing the variable of integration to λ t τ yields 11 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n e w k ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s m r ω d r m s ω d s 0 exp ς r ω n r ς s ω n s λ sin ω d s λ sin ω d r λ d λ it can be found from the above expression of r i j k 0 that the unstable stochasticity inherited from wave motion has been eliminated consequently r i j k 0 is referred as a potentially effective damage indicator however it is worth noting that r i j k 0 is still under the influence from e wk during above derivations the wave spectrum only describes the stochasticity of wave motion under particular sea status i e under particular probability of occurrence or return period but the variation of sea status is also a naturally random process so it can be inferred that the stochasticity changes of sea status will be introduced into r i j k 0 through e wk and then the changes of r i j k 0 values due to damage may be concealed again thus it will meet great difficulties in distinguishing the r i j k 0 changes from varying excitations or structural damages without knowing exactly the information about the sea status which is however impossible to accurately and real timely captured during in field applications then a pca based method will be introduced in order to eliminate the influence of varying sea status furthermore another important issue needs to be discussed before starting the next part during practical approaches the structural responses are always measured along two horizontal directions i e x direction and y direction observing the expression in eq 11 it can be inferred that the sensitivity of r i j 0 to dynamic response variations is minimized to a negligible level when the spatial direction of position i towards position j is orthogonal with the measuring direction of the responses for example the value of r i j 0 in x direction will be dwelling on a high correlating level close to 1 with varying wave status or structural states while the direction of measuring point i towards point j is just along y direction thus a screening process should be performed to eliminate such directionally orthogonal effect and finally a serials of r i j 0 values will be selected to compose the final feature vector v r i j 0 2 2 pca based outlier algorithm the process of damage detection is divided into two stages while pca is introduced in i e baseline modeling stage and damage diagnosis stage lu et al 2019 in the baseline modeling stage an n n dimension reference model matrix y in which totally n n dimensional feature vectors collected from the undamaged state of structure are arranged needs to be constructed it is worth noting that the n samples from the undamaged state should include full range of wave conditions 12 y y 11 y 12 y 1 n y 21 y 22 y 2 n y n 1 y n 2 y n n y 1 y 2 y n t the essential idea of pca method is projecting the features onto the space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues and the new obtained features are considered as not influenced by environmental variations but potentially still sensitive to the structural damages the projection matrix x of the matrix y is calculated by the transformation 13 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n yu where x also has the dimension of n n in which each column is a projection of the original data on each pc direction u r n n is the eigenvector matrix constructed by n eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of y in order to obtain u singular value decomposition svd of the covariance matrix of y is performed 14 y t y u s u t u 1 u 2 u n λ 1 λ 2 λ n u 1 u 2 u n where the diagonal matrix s is the singular value matrix whose main diagonal elements are the singular values arranged in descending order it is notable that the columns of u are sorted according to the singular values by descending order and they are called the principal components pcs of the reference model the innovation of the present pca method is finding those pcs that are unaffected by wave condition changes but still effective in identifying damage to achieve this goal it is necessary to check the variability of the projection data of the normal reference samples on the pc spaces the pc with big variability value i e exceeding certain threshold just indicates that the wave condition changes have significant influences on this projection direction and may conceal the damage information during the diagnosis stage contrarily the pcs with insignificant variability can be considered as potentially mono damage sensitive projection directions here we ll firstly make a definition for the variability of projection data on the qth pc direction 15 c v q σ x p q μ x p q where p ranges from 1 to n μ x pq and σ x pq are the mean value and standard deviation of the projection data from n reference samples on the qth pc direction respectively then a serial of cv values can be obtained through calculating eq 15 on the all pc directions secondly a threshold for screening effective pcs needs to be defined from statistical respect the mean value minus one times of the standard deviation could be determined as the threshold then thirdly m pcs whose cv values below this threshold will be used to construct the loading matrix t r n m and the baseline matrix e is defined as 16 e yt and subsequently its mean vector is defined as 17 e 1 n l 1 n e l then the damage index for the lth sample can be defined as 18 q l e l e c 1 e l e t where c diag λ i λ j λ m whose components are the singular values corresponding to the effective pcs furthermore the above derivations are generalized processes it should be noted that value of q l in both x and y directions need to be calculated separately which can be expressed as q lx and q ly subsequently the final damage index for the lth sample can be calculated by 19 d l q l x 2 q l y 2 in the diagnosis stage the feature vector z z1 z2 zn of a new sample is calculated firstly then perform the following projection calculation on it 20 e z zt subsequently the damage index value d z of the new coming sample can be calculated through eq 18 and eq 19 obviously a threshold also needs to be defined in identifying the new sample s state assuming the damage index values of the reference samples normally distributed the threshold could be determined as the reference ensemble s mean value plus 3 times the reference ensemble s standard deviation by this way any new sample with a d z value below the threshold would be identified as an undamaged case otherwise damaged 3 numerical testing 3 1 numerical model of the jacket oil platform the nb35 2 whpb jacket oil platform simulated in

term wave monitoring results indicate that the use of p m spectrum is more appropriate therefore the p m wave spectrum was adopted in the present simulations 21 s i ω 0 78 ω 5 exp 3 11 ω 4 h s i 2 0 78 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω m i ω 4 where h si and ω mi are respectively the significant wave height and the peak angular frequency for sea status i transient dynamic analyses were performed to calculate the dynamic responses of the jacket platform under random wave excitations the resulted time length was set as 3000 s to achieve enough stationarity of the responses different sea statuses i e wave conditions were simulated during the calculations according to the environmental survey of the engineering sea area the significant wave heights i e h s 0 5 m and 1 0 m with the first two highest occurring probabilities and the 1 return year 10 return year and 100 return year design wave conditions i e h s 2 8 m 4 1 m and 5 1 m respectively were chosen additionally the cases of h s 1 5 m 2 0 m and 3 5 m were also simulated as supplements in this manner totally eight wave height serials were simulated detailed wave parameters are listed in table 2 five wave attacking directions were simulated including statistically the dominant direction 90 and the sub dominant direction 67 5 longitudinal direction 0 and two diagonal directions 30 and 50 as shown in fig 3 in total 200 numerical cases were calculated including 8 wave heights 5 wave attacking directions with 5 random phases for generating random wave for the undamaged states in the numerical simulations damages of flooded members are concerned among various types of damage scenarios member loss often causes catastrophic accidents and many researches have been performed on this type of damage scenario kesavan and kiremidjian 2012 mojtahedi et al 2013 consistently three scenarios with loss of two diagonal braces and a horizontal brace named by d1 d2 and r1 in fig 6 were simulated during the calculations of these damaged cases the wave conditions were set consistent with the undamaged cases expect for only three random phases being set therefore a total of 360 cases were calculated for the damaged state detecting structural damages underwater from the measurements on top deck is predominant in shm for offshore jacket platforms owing to the relatively good accessibility and ease of maintenance yi 2016 at the same time acceleration response is generally the major type of in suit measurement so dynamic structural responses extracting from the calculating results were the accelerations of several measuring points on the deck for locating the measuring points eighteen measuring points on the deck were chosen the schematic positions of the measuring points are shown in fig 7 in which the number of those are also named and marked after transient dynamic analysis of each numerical condition ended acceleration responses of these measuring points were extracted including both x direction and y direction signals to simplify the data description a procedure for identifying each calculation in terms of above parameters is adopted each file is designated with four components the first part h represents wave height i e h1 0 for 1 0 m wave height and h2 8 for 2 8 m wave height the second part a represents the wave direction i e a0 for 0 wave direction a22 5 for 22 5 wave direction etc the third part b represents the random phase set for random wave simulation i e b1 for the first random phase set and b2 for the second set the fourth part represents the structural state i e u for the undamaged state d1 for the first damage scenario d2 for the second damage scenario and r1 for the third damage scenario 3 3 numerical testing results two examples of the structural responses in undamaged and damaged states under the same numerical test condition h0 5a0b1 are plotted in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the time serials and frequency spectrum of the responses are both plotted in figures comparing the two serials of the results it can be found that the recognition of the differences between undamaged and damaged states is difficult in both time and frequency domain as mentioned previously the first step in applying the method is extracting the feature vectors through calculating r i j 0 values across different measuring points on the structure but before this step it would be better to observe the damage sensitivity of r i j 0 for the present jacket platform eighteen acceleration signals on one direction x or y yielding in 153 r i j 0 values nevertheless we can choose one of them e g r 1 3 0 to make the observation serials of r 1 3 0 values were calculated on both x and y signals for 0 wave attacking direction cases with undamaged and damaged states as the calculating results shown in fig 10 and 11 for most of the wave cases i e different wave height conditions with various random phase sets undamaged cases exhibit stable values than damaged cases indicating that the r i j 0 feature is sensitive to damage and the unstable stochasticity inherited from wave motion has been mostly eliminated however it can also be observed that such damage sensitivity is disappearing while crosswise comparisons are made among the wave cases similar phenomena were also observed for other r i j 0 results so it indicates that structural damage cannot be detected through direct comparing r i j 0 values without definitely known about the wave condition as mentioned above for the present jacket platform eighteen acceleration signals on one direction x or y yielding in 153 r i j 0 values among which the directionally orthogonal effect is involved thus the feature screening process was performed and the final effective feature vector v r i j 0 is reduced to 81 dimension in the x direction and 84 dimension in the y direction respectively the second and novel step in the present method is screening the mono damage sensitive pcs the x directional and y directional cv values for all simulated cases against pc orders are plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively based on the threshold determining method mentioned above totally twelve pcs were screened out on x direction and fourteen pcs on y direction for constructing the loading matrix t x and t y respectively the undamaged cases with 1 3 random phases were used for constructing the reference model i e 120 samples the rest 80 undamaged cases and all the 360 damaged cases were chosen as testing samples to perform the diagnosis process the diagnosing results are visualized in fig 14 in which the point s area is divided into five regions i e respectively the reference samples undamaged samples d1 damage scenario samples d2 damage scenario samples and r1 damage scenario samples it is notable that the damage index is plotted on a log scale in this figure and the horizontal black line in it presents the threshold which is determined as the mean value plus 3 times the standard deviation from the reference samples in order to evaluate the performance of the damage detection method the total detection accuracy tda is defined as 22 t d a n c n t 100 where n c represents the number of correct testing samples and n t is the total number of the testing samples for the undamaged testing samples most of the sample points are below the threshold whereas several points exceed the threshold for d1 and d2 damaged testing samples all the sample points are upon the threshold line indicating successful detection for r1 cases most of the samples are detected correctly expect for three cases in general the detection accuracy is wholly 98 the purpose of the shm is to detect the damage as accurately as possible and essentially avoid the two types of error type i error is a false positive indication of damage and type ii is a false negative indication of damage mujica et al 2014 in this paper assuming that the occurrence probability of a certain sea state can be expressed as p h w the calculation of error rate er could be written as 23 e r n e n s p h w 100 where n c is utilized to represent the error samples and n s is the total number of the detected samples corresponding to the wave condition this factor is another indicator to evaluate detection performance of the proposed method for the undamaged testing cases n s is 10 for each significant wave height and the type i error rate is calculated through eq 23 the total error rate is the sum of that of each wave height type ii error rate is also calculated for damaged cases note that n s is 15 for each significant wave height table 3 summarizes the number and percentage of type i and type ii errors for different scenarios for the undamaged testing samples the misjudgments focus on 4 1 m and 5 1 m wave height from table 3 which indicates that the unstable stochasticity of the wave excitations becomes significant under the condition of higher wave height under such cases type i errors may occur since the occurrence probability of these two wave heights is low the method is still effective to avoid type i errors for damaged cases only three type ii errors occur for r1 damage the performance of damage detection method performs relatively well on these three damage scenarios with percent of total misjudgments ranging between 0 percent and 2 percent which can be considered an acceptable result thus it can be seen that the proposed method is available in detecting the structural damages under the influence of the random wave excitations however the measurement noise is very common in field monitoring and the influence of noise will be investigated in the following part 4 improvements on noise resistance in order to verify the anti noise ability of the method gaussian white noises were added to the acceleration responses 24 a n o i s e t a t ε t where a noise t is the signal contaminated by noise a t is the original signal and ε t is the gaussian white noise through using awgn function in matlab mathworks r2016a ε t can be firstly generated under specified snr three different snrs i e 30 db 15 db and 5 db were respectively considered in this section and then the contaminated signal a noise t can be finally obtained through eq 24 under these three snrs the damage detection results are plotted in fig 15 in which all the undamaged samples are misjudged as damaged and the boundary between the undamaged and damaged cases disappeared it can be observed that the damage indexes increase gradually with the decrease of snr indicating that the differences between the reference and testing samples are gradually increased due to the increasing level of noise from the above tests we can find that the indicator s distinguishability on undamaged and damaged samples is corrupted by noise while the reference samples are unpolluted therefore it is naturally to infer that the distinguishability would be recovered if the reference samples were also polluted by the noise with the same snr level as the diagnosing samples then based on this consideration the 120 reference signals used to construct the loading matrix were polluted by gaussian noises with the three snrs i e 30 db 15 db and 5 db respectively consistent with testing signals the improved diagnosing results on the three noise levels are exhibited in figs 16 18 respectively and summarized in table 4 from the results it can be seen that such improvement through reconstructing the loading matrix with noise information achieves a good recovery on the distinguishability of the damage indicator however the above improved method is conditional upon the knowledge about noise level i e snr value obviously the problem is how to obtain this knowledge observing fig 15 we can find that the level of the lg d z values of the testing samples is consistent with their contaminated level so it can be inferred that a noise contamination index could be established on the base of original loading matrix and noise free reference samples here we generated another serial of testing samples with snr 7 noise contamination using the noise free reference model the lg d z values were calculated on the original loading matrix and the results are plotted in fig 19 accompanying with the results from fig 15 it can be seen that the results index a noise contamination level between snr 15 and snr 5 according to this index the diagnosing process was updated by introducing the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 5 and the improved results are illustrated in fig 20 the total detection accuracy of this new serial of samples is 93 indicating that good noise resistance has been achieved 5 model test validation 5 1 model test setup the tests were conducted in the ocean engineering laboratory of tianjin university a scaled model of nb35 2 whpb jacket oil platform as shown in fig 21 was made and tested to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed method for damage detection the dimensional scaling factor λ was 1 15 in the present tests details about the physical similitude theory for modeling a jacket platform can be seen in viero and roitman 1999 in which the corresponding essential scaling factors have been listed the whole model is composed of topside deck and jacket infrastructure to ensure sufficient stiffness and mass set the topside model components including the main beam main column and deck was made of q345 steel due to the limitation of materials the material elastic modulus of the jacket model is hard to be strictly scaled down however the key point is to ensure the model has similar load transfer patterns and modal shapes with the prototype structure in the model tests therefore the jacket model was fabricated from high strength aluminum alloy 6061 t6 the topside model was connected to the jacket model through flanges the legs of the jacket model were extended 6 times of the pile diameter downward from the mudline position to achieve the same boundary condition adopted in numerical simulations the end of each was welded on a base plate which was fixed to the ground by four anchor bolts 5 2 modal characteristics of the model the modal testing was firstly carried out in order to obtain the modal characteristics of the model after test ended the natural frequencies and modal shapes were obtained and the results were shown in table 5 and fig 22 respectively the test results indicated that the modal shapes of the model structure were consistent with the calculated results of the prototype jacket platform 5 3 the loads and the measuring instruments during the tests the model was excited through applying horizontal loads on the main legs at the positions corresponding to water level as shown in fig 23 the loading system was composed of a steel loading pod driven by a servo electric cylinder and force sensor fig 24 shows the test scene of 90 loading direction in which three loading systems were used these systems were independently controlled by computer and each was designed for horizontal loading capacity up to 1 ton and the maximum reciprocating motion period of 10 s the aim of the model tests is to valid the effectiveness of the proposed method thus the key part of the test technology is ensuring the dynamic behaviors of the model structure are similar with those in prototype i e the numerical results for the present study to achieve this similarity how to obtain the similarity between the applied wave load in model scale and that in full scale becomes the dominant issue after the similarity of modal characteristics between model and prototype structures has been established the full scale wave load time serials can be obtained from the numerical simulations and then the subsequent step is scaling the load time serials in a reasonable manner obviously the loading similarity should be consistent with the modal similarity and so the scaling factor of loading process should be derived from the modal scaling relationship thus the scaling of wave loading process is performed by two sub steps the first is to obtain the scaling factor of time the natural frequency of the structure is 0 6069 hz in full scale and 7 258 hz in model scale and then the scaling factor of time λ t can be calculated as 11 959 according to the inertia and elastic similarity criterion the force scaling can be calculated as 41 356 by the relationship of λ t 3 2 through such method the wave loads extracted from numerical simulations were scaled for performing the model tests as the examples shown in fig 25 eighteen three directional ake398b 08 accelerometers capacity 8 g were used to measure the acceleration as shown in fig 26 the accelerometers were installed on the deck with the positions consistent with the measuring points set in the numerical simulations the signals from the accelerometers were recorded by the data acquisition system and sampled at a rate of 500 hz 5 4 test conditions and procedures different wave conditions were considered in the model tests eight wave heights were firstly set which keep consistent with those in the numerical simulations two wave attacking directions were set i e 0 and 90 for the platform we concerned the structural members can be divided into two groups i e the wellhead region members and simple region members in the wellhead region many riser supporting members are arranged and so the load transformation manner across the members is complicated in this region thus it can be inferred that all the member damage scenarios could be detected through the method that can effectively detect the member damages in this region on considering the structural symmetry totally 17 members in the wellhead region shown in fig 27 including the diagonal braces vertical braces and horizontal braces were set as the members to be damaged all these to be damaged members were made as replaceable by setting their joints as detachable flanges through removing respective bolts as shown in fig 28 three types of damage scenarios were modeled during the tests the first type is member loss by removing the corresponding member from the model the second is stiffness reduction the members whose uc values are beyond 0 4 in strength check were selected as stiffness to be reduced as marked in fig 27 and listed in table 6 stiffness reduction was modeled by replacing the original member with a new member with lower diameters as shown in fig 29 here the percentage of the stiffness reduction s p is defined as 25 s p i u n d a m a g e d i d a m a g e d i u n d a m a g e d 100 where i undamaged is the moment of inertia of the original member and i damaged is the moment of inertia of the replaced member the last damage scenario is supporting capacity reduction of the piled foundation which was modeled by loosening the installation bolts of one model leg the a1 leg was selected in the tests as shown in fig 27 table 6 shows the total information of the damage scenarios totally 26 damage scenarios were modeled the schematic diagram of the test procedure is shown in fig 30 the tests were performed on the undamaged state and then repeated in the same way for the damaged state thus totally 16 serials of undamaged records and 416 serials of damaged records were obtained during tests 5 5 damage detection results before performing the proposed method on the test records a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of two times the basic natural frequency of the model i e 15 hz was made on the acceleration records in cleaning the test data an example of cleaned acceleration record is exhibited in fig 31 to perform the proposed damage detection method the testing samples i e the feature vectors v r i j 0 are needed to be extracted through calculating r i j 0 values across different measuring points on the structure by obeying the r i j 0 screening principle in the method totally 16 undamaged and 416 damaged feature vectors were obtained from different test cases observing spectrum exhibited in fig 31 it can be found that the test record was polluted by certain level of white noise and so the noise contamination indexing procedure need to be carried out subsequently according to the proposed method 128 testing samples were randomly selected from the model test ensemble to perform the noise indexing procedure and the results are plotted in fig 32 it can be seen that the results indexed a noise contamination level close to snr 5 thus the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 5 of the novel pca method established above should be introduced in the damage detection then the proposed method has been prepared for detecting the damage scenarios modeled during the tests the first serial of validations was made on member loss damage type three groups were subdivided for this serial the first group was made on undamaged and d1 d7 damage scenarios the corresponding results are shown in fig 33 in which the undamaged testing sample points are all below the threshold almost all damaged testing sample points are upon the threshold line indicating successful detection except for two cases in d7 damage scenario the second group was made on r1 r7 damage scenarios and the results are shown in fig 34 for this serial of damage scenarios the samples of r1 and r2 cases are all detected successfully however two cases are undetected for r3 r6 damage scenarios and four cases are undetected for r7 damage scenarios the third group was made on e1 e3 damage scenarios the corresponding results are shown in fig 35 in which the damage detection method achieved 100 accuracy in detecting these scenarios table 7 summarizes the number and percentage of type i and type ii errors of member loss serial through observing the results it can be found that the error percentage varies with different types of members indicating that the effectiveness of the method is related with the position of the damaged member the second serial of validations was made on the stiffness reduction damage scenarios and the final results of damage detection are shown in fig 36 in order to show the variations of damage index with the damage severity sample points in member loss damage scenario i e s p 100 were also exhibited in the figures as shown in fig 36 for d2 and d4 damage scenarios all the testing sample points exceed the threshold indicating that good damage detection performance has been achieved at the same time it can be found that the accuracy of the damage detection decreases with the decreasing damage severity for d5 and d7 damage scenarios the total detection accuracy of d5 scenario is 94 for the cases of 90 s p while the value is reduced to 81 for 80 s p cases for d7 damage scenario the total detection accuracy decreases from 88 to 70 when the s p varies from 90 to 80 the last serial of validations was made on the supporting capacity reduction of the piled foundation scenario the corresponding results are shown in fig 37 in which all the sample points are significantly higher than the threshold such results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective in detecting this type of damage scenario 6 discussions 6 1 damage detection accuracies on different member types according to their positions and inner load transfer functions all the members are divided into six groups including the main leg i e a1 leg diagonal elevation braces i e d2 d6 r1 and r6 diagonal plan braces i e e1 e2 and e3 vertical braces i e d4 and r3 outer plan members i e d1 d3 d5 d7 r2 and r4 and inner plan members i e r5 and r7 fig 38 shows the averaged total detection accuracies for different member groups the accuracy is both 100 for the main leg and diagonal plan braces and the lowest level of 81 for the type of inner plan members the differences indicate that behavior of the proposed method relates to the importance or structural function of the particular member on which the damage scenario locates as known the main legs are the most important members of the jacket platform chakrabarti 2005 and the proposed method behaved very well in detecting damages on them elshafey et al 2010 states that infrastructure s natural frequency is more sensitive to the changes of diagonal brace members than those of horizontal brace members in other words diagonal brace members are more important than horizontal brace members in dominating the dynamic characteristics of the jacket infrastructure and consequently a better behavior of the proposed method was observed on the diagonal brace members the importance of a member is always defined as its failure consequence to the whole structure just as stated by gharaibeh et al 2002 for jacket offshore platforms typically main leg members may be taken as top important group as failure of any of these would result in very serious consequence i e failure of the structure the next level of important group includes the main elevation braces i e diagonal elevation braces and the outer plan members failure of any of such members would result in serious consequence i e considerable loss of system reliability the third level of important group includes the inner plan members failure of any member on this level would not result in serious consequence obviously an effective shm should behave a perfect detection no error can be accepted on the first level of important members to support an immediate decision on production shutdown and making repair plan and then on the second level of important members the shm should behave a good detection only a few errors can be accepted to support a necessary maintenance plan in the near future lastly on the third level of important members the shm may be needed to behave an acceptable detection certain amounts of errors may be accepted because the corresponding maintenance plan for such members are always un urgent thus we summarize the damage detecting results of model tests by dividing the damaged members for member loss scenario into three groups consistent with the three importance levels as shown in fig 38 it can be seen that the proposed method exhibits perfect damage detection performance on the first importance level members 100 accuracies good performance on the second importance level members upon 90 accuracies and acceptable performance on the third level ones upon 81 accuracies besides four members that have potential high failure risks were selected for the stiffness reduction damage scenario during the model tests these high failure risk members generally require the shm to be able to detect the damage in early developed stage the present detection accuracies are average of 92 for these early developed damage cases exhibiting an also good behavior 6 2 limitations of the damage detection method as mentioned above the proposed method is theoretically basing on the next for damage sensitive feature extraction the natural excitation considered for the method is the narrowband low frequency random wave action by this way an initial assumption that responses caused by other types of excitations would act as disturbances noises in other words on the damage sensitivity of the feature and so it is necessary to discuss how this initial assumption affects the obtained results the validations through model tests have proved that the proposed method exhibits good noise resistance during detecting the damages however it is worth noting the noise resistibility of the method basing on an assumption that the measured response is only contaminated by the white noise additional analyses for the discussions were performed on a serial of test cases undamaged and d1 d7 damaged cases with original data i e the test records keep un cleaned according to the proposed detecting procedures we need to perform the noise contamination indexing after obtained the testing samples through calculating the feature vectors v r i j 0 the indexing results are plotted in fig 39 in which a noise contamination level below snr 5 was indexed such result indicates that the pre established noise contamination indexes need to be extended thus three new indexes i e snr 0 snr 5 and snr 10 were established and the final indexing result exhibited the noise contamination level of un cleaned model test data closed to snr 10 next we may as well carry out the damage detection based on the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 10 the results indicate that the method is failed in detecting the damages as shown in fig 40 obviously further discussions should be made on the failure reasons it is worth noting that the noise contamination level of snr below 0 means the wave excited response power completely shadowed by the noise power thus it could be inferred that the noise contamination of the response for damage sensitive feature extraction cannot be below level of snr 0 however it is also worth noting that the noise contamination indexing procedure for the proposed method is only available for indexing white noise level as an example the time serials and frequency spectrum of one original acceleration record under undamaged state are plotted in fig 41 from which not only signs of white noise can be observed but also significant energy concentrations at high frequency ranges then the noise contamination indexing result is probably not true nevertheless the results at least show that the damage detection method will be greatly influenced by the types of noises polluting the response data then how about the cases of the response only contaminated by the white noise but still on a low snr level a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 hz in cleaning the original test data was performed the noise contamination indexing results on the features extracted from these filtered data indexed closed to snr 5 then the final damage detecting procedure was performed by updating the loading matrix and the results are shown in fig 42 failure of the method can also be observed from the figure thus it can be concluded that the limitation of the proposed method on application is that the measured response signals should be effectively denoised to a white noise mono contaminated level with positive snr values 7 conclusions a combined method of cross correlation and pca based outlier algorithm has been established in this paper through investigating the effectiveness of the proposed method on detecting the damages of a jacket platform under random wave excitations following conclusions are drawn 1 the theoretical analysis illuminates that the cross correlation vector v r i j 0 is a potentially damage sensitive feature during extracting the vector the directionally orthogonal effect should be considered furthermore a pca based method is subsequently needed to eliminate the influence of varying sea status 2 during introducing the pca processing a method of screening effective pcs was firstly developed in projecting the features on mono damage sensitive directions through loading matrix the total detection accuracy is 98 for all the numerical testing samples furthermore noise resistance has also been improved by reconstructing the loading matrix with noise information indexed by a new established noise contamination indexing method 3 model tests were carried out to validate the proposed method three types of damage scenarios were modeled in the tests the validation results show that the proposed method behaved good in these damage scenarios it is necessary to stress that the present study is a method to detect the damages of jacket platform subjected to the wave excitations considerable uncertainties with respect to the proposed damage detection method still exist in practical applications including the influence of complicated noises and operational effects consequently the preliminary knowledge obtained in this

21584,in order to achieve accurate identification of structural damages the structure health monitoring shm has been developed rapidly for the jacket platform during the latest decades however the damage detection in structure health monitoring should consider the variation caused by ocean environmental conditions many researchers have shown that the cross correlation function is a good approach in extracting structural characteristics by proceeding it between the vibration responses from various structural locations besides the principal component analysis pca method has been proved effective in eliminating the environmental variations as a consequence this paper proposes an approach in developing a pca based method for identifying the structural state from the feature vector constructed by cross correlation functions the proposed method was firstly applied on detecting the damage of numerical model of a jacket platform in the bohai sea subsequently a scaled model of the studied jacket platform was made and model tests were carried out to validate the proposed method after summarizing the damage detection results of numerical simulations and model tests it can be concluded that the proposed method behaves good in different damage scenarios under the random wave excitations and the accuracy varies with the damage location and severity keywords damage detection structure health monitoring wave excitations cross correlation pca based 1 introduction steel jacket platform is the most common used type of structures in offshore resources exploration wisch 1998 this kind of structure is exposed in harsh environments and unexpected structural damages may occur during their service lives and probably lead the structure into a dangerous situation to ensure the structural safety inspections at regular intervals are therefore mandatory pérez et al 2017 however by now the inspections are always costly and dangerous especially for the underwater cases hillis and courtney 2011 farrar and worden 2013 for such reason vibration based structure health monitoring shm technologies have been developed for offshore structures wang et al 2018 this type of technologies is based on the fundamental theory that damages lead changes of structural stiffness and consequently change its dynamic properties michael et al 2018 since early 1970s serials of approaches have been carried out in developing vibration based shm technologies for damage detections of jacket platforms many approaches have been performed through estimating the modal parameters including the natural frequencies mode shapes modal strain energy and so on doebling et al 1998 roitman et al 2004 minette et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however unlike those land structures these kinds of methods always meet great difficulties in the applications on offshore platforms reliable estimation of the modal parameters essentially lies on the accurate response measurements for all the key positions of the structure i e all the key members or joints for jacket structure li et al 2007 which is hard and unrealistic to be achieved on an offshore platform besides as described in nichols 2003 due to the low frequency nature of sea waves they tend to produce structural response data that are ill suited to a modal based approach on considering the limitation of modal based technique many approaches have been made to explore new damage indicators trendafilova et al 2015 asgarian et al 2016 hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 among which the cross correlation between two measuring positions has attracted extensive attentions serials of applications for structural damage detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of using cross correlation function for example navarro et al 2018 utilized cross correlation function to extract the damage sensitive feature for different kinds of structures the feasibility and sensitivity of their approaches have been validated respectively for different damage scenarios feng et al 2015 developed a damage indicator based on the normalized cross correlation function in detecting the damages of metro tunnel structure subjected to impact excitations li and law 2008 proposed a method to quantify the severity of the damages based on the wavelet packet energy of cross correlation function of the measured acceleration responses in most of these works the cross correlation function is extracted from the response under white noise excitations or impact excitations however the offshore platform is primarily subjected to unstable random wave excitation and thus the damage detecting behavior of cross correlation function under such excitations needs to be further investigated in real applications monitoring of the jacket platform requires consideration of environmental effects gillich et al 2019 unstable wave excitations are the dominant environmental effect that influences the structural responses changes of wave parameters i e wave height wave direction etc may generate higher changes in the feature parameters than the effects from damages in early state and thus it becomes difficult to distinguish the changes from the combination of these two types of causes in order to eliminate the influence of environmental effects many approaches have also been proposed and one of the widely used methods is the principal component analysis pca mujica et al 2008 explored the use of pca with t2 statistic and q statistic in order to detect and distinguish damages in a wing aircraft section and an aluminum beam santos et al 2013 proposed an approach for structural damage classification through pca and cluster analysis as known pca based method is to reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension while revealing some hidden and simplified patterns that often underlie it tibaduiza et al 2013 in the process of damage detection pca methods are introduced by projecting the features onto the space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues moreover new obtained features which are unaffected by environmental variations but still effective in identifying damage can be obtained however for detecting structural damages most of the pca based methods are associated with excluding the changes due to temperature variations yan et al 2005a b bellino et al 2010 few works concerned on the variations of the external excitation conditions consequently the effectiveness of pca based method also needs to be further analyzed under this situation the objective of this paper is to present a method for detecting damages in a jacket platform using a combination of the cross correlation function and pca based method this method is performed based on three steps the first step is to extract the basic damage sensitive features through the cross correlation function the second is performing the data projections process by pca method the last step is establishing an outlier algorithm by testing the sensitivity of each pc to wave conditions and extracting potentially mono damage sensitive pcs as damage indicator the following parts of the paper are organized as follows first of all the proposed method is introduced in section 2 secondly in section 3 the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a jacket platform located in the bohai sea through numerical analyses and the application of this method under the influence of noise is also discussed and summarized in section 4 subsequently validation of the method is performed through a serial of model tests in section 5 and the detailed discussions are carried out in section 6 finally in section 7 concluding remarks are summarized 2 the damage detection method 2 1 bases of choosing cross correlation as damage sensitive feature the theoretical background supporting cross correlation function as damage sensitive feature is from the natural excitation technique next the basic principle of next states that the cross correlation function is seen to be a sum of decaying sinusoids which have the same characteristics as the system s impulse response function full derivation of the method has been made by james et al 1995 and here a brief illustration will be made firstly for an n degree of freedom system the equations for the vibration of a structure can be expressed as 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m is the n n mass matrix c is the n n damping matrix k is the n n stiffness matrix x t x t x t is the displacement vector velocity vector and acceleration vector respectively f t is the external force vector the cross correlation function between two dynamic response measurements at different positions i and j is defined as 2 r i j k δ t e x i k t x j k t δ t where e is the expectation operation δt is the time lag x ik t and x jk t represent the responses at location i and j excited by an input force f k t at position k respectively t is the duration of the dynamic process after certain transformations the cross correlation function can be written as 3 r i j k δ t r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t δ t g r t δ t σ g s t τ e f k σ f k τ d σ d τ where n is the number of modal modes the superscripts r and s represent the rth and sth modal respectively ϕ is the modal shape vector g r t 1 m r ω d r exp ζ r ω n r t sin ω d r t is the impulse response function related with the rth modal ω d is the damped natural frequency ω n is the natural frequency ζ is the modal damping ratio and m is the modal mass for sea wave excitation which is a band limited and unstable stochastic process the item e f k σ f k τ should be rewritten as 4 e f k σ f k τ r k w δ t ℱ 1 s k ω where s k ω is the wave force power spectral densities psd and r k w δ t is the auto correlation function of wave force it can be noted that r k w δ t is calculated by inverse fourier transform of s k ω it is generally known that the psd of wave force is a transformation of wave spectrum after acting on a structure many researching works have been made in establishing proper wave spectrums and most of the proposed wave spectrums have the following general expression 5 s η ω a ω m exp b ω n γ α where η represents the wave height m ranges from 5 to 6 and n is usually 2 or 4 neumann 1953 bretschneider 1959 pierson and moskowitz 1964 hasselmann et al 1973 goda 2008 γ α is a frequency dependent factor that controls the sharpness of the peak a and b are constants related with significant wave height and wave peak frequency for the case of γ α 1 the corresponding spectrum represents to fully developed wind waves such as neumann spectrum pierson moskowitz spectrum and so on while for other γ α values the corresponding spectrum just represents un fully developed wind waves i e the jonswap spectrum and then s k ω is calculated by 6 s k ω t f ω 2 s η ω where t f ω is the transfer function of wave force and can be represented as t f d p w d the variables d p w d are related with structural dimensions wave parameters water depth and so on by substituting eq 5 6 into it eq 4 is transformed into the following form 7 ℱ 1 s k ω 1 2 π 0 t f ω 2 a ω m exp b ω n γ α exp i ω δ t d ω and the new expression of the r i j k δt can be obtained by substituting eq 7 into eq 3 for sea wave excitation 8 r i j k δ t r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t δ t g r t δ t σ g s t τ 1 2 π 0 t f ω 2 a ω m exp b ω n γ α exp i ω δ t d ω d σ d τ under the influence of sea wave excitation it can be found that the cross correlation function has become an unstable process from eq 8 meanwhile the stable structural modal information is hidden by the unstable stochastic behavior however such stochasticity can be eliminated by setting time lag δt as zero 9 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t g r t σ g s t τ 0 s k ω d ω d σ d τ in the above simplified expression the independent integration 0 s k ω d ω represents the energy of the wave force let e wk representing this item we can get the following expression 10 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n e w k ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s t t g r t σ g s t τ d σ d τ changing the variable of integration to λ t τ yields 11 r i j k 0 1 2 π r 1 n s 1 n e w k ϕ i r ϕ k r ϕ j s ϕ k s m r ω d r m s ω d s 0 exp ς r ω n r ς s ω n s λ sin ω d s λ sin ω d r λ d λ it can be found from the above expression of r i j k 0 that the unstable stochasticity inherited from wave motion has been eliminated consequently r i j k 0 is referred as a potentially effective damage indicator however it is worth noting that r i j k 0 is still under the influence from e wk during above derivations the wave spectrum only describes the stochasticity of wave motion under particular sea status i e under particular probability of occurrence or return period but the variation of sea status is also a naturally random process so it can be inferred that the stochasticity changes of sea status will be introduced into r i j k 0 through e wk and then the changes of r i j k 0 values due to damage may be concealed again thus it will meet great difficulties in distinguishing the r i j k 0 changes from varying excitations or structural damages without knowing exactly the information about the sea status which is however impossible to accurately and real timely captured during in field applications then a pca based method will be introduced in order to eliminate the influence of varying sea status furthermore another important issue needs to be discussed before starting the next part during practical approaches the structural responses are always measured along two horizontal directions i e x direction and y direction observing the expression in eq 11 it can be inferred that the sensitivity of r i j 0 to dynamic response variations is minimized to a negligible level when the spatial direction of position i towards position j is orthogonal with the measuring direction of the responses for example the value of r i j 0 in x direction will be dwelling on a high correlating level close to 1 with varying wave status or structural states while the direction of measuring point i towards point j is just along y direction thus a screening process should be performed to eliminate such directionally orthogonal effect and finally a serials of r i j 0 values will be selected to compose the final feature vector v r i j 0 2 2 pca based outlier algorithm the process of damage detection is divided into two stages while pca is introduced in i e baseline modeling stage and damage diagnosis stage lu et al 2019 in the baseline modeling stage an n n dimension reference model matrix y in which totally n n dimensional feature vectors collected from the undamaged state of structure are arranged needs to be constructed it is worth noting that the n samples from the undamaged state should include full range of wave conditions 12 y y 11 y 12 y 1 n y 21 y 22 y 2 n y n 1 y n 2 y n n y 1 y 2 y n t the essential idea of pca method is projecting the features onto the space spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the small eigenvalues and the new obtained features are considered as not influenced by environmental variations but potentially still sensitive to the structural damages the projection matrix x of the matrix y is calculated by the transformation 13 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 x n n yu where x also has the dimension of n n in which each column is a projection of the original data on each pc direction u r n n is the eigenvector matrix constructed by n eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of y in order to obtain u singular value decomposition svd of the covariance matrix of y is performed 14 y t y u s u t u 1 u 2 u n λ 1 λ 2 λ n u 1 u 2 u n where the diagonal matrix s is the singular value matrix whose main diagonal elements are the singular values arranged in descending order it is notable that the columns of u are sorted according to the singular values by descending order and they are called the principal components pcs of the reference model the innovation of the present pca method is finding those pcs that are unaffected by wave condition changes but still effective in identifying damage to achieve this goal it is necessary to check the variability of the projection data of the normal reference samples on the pc spaces the pc with big variability value i e exceeding certain threshold just indicates that the wave condition changes have significant influences on this projection direction and may conceal the damage information during the diagnosis stage contrarily the pcs with insignificant variability can be considered as potentially mono damage sensitive projection directions here we ll firstly make a definition for the variability of projection data on the qth pc direction 15 c v q σ x p q μ x p q where p ranges from 1 to n μ x pq and σ x pq are the mean value and standard deviation of the projection data from n reference samples on the qth pc direction respectively then a serial of cv values can be obtained through calculating eq 15 on the all pc directions secondly a threshold for screening effective pcs needs to be defined from statistical respect the mean value minus one times of the standard deviation could be determined as the threshold then thirdly m pcs whose cv values below this threshold will be used to construct the loading matrix t r n m and the baseline matrix e is defined as 16 e yt and subsequently its mean vector is defined as 17 e 1 n l 1 n e l then the damage index for the lth sample can be defined as 18 q l e l e c 1 e l e t where c diag λ i λ j λ m whose components are the singular values corresponding to the effective pcs furthermore the above derivations are generalized processes it should be noted that value of q l in both x and y directions need to be calculated separately which can be expressed as q lx and q ly subsequently the final damage index for the lth sample can be calculated by 19 d l q l x 2 q l y 2 in the diagnosis stage the feature vector z z1 z2 zn of a new sample is calculated firstly then perform the following projection calculation on it 20 e z zt subsequently the damage index value d z of the new coming sample can be calculated through eq 18 and eq 19 obviously a threshold also needs to be defined in identifying the new sample s state assuming the damage index values of the reference samples normally distributed the threshold could be determined as the reference ensemble s mean value plus 3 times the reference ensemble s standard deviation by this way any new sample with a d z value below the threshold would be identified as an undamaged case otherwise damaged 3 numerical testing 3 1 numerical model of the jacket oil platform the nb35 2 whpb jacket oil platform simulated in this paper is a six legged steel wellhead platform shown in fig 1 which is located in the bohai sea the platform has a total height of approximately 40 m from the upper deck to the mudline and sits in a water depth of 12 6 m the numerical model is illustrated in fig 2 the gravity center of the numerical model was arranged consistent with the actual platform and fixed boundary conditions were applied on the pile ends that below the mudline in 6 times the pile diameter the nomenclatures of each leg are illustrated in fig 3 in which the positive x direction and y direction have been marked as the sketches shown in fig 4 the elevation of the free surface of water on which origin of the numerical coordinates was set is 3 0 m above the second horizontal bracing level the modal properties of the jacket platform were calculated and the results are listed in table 1 as well as the first three modal shapes were illuminated in fig 5 3 2 numerical conditions and damage simulations the random wave load generating algorithm in ansys was used to simulate the wave loads through defining a wave spectrum ansys inc 2016 for the bohai sea area in which the platform we monitored the long term wave monitoring results indicate that the use of p m spectrum is more appropriate therefore the p m wave spectrum was adopted in the present simulations 21 s i ω 0 78 ω 5 exp 3 11 ω 4 h s i 2 0 78 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω m i ω 4 where h si and ω mi are respectively the significant wave height and the peak angular frequency for sea status i transient dynamic analyses were performed to calculate the dynamic responses of the jacket platform under random wave excitations the resulted time length was set as 3000 s to achieve enough stationarity of the responses different sea statuses i e wave conditions were simulated during the calculations according to the environmental survey of the engineering sea area the significant wave heights i e h s 0 5 m and 1 0 m with the first two highest occurring probabilities and the 1 return year 10 return year and 100 return year design wave conditions i e h s 2 8 m 4 1 m and 5 1 m respectively were chosen additionally the cases of h s 1 5 m 2 0 m and 3 5 m were also simulated as supplements in this manner totally eight wave height serials were simulated detailed wave parameters are listed in table 2 five wave attacking directions were simulated including statistically the dominant direction 90 and the sub dominant direction 67 5 longitudinal direction 0 and two diagonal directions 30 and 50 as shown in fig 3 in total 200 numerical cases were calculated including 8 wave heights 5 wave attacking directions with 5 random phases for generating random wave for the undamaged states in the numerical simulations damages of flooded members are concerned among various types of damage scenarios member loss often causes catastrophic accidents and many researches have been performed on this type of damage scenario kesavan and kiremidjian 2012 mojtahedi et al 2013 consistently three scenarios with loss of two diagonal braces and a horizontal brace named by d1 d2 and r1 in fig 6 were simulated during the calculations of these damaged cases the wave conditions were set consistent with the undamaged cases expect for only three random phases being set therefore a total of 360 cases were calculated for the damaged state detecting structural damages underwater from the measurements on top deck is predominant in shm for offshore jacket platforms owing to the relatively good accessibility and ease of maintenance yi 2016 at the same time acceleration response is generally the major type of in suit measurement so dynamic structural responses extracting from the calculating results were the accelerations of several measuring points on the deck for locating the measuring points eighteen measuring points on the deck were chosen the schematic positions of the measuring points are shown in fig 7 in which the number of those are also named and marked after transient dynamic analysis of each numerical condition ended acceleration responses of these measuring points were extracted including both x direction and y direction signals to simplify the data description a procedure for identifying each calculation in terms of above parameters is adopted each file is designated with four components the first part h represents wave height i e h1 0 for 1 0 m wave height and h2 8 for 2 8 m wave height the second part a represents the wave direction i e a0 for 0 wave direction a22 5 for 22 5 wave direction etc the third part b represents the random phase set for random wave simulation i e b1 for the first random phase set and b2 for the second set the fourth part represents the structural state i e u for the undamaged state d1 for the first damage scenario d2 for the second damage scenario and r1 for the third damage scenario 3 3 numerical testing results two examples of the structural responses in undamaged and damaged states under the same numerical test condition h0 5a0b1 are plotted in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the time serials and frequency spectrum of the responses are both plotted in figures comparing the two serials of the results it can be found that the recognition of the differences between undamaged and damaged states is difficult in both time and frequency domain as mentioned previously the first step in applying the method is extracting the feature vectors through calculating r i j 0 values across different measuring points on the structure but before this step it would be better to observe the damage sensitivity of r i j 0 for the present jacket platform eighteen acceleration signals on one direction x or y yielding in 153 r i j 0 values nevertheless we can choose one of them e g r 1 3 0 to make the observation serials of r 1 3 0 values were calculated on both x and y signals for 0 wave attacking direction cases with undamaged and damaged states as the calculating results shown in fig 10 and 11 for most of the wave cases i e different wave height conditions with various random phase sets undamaged cases exhibit stable values than damaged cases indicating that the r i j 0 feature is sensitive to damage and the unstable stochasticity inherited from wave motion has been mostly eliminated however it can also be observed that such damage sensitivity is disappearing while crosswise comparisons are made among the wave cases similar phenomena were also observed for other r i j 0 results so it indicates that structural damage cannot be detected through direct comparing r i j 0 values without definitely known about the wave condition as mentioned above for the present jacket platform eighteen acceleration signals on one direction x or y yielding in 153 r i j 0 values among which the directionally orthogonal effect is involved thus the feature screening process was performed and the final effective feature vector v r i j 0 is reduced to 81 dimension in the x direction and 84 dimension in the y direction respectively the second and novel step in the present method is screening the mono damage sensitive pcs the x directional and y directional cv values for all simulated cases against pc orders are plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively based on the threshold determining method mentioned above totally twelve pcs were screened out on x direction and fourteen pcs on y direction for constructing the loading matrix t x and t y respectively the undamaged cases with 1 3 random phases were used for constructing the reference model i e 120 samples the rest 80 undamaged cases and all the 360 damaged cases were chosen as testing samples to perform the diagnosis process the diagnosing results are visualized in fig 14 in which the point s area is divided into five regions i e respectively the reference samples undamaged samples d1 damage scenario samples d2 damage scenario samples and r1 damage scenario samples it is notable that the damage index is plotted on a log scale in this figure and the horizontal black line in it presents the threshold which is determined as the mean value plus 3 times the standard deviation from the reference samples in order to evaluate the performance of the damage detection method the total detection accuracy tda is defined as 22 t d a n c n t 100 where n c represents the number of correct testing samples and n t is the total number of the testing samples for the undamaged testing samples most of the sample points are below the threshold whereas several points exceed the threshold for d1 and d2 damaged testing samples all the sample points are upon the threshold line indicating successful detection for r1 cases most of the samples are detected correctly expect for three cases in general the detection accuracy is wholly 98 the purpose of the shm is to detect the damage as accurately as possible and essentially avoid the two types of error type i error is a false positive indication of damage and type ii is a false negative indication of damage mujica et al 2014 in this paper assuming that the occurrence probability of a certain sea state can be expressed as p h w the calculation of error rate er could be written as 23 e r n e n s p h w 100 where n c is utilized to represent the error samples and n s is the total number of the detected samples corresponding to the wave condition this factor is another indicator to evaluate detection performance of the proposed method for the undamaged testing cases n s is 10 for each significant wave height and the type i error rate is calculated through eq 23 the total error rate is the sum of that of each wave height type ii error rate is also calculated for damaged cases note that n s is 15 for each significant wave height table 3 summarizes the number and percentage of type i and type ii errors for different scenarios for the undamaged testing samples the misjudgments focus on 4 1 m and 5 1 m wave height from table 3 which indicates that the unstable stochasticity of the wave excitations becomes significant under the condition of higher wave height under such cases type i errors may occur since the occurrence probability of these two wave heights is low the method is still effective to avoid type i errors for damaged cases only three type ii errors occur for r1 damage the performance of damage detection method performs relatively well on these three damage scenarios with percent of total misjudgments ranging between 0 percent and 2 percent which can be considered an acceptable result thus it can be seen that the proposed method is available in detecting the structural damages under the influence of the random wave excitations however the measurement noise is very common in field monitoring and the influence of noise will be investigated in the following part 4 improvements on noise resistance in order to verify the anti noise ability of the method gaussian white noises were added to the acceleration responses 24 a n o i s e t a t ε t where a noise t is the signal contaminated by noise a t is the original signal and ε t is the gaussian white noise through using awgn function in matlab mathworks r2016a ε t can be firstly generated under specified snr three different snrs i e 30 db 15 db and 5 db were respectively considered in this section and then the contaminated signal a noise t can be finally obtained through eq 24 under these three snrs the damage detection results are plotted in fig 15 in which all the undamaged samples are misjudged as damaged and the boundary between the undamaged and damaged cases disappeared it can be observed that the damage indexes increase gradually with the decrease of snr indicating that the differences between the reference and testing samples are gradually increased due to the increasing level of noise from the above tests we can find that the indicator s distinguishability on undamaged and damaged samples is corrupted by noise while the reference samples are unpolluted therefore it is naturally to infer that the distinguishability would be recovered if the reference samples were also polluted by the noise with the same snr level as the diagnosing samples then based on this consideration the 120 reference signals used to construct the loading matrix were polluted by gaussian noises with the three snrs i e 30 db 15 db and 5 db respectively consistent with testing signals the improved diagnosing results on the three noise levels are exhibited in figs 16 18 respectively and summarized in table 4 from the results it can be seen that such improvement through reconstructing the loading matrix with noise information achieves a good recovery on the distinguishability of the damage indicator however the above improved method is conditional upon the knowledge about noise level i e snr value obviously the problem is how to obtain this knowledge observing fig 15 we can find that the level of the lg d z values of the testing samples is consistent with their contaminated level so it can be inferred that a noise contamination index could be established on the base of original loading matrix and noise free reference samples here we generated another serial of testing samples with snr 7 noise contamination using the noise free reference model the lg d z values were calculated on the original loading matrix and the results are plotted in fig 19 accompanying with the results from fig 15 it can be seen that the results index a noise contamination level between snr 15 and snr 5 according to this index the diagnosing process was updated by introducing the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 5 and the improved results are illustrated in fig 20 the total detection accuracy of this new serial of samples is 93 indicating that good noise resistance has been achieved 5 model test validation 5 1 model test setup the tests were conducted in the ocean engineering laboratory of tianjin university a scaled model of nb35 2 whpb jacket oil platform as shown in fig 21 was made and tested to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed method for damage detection the dimensional scaling factor λ was 1 15 in the present tests details about the physical similitude theory for modeling a jacket platform can be seen in viero and roitman 1999 in which the corresponding essential scaling factors have been listed the whole model is composed of topside deck and jacket infrastructure to ensure sufficient stiffness and mass set the topside model components including the main beam main column and deck was made of q345 steel due to the limitation of materials the material elastic modulus of the jacket model is hard to be strictly scaled down however the key point is to ensure the model has similar load transfer patterns and modal shapes with the prototype structure in the model tests therefore the jacket model was fabricated from high strength aluminum alloy 6061 t6 the topside model was connected to the jacket model through flanges the legs of the jacket model were extended 6 times of the pile diameter downward from the mudline position to achieve the same boundary condition adopted in numerical simulations the end of each was welded on a base plate which was fixed to the ground by four anchor bolts 5 2 modal characteristics of the model the modal testing was firstly carried out in order to obtain the modal characteristics of the model after test ended the natural frequencies and modal shapes were obtained and the results were shown in table 5 and fig 22 respectively the test results indicated that the modal shapes of the model structure were consistent with the calculated results of the prototype jacket platform 5 3 the loads and the measuring instruments during the tests the model was excited through applying horizontal loads on the main legs at the positions corresponding to water level as shown in fig 23 the loading system was composed of a steel loading pod driven by a servo electric cylinder and force sensor fig 24 shows the test scene of 90 loading direction in which three loading systems were used these systems were independently controlled by computer and each was designed for horizontal loading capacity up to 1 ton and the maximum reciprocating motion period of 10 s the aim of the model tests is to valid the effectiveness of the proposed method thus the key part of the test technology is ensuring the dynamic behaviors of the model structure are similar with those in prototype i e the numerical results for the present study to achieve this similarity how to obtain the similarity between the applied wave load in model scale and that in full scale becomes the dominant issue after the similarity of modal characteristics between model and prototype structures has been established the full scale wave load time serials can be obtained from the numerical simulations and then the subsequent step is scaling the load time serials in a reasonable manner obviously the loading similarity should be consistent with the modal similarity and so the scaling factor of loading process should be derived from the modal scaling relationship thus the scaling of wave loading process is performed by two sub steps the first is to obtain the scaling factor of time the natural frequency of the structure is 0 6069 hz in full scale and 7 258 hz in model scale and then the scaling factor of time λ t can be calculated as 11 959 according to the inertia and elastic similarity criterion the force scaling can be calculated as 41 356 by the relationship of λ t 3 2 through such method the wave loads extracted from numerical simulations were scaled for performing the model tests as the examples shown in fig 25 eighteen three directional ake398b 08 accelerometers capacity 8 g were used to measure the acceleration as shown in fig 26 the accelerometers were installed on the deck with the positions consistent with the measuring points set in the numerical simulations the signals from the accelerometers were recorded by the data acquisition system and sampled at a rate of 500 hz 5 4 test conditions and procedures different wave conditions were considered in the model tests eight wave heights were firstly set which keep consistent with those in the numerical simulations two wave attacking directions were set i e 0 and 90 for the platform we concerned the structural members can be divided into two groups i e the wellhead region members and simple region members in the wellhead region many riser supporting members are arranged and so the load transformation manner across the members is complicated in this region thus it can be inferred that all the member damage scenarios could be detected through the method that can effectively detect the member damages in this region on considering the structural symmetry totally 17 members in the wellhead region shown in fig 27 including the diagonal braces vertical braces and horizontal braces were set as the members to be damaged all these to be damaged members were made as replaceable by setting their joints as detachable flanges through removing respective bolts as shown in fig 28 three types of damage scenarios were modeled during the tests the first type is member loss by removing the corresponding member from the model the second is stiffness reduction the members whose uc values are beyond 0 4 in strength check were selected as stiffness to be reduced as marked in fig 27 and listed in table 6 stiffness reduction was modeled by replacing the original member with a new member with lower diameters as shown in fig 29 here the percentage of the stiffness reduction s p is defined as 25 s p i u n d a m a g e d i d a m a g e d i u n d a m a g e d 100 where i undamaged is the moment of inertia of the original member and i damaged is the moment of inertia of the replaced member the last damage scenario is supporting capacity reduction of the piled foundation which was modeled by loosening the installation bolts of one model leg the a1 leg was selected in the tests as shown in fig 27 table 6 shows the total information of the damage scenarios totally 26 damage scenarios were modeled the schematic diagram of the test procedure is shown in fig 30 the tests were performed on the undamaged state and then repeated in the same way for the damaged state thus totally 16 serials of undamaged records and 416 serials of damaged records were obtained during tests 5 5 damage detection results before performing the proposed method on the test records a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of two times the basic natural frequency of the model i e 15 hz was made on the acceleration records in cleaning the test data an example of cleaned acceleration record is exhibited in fig 31 to perform the proposed damage detection method the testing samples i e the feature vectors v r i j 0 are needed to be extracted through calculating r i j 0 values across different measuring points on the structure by obeying the r i j 0 screening principle in the method totally 16 undamaged and 416 damaged feature vectors were obtained from different test cases observing spectrum exhibited in fig 31 it can be found that the test record was polluted by certain level of white noise and so the noise contamination indexing procedure need to be carried out subsequently according to the proposed method 128 testing samples were randomly selected from the model test ensemble to perform the noise indexing procedure and the results are plotted in fig 32 it can be seen that the results indexed a noise contamination level close to snr 5 thus the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 5 of the novel pca method established above should be introduced in the damage detection then the proposed method has been prepared for detecting the damage scenarios modeled during the tests the first serial of validations was made on member loss damage type three groups were subdivided for this serial the first group was made on undamaged and d1 d7 damage scenarios the corresponding results are shown in fig 33 in which the undamaged testing sample points are all below the threshold almost all damaged testing sample points are upon the threshold line indicating successful detection except for two cases in d7 damage scenario the second group was made on r1 r7 damage scenarios and the results are shown in fig 34 for this serial of damage scenarios the samples of r1 and r2 cases are all detected successfully however two cases are undetected for r3 r6 damage scenarios and four cases are undetected for r7 damage scenarios the third group was made on e1 e3 damage scenarios the corresponding results are shown in fig 35 in which the damage detection method achieved 100 accuracy in detecting these scenarios table 7 summarizes the number and percentage of type i and type ii errors of member loss serial through observing the results it can be found that the error percentage varies with different types of members indicating that the effectiveness of the method is related with the position of the damaged member the second serial of validations was made on the stiffness reduction damage scenarios and the final results of damage detection are shown in fig 36 in order to show the variations of damage index with the damage severity sample points in member loss damage scenario i e s p 100 were also exhibited in the figures as shown in fig 36 for d2 and d4 damage scenarios all the testing sample points exceed the threshold indicating that good damage detection performance has been achieved at the same time it can be found that the accuracy of the damage detection decreases with the decreasing damage severity for d5 and d7 damage scenarios the total detection accuracy of d5 scenario is 94 for the cases of 90 s p while the value is reduced to 81 for 80 s p cases for d7 damage scenario the total detection accuracy decreases from 88 to 70 when the s p varies from 90 to 80 the last serial of validations was made on the supporting capacity reduction of the piled foundation scenario the corresponding results are shown in fig 37 in which all the sample points are significantly higher than the threshold such results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective in detecting this type of damage scenario 6 discussions 6 1 damage detection accuracies on different member types according to their positions and inner load transfer functions all the members are divided into six groups including the main leg i e a1 leg diagonal elevation braces i e d2 d6 r1 and r6 diagonal plan braces i e e1 e2 and e3 vertical braces i e d4 and r3 outer plan members i e d1 d3 d5 d7 r2 and r4 and inner plan members i e r5 and r7 fig 38 shows the averaged total detection accuracies for different member groups the accuracy is both 100 for the main leg and diagonal plan braces and the lowest level of 81 for the type of inner plan members the differences indicate that behavior of the proposed method relates to the importance or structural function of the particular member on which the damage scenario locates as known the main legs are the most important members of the jacket platform chakrabarti 2005 and the proposed method behaved very well in detecting damages on them elshafey et al 2010 states that infrastructure s natural frequency is more sensitive to the changes of diagonal brace members than those of horizontal brace members in other words diagonal brace members are more important than horizontal brace members in dominating the dynamic characteristics of the jacket infrastructure and consequently a better behavior of the proposed method was observed on the diagonal brace members the importance of a member is always defined as its failure consequence to the whole structure just as stated by gharaibeh et al 2002 for jacket offshore platforms typically main leg members may be taken as top important group as failure of any of these would result in very serious consequence i e failure of the structure the next level of important group includes the main elevation braces i e diagonal elevation braces and the outer plan members failure of any of such members would result in serious consequence i e considerable loss of system reliability the third level of important group includes the inner plan members failure of any member on this level would not result in serious consequence obviously an effective shm should behave a perfect detection no error can be accepted on the first level of important members to support an immediate decision on production shutdown and making repair plan and then on the second level of important members the shm should behave a good detection only a few errors can be accepted to support a necessary maintenance plan in the near future lastly on the third level of important members the shm may be needed to behave an acceptable detection certain amounts of errors may be accepted because the corresponding maintenance plan for such members are always un urgent thus we summarize the damage detecting results of model tests by dividing the damaged members for member loss scenario into three groups consistent with the three importance levels as shown in fig 38 it can be seen that the proposed method exhibits perfect damage detection performance on the first importance level members 100 accuracies good performance on the second importance level members upon 90 accuracies and acceptable performance on the third level ones upon 81 accuracies besides four members that have potential high failure risks were selected for the stiffness reduction damage scenario during the model tests these high failure risk members generally require the shm to be able to detect the damage in early developed stage the present detection accuracies are average of 92 for these early developed damage cases exhibiting an also good behavior 6 2 limitations of the damage detection method as mentioned above the proposed method is theoretically basing on the next for damage sensitive feature extraction the natural excitation considered for the method is the narrowband low frequency random wave action by this way an initial assumption that responses caused by other types of excitations would act as disturbances noises in other words on the damage sensitivity of the feature and so it is necessary to discuss how this initial assumption affects the obtained results the validations through model tests have proved that the proposed method exhibits good noise resistance during detecting the damages however it is worth noting the noise resistibility of the method basing on an assumption that the measured response is only contaminated by the white noise additional analyses for the discussions were performed on a serial of test cases undamaged and d1 d7 damaged cases with original data i e the test records keep un cleaned according to the proposed detecting procedures we need to perform the noise contamination indexing after obtained the testing samples through calculating the feature vectors v r i j 0 the indexing results are plotted in fig 39 in which a noise contamination level below snr 5 was indexed such result indicates that the pre established noise contamination indexes need to be extended thus three new indexes i e snr 0 snr 5 and snr 10 were established and the final indexing result exhibited the noise contamination level of un cleaned model test data closed to snr 10 next we may as well carry out the damage detection based on the reconstructed loading matrix on snr 10 the results indicate that the method is failed in detecting the damages as shown in fig 40 obviously further discussions should be made on the failure reasons it is worth noting that the noise contamination level of snr below 0 means the wave excited response power completely shadowed by the noise power thus it could be inferred that the noise contamination of the response for damage sensitive feature extraction cannot be below level of snr 0 however it is also worth noting that the noise contamination indexing procedure for the proposed method is only available for indexing white noise level as an example the time serials and frequency spectrum of one original acceleration record under undamaged state are plotted in fig 41 from which not only signs of white noise can be observed but also significant energy concentrations at high frequency ranges then the noise contamination indexing result is probably not true nevertheless the results at least show that the damage detection method will be greatly influenced by the types of noises polluting the response data then how about the cases of the response only contaminated by the white noise but still on a low snr level a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 hz in cleaning the original test data was performed the noise contamination indexing results on the features extracted from these filtered data indexed closed to snr 5 then the final damage detecting procedure was performed by updating the loading matrix and the results are shown in fig 42 failure of the method can also be observed from the figure thus it can be concluded that the limitation of the proposed method on application is that the measured response signals should be effectively denoised to a white noise mono contaminated level with positive snr values 7 conclusions a combined method of cross correlation and pca based outlier algorithm has been established in this paper through investigating the effectiveness of the proposed method on detecting the damages of a jacket platform under random wave excitations following conclusions are drawn 1 the theoretical analysis illuminates that the cross correlation vector v r i j 0 is a potentially damage sensitive feature during extracting the vector the directionally orthogonal effect should be considered furthermore a pca based method is subsequently needed to eliminate the influence of varying sea status 2 during introducing the pca processing a method of screening effective pcs was firstly developed in projecting the features on mono damage sensitive directions through loading matrix the total detection accuracy is 98 for all the numerical testing samples furthermore noise resistance has also been improved by reconstructing the loading matrix with noise information indexed by a new established noise contamination indexing method 3 model tests were carried out to validate the proposed method three types of damage scenarios were modeled in the tests the validation results show that the proposed method behaved good in these damage scenarios it is necessary to stress that the present study is a method to detect the damages of jacket platform subjected to the wave excitations considerable uncertainties with respect to the proposed damage detection method still exist in practical applications including the influence of complicated noises and operational effects consequently the preliminary knowledge obtained in this
