thereby polluting them the major sources of such harmful discharge include plastic paper concrete rubber textile and medicine industries 1 the discharged dyes pose a great threat to the living beings in contact with them due to their injurious effects including high biotoxicity mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in particular they cause irritation in the respiratory tract eyes and skin instigated heartbeat on breathing nausea vomiting jaundice quadriplegia and tissue necrosis in addition to carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity 2 4 this gives rise to a growing problem of availability of water resources for the human consumption with the ever increasing global population 5 one of the promising solutions to this aforementioned problem is the membranes based water purification the membrane separation technology is capable of treating wastewater and producing clean drinking water by removing contaminants present in the water stream 6 7 particularly polymeric hollow fiber membranes hfms are industrially preferred over the flat sheet due to their comparatively higher separation performance and lower operational costs 8 however there are still some challenges associated with these membranes some of their major challenges are flux fouling mechanical and thermal stability 9 10 several methods have been used to overcome the aforementioned challenges thereby improving the physicochemical properties and separation performance of the membranes 11 interfacial polymerization 12 surface treatment uv grafting and electron beam irradiation 11 13 layer by layer assembly 14 and embedding nanoparticles nps 15 are some of these methods recently the application of metal metal oxide nps e g copper silver iron iron oxides silica alumina zinc oxide zno and titania in the membranes has gained a significant attention to improve their physicochemical properties e g hydrophilicity mechanical and thermal stability membrane porosity and pore size moreover a remarkable improvement in terms of fouling resistant water permeation flux and solute rejection has also been achieved 11 15 19 among these nps zno is the low cost metal oxide np which is increasingly being used in the membranes for wastewater treatment 20 21 in addition to the above mentioned nps carbon nanomaterials cnms including graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts or their nanocomposites are also being used to make them suitable for the wastewater treatment 22 26 it is important to note that metal metal oxide nps suffer from aggregation which resulted in their non uniform distribution in the membranes thus to tackle this challenge a nanohybrid consisting of metal metal oxide nps and a cnm go and cnts is prepared and used in the membranes to improve their performance for different applications 22 27 31 it is believed that the oxygen enriched functional groups in cnms prevent nps agglomeration and help in their uniform dispersion it may be noted that as per the authors best knowledge there is no such study reported in the literature which discussed the synthesis of zno nps decorated carboxylated go nanosheets and their use in membrane fabrication to demonstrate the efficient rejection of dyes while maintaining high pure water permeability pwp superior antifouling property and excellent stability for the longer duration in this study zno nps were decorated on carboxylated go cgo nanosheets the composite is termed as zno cgo nanohybrid this synthesized nanohybrid was embedded for the first time as per the authors knowledge in polyethersulfone pes or p hfms to study their effect on the physichemical properties and separation performance of the resulting zogp hfms the morphology of these hfms was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem surface functionality by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir and the positive effect of zno cgo nanohybrid on the hydrophilicity mechanical and thermal stability porosity and pore size zeta potential and roughness of the fabricated zogp hfms was studied importantly pwp antifouling performance and the rejection of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rh b were investigated using these hfms the performance of these composite hfms was compared with that of the pristine p hfms 2 experimental section in the experimental section the protocol of synthesis and the details to characterize zno cgo nanohybrid are presented next the details to fabricate the hfm samples and their physicochemical characterization are described it is followed by discussing the experiments which were conducted to examine the pwp antifouling property and dye removal using the fabricated hfm samples 2 1 synthesis of zno cgo nanohybrid the chemicals which were used in the synthesis of zno cgo nanohybrid were bought from sigma aldrich united states zno cgo nanohybrid was prepared by following the steps shown in the fig 1 first of all go nanosheets were synthesized by following the protocol reported in the previous studies 32 33 next go nanosheets were functionalized with carboxyl groups as discussed below 34 50 mg go nanosheets were mixed with 1 2 g chloroacetic acid clch2co2h and 1 g sodium hydroxide naoh in 100 ml milli q mq water the resulting solution was ultrasonicated for 3 h to remove sodium chloride nacl the hydroxyl groups were converted to carboxyl groups the cgo solution was neutralized with the help of nitric acid hno3 and then subjected to a series of cycles with acetone and mq water the precipitate was dried at 50 for 24 h to obtain cgo nanosheets now 2 mg ml cgo nanosheets alongwith 0 2 g naoh was ultrasonicated in methanol for 30 min it was followed by stirring for 45 min simultaneously 0 55 g zn ch3coo 2 2h2o zn ac 2 was added to 50 ml methanol the solution was heated at 80 for 15 min under continuous stirring the temperature of solution was brought down to 40 thereafter zn ac 2 solution was added to the above prepared go naoh solution next 100 ml hexane was added to this mixture which was stirred overnight the product was washed with ethanol which was followed by centrifugation finally it was subjected to washing with water and drying at 50 to obtain pure zno cgo nanohybrid 2 2 characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid the details of characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid are same as mentioned in the previous studies 31 32 34 briefly the morphology was

surface functionality of the nanohybrid the chemical identities of atoms present in the zno cgo nanohybrid was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis axis supra kratos analytical united kingdom 2 3 fabrication of hfms the protocol to fabricate hfm samples was same as mentioned in the previous studies 32 35 the details of the fiber spinning set up are discussed in a previous study 36 briefly the dispersion of different concentration 0 25 and 0 5 wt of zno cgo nanohybrid was prepared in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent via ultrasonication for 1 h a very dilute pes solution was added to zno cgo nanohybrid dispersion in nmp under stirring for 1 h after that pes was added to make up pes concentration to 20 wt and the stirring was continued for 24 h the prepared polymer dope solution was degassed to remove any air bubble entrapped in it and finally used to spin hfms the fabrication parameter are shown in table 1 pristine p hfms were also spun for the comparison purposes these hfms were kept in water to remove excess solvent for 48 h 2 4 characterization of hfms the characterization details of membranes were same as discussed in the literature 31 34 the surface morphology was examined by sem jeol jsm 7600 f japan the surface functional groups were studied by atr ftir spectroscopy the positive effect of incorporating the zno cgo nanohybrid in

instruments france and surface roughness by atomic force microscopy afm mfp 3d bio asylum research united states was evaluated the porosity was measured using the gravimetric method as reported in the literature 31 briefly a known weight denoted as dry weight i e wd of dried hfms was dipped in di water overnight next the excess water from hfms was removed and the wet weight denoted as ww of the sample was measured then the porosity ε of a particular hfm sample was calculated with the help of the following eq 1 1 ε w w w d a l ρ 100 in the above equation a denotes membrane area m2 l denotes membrane thickness m and ρ denotes water density 1000 kg m3 at 25 in addition to this the pore size rm of a hfm sample was estimated by guerout elford ferry equation presented as the eq 2 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p here ε is the membrane porosity η is the viscosity of water in pa s l is the membrane thickness in m q is the permeate flow rate in m3 s a is the membrane area in m2 and δp is the transmembrane pressure tmp in pa 2 5 separation performance of hfm samples pwp and antifouling nature of membranes were studied next dye rejection experiments were performed it can be noted that the hfm modules were fabricated to perform these experiments as reported in the previous study 31 37 the set up used for these experiments was same as discussed in the previous study 36 the pwp was calculated by running water through the membranes at 1 0 bar and permeate was collected at regular intervals the value of pwp was computed by the eq 3 given below 3 p w p q n π d i l δ p here q denotes flow rate of permeate ml h di represents internal diameter of an hfm m l represents length of a fiber m and δp is the tmp mmhg this value of pwp is termed as pwpi pwp without fouling now to measure the rejection of mb and rh b using these hfm samples 50 mg l mb and 2 mg l rh b solutions were prepared in mq water and separately run through the hfms at 1 0 bar permeate was collected after 1 h the rejection values of dyes were determined by the following eq 4 4 r e x p 1 c p c f 100 here cp and cf indicate concentration of mb rh b dye in permeate and feed respectively it can be noted that the concentration of mb rhb dye was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer molecular devices united states at the wavelength of 664 nm for mb and 554 nm for rh b few additional rejection experiments were also by preparing the dye solutions using lake water the lake water was taken and kept at an undisturbed place to allow the particles to settle down then the upper layer of lake water was separated and the dye solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate amount of dyes in it the setup protocol and conditions for the rejection experiments remained the same as described earlier additionally the antibiofouling property of hfm samples was also examined by incubating them with nearby lake water for 15 days next the hfms were flushed with mq water the biofouling was observed on the membranes inner surface under sem moreover the values of flux recovery ratio frr and the change in pwp post fouling or flux reduction fr for membranes were also calculated by re measuring the value of pwp termed as pwpf the protocol followed to measure post fouling pwp was same as discussed earlier the frr and fr values for a membrane were determined by the formulae 5 and 6 written below 5 f r r p w p f p w p i 100 6 f r 1 p w p f p w p i 100 long term dye rejection experiment was also carried out for 10 cycles to study the performance and stability of the superior membrane the duration of each cycle was 3 h and each cycle is followed by washing with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds 2 mm solution for 25 min and then rinsed with di water for 5 min to remove the residual sds solution the stability of membranes was examined after each separation cycle the water samples were collected from feed tank and permeate and then these samples were checked for the leaching of the constituents zno nps and cgo nanosheets of zno cgo nanohybrid the presence of these constituents in the collected water samples will determine the stability of membranes the lower the leaching of these constituents the better the membrane stability 3 results and discussion the section presents the results of the physicochemical characteristics of the zno cgo nanohybrid and that of the zogp hfms and discusses them most importantly the separation performance discussing pwp antifouling property and dyes rejection is also presented 3 1 physicochemical characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid the tem image of the prepared zno cgo nanohybrid indicated that zno nps were anchored and uniformly distributed into cgo nanosheets eds point analysis confirmed the presence of zno nps on the cgo nanosheets fig 2 b the xrd pattern of zno cgo nanohybrid fig 2c showed the diffraction peak recorded at 11 3 corresponding to the 001 plane due to the stacked cgo nanosheets furthermore the diffraction peaks were also obtained at 31 7 corresponding to 100 plane 34 3 corresponding to 002 plane 36 2 corresponding to 101 plane 47 5 corresponding to 102 plane 56 6 corresponding to 110 plane 62 8 corresponding to 103 plane 66 3 corresponding to 200 plane 67 9 corresponding to 112 plane and 69 1 corresponding to 201 plane it confirmed the wurtzite structure of zno nps jcpds no 36 1451 which were anchored on the cgo nanosheets 38 39 the atr ftir spectrum of zno cgo nanohybrid is shown in fig 2d the peaks appearing between 440 and 675 cm 1 related to the zn o stretching vibrations moreover the peaks recorded at 1056 1097 1243 1375 and 1450 cm 1 corresponded to the co stretching vibrations with coh bending a peak was recorded at 1577 cm 1 which signified the skeletal vibration of the cgo nanosheets most importantly the peaks appearing at 1659 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 indicated co stretching vibrations of cooh group which helped in controlled growth and uniform dispersal of zno nps over cgo nanosheets via complexation with zno atoms two more peaks also appeared at 2855 and 2928 cm 1 which indicated the ch stretching vibrations a peak appeared in the range of 3300 3600 cm 1 signified the oh group 40 the existence of these oxygen containing groups on cgo nanosheets acted as sites to form coordinate bonds with zno nps which resulted in the formation of zno cgo nanohybrid it is important to note that the peaks recorded for the nanohybrid in this study match with the literature reports 38 39 41 xps study was done on zno cgo nanohybrid to examine the chemical states of different elements present in the nanohybrid the xps spectra of c 1 s and zn 2p for zno cgo nanohybrid were recorded fig 3 the zn 2p spectrum fig 3 a displayed dominant peaks at 1022 3 ev corresponding to zn 2p3 2 and 1045 4 ev corresponding to zn 2p1 2 the appearance of these peaks indicated that zn was present in its oxidized state in the zno cgo nanohybrid 42 fig 3 b displays the c 1 s spectrum three peaks appeared at 284 6 ev corresponding to c c 286 2 ev corresponding to c oh and 289 7 ev corresponding to o c o 3 2 physicochemical characterization of hfms the section presents and discusses the results showing the effect of incorporating zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms on the morphology surface functionality hydrophilicity mechanical strength thermal stability porosity pore size surface charge and surface roughness of the hfms the sem images of different hfms are shown in fig 4 from the images it can observed that zogp hfms were comparatively more porous than pristine hfms it was also observed that the hfm samples exhibited a finger like structure which broadened as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid added in membranes increased moreover the sponge like structures also appeared in the outermost layer of zogp hfms the elemental mapping of p and zogp hfms was recorded which is shown in fig 5 c s and o being the constituents of pes are present in both the hfm samples however zn which is one of the characteristic elements of zno cgo nanohybrid zn was mapped in the elemental mapping of zogp hfms it can be seen that zn was uniformly distributed all over the zogp hfms which also confirmed the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms atr ftir spectra were recorded to study the surface functionality of hfms fig 6 a the representative peaks of p were recorded in all spectra as discussed in the previous study 32 43 moreover the representative peaks of zno cgo nanohybrid were also observed specifically between 440 and 750 cm 1 corresponding to zno stretching at 1410 cm 1 indicating coh and co bonds at 1680 cm 1 indicating carboxylic groups and between 3080 and 3500 cm 1 indicating oh groups thus the atr ftir study showed the surface functionality of zogp hfms with oxygen enriched groups due to the presence of the nanohybrid it also resulted in remarkable decrease in the water contact angles from 77 1 2 5 for p hfms to 56 2 1 4 for zogp 25 hfms to 35 3 1 1 for zogp 50 hfms fig 6b in other words the hydrophilicity significantly improved which helps in boosting the separation performance of the zogp hfms the mechanical strength of different hfm samples was examined by measuring young s moduli fig 6c the values of young s modulus for p zogp 25 and zogp 50 hfm samples were 310 6 6 8 mpa 358 3 7 4 mpa and 398 8 7 5 mpa respectively the values of young s modulus indicated that the mechanical strength of hfm samples improved remarkably here zno cgo nanohybrid acted as a reinforcement element in the polymer nanocomposite and due to the better interfacial interactions between the polymer pes chains and the nanohybrid zno cgo the mechanical strength of the polymer nanohybrid composite membranes zogp hfms increased similar trend was also observed for other polymer nanoparticles composite membranes in the literature 34 37 44 47 this also resulted in improved thermal stability of these membranes samples with the high thermal degradation temperature fig 6d the incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms resulted in their higher porosity than p hfms the highest porosity of 89 9 2 1 was measured for zogp 50 hfms table 2 the porosity values for p hfms was 61 5 1 4 and that for zogp 25 hfms was 81 1 1 9 this increase in porosity can be credited to the oxygen rich surface groups in zno cgo nanohybrid which enhanced the solvent exchange rate and contributed to the formation of pores in the membranes the membrane pore size was also measured for different hfm samples table 2 which indicated that these membranes exhibited nanoscale pores ranging between 5 8 nm moreover the zeta potential of membrane samples was also computed to examine their surface charge as shown in table 2 the embedding of nanohybrid in hfms showed a positive role in increasing the zeta potential for zogp hfms which will help the membranes in mitigating the fouling and enhancing the dye rejection via electrostatic interactions 48 surface roughness is responsible for membrane fouling it is reported in the literature 49 50 that the embedding of a hydrophilic nanocomposite in membranes lowers the surface roughness thereby helping in mitigation of the membrane fouling likewise in this study the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in membranes lowered their surface roughness the 3d afm images of surface topography of hfms are depicted in fig 7 the roughness was quantified and reported as root mean square roughness rrms and average roughness ravg table 3 rrms and ravg values clearly demonstrated that the surface roughness decreased in other words the surface smoothened as the amount of nanohybrid in hfms increased as shown earlier that the hydrophilic groups are present in zno cgo nanohybrid which contributed toward the uniform dispersion of zno cgo nanohybrid in the membrane matrix and altered the phase demixing between solvent and non solvent which led to smoothening of the surface of the zogp hfms 31 34 46 3 3 separation performance of hfms the pwp of different hfm samples was presented in fig 8 a it displays the effect of fouling on the values of pwp the pwp increased by almost 4 times as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms increased to 0 5 wt in other words the pwp for zogp 50 hfms with 0 5 wt zno cgo nanohybrid was 358 5 14 9 ml m2 h mmhg against p hfms value of pwp was 74 6 7 1 ml m2 h mmhg the pwp for zogp 25 hfms with 0 25 wt zno cgo nanohybrid was 229 3 13 4 ml m2 h mmhg clearly a significant increase in pwp value was measured as the zno cgo nanohybrid was added in hfms even after the fouling experiments the value of pwp followed the same order that is the pwp improved as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid embedded in hfms increased the order of pwp after fouling experiments was zogp 50 hfms 353 1 14 7 ml m2 h mmhg followed by zogp 25 hfms 205 9 13 5 ml m2 h mmhg and p hfms 42 9 7 5 ml m2 h mmhg from these values of pwp the frr and fr values of these membrane samples was calculated fig 8b it was found that the frr value of zogp 50 hfms was 98 5 which was followed by zogp 25 hfms 89 8 and p hfms 57 5 the values of pwp and frr for zogp 50 hfms are better than the values reported for the metal oxide cnms incorporated polymeric membranes in the literature 20 21 30 51 53 thus the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in membranes improved their pwp and antifouling property this improvement can be attributed to the oxygen containing hydrophilic hydroxyl carbonyl and epoxy functional groups present in the zno cgo nanohybrid which resisted the attachment of fouling agents on the hfm surface thus the remarkably improved hydrophilicity as shown in section 3 2 of the zogp hfms resulted in their superior antifouling nature 54 the effect of incubating membrane samples with lake water was also studied by sem to evaluate their antifouling property as shown in fig 9 foulants were confluent on p hfms however as zno cgo nanohybrid was added in hfms the presence of foulants was limited a very few units of foulant was observed in zogp hfms this also indicated that the improved hydrophilicity of zogp hfms helped in restricting the adhesion of foulant on the surface of zogp hfms in other words the incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms imparted the oxygen enriched functional groups to the membrane surface which led to the formation of a hydration layer due to hydrogen bonding between these hydrophilic functional groups and water molecules this hydration layer acted as a shield which restricted the adsorption of the foulants on the membrane surface 55 the dye rejection performance of hfms was investigated by calculating rejection values for both the dyes fig 10 clearly the rejection of mb and rh b solutions improved significantly for zogp hfms the mb rejection values from mb spiked mq water for different hfm samples were 56 7 0 9 for p hfms 87 7 1 1 for zogp 25 hfms and 98 6 1 4 for zogp 50 hfms the mb rejection values from mb spiked lake water were 10 3 1 1 for p hfms 66 8 1 2 for zogp 25 hfms and 80 7 1 5 for zogp 50 hfms further the rh b rejection values from rh b spiked mq water were 52 7 0 7 for p hfms 85 5 0 8 for zogp 25 hfms and 98 5 1 1 for zogp 50 hfms their corresponding rejection values from rh b spiked lake water were 7 8 0 9 63 9 1 1 and 76 9 1 3 respectively from the data it is clear that among all the hfm samples zogp 50 hfms exhibited the outstanding dye removal while maintaining the pwp and antifouling property the superior dye removal performance of zogp 50 hfms can be credited to the hydrophilic oxygen enriched groups which were present on the membrane surface due to incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms these groups imparted a negative charge to the membrane surface evident from the zeta potential values which helped in electrostatic interactions between the membrane surface and the cationic dyes mb and rh b 56 57 consequently a remarkably high removal of dyes was measured using modified zogp hfms the dye rejection values of the zogp 50 hfms were compared with the literature and it was observed that the rejection values were remarkably higher than the values shown by most of the literature reported membranes 56 58 63 and comparable to a few materials studied in the literature 48 64 65 the long term performance study of the superior membrane material zogp 50 hfms for 10 cycles is presented in fig 11 the data clearly indicated that there was no change in dye removal capacity of zogp 50 hfms i e dye rejection performance was maintained furthermore zogp 50 hfms demonstrated their excellent stability during the filtration experiments as the negligible leaching of the constituents zno nps and cgo nanosheets of zno cgo nanohybrid was observed in the feed tank and permeate it can be noted that there are many literature reports which discussed the leaching of zno nps from the membranes however their leaching did not occur in the present study which can be credited to the carboxylated go nanosheets for providing sufficient anchor sites for the attachment of zno nps the negligible leaching of nanohybrid from the zogp 50 hfms can also be attributed to the excellent dispersion of zno cgo nanohybrid in the polymer matrices and the excellent compatibility between polymer pes and nanohybrid zno cgo nanohybrid therefore the results of this long term study clearly demonstrated the superior performance stability of zogp 50 hfms thus this membrane material can be used for the practical applications 4 conclusions the novel polyethersulfone nanohybrid hfms were developed using zno nps decorated cgo nanosheets the zno cgo nanohybrid was predominantly hydrophilic in nature due to the oxygen enriched groups their incorporation in hfms resulted in enhanced thermal and mechanical 398 8 7 5 mpa stability improved hydrophilicity water contact angle 35 3 1 1 membrane porosity 89 9 2 1 and lowered surface roughness rrms 8 0 0 9 nm and ravg 6 4 0 7 nm remarkably the improvement in pwp antifouling property and rejection was achieved with zogp 50 hfms pes hfms with 0 5 wt zno cgo nanohybrid the pwp was 358 5 14 9 ml m2 h mmhg with flux recovery of 98 5 significantly high mb and rh b rejection values 98 6 1 4 and 98 5 1 1 respectively were measured for zogp 50 hfms thus cgo nanosheets provided a better platform for the uniform dispersion of zno nps which resulted in zno nps decorated cgo nanosheets these nanohybrid was highly effective in improving the overall properties of polymeric hfms with superior hydrophilicity pwp antibiofouling and dye removal thus enabling zogp hfms to be potential membranes for the separation and purification applications acknowledgments the wrcb iit bombay india is acknowledged for research grant the authors are

thereby polluting them the major sources of such harmful discharge include plastic paper concrete rubber textile and medicine industries 1 the discharged dyes pose a great threat to the living beings

heartbeat on breathing nausea vomiting jaundice quadriplegia and tissue necrosis in addition to carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity 2 4 this gives rise to a growing problem of availability of water resources for the human consumption with the ever increasing global population 5 one of the promising solutions to this aforementioned problem is the membranes based water purification the membrane separation technology is capable of treating wastewater and producing clean drinking water by removing contaminants present in the water stream 6 7 particularly polymeric hollow fiber membranes hfms are industrially preferred over the flat sheet due to their comparatively higher separation performance and lower operational costs 8 however there are still some challenges associated with these membranes some of their major challenges are flux fouling mechanical and thermal stability 9 10 several methods have been used to overcome the aforementioned challenges thereby improving the physicochemical properties and separation performance of the membranes 11 interfacial polymerization 12 surface treatment uv grafting and electron beam irradiation 11 13 layer by layer assembly 14 and embedding nanoparticles nps 15 are some of these methods recently the application of metal metal oxide nps e g copper silver iron iron oxides silica alumina zinc oxide zno and titania in the membranes has gained a significant attention to improve their physicochemical properties e g hydrophilicity mechanical and thermal stability membrane porosity and pore size moreover a remarkable improvement in terms of fouling resistant water permeation flux and solute rejection has also been achieved 11 15 19 among these nps zno is the low cost metal oxide np which is increasingly being used in the membranes for wastewater treatment 20 21 in addition to the above mentioned nps carbon nanomaterials cnms including graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts or their nanocomposites are also being used to make them suitable for the wastewater treatment 22 26 it is important to note that metal metal oxide nps suffer from aggregation which resulted in their non uniform distribution in the membranes thus to tackle this challenge a nanohybrid consisting of metal metal oxide nps and a cnm go and cnts is prepared and used in the membranes to improve their performance for different applications 22 27 31 it is believed that the oxygen enriched functional groups in cnms prevent nps agglomeration and help in their uniform dispersion it may be noted that as per the authors best knowledge there is no such study reported in the literature which discussed the synthesis of zno nps decorated carboxylated go nanosheets and their use in membrane fabrication to demonstrate the efficient rejection of dyes while maintaining high pure water permeability pwp superior antifouling property and excellent stability for the longer duration in this study zno nps were decorated on carboxylated go cgo nanosheets the composite is termed as zno cgo nanohybrid this synthesized nanohybrid was embedded for the first time as per the authors knowledge in polyethersulfone pes or p hfms to study their effect on the physichemical properties and separation performance of the resulting zogp hfms the morphology of these hfms was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem surface functionality by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir and the positive effect of zno cgo nanohybrid on the hydrophilicity mechanical and thermal stability porosity and pore size zeta potential and roughness of the fabricated zogp hfms was studied importantly pwp antifouling performance and the rejection of methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rh b were investigated using these hfms the performance of these composite hfms was compared with that of the pristine p hfms 2 experimental section in the experimental section the protocol of synthesis and the details to characterize zno cgo nanohybrid are presented next the details to fabricate the hfm samples and their physicochemical characterization are described it is followed by discussing the experiments which were conducted to examine the pwp antifouling property and dye removal using the fabricated hfm samples 2 1 synthesis of zno cgo nanohybrid the chemicals which were used in the synthesis of zno cgo nanohybrid were bought from sigma aldrich united states zno cgo nanohybrid was prepared by following the steps shown in the fig 1 first of all go nanosheets were synthesized by following the protocol reported in the previous studies 32 33 next go nanosheets were functionalized with carboxyl groups as discussed below 34 50 mg go nanosheets were mixed with 1 2 g chloroacetic acid clch2co2h and 1 g sodium hydroxide naoh in 100 ml milli q mq water the resulting solution was ultrasonicated for 3 h to remove sodium chloride nacl the hydroxyl groups were converted to carboxyl groups the cgo solution was neutralized with the help of nitric acid hno3 and then subjected to a series of cycles with acetone and mq water the precipitate was dried at 50 for 24 h to obtain cgo nanosheets now 2 mg ml cgo nanosheets alongwith 0 2 g naoh was ultrasonicated in methanol for 30 min it was followed by stirring for 45 min simultaneously 0 55 g zn ch3coo 2 2h2o zn ac 2 was added to 50 ml methanol the solution was heated at 80 for 15 min under continuous stirring the temperature of solution was brought down to 40 thereafter zn ac 2 solution was added to the above prepared go naoh solution next 100 ml hexane was added to this mixture which was stirred overnight the product was washed with ethanol which was followed by centrifugation finally it was subjected to washing with water and drying at 50 to obtain pure zno cgo nanohybrid 2 2 characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid the details of characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid are same as mentioned in the previous studies 31 32 34 briefly the morphology was

surface functionality of the nanohybrid the chemical identities of atoms present in the zno cgo nanohybrid was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis axis supra kratos analytical united kingdom 2 3 fabrication of hfms the protocol to fabricate hfm samples was same as mentioned in the previous studies 32 35 the details of the fiber spinning set up are discussed in a previous study 36 briefly the dispersion of different concentration 0 25 and 0 5 wt of zno cgo nanohybrid was prepared in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent via ultrasonication for 1 h a very dilute pes solution was added to zno cgo nanohybrid dispersion in nmp under stirring for 1 h after that pes was added to make up pes concentration to 20 wt and the stirring was continued for 24 h the prepared polymer dope solution was degassed to remove any air bubble entrapped in it and finally used to spin hfms the fabrication parameter are shown in table 1 pristine p hfms were also spun for the comparison purposes these hfms were kept in water to remove excess solvent for 48 h 2 4 characterization of hfms the characterization details of membranes were same as discussed in the literature 31 34 the surface morphology was examined by sem jeol jsm 7600 f japan the surface functional groups were studied by atr ftir spectroscopy the positive effect of incorporating the zno cgo nanohybrid in

instruments france and surface roughness by atomic force microscopy afm mfp 3d bio asylum research united states was evaluated the porosity was measured using the gravimetric method as reported in the literature 31 briefly a known weight denoted as dry weight i e wd of dried hfms was dipped in di water overnight next the excess water from hfms was removed and the wet weight denoted as ww of the sample was measured then the porosity ε of a particular hfm sample was calculated with the help of the following eq 1 1 ε w w w d a l ρ 100 in the above equation a denotes membrane area m2 l denotes membrane thickness m and ρ denotes water density 1000 kg m3 at 25 in addition to this the pore size rm of a hfm sample was estimated by guerout elford ferry equation presented as the eq 2 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p here ε is the membrane porosity η is the viscosity of water in pa s l is the membrane thickness in m q is the permeate flow rate in m3 s a is the membrane area in m2 and δp is the transmembrane pressure tmp in pa 2 5 separation performance of hfm samples pwp and antifouling nature of membranes were studied next dye rejection experiments were performed it can be noted that the hfm modules were fabricated to perform these experiments as reported in the previous study 31 37 the set up used for these experiments was same as discussed in the previous study 36 the pwp was calculated by running water through the membranes at 1 0 bar and permeate was collected at regular intervals the value of pwp was computed by the eq 3 given below 3 p w p q n π d i l δ p here q denotes flow rate of permeate ml h di represents internal diameter of an hfm m l represents length of a fiber m and δp is the tmp mmhg this value of pwp is termed as pwpi pwp without fouling now to measure the rejection of mb and rh b using these hfm samples 50 mg l mb and 2 mg l rh b solutions were prepared in mq water and separately run through the hfms at 1 0 bar permeate was collected after 1 h the rejection values of dyes were determined by the following eq 4 4 r e x p 1 c p c f 100 here cp and cf indicate concentration of mb rh b dye in permeate and feed respectively it can be noted that the concentration of mb rhb dye was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer molecular devices united states at the wavelength of 664 nm for mb and 554 nm for rh b few additional rejection experiments were also by preparing the dye solutions using lake water the lake water was taken and kept at an undisturbed place to allow the particles to settle down then the upper layer of lake water was separated and the dye solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate amount of dyes in it the setup protocol and conditions for the rejection experiments remained the same as described earlier additionally the antibiofouling property of hfm samples was also examined by incubating them with nearby lake water for 15 days next the hfms were flushed with mq water the biofouling was observed on the membranes inner surface under sem moreover the values of flux recovery ratio frr and the change in pwp post fouling or flux reduction fr for membranes were also calculated by re measuring the value of pwp termed as pwpf the protocol followed to measure post fouling pwp was same as discussed earlier the frr and fr values for a membrane were determined by the formulae 5 and 6 written below 5 f r r p w p f p w p i 100 6 f r 1 p w p f p w p i 100 long term dye rejection experiment was also carried out for 10 cycles to study the performance and stability of the superior membrane the duration of each cycle was 3 h and each cycle is followed by washing with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds 2 mm solution for 25 min and then rinsed with di water for 5 min to remove the residual sds solution the stability of membranes was examined after each separation cycle the water samples were collected from feed tank and permeate and then these samples were checked for the leaching of the constituents zno nps and cgo nanosheets of zno cgo nanohybrid the presence of these constituents in the collected water samples will determine the stability of membranes the lower the leaching of these constituents the better the membrane stability 3 results and discussion the section presents the results of the physicochemical characteristics of the zno cgo nanohybrid and that of the zogp hfms and discusses them most importantly the separation performance discussing pwp antifouling property and dyes rejection is also presented 3 1 physicochemical characterization of zno cgo nanohybrid the tem image of the prepared zno cgo nanohybrid indicated that zno nps were anchored and uniformly distributed into cgo nanosheets eds point analysis confirmed the presence of zno nps on the cgo nanosheets fig 2 b the xrd pattern of zno cgo nanohybrid fig 2c showed the diffraction peak recorded at 11 3 corresponding to the 001 plane due to the stacked cgo nanosheets furthermore the diffraction peaks were also obtained at 31 7 corresponding to 100 plane 34 3 corresponding to 002 plane 36 2 corresponding to 101 plane 47 5 corresponding to 102 plane 56 6 corresponding to 110 plane 62 8 corresponding to 103 plane 66 3 corresponding to 200 plane 67 9 corresponding to 112 plane and 69 1 corresponding to 201 plane it confirmed the wurtzite structure of zno nps jcpds no 36 1451 which were anchored on the cgo nanosheets 38 39 the atr ftir spectrum of zno cgo nanohybrid is shown in fig 2d the peaks appearing between 440 and 675 cm 1 related to the zn o stretching vibrations moreover the peaks recorded at 1056 1097 1243 1375 and 1450 cm 1 corresponded to the co stretching vibrations with coh bending a peak was recorded at 1577 cm 1 which signified the skeletal vibration of the cgo nanosheets most importantly the peaks appearing at 1659 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 indicated co stretching vibrations of cooh group which helped in controlled growth and uniform dispersal of zno nps over cgo nanosheets via complexation with zno atoms two more peaks also appeared at 2855 and 2928 cm 1 which indicated the ch stretching vibrations a peak appeared in the range of 3300 3600 cm 1 signified the oh group 40 the existence of these oxygen containing groups on cgo nanosheets acted as sites to form coordinate bonds with zno nps which resulted in the formation of zno cgo nanohybrid it is important to note that the peaks recorded for the nanohybrid in this study match with the literature reports 38 39 41 xps study was done on zno cgo nanohybrid to examine the chemical states of different elements present in the nanohybrid the xps spectra of c 1 s and zn 2p for zno cgo nanohybrid were recorded fig 3 the zn 2p spectrum fig 3 a displayed dominant peaks at 1022 3 ev corresponding to zn 2p3 2 and 1045 4 ev corresponding to zn 2p1 2 the appearance of these peaks indicated that zn was present in its oxidized state in the zno cgo nanohybrid 42 fig 3 b displays the c 1 s spectrum three peaks appeared at 284 6 ev corresponding to c c 286 2 ev corresponding to c oh and 289 7 ev corresponding to o c o 3 2 physicochemical characterization of hfms the section presents and discusses the results showing the effect of incorporating zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms on the morphology surface functionality hydrophilicity mechanical strength thermal stability porosity pore size surface charge and surface roughness of the hfms the sem images of different hfms are shown in fig 4 from the images it can observed that zogp hfms were comparatively more porous than pristine hfms it was also observed that the hfm samples exhibited a finger like structure which broadened as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid added in membranes increased moreover the sponge like structures also appeared in the outermost layer of zogp hfms the elemental mapping of p and zogp hfms was recorded which is shown in fig 5 c s and o being the constituents of pes are present in both the hfm samples however zn which is one of the characteristic elements of zno cgo nanohybrid zn was mapped in the elemental mapping of zogp hfms it can be seen that zn was uniformly distributed all over the zogp hfms which also confirmed the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms atr ftir spectra were recorded to study the surface functionality of hfms fig 6 a the representative peaks of p were recorded in all spectra as discussed in the previous study 32 43 moreover the representative peaks of zno cgo nanohybrid were also observed specifically between 440 and 750 cm 1 corresponding to zno stretching at 1410 cm 1 indicating coh and co bonds at 1680 cm 1 indicating carboxylic groups and between 3080 and 3500 cm 1 indicating oh groups thus the atr ftir study showed the surface functionality of zogp hfms with oxygen enriched groups due to the presence of the nanohybrid it also resulted in remarkable decrease in the water contact angles from 77 1 2 5 for p hfms to 56 2 1 4 for zogp 25 hfms to 35 3 1 1 for zogp 50 hfms fig 6b in other words the hydrophilicity significantly improved which helps in boosting the separation performance of the zogp hfms the mechanical strength of different hfm samples was examined by measuring young s moduli fig 6c the values of young s modulus for p zogp 25 and zogp 50 hfm samples were 310 6 6 8 mpa 358 3 7 4 mpa and 398 8 7 5 mpa respectively the values of young s modulus indicated that the mechanical strength of hfm samples improved remarkably here zno cgo nanohybrid acted as a reinforcement element in the polymer nanocomposite and due to the better interfacial interactions between the polymer pes chains and the nanohybrid zno cgo the mechanical strength of the polymer nanohybrid composite membranes zogp hfms increased similar trend was also observed for other polymer nanoparticles composite membranes in the literature 34 37 44 47 this also resulted in improved thermal stability of these membranes samples with the high thermal degradation temperature fig 6d the incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms resulted in their higher porosity than p hfms the highest porosity of 89 9 2 1 was measured for zogp 50 hfms table 2 the porosity values for p hfms was 61 5 1 4 and that for zogp 25 hfms was 81 1 1 9 this increase in porosity can be credited to the oxygen rich surface groups in zno cgo nanohybrid which enhanced the solvent exchange rate and contributed to the formation of pores in the membranes the membrane pore size was also measured for different hfm samples table 2 which indicated that these membranes exhibited nanoscale pores ranging between 5 8 nm moreover the zeta potential of membrane samples was also computed to examine their surface charge as shown in table 2 the embedding of nanohybrid in hfms showed a positive role in increasing the zeta potential for zogp hfms which will help the membranes in mitigating the fouling and enhancing the dye rejection via electrostatic interactions 48 surface roughness is responsible for membrane fouling it is reported in the literature 49 50 that the embedding of a hydrophilic nanocomposite in membranes lowers the surface roughness thereby helping in mitigation of the membrane fouling likewise in this study the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in membranes lowered their surface roughness the 3d afm images of surface topography of hfms are depicted in fig 7 the roughness was quantified and reported as root mean square roughness rrms and average roughness ravg table 3 rrms and ravg values clearly demonstrated that the surface roughness decreased in other words the surface smoothened as the amount of nanohybrid in hfms increased as shown earlier that the hydrophilic groups are present in zno cgo nanohybrid which contributed toward the uniform dispersion of zno cgo nanohybrid in the membrane matrix and altered the phase demixing between solvent and non solvent which led to smoothening of the surface of the zogp hfms 31 34 46 3 3 separation performance of hfms the pwp of different hfm samples was presented in fig 8 a it displays the effect of fouling on the values of pwp the pwp increased by almost 4 times as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms increased to 0 5 wt in other words the pwp for zogp 50 hfms with 0 5 wt zno cgo nanohybrid was 358 5 14 9 ml m2 h mmhg against p hfms value of pwp was 74 6 7 1 ml m2 h mmhg the pwp for zogp 25 hfms with 0 25 wt zno cgo nanohybrid was 229 3 13 4 ml m2 h mmhg clearly a significant increase in pwp value was measured as the zno cgo nanohybrid was added in hfms even after the fouling experiments the value of pwp followed the same order that is the pwp improved as the amount of zno cgo nanohybrid embedded in hfms increased the order of pwp after fouling experiments was zogp 50 hfms 353 1 14 7 ml m2 h mmhg followed by zogp 25 hfms 205 9 13 5 ml m2 h mmhg and p hfms 42 9 7 5 ml m2 h mmhg from these values of pwp the frr and fr values of these membrane samples was calculated fig 8b it was found that the frr value of zogp 50 hfms was 98 5 which was followed by zogp 25 hfms 89 8 and p hfms 57 5 the values of pwp and frr for zogp 50 hfms are better than the values reported for the metal oxide cnms incorporated polymeric membranes in the literature 20 21 30 51 53 thus the embedding of zno cgo nanohybrid in membranes improved their pwp and antifouling property this improvement can be attributed to the oxygen containing hydrophilic hydroxyl carbonyl and epoxy functional groups present in the zno cgo nanohybrid which resisted the attachment of fouling agents on the hfm surface thus the remarkably improved hydrophilicity as shown in section 3 2 of the zogp hfms resulted in their superior antifouling nature 54 the effect of incubating membrane samples with lake water was also studied by sem to evaluate their antifouling property as shown in fig 9 foulants were confluent on p hfms however as zno cgo nanohybrid was added in hfms the presence of foulants was limited a very few units of foulant was observed in zogp hfms this also indicated that the improved hydrophilicity of zogp hfms helped in restricting the adhesion of foulant on the surface of zogp hfms in other words the incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms imparted the oxygen enriched functional groups to the membrane surface which led to the formation of a hydration layer due to hydrogen bonding between these hydrophilic functional groups and water molecules this hydration layer acted as a shield which restricted the adsorption of the foulants on the membrane surface 55 the dye rejection performance of hfms was investigated by calculating rejection values for both the dyes fig 10 clearly the rejection of mb and rh b solutions improved significantly for zogp hfms the mb rejection values from mb spiked mq water for different hfm samples were 56 7 0 9 for p hfms 87 7 1 1 for zogp 25 hfms and 98 6 1 4 for zogp 50 hfms the mb rejection values from mb spiked lake water were 10 3 1 1 for p hfms 66 8 1 2 for zogp 25 hfms and 80 7 1 5 for zogp 50 hfms further the rh b rejection values from rh b spiked mq water were 52 7 0 7 for p hfms 85 5 0 8 for zogp 25 hfms and 98 5 1 1 for zogp 50 hfms their corresponding rejection values from rh b spiked lake water were 7 8 0 9 63 9 1 1 and 76 9 1 3 respectively from the data it is clear that among all the hfm samples zogp 50 hfms exhibited the outstanding dye removal while maintaining the pwp and antifouling property the superior dye removal performance of zogp 50 hfms can be credited to the hydrophilic oxygen enriched groups which were present on the membrane surface due to incorporation of zno cgo nanohybrid in hfms these groups imparted a negative charge to the membrane surface evident from the zeta potential values which helped in electrostatic interactions between the membrane surface and the cationic dyes mb and rh b 56 57 consequently a remarkably high removal of dyes was measured using modified zogp hfms the dye rejection values of the zogp 50 hfms were compared with the literature and it was observed that the rejection values were remarkably higher than the values shown by most of the literature reported membranes 56 58 63 and comparable to a few materials studied in the literature 48 64 65 the long term performance study of the superior membrane material zogp 50 hfms for 10 cycles is presented in fig 11 the data clearly indicated that there was no change in dye removal capacity of zogp 50 hfms i e dye rejection performance was maintained furthermore zogp 50 hfms demonstrated their excellent stability during the filtration experiments as the negligible leaching of the constituents zno nps and cgo nanosheets of zno cgo nanohybrid was observed in the feed tank and permeate it can be noted that there are many literature reports which discussed the leaching of zno nps from the membranes however their leaching did not occur in the present study which can be credited to the carboxylated go nanosheets for providing sufficient anchor sites for the attachment of zno nps the negligible leaching of nanohybrid from the zogp 50 hfms can also be attributed to the excellent dispersion of zno cgo nanohybrid in the polymer matrices and the excellent compatibility between polymer pes and nanohybrid zno cgo nanohybrid therefore the results of this long term study clearly demonstrated the superior performance stability of zogp 50 hfms thus this membrane material can be used for the practical applications 4 conclusions the novel polyethersulfone nanohybrid hfms were developed using zno nps decorated cgo nanosheets the zno cgo nanohybrid was predominantly hydrophilic in nature due to the oxygen enriched groups their incorporation in hfms resulted in enhanced thermal and mechanical 398 8 7 5 mpa stability improved hydrophilicity water contact angle 35 3 1 1 membrane porosity 89 9 2 1 and lowered surface roughness rrms 8 0 0 9 nm and ravg 6 4 0 7 nm remarkably the improvement in pwp antifouling property and rejection was achieved with zogp 50 hfms pes hfms with 0 5 wt zno cgo nanohybrid the pwp was 358 5 14 9 ml m2 h mmhg with flux recovery of 98 5 significantly high mb and rh b rejection values 98 6 1 4 and 98 5 1 1 respectively were measured for zogp 50 hfms thus cgo nanosheets provided a better platform for the uniform dispersion of zno nps which resulted in zno nps decorated cgo nanosheets these nanohybrid was highly effective in improving the overall properties of polymeric hfms with superior hydrophilicity pwp antibiofouling and dye removal thus enabling zogp hfms to be potential membranes for the separation and purification applications acknowledgments the wrcb iit bombay india is acknowledged for research grant the authors are

14411,the presence of pesticides in municipal wastewater and aquatic environments is showing an increasing trend and leading to adverse environmental and health effects the present study investigated the occurrence of pyrethroids in the municipal wastewater of tabriz a city in northwestern iran the performance of a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of pyrethroids was also investigated for this purpose lambda cyhalothrin cypermethrin permethrin and deltamethrin in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant in summer and fall seasons were measured the toxicity of target pesticides on rainbow trout and daphnia magna was also investigated by a new modified index of environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants the results show that permethrin was the dominant pesticide in the samples in both seasons with the highest detected concentration in the influent wastewater of 1838 ng l furthermore cypermethrin was among the highly detected pesticides with concentration as high as 1742 ng l it was also found that 77 and 85 of permethrin as the dominant pesticide was removed in summer and fall seasons respectively investigation of the risk of pesticides presence in the effluent presents a very high risk to the aquatic environment which was obtained by calculating the proposed index although there is a high removal efficiency of pesticides in wastewater treatment plant higher toxicity and detection frequency of permethrin in the collected samples is the main reason of high risk to the aquatic environment keywords emerging contaminants merpwi permethrin tabriz wcsi 1 introduction pesticides together with pharmaceuticals hormones artificial sweeteners etc are collectively known as emerging organic compounds eocs the presence of eocs in municipal wastewater is of great concern that has attracted more interest in recent years 1 3 some investigations have evaluated the occurrence and fate of eocs in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps 4 5 and their environmental impacts 6 pesticides are among the eocs threatening the aquatic life and environment which have been investigated by several researchers 7 the occurrence and removal of fungicides in a municipal wwtp 8 and the presence of pesticides in surface and groundwater 9 14 soils 15 20 and sediments 21 have been reported in the literature it has been reported that conventional wastewater systems are not capable of completely removing eocs 3 in a study conducted in municipal and industrial wwtps with conventional secondary and even tertiary treatment processes the poor removal efficiencies of pesticides were observed 6 to the best of our knowledge almost all the studies were conducted in case of organophosphate organochlorine and carbamate pesticides occurrence and removal in wwtps the use of pyrethroids increased over time due to their higher effectiveness and lower toxicity compared to the older insecticides such as the organophosphate organochlorine and carbamate ones 22 consequently they became one of the three major classes of pesticides cornering about 38 of the global market in 2015 23 according to tang et al 2018 the global market value of pyrethroids was 1 633 03 million in 2016 in general two kinds of pyrethroids are available agricultural and urban pyrethroids in addition to their widespread use for agricultural purposes they play a major role in protecting public health indoor and outdoor pest control direct spraying into sewage manholes especially in warm seasons etc personal care head lice control shampoos etc grass management parks and recreational facilities and ornamental and potted plants as well as industrial vegetation control etc 6 it has also been reported that cypermethrin deltamethrin permethrin and lambda cyhalothrin are the pyrethroids most widely used in recent years 22 pyrethroids are very stable to light and temperature 24 not very soluble in water and have a high tendency to accumulate in aquatic organisms through the food chain 22 25 although initial structures of some pyrethroids may be degraded in the environment degradation by products and some of the recently produced pyrethroids could be present in the environment for a few months 25 26 recently higher aquatic risks associated with pyrethroid applications in comparison with older insecticides were documented due to their high toxicity and long term adverse effects 22 23 their effects on the nervous immune cardiovascular genetic and male reproductive systems have been pointed out in a recently published review paper 22 according to a review conducted by tang et al 2018 the concentrations of pyrethroids found in municipal wastewater urban runoff polluted pond water river water and seawater were 0 013 to 1 246 μg l 0 003 to 0 259 μg l 12 470 to 19 080 μg l none detected nd to 13 000 μg l and nd to 16 2 μg l respectively the most frequently detected pyrethroid in surface water was cypermethrin however permethrin the most widely used urban pyrethroid was the dominant pyrethroid observed in the same media based on the same report pyrethroid pesticide residues from nd to 375 7 μg g and nd to 1 184 μg g were measured in sediment and soil samples respectively 22 this study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of the most widely used urban pyrethroids in municipal wastewater of tabriz city in 2018 their seasonal variations the removal efficiencies in a wwtp and the environmental relevance to the aquatic environment the modified environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants index merpwi and the water cycle spreading index wcsi were used to assess the environmental impact in this study 6 the present study proposes that the detection frequency must be considered for calculating erpwi actually this is the first study on the presence of urban pyrethroids and their fate in a municipal wwtp as well the indices of merpwi and wcsi were considered for the first time on the concentrations of pyrethroid pesticides in a municipal wwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in a municipal wwtp with a

injection into the separation system this solution was used for quality control qc of the separation system and also for calculating the enrichment factors efs and extraction recoveries ers 2 4 extraction method the air assisted liquid liquid microextraction aallme method was used for the extraction of target pesticides in this study 28 in the practical procedures 7 ml of deionized water was spiked with various concentrations of target pesticides 0 2 20 μg l for calibration or each collected wastewater sample was transferred into a 10 ml glass tube with conical bottom then 30 μl of carbon tetrachloride was added and the mixture was rapidly sucked into a 5 ml glass syringe and injected into the tube using a syringe and needle this action led to the fast extraction of pesticides into small drops of extraction solvent the extraction solvent was then settled down at the bottom of the tube after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 7 min the total volume of the sedimented phase was transferred to a microtube using a 50 μl syringe and evaporated to complete dryness under a nitrogen stream after some time the residue was resolved in 200 μl of methanol by vortexing it for 1 min and

the ranges of 37 6 149 9 ng l and 125 4 499 8 ng l respectively table 2 2 7 environmental impacts merpwi and wcsi were used in assessing the environmental impact in the present study 6 the merpw index embraces the presence and removal of target pesticides in wwtp as well as their toxicity against the two aquatic organisms of fish and daphnia magna it is calculated using the following equation merpwi tup srem df 1000 where tup is the target pesticide concentration in the effluent of the wwtp mg l end point corresponding lc50 mg l srem is the removal score of the target pesticide in the wwtp and df is the detection frequency according to the method described by köck schulmeyer et al the erpwi is classified as follows negligible 0 001 low 0 001 to 0 01 medium 0 01 1 high 1 10 and very high 10 the lc50 values of target pesticides against fish and daphnia magna are given in table 1 the srem values are 1 0 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 for the removal percentages of 0 0 25 25 50 50 75 and 75 100 respectively the wcsi was also estimated according to the proportion of the effluent concentrations and the relative removal in the wwtp 6 in case that the mean effluent concentration of a compound was below the lod half of the lod was used as the concentration for calculating the wcsi 29 2 8 statistical analysis for data description the median mean and sd of each variable were reported data normality was evaluated using the shapiro wilk test according to the results of the normality test and because of the strong correlation existing between input and output values the paired t test for normally distributed variables and the wilcoxon signed ranks test for non normal variables were used to compare input and output amounts ibm spss version 25 was used for data analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesticide concentrations in wastewater before investigating the residual pesticides concentration in the influent and effluent of wwtp the general characteristics of wastewater was investigated the detailed characteristics of the influent and effluent of the wwtp during the study period are presented in table 3 table 4 represents the detection frequency median mean and maximum concentrations of the target pesticides in both influent and effluent samples the results showed that permethrin was the most highly detected pesticide found in 80 and 100 of the influent samples in the summer and fall seasons respectively while cypermethrin and deltamethrin were found in 13 3 and lambda cyhalothrin was observed only in 6 7 of the influent summer samples cypermethrin deltamethrin and lambda cyhalothrin were not detected in any samples from the fall season the maximum individual concentrations of 1838 ng l in summer and 492 ng l in fall for permethrin were observed in the influent samples the higher detection frequency of permethrin could be due to its widespread use in public health programs such as mosquito reduction programs as a pediculicide for the treatment of head lice and scabies cream or lotion on in many food crops livestock and livestock dwellings modes of transportation buildings and numerous residential use sites including use in outdoor and indoor spaces pets and clothing etc 30 the main reason for the presence of permethrin in wastewater in the fall season could be due to the higher prevalence of student head lice in the school environments permethrin in concentrations ranging from 200 to 400 ng l was also reported as the dominant pyrethroid in the wastewater of sacramento 31 as is represented in table 4 except for permethrin the other monitored pesticides were not detected in the fall season there is no statistically significant difference between any detected values in either summer or fall however the average concentration of permethrin in the summer is higher than that of the fall and this shows a seasonal pattern this is due to the fact that the use of pesticides is greater in the summer than in the fall therefore their occurrence in the environment is frequently observed in a study conducted in sacramento a seasonal pattern was observed for bifenthrin as a pyrethroid pesticide with a seasonal peak in summer 31 comparing the results of the present study with other similar investigations showed that the average concentration of pyrethroids in the influent of the wwtp in the present study was higher than those reported in the literature table 5 for instance the maximum concentration of pyrethroids in a constructed wetland influent in california was reported to be 337 3 ng l 32 however as is shown in table 5 the maximum value of 1838 ng l was recorded for the influent wastewater samples in the present study higher values of pyrethroids compared to other pesticides could be attributed to their extensive consumption for both agricultural and non agricultural purposes which is showing an increasing trend due to their higher effectiveness and lower toxicity compared to the older pesticides 22 in addition the higher values of pesticides found by the present study could be due to the direct spraying of pesticides into wastewater manholes to control pests 3 2 pesticides removal in wwtp the performance of wwtp was evaluated based on pesticides removal fig 2 illustrates the average efficiency of pyrethroid removal in the wwtp the results show that there is a significant difference between the concentrations detected in the influent and effluent of wwtp p 0 05 as is shown in the figure the highest removal efficiency was reached in the case of pyrethroid of which almost 80 of permethrin in the influent was removed across the activated sludge process in general biological treatments in case of permethrin are capable to achieve removal efficiencies ranging from 60 to 99 in the conventional activated sludge process 33 the performance of the studied wwtp in pesticide removal was similar to that reported from an activated sludge plant in spain comprising a primary sedimentation and conventional activated sludge system with an overall removal of 88 34 the analysis of daily composite samples in the present study showed that almost all of the wwtp influent samples contained permethrin in both summer and fall seasons adaptation and acclimation of a biomass to a contaminant could be reached by continuous exposure of the biomass to the contaminant 35 therefore the higher removal efficiency of permethrin in activated sludge could be attributed to the continuous exposure of the biomass to this pesticide however the octanol water partition coefficient kow of permethrin is relatively high log kow 6 5 and it is considered to have high lipophilicity log kow 6 36 therefore the concentration of permethrin in sludge is expected to be high and the bioaccumulation of permethrin could occur in the wwtp 34 3 3 merpw index risk assessment and the authorization of pesticides for agricultural and non agricultural uses are of great importance a large number of criteria for pesticide use must be met to ensure the protection of workers consumers and the environment 37 the consumption of pesticides considering their characteristics may lead to the contamination of water soil or other vegetation in addition to killing insects or weeds pesticides may cause the intoxication of other organisms such as fish birds beneficial insects and non target plants therefore the environmental risk of pesticides for non target organisms must be assessed in this study a modified erpwi was used to calculate the toxicity of each monitored pesticide for fish and daphnia magna table 6 gives the removal scores srem based on the removal rate percentages and the classiﬁcation of merpwi values 6 fig 3 illustrates the merpwi values for the investigated pesticides in the present study as shown in this figure the merpwi for all pesticides in the case of daphnia magna falls into a very high risk level the highest value of merpwi was calculated for permethrin in the case of daphnia magna which could be attributed to the higher detection frequency of permethrin in wastewater samples and the higher toxicity of permethrin for daphnia magna lc50 70 ng l the merpwi was lower in rainbow trout which are more resistant to changes in water chemistry than in daphnia magna however the calculated merpwi indicated high risk levels for cypermethrin deltamethrin and permethrin and a very high risk level for lambda cyhalothrin the risk level for lambda cyhalothrin in the case of rainbow trout could be attributed to its lower removal efficiency in the wwtp according to the merpwi permethrin was found to be the most relevant pesticide in the monitored wastewater which was highly threatening to the downstream aquatic life no similar study has used the merpwi to calculate the risk of pyrethroids in aquatic environment however köck schulmeyer et al 2013 reported an erpwi value of about 100 ng l for diazinon in wwtp effluent which is almost 2 5 times lower than the value obtained for permethrin in the present study therefore residual permethrin in the wwtp effluent could have an adverse effect on downstream aquatic organisms the wcsi was also calculated for the evaluation of pesticides discharged with treated municipal wastewater in receiving surface waters this index was used to evaluate pesticides with respect to their potential to spread in the aquatic environment and along partly closed water cycles the wcsi calculations were based on the statistical mean concentrations of the influent and effluent of investigated pesticides and they were obtained by dividing the mean residual values in the effluent by the average removal efficiencies 29 according to reemtsma et al 2006 higher wcsi value indicates a higher potential for a pollutant to spread in the aquatic environment and thus higher environmental concentrations fig 4 illustrates the wcsi values calculated for the target pesticides in the current study as shown in fig 4 the highest wcsi value was calculated for lambda cyhalothrin which is due to the lower removal efficiency in the wwtp the lower removal rate of lambda cyhalothrin could also be attributed to its lower detection frequency in influent and consequently the lower acclimation of biomass for lambda cyhalothrin biodegradation köck schulmeyer et al 2013 reported a wcsi value above 100 ng l for diazinon which is higher than the values obtained in the present study it should be noted that wcsi is largely affected by the proper operation of the wwtp therefore higher wcsi values could be due to some working malfunctions of the wwtp or less probably the highly variable composition of influent wastewaters 38 4 conclusions due to the improving trend of pesticide consumption the presence of pesticides in aquatic environments is inevitable the present study investigated the occurrence and environmental impacts of pyrethroids in aquatic environments in tabriz iran lambda cyhalothrin cypermethrin permethrin and deltamethrin were measured in both influent and effluent from the wwtp in summer and fall seasons the results show that permethrin was the highly detected pesticide in the collected samples detection frequencies of the pesticides were included in environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants index for environmental risk assessment of the pyrethroids according to the results in the current study permethrin is the most highly detected pesticide in wastewater imposing very high risks to the aquatic environments which is due to its toxicity its removal rate and detection frequency in wastewater samples based on the results it was clearly found that merpwi could be used as a reliable index for investigating the risk level of contaminates for aquatic organisms in the effluent of a wwtp for reducing the pesticides risks to the aquatic environment and human pest control strategies should be taken into account to reduce the pesticides consumption pesticide consumption should be based on the continuous monitoring of the pests population and types and then appropriate pesticides along with adequate amount of pesticides should be applied for pest control compliance with ethical standards the local ethical review committee of the tabriz university of medical sciences approved the study ir tbzmed rec 1396 356 conflict

14411,the presence of pesticides in municipal wastewater and aquatic environments is showing an increasing trend and leading to adverse environmental and health effects the present study investigated the occurrence of pyrethroids in the municipal wastewater of tabriz a city in northwestern iran the performance of a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of pyrethroids was also investigated for this purpose lambda cyhalothrin cypermethrin permethrin and deltamethrin in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant in summer and fall seasons were measured the toxicity of target pesticides on rainbow trout and daphnia magna was also investigated by a new modified index of environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants the results show that permethrin was the dominant pesticide in the samples in both seasons with the highest detected concentration in the influent wastewater of 1838 ng l furthermore cypermethrin was among the highly detected pesticides with concentration as high as 1742 ng l it was also found that 77 and 85 of permethrin as the dominant pesticide was removed in summer and fall seasons respectively investigation of the risk of pesticides presence in the effluent presents a very high risk to the aquatic environment which was obtained by calculating the proposed index although there is a high removal efficiency of pesticides in wastewater treatment plant higher toxicity and detection frequency of permethrin in the collected samples is the main reason of high risk to the aquatic environment keywords emerging contaminants merpwi permethrin tabriz wcsi 1 introduction pesticides together with pharmaceuticals hormones artificial sweeteners etc are collectively known as emerging organic compounds eocs the presence of eocs in municipal wastewater is of great concern that has attracted more interest in recent years 1 3 some investigations have evaluated the occurrence and fate of eocs in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps 4 5 and their environmental impacts 6 pesticides are among the eocs threatening the aquatic life and environment which have been investigated by several researchers 7 the occurrence and removal of fungicides in a municipal wwtp 8 and the presence of pesticides in surface and groundwater 9 14 soils 15 20 and sediments 21 have been reported in the literature it has been reported that conventional wastewater systems are not capable of completely removing eocs 3 in a study conducted in municipal and industrial wwtps with conventional secondary and even tertiary treatment processes the poor removal efficiencies of pesticides were observed 6 to the best of our knowledge almost all the studies were conducted in case of organophosphate organochlorine and carbamate pesticides occurrence and removal in wwtps the use of pyrethroids increased over time due to their higher effectiveness and lower toxicity compared to the older insecticides such as the organophosphate organochlorine and carbamate ones 22 consequently they became one of the three major classes of pesticides cornering about 38 of the global market in 2015 23 according to tang et al 2018 the global market value of pyrethroids was 1 633 03 million in 2016 in general two kinds of pyrethroids are available agricultural and urban pyrethroids in addition to their widespread use for agricultural purposes they play a major role in protecting public health indoor and outdoor pest control direct spraying into sewage manholes especially in warm seasons etc personal care head lice control shampoos etc grass management parks and recreational facilities and ornamental and potted plants as well as industrial vegetation control etc 6 it has also been reported that cypermethrin deltamethrin permethrin and lambda cyhalothrin are the pyrethroids most widely used in recent years 22 pyrethroids are very stable to light and temperature 24 not very soluble in water and have a high tendency to accumulate in aquatic organisms through the food chain 22 25 although initial structures of some pyrethroids may be degraded in the environment degradation by products and some of the recently produced pyrethroids could be present in the environment for a few months 25 26 recently higher aquatic risks associated with pyrethroid applications in comparison with older insecticides were documented due to their high toxicity and long term adverse effects 22 23 their effects on the nervous immune cardiovascular genetic and male reproductive systems have been pointed out in a recently published review paper 22 according to a review conducted by tang et al 2018 the concentrations of pyrethroids found in municipal wastewater urban runoff polluted pond water river water and seawater were 0 013 to 1 246 μg l 0 003 to 0 259 μg l 12 470 to 19 080 μg l none detected nd to 13 000 μg l and nd to 16 2 μg l respectively the most frequently detected pyrethroid in surface water was cypermethrin however permethrin the most widely used urban pyrethroid was the dominant pyrethroid observed in the same media based on the same report pyrethroid pesticide residues from nd to 375 7 μg g and nd to 1 184 μg g were measured in sediment and soil samples respectively 22 this study was carried out to evaluate the occurrence of the most widely used urban pyrethroids in municipal wastewater of tabriz city in 2018 their seasonal variations the removal efficiencies in a wwtp and the environmental relevance to the aquatic environment the modified environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants index merpwi and the water cycle spreading index wcsi were used to assess the environmental impact in this study 6 the present study proposes that the detection frequency must be considered for calculating erpwi actually this is the first study on the presence of urban pyrethroids and their fate in a municipal wwtp as well the indices of merpwi and wcsi were considered for the first time on the concentrations of pyrethroid pesticides in a municipal wwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in a municipal wwtp with a maximum capacity of 129 600 m3 d operated in tabriz the capital city of east azerbaijan province northwestern iran the plant consists of coarse screens grit chambers primary sedimentation tanks

embraces the presence and removal of target pesticides in wwtp as well as their toxicity against the two aquatic organisms of fish and daphnia magna it is calculated using the following equation merpwi tup srem df 1000 where tup is the target pesticide concentration in the effluent of the wwtp mg l end point corresponding lc50 mg l srem is the removal score of the target pesticide in the wwtp and df is the detection frequency according to the method described by köck schulmeyer et al the erpwi is classified as follows negligible 0 001 low 0 001 to 0 01 medium 0 01 1 high 1 10 and very high

discussion 3 1 pesticide concentrations in wastewater before investigating the residual pesticides concentration in the influent and effluent of wwtp the general characteristics of wastewater was investigated the detailed characteristics of the influent and effluent of the wwtp during the study period are presented in table 3 table 4 represents the detection frequency median mean and maximum concentrations of the target pesticides in both influent and effluent samples the results showed that permethrin was the most highly detected pesticide found in 80 and 100 of the influent samples in the summer and fall seasons respectively while cypermethrin and deltamethrin were found in 13 3 and lambda cyhalothrin was observed only in 6 7 of the influent summer samples cypermethrin deltamethrin and lambda cyhalothrin were not detected in any samples from the fall season the maximum individual concentrations of 1838 ng l in summer and 492 ng l in fall for permethrin were observed in the influent samples the higher detection frequency of permethrin could be due to its widespread use in public health programs such as mosquito reduction programs as a pediculicide for the treatment of head lice and scabies cream or lotion on in many food crops livestock and livestock dwellings modes of transportation buildings and numerous residential use sites including use in outdoor and indoor spaces pets and clothing etc 30 the main reason for the presence of permethrin in wastewater in the fall season could be due to the higher prevalence of student head lice in the school environments permethrin in concentrations ranging from 200 to 400 ng l was also reported as the dominant pyrethroid in the wastewater of sacramento 31 as is represented in table 4 except for permethrin the other monitored pesticides were not detected in the fall season there is no statistically significant difference between any detected values in either summer or fall however the average concentration of permethrin in the summer is higher than that of the fall and this shows a seasonal pattern this is due to the fact that the use of pesticides is greater in the summer than in the fall therefore their occurrence in the environment is frequently observed in a study conducted in sacramento a seasonal pattern was observed for bifenthrin as a pyrethroid pesticide with a seasonal peak in summer 31 comparing the results of the present study with other similar investigations showed that the average concentration of pyrethroids in the influent of the wwtp in the present study was higher than those reported in the literature table 5 for instance the maximum concentration of pyrethroids in a constructed wetland influent in california was reported to be 337 3 ng l 32 however as is shown in table 5 the maximum value of 1838 ng l was recorded for the influent wastewater samples in the present study higher values of pyrethroids compared to other pesticides could be attributed to their extensive consumption for both agricultural and non agricultural purposes which is showing an increasing trend due to their higher effectiveness and lower toxicity compared to the older pesticides 22 in addition the higher values of pesticides found by the present study could be due to the direct spraying of pesticides into wastewater manholes to control pests 3 2 pesticides removal in wwtp the performance of wwtp was evaluated based on pesticides removal fig 2 illustrates the average efficiency of pyrethroid removal in the wwtp the results show that there is a significant difference between the concentrations detected in the influent and effluent of wwtp p 0 05 as is shown in the figure the highest removal efficiency was reached in the case of pyrethroid of which almost 80 of permethrin in the influent was removed across the activated sludge process in general biological treatments in case of permethrin are capable to achieve removal efficiencies ranging from 60 to 99 in the conventional activated sludge process 33 the performance of the studied wwtp in pesticide removal was similar to that reported from an activated sludge plant in spain comprising a primary sedimentation and conventional activated sludge system with an overall removal of 88 34 the analysis of daily composite samples in the present study showed that almost all of the wwtp influent samples contained permethrin in both summer and fall seasons adaptation and acclimation of a biomass to a contaminant could be reached by continuous exposure of the biomass to the contaminant 35 therefore the higher removal efficiency of permethrin in activated sludge could be attributed to the continuous exposure of the biomass to this pesticide however the octanol water partition coefficient kow of permethrin is relatively high log kow 6 5 and it is considered to have high lipophilicity log kow 6 36 therefore the concentration of permethrin in sludge is expected to be high and the bioaccumulation of permethrin could occur in the wwtp 34 3 3 merpw index risk assessment and the authorization of pesticides for agricultural and non agricultural uses are of great importance a large number of criteria for pesticide use must be met to ensure the protection of workers consumers and the environment 37 the consumption of pesticides considering their characteristics may lead to the contamination of water soil or other vegetation in addition to killing insects or weeds pesticides may cause the intoxication of other organisms such as fish birds beneficial insects and non target plants therefore the environmental risk of pesticides for non target organisms must be assessed in this study a modified erpwi was used to calculate the toxicity of each monitored pesticide for fish and daphnia magna table 6 gives the removal scores srem based on the removal rate percentages and the classiﬁcation of merpwi values 6 fig 3 illustrates the merpwi values for the investigated pesticides in the present study as shown in this figure the merpwi for all pesticides in the case of daphnia magna falls into a very high risk level the highest value of merpwi was calculated for permethrin in the case of daphnia magna which could be attributed to the higher detection frequency of permethrin in wastewater samples and the higher toxicity of permethrin for daphnia magna lc50 70 ng l the merpwi was lower in rainbow trout which are more resistant to changes in water chemistry than in daphnia magna however the calculated merpwi indicated high risk levels for cypermethrin deltamethrin and permethrin and a very high risk level for lambda cyhalothrin the risk level for lambda cyhalothrin in the case of rainbow trout could be attributed to its lower removal efficiency in the wwtp according to the merpwi permethrin was found to be the most relevant pesticide in the monitored wastewater which was highly threatening to the downstream aquatic life no similar study has used the merpwi to calculate the risk of pyrethroids in aquatic environment however köck schulmeyer et al 2013 reported an erpwi value of about 100 ng l for diazinon in wwtp effluent which is almost 2 5 times lower than the value obtained for permethrin in the present study therefore residual permethrin in the wwtp effluent could have an adverse effect on downstream aquatic organisms the wcsi was also calculated for the evaluation of pesticides discharged with treated municipal wastewater in receiving surface waters this index was used to evaluate pesticides with respect to their potential to spread in the aquatic environment and along partly closed water cycles the wcsi calculations were based on the statistical mean concentrations of the influent and effluent of investigated pesticides and they were obtained by dividing the mean residual values in the effluent by the average removal efficiencies 29 according to reemtsma et al 2006 higher wcsi value indicates a higher potential for a pollutant to spread in the aquatic environment and thus higher environmental concentrations fig 4 illustrates the wcsi values calculated for the target pesticides in the current study as shown in fig 4 the highest wcsi value was calculated for lambda cyhalothrin which is due to the lower removal efficiency in the wwtp the lower removal rate of lambda cyhalothrin could also be attributed to its lower detection frequency in influent and consequently the lower acclimation of biomass for lambda cyhalothrin biodegradation köck schulmeyer et al 2013 reported a wcsi value above 100 ng l for diazinon which is higher than the values obtained in the present study it should be noted that wcsi is largely affected by the proper operation of the wwtp therefore higher wcsi values could be due to some working malfunctions of the wwtp or less probably the highly variable composition of influent wastewaters 38 4 conclusions due to the improving trend of pesticide consumption the presence of pesticides in aquatic environments is inevitable the present study investigated the occurrence and environmental impacts of pyrethroids in aquatic environments in tabriz iran lambda cyhalothrin cypermethrin permethrin and deltamethrin were measured in both influent and effluent from the wwtp in summer and fall seasons the results show that permethrin was the highly detected pesticide in the collected samples detection frequencies of the pesticides were included in environmental relevance of pesticides from wastewater treatment plants index for environmental risk assessment of the pyrethroids according to the results in the current study permethrin is the most highly detected pesticide in wastewater imposing very high risks to the aquatic environments which is due to its toxicity its removal rate and detection frequency in wastewater samples based on the results it was clearly found that merpwi could be used as a reliable index for investigating the risk level of contaminates for aquatic organisms in the effluent of a wwtp for reducing the pesticides risks to the aquatic environment and human pest control strategies should be taken into account to reduce the pesticides consumption pesticide consumption should be based on the continuous monitoring of the pests population and types and then appropriate pesticides along with adequate amount of pesticides

14412,in the current study polypyrrole ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized and applied for the removal of al 3 metal ions from the aqueous medium the nanocomposite was characterized using several analytical techniques such as sem tem ftir xrd edax and bet the results showed that the synthesized composite has an average diameter of 81 nm bet surface area of 49 55 and 19 44 m2 g before and after adsorption respectively verified that al 3 was adsorbed by ppy fe3o4 the effect of main operating parameters including ph value contact time target pollutant concentration adsorbent dosage temperature and competing ions were examined al 3 adsorption was strongly dependent on solution ph the maximum adsorption of 82 was observed at ph 3 the uptake of al 3 onto ppy fe3o4 was rapid and equilibrium established within 20 min adsorbate concentration and adsorbent dosage of 5 μg ml and 100 μg ml resulted in the highest al 3 adsorption furthermore adsorbent reusability was tested and it was shown that after five times recycling the removal efficiency was still above 50 the maximum adsorption efficiency of 100 7 mg g was achieved in the current study the presence of fe 2 na nh4 and so4 2 did not reduce adsorption efficiency which is indicative of the high selectivity of the prepared adsorbent equilibrium data were in good accordance with the freundlich model the obtained results revealed that pseudo second model is the best one because of the greatest r2 value 0 9905 and it suggested that the adsorption mechanism follow chemisorption mechanism thermodynamic parameters such as δ g δ s a n d δ h were estimated for the adsorption study and suggested that the adsorption was exothermic and maximum al 3 adsorption occurred at 20 c consequently ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite could be utilized as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent for the removal of al 3 ions from aqueous solutions keywords adsorption aluminum wastewater treatment polypyrrole dispersive solid phase extraction 1 introduction there is no any doubt that urbanization and industrialization two main consequences of the industrial revolution have brought easy life as well as life satisfaction and long living for human beings however environmental pollution and more importantly water contamination is the major drawback of this phenomenon which cannot be neglected anymore 1 2 industrial effluents contain a wide variety of toxic organic and inorganic chemicals that are freely entered into the environment due to the inability of the present conventional wastewater treatment plants in cities and industrial estates 3 5 among so many different constituents in industrial wastewaters heavy metals are considered as one of the most hazardous ones electroplating welding battery industry pesticides mining textile paper industries electroplating wood processing tannery industries and refineries are the main source of heavy metals generation and release in the water bodies 6 7 many studies confirm the presence of heavy metals in soil water and sediment of rivers 6 8 11 although a certain amount of heavy metal is beneficial for human excess amount leads to severe health effects including muscular stiffness renal and liver disturbances cancer hypertension vomiting and sometimes death 9 12 13 aluminum the third abundant element after oxygen and silicon have been considerably used in human activities including construction packaging paper industry dye production space industries pharmaceutical drugs car industry and cosmetic industry since its discovery 14 17 however it should not be forgotten that aluminum is a heavy metal with severe environmental impacts that may enter the aquatic media including surface waters and more importantly drinking water through effluents of the mentions industries alzheimer s disease root growth inhibition and nutrient imbalance in plants lou gehring s disease senile dementia human cancer and crop productivity limitation are the main challenges related to exposure of high amount of aluminum 15 18 19 martyn et al have proved that in districts with high al 3 concentration alzheimer s disease was highly common 20 moreover previous studies have confirmed that al ions are harmful to fish zooplankton cyanobacteria water weeds and algae 21 it is noteworthy saying that al based coagulants have been extensively used to as enhance removal of colloids and suspended particles in municipal water treatment plants mwtps in spite of the fact that al 3 is separated through sedimentation tanks or filtration process a variable amount of al 3 ions could be detected in the final produced drinking water that resulted in adverse long term consequences for humans there is considerable concern throughout the world over the levels of aluminum found in drinking water sources and treated water the epa has set the secondary permissible levels of aluminum at 0 05 to 0 20 mg l 22 in the case of canada and sweden it is 0 12 mg l on the basis of the above considerations proper elimination of al 3 from aqueous media is of great importance to preserve human health in case of heavy metals removal various chemical biological and physical methods such as ion exchange the electrochemical techniques adsorption advanced oxidation processes chemical precipitation and microbial system and have been used 23 generally utilization of chemical and biological methods is merely restricted because of the hard operation high chemical demand generation of new secondary contaminant or fluctuation in the efficiency of the system 24 26 while physical methods are of great interest to remove heavy metals due to their minimum usage of chemical reagents high removal efficiency as well as facile operation 27 28 among various physical methods proposed the adsorption process has gained much attention recently in terms of high flexibility in operation and design along with being economically feasible and insensitivity to toxic pollutants 29 30 various adsorbents including carbon active carbon nanotubes agricultural waste material industrial waste and bioadsorbent have been examined for heavy metals removal 23 in recent years conductive polymers have displayed better removal efficiency adsorption capacity thermal stability selectivity granulometric properties insolubility in water and reproducibility when compared to traditional adsorbents 31 polypyrrole a promising conductive polymer consists of a five membered heterocyclic ring have been candidated as a suitable adsorbent because of the owning large number of positively nitrogen atoms 32 33 in order to improve the adsorption efficiency materials containing oxygen or and nitrogen groups must be introduced to polypyrrole which resulted in the generation of a nanocomposite material based on polypyrrole in this direction modification of polypyrrole with various materials to prepare distinctive composites have been reported 33 34 recently the application of magnetic science has been of interest in water and wastewater treatment especially for adsorption methods magnetic adsorbent a combination of an adsorbent and fe3o4 as magnetic provides the opportunity to separate pollutants from the solution without further preparation such as filtration or centrifugation 35 in addition magnetic adsorbent supplies large surface area along with appropriate dispersion in the solution the above mentioned advantages have led to the utilization of magnetic adsorbent in studies in an overview various nanocomposites based polypyrrole ppy has been suggested by the researchers in this research work fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized based on the electro oxidation methods 36 37 in order to improve adsorption efficiency fe3o4 was coated with ppy and a magnetic adsorbent was generated the effects of operational parameters including ph value contact time target pollutant concentration adsorbent dosage temperature and competing ions were examined adsorbent reusability and treatment of real wastewater was also studied kinetic models by using pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models were employed to understand the adsorption process adsorption equilibrium data were fitted with isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin to describe the adsorption mechanism thermodynamic parameters were also calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment pyrrole c4h5n ethanol c2h5oh iron chloride fecl2 4h2o ammonium chloride nh4cl copper sulfate cuso4 5h2o aluminum nitrate al no3 9h2o and dimethylamin hydrochloride c2h8cln were supplied by merck germany all the chemicals used during the study were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification solutions were prepared using deionized water sem model tescan vegu ii was employed to identify the surface structure and the presence of porosity on the synthesized adsorbent the remained al 3 concentration in the solution after the adsorption process was determined by icp ms model icps 7000 ver2 shimadzu company ultrasonic apparatus model eurosonic italy was employed for adsorbent activation power supply ax510metrix and ph meter model 691 wagtech company were used 2 2 preparation of the fe3o4 nanoparticles the electrochemical method was used for fe3o4 nanoparticles synthesis cathode and anode material were both chosen to be aluminum in ratio 4 to 1 respectively surface of the electrodes were washed with ethanol to remove any impurities electrolyte solution was a mixture of the dimethylamin hydrochloride and deionized water the electrochemical cell electrolyte solution and electrodes was placed in a thermostatic bath at a fixed temperature of 50 c the voltage applied to the system was 8 v at the initial step of the reaction electrolyte is completely colorless and by applying the desired voltage its color will change to brown and then black this phenomenon confirms the generation of the fe3o4 particles reaction time was set at 1800s an external magnetic field was utilized to separate black residue from the solution nanomaterial syntheses in the presence of surfactants led to nanomaterials with lower diameter and prevent agglomeration therefore polypyrrole synthesis was done in fe3o4 suspension in tetramethylammonium hydroxide ch3 4noh tmaoh solution tmaoh is a surfactant which creates an electrostatic force to repulse nanoparticles from each other and prevent magnetic particles agglomeration and clumping 38 the obtained material was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c 2 3 preparation of the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites the ppy fe3o4 magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization technique described in previous studies 39 in a typical polymerization technique 0 4 g of fe3o4 was added to a 80 ml deionized water and then ultrasonicated for 10 min for better dispersion of fe3o4 in the solution 6 g of fecl3 oxidant was added to the solution containing fe3o4 and was shaken for 30 min 0 8 ml pyrrole was syringed to the obtained mixture and then it was kept under constant shaking for 3 h at ambient temperature acetone was added to the solution to prevent further reaction the black powder nanocomposite obtained was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate became colorless and thereafter washed with acetone finally the obtained nanocomposite was dried at 100 c for 6 h under vacuum this adsorbent is called core shell ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite the preparation of the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites is graphically represented in fig 1 2 4 adsorption procedure in the present study adsorption of al 3 by ppy fe3o4 adsorbent was tested first a stock solution of aluminum nitrate at a concentration level of 1000 μg ml was prepared and by dilution desired al 3 solutions were taken all the experiments were tested at a 10 ml erlenmeyer flask which was placed in a water bath to keep the temperature constant to reach the maximum adsorption efficiency optimum values of ph 1 7 contact time 5 45 min initial al concentration 1 40 μg ml adsorbent dosage 50 500 μg ml and temperature 20 50 c were examined ph of the solution was adjusted by 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh under optimum conditions the effect of fe 2 na nh4 and so4 2 on the adsorption process was studied similarly ppy fe3o4 adsorbent reusability was tested to figure out the fluctuation of removal efficiency during the adsorption process finally an actual wastewater from a factory of aluminum was taken to evaluate the adsorption process in a real situation adsorption kinetics and isotherms were employed to describe the adsorption removal mechanism the amount of al 3 adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g and the removal percentages were calculated by the following equations q t c o c t v m r e m o v a l r a t e c o c t c o where co mg l is the initial al 3 concentration ct mg l is the concentration of al 3 at time t v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of ppy fe3o4 used 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization to investigate the surface structure and morphology of the synthesized ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite sem images before and after adsorption were taken fig 2 it can be observed that the ppy fe3o4 composite before adsorption had a regular uniform spherical structure with particle diameters ranging from 30 to 150 nm mean diameter of the particle has calculated to be 81 nm which confirms the nanostructure of the developed ppy fe3o4 composite fig 3 b similarly after the adsorption of al 3 ions ppy fe3o4 still exhibited an approximately uniform morphology and did not experience a complete change in surface texture it can clearly be observed that adsorption process was successfully conducted and al 3 ions accumulate on the exterior surface of ppy fe3o4 these changes in the morphologies are in good agreement with the previous literature 40 41 tem images of ppy fe3o4 are given in fig 3a investigation of tem image reveals the presence of a spherical morphology on the surface of the ppy fe3o4 which is in accordance with the sem images as shown in the figure ppy nanoparticles are light colored which located in the outer portion of the nanocomposite shell and fe3o4 nanoparticles are located in the central part core with a dark color this confirms the core shell structure of ppy fe3o4 the ftir and xrd of al 3 adsorption before and adsorption are shown in fig 4 in the ftir spectrum of ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles a broad band around 578 cm 1 was corresponding to fe o stretching vibration bonds 42 the peaks at 1521 and 1474 cm 1 are resulted from symmetric and antisymmetric pyrrole ring stretching while the bands at 1103 and 1436 cm 1 are corresponding to c h stretching and conjugated c n stretching respectively the peaks approximately at 994 and 1033 cm 1 can be assigned to c h deformation and nh vibration compared with the original spectrum of ppy fe3o4 and after adsorption of al 3 n h wagging and c n in plane deformation peaks shifted to 1026 and 1251 cm 1 respectively illustrates the coordination of al 3 ions to nitrogen in pyrrole ring therefore the figure clearly reveals that the bands before and after adsorption have shifted to some degree indicating that the adsorption process was successfully concurred the ftir bands in fig 4 are in good agreement with those reported in the literature 43 44 in the case of xrd pattern the distinguished sharp peaks located at 31 8 36 08 37 44 42 12 53 72 56 72 and 63 24 are the main characteristic peaks of fe3o4 according to the to the cubic pattern jcpds no 72 2303 a xrd diffraction peak was observed at 2θ 20 5 which is a characteristic peak of amorphous ppy these peaks confirm that the synthesized nanocomposite was compromised of magnetic nanoparticle and ppy in the case of ppy fe3o4 before and after adsorption of al 3 new peaks were observed the peaks at 38 47 63 and 78 are attributed to al 3 ions adsorption n2 adsorption desorption measurements were used to find the porous properties of the ppy fe3o4 and ppy fe3o4 after al 3 adsorption as given in fig 5 ppy fe3o4 adsorption isotherm was of type iv based on brunauer s classification which showed the nanoporous nature of the adsorbent the pore size distribution calculated from desorption data using the bjh model suggested an average value of 18 40 nm which can be seen from fig b the bet surface area and the total pore volume for ppy fe3o4 before adsorption were found to be 49 55 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g respectively as it was expected after an adsorption process occurred bet surface area and the total pore volume for ppy fe3o4 decreased to 19 44 m2 g and 0 084 cm3 g respectively it confirms that al 3 was adsorbed on the surface of ppy fe3o4 or entered to pores resulting a decrease in surface area as well as pore volume fig 6 shows the edax spectra of the ppy fe3o4 the investigation of the spectrum and its peaks reveals the presence of major components such as fe n o c and cl the peaks such as fe are specifically related to fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles c and n specifically related to ppy edax spectra confirm that synthesized nanocomposite was formed from two different components 3 2 effect of initial ph value as surface properties of adsorbent and charged species of adsorbate are dependent on ph there is no doubt that ph adjustment before the adsorption process highly affects the efficiency of the whole process fig 7 a shows the effect of ph 1 to 7 on the removal efficiency of al 3 from synthetic solution by increasing ph value from 1 to 3 removal efficiency increased from 37 6 to 53 4 and a further increase in ph to 7 led to a loss in efficiency reached to about 9 it is obvious that the maximum removal efficiency was observed at ph 3 the similar phenomenon was found in the literature 45 the removal efficiency is highly dependent on the ph value to explain the mechanism of ph effect on the adsorption processes it is necessary to understand the surface charges on the adsorbate and adsorbent phzpc zero point charge is the ph at which the surface of the adsorbent is totally neutral below this value adsorbent owns a positive charge and beyond this value it is negatively charged according to previous studies phzpc of ppy fe3o4 was approximately determined to be 3 20 eqs 1 2 45 as reported in the literature aluminum exists in several species at different ph like al 3 al oh 2 al3 oh 4 5 al oh 4 and al oh 3 46 47 according to ft ir results the aluminum ions adsorption may be due to the interaction between al 3 and lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings however aluminum ions can be adsorbed on ppy via π metal interaction too after ph 3 al 3 converts to alo2 and adsorption efficiency decreases sharply the repulsion force between negative species of aluminum and ppy fe3o4 possessing a negative surface charge plays an important role in decreasing adsorption efficiency furthermore aluminum is soluble at acidic ph but under neutral or weakly alkaline media tends to form al oh 3 precipitation which is not beneficial in terms of adsorption efficiency 46 therefore following experiments were conducted at ph 3 1 p p y h p p y h p h p h z p c 2 p p y o h p p y o h p h p h z p c 3 3 effect of contact time the contact time is worthy of consideration since the effective interaction between ppy fe3o4 and al 3 ions occur once the adequate contact time is intended in the adsorption process fig 7b shows the variations of removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of ppy for al 3 with increasing the contact time it was observed that during the first 5 min of the reaction the removal percentage increased significantly and approximately 60 of al 3 ions were removed from the solution thereafter removal efficiency increased gradually and reach the maximum value at 20 min 71 removal and then followed by a slow and then fast decrease the reason for such these results is due to the fact that in the first 5 min of the contact time there are the large number of the free active adsorption sites on ppy fe3o4 in which rapidly can be occupied by analyte 48 50 further increase in contact time leads to a faceless number of sites being available and al 3 ions cannot well attract by the adsorption energy of adsorbent as shown in the figure adsorption capacity exhibited similar trends to removal efficiency which seems to be logical more removal efficiency engenders high adsorption capacity and vice versa another imperative point seen from the figure is that desorption happened after 25 min of the reaction the authors think that the weak interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate is the main factor for this observation also it can be attributed to the equilibrium between the al 3 ions loaded on the ppy fe3o4 and those in the solution which results in the desorption of the adsorbed adsorbates once the complete saturation of the adsorbent surface is reached by al 3 ions in view of adsorption capacity and removal percentage an optimum contact time 20 min was applied to the following experiments the adsorption process of this adsorbent for aluminum ions was fast and time efficient when compared with other adsorbents 51 52 3 4 effect of initial al 3 concentration determination of the proper pollutant concentration is a key parameter in the adsorption process design because of its direct influence on the amount of the adsorbent used amount of the sludge produced and the removal efficiency of the process generally higher aluminum ions in the solution require more active sites on the adsorbent to be removed the effect of the initial al 3 concentration on the removal efficiency and adsorbent capacity at ph 3 adsorbent dosage 200 μg ml and contact time 20 min is presented in fig 4 by increasing al 3 concentration from 1 to 40 μg ml removal efficiency and adsorption capacity changed from 71 06 to 50 36 and 3 55 to 100 7 mg g respectively fig 7c clearly indicates that an increase in al 3 concentration resulted in a diminish in removal efficiency and an increase in adsorption capacity fixed adsorbent dosage in the experiments implies the fact that there are specified number of accessible vacant sites on the adsorbent and once the al 3 concentration is gradually increased it is expected that removal efficiency to be decreased on the other hand the al 3 ions must be able to overcome the resistance of the mass transfer from the aqueous solution to the adsorbent surface when al 3 concentration increased to some degree a driving force will appear due to the gradient concentration between solid and liquid phase in which leads to the maximum interaction between ppy fe3o4 and al 3 ions in other word enhancing adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 by increasing aluminum ions concentration implements the idea that metals are willing to accumulate on the outer and inner surface of the adsorbent to obtain the maximum level of saturation based on the date the initial concentration of al 3 was chosen to be 5 μg ml for further experiments 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage an important element of total cost of adsorption operational systems is related to the amount of adsorbent used during the treatment so the optimum value of adsorbent is of great concern fig 7d denotes graphically the effect of various adsorbent dosages on the removal efficiency at ph 3 contact time 20 min and al 3 concentration 5 μg ml by increasing adsorbent dosage from 50 to 500 μg ml adsorption capacity continuously decreased from 65 14 to 4 98 mg g whereas removal efficiency showed an increased trend 65 to 79 and then falls down 79 to 49 increased removal efficiency can be attributed to the fact that there are more vacancies available active sites on the adsorbent which can bind to metal ion in the medium on the contrary continuously raising in the adsorbent amount beyond the optimum value leads to direct contact aggregation and collision of the adsorbent particles with each other and a bring down in the effective surface area will undoubtedly occur 53 under these circumstances a reduced surface area of the adsorbent engenders less removal efficiency as well it should be noted that once the high amount of adsorbent is introduced to the solution less number of sites will be occupied by the al 3 ions and the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cannot be reached in fact ppy fe3o4 is still unsaturated which is not favorable in means of economic benefits and sludge production a trade off between adsorbent dosage removal efficiency and adsorption capacity must be calculated to have an optimum adsorption treatment process this trend has been observed in several ppy based composites 40 45 therefore subsequent experiments were conducted using 100 μg ml of ppy fe3o4 3 6 effect of temperature temperature is an important operational parameter that directly affects the adsorption capacity as well as the process efficiency 54 the influence of the temperate on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of al 3 from synthetic solution was determined at 20 25 30 40 and 50 c and is shown in fig 7e ph sample volume and contact time was 3 10 ml and 20 min respectively by increasing the temperature from 20 to 50 c removal efficiency and adsorption capacity decreased from 82 35 and 41 17 mg g to 59 88 and 29 94 mg g respectively as a matter of fact an increase in temperature causes a decrease in removal efficiency and adsorption capacity this behavior indicates that the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is exothermic in nature and the increase of temperature is not favorable for adsorption in addition thermodynamic parameters including gibb s free energy change δ g enthalpy change δ h and entropy change δ s provide significant insightful information regarding adsorption energy changes through the adsorption process the van t hoff equation is employed to determine thermodynamic parameters and it is shown as 38 3 ln q e c e δ s r δ h r t 4 δ g δ h t δ s where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j m o l k and t is the absolute temperature k van t hoff parameters are calculated from a linear plot of ln q e c e versus 1 t fig the thermodynamics parameters are listed in table 1 the negative values of δ g at different temperature indicate that the adsorption of al 3on ppy fe3o4 is feasible and the adsorption process is spontaneous the negative δ h value verifies the exothermic nature of al 3 ions adsorption on ppy fe3o4 which favors higher removal efficiency and adsorption capacity at a lower temperature negative entropy δ s value implies the affinity of the synthesized adsorbent toward al 3 ions in fact the negative entropy suggests the decrease in randomness at the solid solution interface during the adsorption process which can be attributed to the decrease in the degree of freedom of al 3 ions 3 7 effect of competing ions it is merely accepted that the presence of various kinds of competitive ions in the wastewater may intervene the adsorption process and so before designing the adsorption system identification of wastewater quality is of high importance wastewater effluent from a factory of aluminum can production analyzed for a period of six months and in all the samples analyzed the presence of sodium na ammonium nh 4 sulfate so 2 4 and ferrous fe 2 ions were confirmed also al 3 concentrations varied between 0 7 to 3 5 μg ml during the mentioned period but the average value was 1 8 μg ml in these experiments the al 3 concentration was fixed at 1 8 μg ml the obtained results are illustrated in fig 8 experiments were conducted under optimum values of contact time ph and adsorbent dosage the results in fig 7 indicate that the removal efficiency of the adsorption process did not reduce significantly in the presence of mentioned ions in other words a great advantage of ppy fe3o4 is its selectivity toward al 3 ions 3 8 reusability of the ppy fe3o4 adsorbent reusability is an important factor which is a worthy consideration for adsorption systems in order to reduce treatment cost and sludge production the economics of an adsorbent is determined by how many times it can be regenerated and utilized in adsorption desorption cycle in the present study reusability of the synthesized adsorbent was examined under optimum conditions and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 9 undoubtedly with consecutive use of ppy fe3o4 the removal efficiency and adsorbent capacity both reduce to some degree it was observed that when the adsorbent was employed from one to five times removal efficiency and adsorption capacity reduced from 83 3 and 41 69 mg g to 50 6 and 25 31 mg g respectively the high energetic chemical interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent cause al 3 ions bind to ppy fe3o4 surface and will not detach during regeneration cycles in this direction the accumulation of adsorbate on the adsorbent increased by repetitive use one of the greatest advantages of the synthesized adsorbent is that even after five time use the removal efficiency of al 3 was still higher that 50 the results revealed that ppy fe3o4 can be successfully employed for al 3 treatment from water and wastewater with high removal efficiency and minimum adsorbent amount 3 9 investigation on the al 3 removal from actual wastewater although the adsorption process revealed suitable removal efficiency from synthetic al 3 solutions it is important to examine the al 3 removal from actual wastewater thus wastewater samples were taken from a factory of aluminum cans and ferrous sodium ammonium and sulfate ions were the main ions in the wastewater as well as al3 ions operational parameters were as follows sample volume 10 ml ph 3 temperature 20 c adsorbent dosage 100 mg and contact time 20 min experiments were conducted through there different samples and the obtained results are listed in table 3 it is evident that the removal efficiency suppressed in comparison to the synthetic solution which is due to the presence of various inorganic ions which compete with al 3 to be adsorbed by ppy fe3o4 in which leads to a loss in removal efficiency generally treatment processes must be able to tolerate wastewater quality fluctuations in order to be reliable it can be observed from the table 2 that by variations in the concentration of ions in the influent wastewater the removal efficiency of al 3 was constant to some degree approximately 71 so the results revealed that synthesized adsorbent is capable of being used in actual wastewater with high al 3 ions removal efficiency 3 10 adsorption kinetic for an optimum design of the adsorption treatment process it is important to evaluate the rate of reactions between adsorbent and adsorbate the time required for an adsorption process to be completed is determined by the adsorption kinetics to investigate the kinetic mechanism of the al 3 adsorption process onto ppy fe3o4 four different models namely the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich models were employed to fit the adsorption data approximately pfo and pso are the most widely employed adsorption kinetic that have been employed in data interpretation of numerous adsorption treatment systems pfo model is based on the fact that interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent follows the weak interaction energy and it can well describe physisorption and the first stage of the reaction however pso is utilized to expound adsorption processes that interaction between adsorbent surface functional groups and adsorbate is chemical bonds and adsorbate cannot easily detach from the adsorbent pfo eq 5 and pso eq 6 are as follows 55 5 ln qe qt lnqe k1t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where k1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption and k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of adsorption qe is the amount of dye adsorbed on adsorbent at equilibrium and qt is the amount of dye adsorbed on adsorbent at time t adsorption parameters of pfo and pso will be calculated from a linear plot of ln qe qt against t and t qt against t respectively intraparticle diffusion idp and elovich models were used to describe the adsorption mechanism generally adsorption process involves consecutive steps 1 transference of the solute from solution bulk to the adjacent solid phase 2 movement of the solutes to the external surface of the adsorbent 3 migration of the pollutant molecules to the internal adsorbent pores 4 chemisorption due to the presence of functional groups idp model is employed to identify the importance of the al 3 ions diffusion into the internal pores of the ppy fe3o4 ipd model in fact declares the limiting rate step of the adsorption process by introducing the following equation which was firstly proposed by webber and morris in 1962 56 7 q t k p t 0 5 c where kp is the ipd rate constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant for any experiment mg g related to the thickness of the boundary layer the values of kp and c can be obtained by plotting qt against t0 5 elovich model can be employed to describe a chemical adsorption process over a energetically heterogeneous surface and equation is shown below 57 58 8 q e 1 β l n t 1 β l n α β where α and β are initial adsorption rate mg g min and desorption constant g mg respectively elovich parameters are calculated from linear plot of qe versus lnt fig 10 shows the examined kinetic models and table 3 represent all the parameters calculated from the models as well as obtained r2 values based on the fact that higher r2 value shows a better fit to experimental data it is clear that pso has the minimal r2 value 0 9905 the order of the r2 values was ascribed by pfo elovich idp pso suggesting that pso model is the suitable equation to describe the adsorption mechanism furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity qe calculated 39 84 mg g was in good agreement with experimental data qe experimental 36 mg g it is noteworthy saying that qe calculated and qe experimental for pfo model were 118 87 and 36 mg g respectively which demonstrate the inapplicability of this model to describe the treatment mechanism because of the large difference between them thus the adsorption mechanism followed a chemisorption that functional groups on the adsorbent surface as shown in the ftir test tend to bind a chemical reaction to al 3 ions via exchange or share of valence electrons 52 these findings confirm that the al 3 ions adsorption onto ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite is well described using linearize pso model through the whole range of process time moreover al 3 ions cannot be removed absolutely from the ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles in the desorption processes in the case of ipd it is obvious that it cannot describe kinetics adsorption data well due to low r2 value as can be seen ipd plot does not pass the origin which shows that it is not the only limiting step whereas as shown above pso also describe the adsorption process 58 the ipd model is linked by two straight lines during the al 3 ions adsorption process indicating the adsorption process was controlled by both surface and intraparticle diffusion processes the lowest r2 value was attributed to the elovich model and which reflect the unsuitability of the model to describe the al 3 adsorption by the synthesized adsorbent 3 11 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms have been widely utilized to expound adsorption mechanism in fact insightful date about adsorbent surface structure suitability of adsorption the energy of attraction between adsorbent and adsorbate and etc can be obtained from adsorption isotherms in this study isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin were examined to describe the adsorption mechanism of al 3 as a pollutant and ppy fe3o4 as a synthesized adsorbent langmuir isotherm implies that the number of vacant sites on the adsorbent is not countless and adsorbate accumulation on the adsorbent surface follows a monolayer disposition at a constant temperature furthermore uniformity and homogeneity of the adsorbent are other assumptions of langmuir isotherms the greatest drawback of the langmuir model is that this model believes that each site on the adsorbent has an equivalent adsorbent energy the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is given by the following equation 59 9 c e q e 1 k l q 0 c e q 0 where qe mg g is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration qm mg g is the langmuir constant representing maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of the binding sites isotherm parameters can be calculated by the linear plot of q e c e versus q e the favorability of the langmuir isotherm can be defined by dimension less equilibrium characteristics rl which is defined as 10 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl are the initial concentration of al 3 and langmuir constant respectively once rl value is between zero and one langmuir adsorption is applicable to fit the experimental data well however rl greater than one shows its inapplicability to solve the problems related to the langmuir model freundlich isotherm was proposed which is based on the fact that the adsorbent surface is heterogeneous and also multilayer of solute can be observed on the adsorbent surface a linear form of the freundlich isotherm expression is represented by the following equation 60 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf mg l n mg l and ce mg l are freundlich constant which represents adsorption capacity adsorption intensity and equilibrium concentration respectively the plot of lnqe versus lnce gives a straight line with slope kf and intercept 1 n freundlich isotherm can somehow determine if the adsorption process is a physisorption or chemisorption when n value is greater than one and lower than one adsorption is physical and chemical respectively it is obvious that once n 1 freundlich isotherm follows hendry isotherm which is valid at a very low concentration of adsorbate additionally as 1 n gets closer to zero the surface tends to be heterogeneous temkin isotherm developed by the cooperation of three scientists is based on the fact that adsorption energy decreased linearly by the occupation of the adsorbent sites this decline in energy is ascribed to the adsorbent adsorbate interaction 61 the implication of adsorbent and adsorbate interaction is one of the greatest high points of temkin isotherm in comparison to langmuir model the temkin isotherm is given by 62 12 q e b ln a t b ln c e where is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol a t is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g r is the universal gas constant j mol k and t is the absolute temperature at k from the plot of qe versus ce b and a t can be calculated from the slope b and intercepts b ln a t respectively fig 11 shows the plot of the isotherm models and calculated parameters are listed in table 4 according to the obtained r2 values it can be said that freundlich isotherm may describe the adsorption mechanism well the order of the r2 values was temkin langmuir freundlich thus as it was expected adsorbent surface would be heterogeneous and n value greater than one is indicative of the chemical bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent the result is in correspondence with adsorption kinetic in which pso and chemical adsorption were introduced as the adsorption mechanism in spite of the fact that langmuir isotherm is not the suitable model to describe adsorption mechanism when compared to freundlich model but the high r2 value of langmuir model signs that some parts of the adsorbent surface tend to be homogenous similarly 1 n value was approximately 0 89 that is a bit far away from zero furthermore rl values for all the experiment were between 0 and 1 thus indicating that the langmuir isotherm can by favorable low r2 value of temkin isotherm suggests poor fit with this model to sum up the adsorption mechanism seems to follow the freundlich model and the adsorbent surface is a combination of homogeneity and heterogeneity 3 12 adsorption mechanism to design a carefully optimized adsorption condition for al 3 ions removal from aqueous solutions it is essential to determine the adsorption mechanism as fully described before various parameters affected the efficiency of the process the experimental results indicated that ph had an obvious effect on the removal of al 3 the adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 was varied with its surface charge in fact when the ph of the solution was greater than phzpc ppy fe3o4 carries negative charges which was beneficial to the adsorption of positively charged al 3 via electrostatic attraction on the contrary owning the same charges on the adsorbent and adsorbate would definitely inhibit the adsorption efficiency due to the existence of electrostatic repulsion this phenomenon verifies that electrostatic force is not the only adsorption force therefore other forces must exist thorough adsorption the other main mechanism occurs through ion exchange reaction the al 3 ions might selectively coordinate with the n atoms within pyrrole units in a1 2 ratio making a complex ion compound fig 12 the results of adsorption isotherms and kinetics fitted well with freundlich and pso models in which verify chemical adsorption through ion exchange and electrostatic force furthermore it seems that chemisorption is the main adsorption process but physisorption is also effective due to the high bet surface area obtained in this study relatively high r2 value obtained from langmuir isotherm confirms this observation obviously sem images showed that ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 81 nm which is greater than al 3 ions radius and al 3 ions can easily adsorbed on the external pores and internal pores of ppy fe3o4 bet analysis before and after adsorption exhibited the occupation of the adsorbent pores therefore chemisorption and physisorption both are influential in adsorption of al 3 ions by ppy fe3o4 from aqueous media 3 13 comparison of ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite with other sorbents in terms of the adsorption efficiency maximum adsorbent capacity and required contact time to reach the full saturation of the adsorbent sites plays an important role al 3 ions removal from aqueous solutions have recently gained much attention however the literature survey revealed that there are limited numbers of studies regarding aluminum removal table 5 presents a comparison of maximum adsorption capacity and contact time with other earlier reported adsorbents in literature it is evident from this table that adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 toward al 3 ions is highly competitive and is higher than most of them requiring a low contact time is one of the greatest advantages of the synthesized adsorbent in the present study when compared to the other adsorbents nontoxicity high surface area easy separation and environmentally friendly are other good points of this adsorbent these results make the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites promising effective adsorbent for the refining al 3 ions from aqueous media 4 conclusion from the obtained results it can be concluded that the synthesized ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles are a potential material for al 3 ions adsorption from aqueous solutions the synthesized nanocomposites showed a high bet surface area 49 55 m2 g a core shell structure the adsorption process was strongly affected by parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage and temperature the equilibrium time for al 3 ions was determined as 20 min and optimum ph was 3 maximum adsorption efficiency of more than 80 was achieved at adsorbent dosage of 100 μg ml the value of δg was found negative in the adsorption of al 3 on ppy fe3o4 which confirmed the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process the negative values of δh and δs suggested that the adsorption is exothermic in nature by relating the kinetic models to the experimental data it was noted that the adsorption of the target pollutant followed the pseudo second order rate kinetics isotherm modeling revealed that the freundlich equation could better described the adsorption process as compared to langmuir or temkin isotherm models moreover ppy fe3o4 exhibited removal efficiency of more than 50 even after five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles interestingly the prepared adsorbent showed high selectivity for al 3 ions even in the presence of other competing ions in view of all these outcomes it may be concluded that ppy fe3o4 could be a promising candidate for the removal of al 3 from aqueous solution 
14412,in the current study polypyrrole ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized and applied for the removal of al 3 metal ions from the aqueous medium the nanocomposite was characterized using several analytical techniques such as sem tem ftir xrd edax and bet the results showed that the synthesized composite has an average diameter of 81 nm bet surface area of 49 55 and 19 44 m2 g before and after adsorption respectively verified that al 3 was adsorbed by ppy fe3o4 the effect of main operating parameters including ph value contact time target pollutant concentration adsorbent dosage temperature and competing ions were examined al 3 adsorption was strongly dependent on solution ph the maximum adsorption of 82 was observed at ph 3 the uptake of al 3 onto ppy fe3o4 was rapid and equilibrium established within 20 min adsorbate concentration and adsorbent dosage of 5 μg ml and 100 μg ml resulted in the highest al 3 adsorption furthermore adsorbent reusability was tested and it was shown that after five times recycling the removal efficiency was still above 50 the maximum adsorption efficiency of 100 7 mg g was achieved in the current study the presence of fe 2 na nh4 and so4 2 did not reduce adsorption efficiency which is indicative of the high selectivity of the prepared adsorbent equilibrium data were in good accordance with the freundlich model the obtained results revealed that pseudo second model is the best one because of the greatest r2 value 0 9905 and it suggested that the adsorption mechanism follow chemisorption mechanism thermodynamic parameters such as δ g δ s a n d δ h were estimated for the adsorption study and suggested that the adsorption was exothermic and maximum al 3 adsorption occurred at 20 c consequently ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite could be utilized as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent for the removal of al 3 ions from aqueous solutions keywords adsorption aluminum wastewater treatment polypyrrole dispersive solid phase extraction 1 introduction there is no any doubt that urbanization and industrialization two main consequences of the industrial revolution have brought easy life as well as life satisfaction and long living for human beings however environmental pollution and more importantly water contamination is the major drawback of this phenomenon which cannot be neglected anymore 1 2 industrial effluents contain a wide variety of toxic organic and inorganic chemicals that are freely entered into the environment due to the inability of the present conventional wastewater treatment plants in cities and industrial estates 3 5 among so many different constituents in industrial wastewaters heavy metals are considered as one of the most hazardous ones electroplating welding battery industry pesticides mining textile paper industries electroplating wood processing tannery industries and refineries are the main source of heavy metals generation and release in the water bodies 6 7 many studies confirm the presence of heavy metals in soil water and sediment of rivers 6 8 11 although a certain amount of heavy metal is beneficial for human excess amount leads to severe health effects including muscular stiffness renal and liver disturbances cancer hypertension vomiting and sometimes death 9 12 13 aluminum the third abundant element after oxygen and silicon have been considerably used in human activities including construction packaging paper industry dye production space industries pharmaceutical drugs car industry and cosmetic industry since its discovery 14 17 however it should not be forgotten that aluminum is a heavy metal with severe environmental impacts that may enter the aquatic media including surface waters and more importantly drinking water through effluents of the mentions industries alzheimer s disease root growth inhibition and nutrient imbalance in plants lou gehring s disease senile dementia human cancer and crop productivity limitation are the main challenges related to exposure of high amount of aluminum 15 18 19 martyn et al have proved that in districts with high al 3 concentration alzheimer s disease was highly common 20 moreover previous studies have confirmed that al ions are harmful to fish zooplankton cyanobacteria water weeds and algae 21 it is noteworthy saying that al based coagulants have been extensively used to as enhance removal of colloids and suspended particles in municipal water treatment plants mwtps in spite of the fact that al 3 is separated through sedimentation tanks or filtration process a variable amount of al 3 ions could be detected in the final produced drinking water that resulted in adverse long term consequences for humans there is considerable concern throughout the world over the levels of aluminum found in drinking water sources and treated water the epa has set the secondary permissible levels of aluminum at 0 05 to 0 20 mg l 22 in the case of canada and sweden it is 0 12 mg l on the basis of the above considerations proper elimination of al 3 from aqueous media is of great importance to preserve human health in case of heavy metals removal various chemical biological and physical methods such as ion exchange the electrochemical techniques adsorption advanced oxidation processes chemical precipitation and microbial system and have been used 23 generally utilization of chemical and biological methods is merely restricted because of the hard operation high chemical demand generation of new secondary contaminant or fluctuation in the efficiency of the system 24 26 while physical methods are of great interest to remove heavy metals due to their minimum usage of chemical reagents high removal efficiency as well as facile operation 27 28 among various physical methods proposed the adsorption process has gained much attention recently in terms of high flexibility in operation and design along with being economically feasible and insensitivity to toxic pollutants 29 30 various adsorbents including carbon active carbon nanotubes agricultural waste material industrial waste and bioadsorbent have been examined for heavy metals removal 23 in recent years conductive polymers have displayed better removal efficiency adsorption capacity thermal stability selectivity granulometric properties insolubility in water and reproducibility when compared to traditional adsorbents 31 polypyrrole a promising conductive polymer consists of a five membered heterocyclic ring have been candidated as a suitable adsorbent because of the owning large number of positively nitrogen atoms 32 33 in order to improve the adsorption efficiency materials containing oxygen or and nitrogen groups must be introduced to polypyrrole which resulted in the generation of a nanocomposite material based on polypyrrole in this direction modification of polypyrrole with various materials to prepare distinctive composites have been reported 33 34 recently the application of magnetic science has been of interest in water and wastewater treatment especially for adsorption methods magnetic adsorbent a combination of an adsorbent and fe3o4 as magnetic provides the opportunity to separate pollutants from the solution without further preparation such as filtration or centrifugation 35 in addition magnetic adsorbent supplies large surface area along with appropriate dispersion in the solution the above mentioned advantages have led to the utilization of magnetic adsorbent in studies in an overview various nanocomposites based polypyrrole ppy has been suggested by the researchers in this research work fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized based on the electro oxidation methods 36 37 in order to improve adsorption efficiency fe3o4 was coated with ppy and a magnetic adsorbent was generated the effects of operational parameters including ph value contact time target pollutant concentration adsorbent dosage temperature and competing ions were examined adsorbent reusability and treatment of real wastewater was also studied kinetic models by using pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models were employed to understand the adsorption process adsorption equilibrium data were fitted with isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin to describe the adsorption mechanism thermodynamic parameters were also calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and equipment pyrrole c4h5n ethanol c2h5oh iron chloride fecl2 4h2o ammonium chloride nh4cl copper sulfate cuso4 5h2o aluminum nitrate al no3 9h2o and dimethylamin hydrochloride c2h8cln were supplied by merck germany all the chemicals used during the study were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification solutions were prepared using deionized water sem model tescan vegu ii was employed to identify the surface structure and the presence of porosity on the synthesized adsorbent the remained al 3 concentration in the solution after the adsorption process was determined by icp ms model icps 7000 ver2 shimadzu company ultrasonic apparatus model eurosonic italy was employed for adsorbent activation power supply ax510metrix and ph meter model 691 wagtech company were used 2 2 preparation of the fe3o4 nanoparticles the electrochemical method was used for fe3o4 nanoparticles synthesis cathode and anode material were both chosen to be aluminum in ratio 4 to 1 respectively surface of the electrodes were washed with ethanol to remove any impurities electrolyte solution was a mixture of the dimethylamin hydrochloride and deionized water the electrochemical cell electrolyte solution and electrodes was placed in a thermostatic bath at a fixed temperature of 50 c the voltage applied to the system was 8 v at the initial step of the reaction electrolyte is completely colorless and by applying the desired voltage its color will change to brown and then black this phenomenon confirms the generation of the fe3o4 particles reaction time was set at 1800s an external magnetic field was utilized to separate black residue from the solution nanomaterial syntheses in the presence of surfactants led to nanomaterials with lower diameter and prevent agglomeration therefore polypyrrole synthesis was done in fe3o4 suspension in tetramethylammonium hydroxide ch3 4noh tmaoh solution tmaoh is a surfactant which creates an electrostatic force to repulse nanoparticles from each other and prevent magnetic particles agglomeration and clumping 38 the obtained material was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c 2 3 preparation of the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites the ppy fe3o4 magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization technique described in previous studies 39 in a typical polymerization technique 0 4 g of fe3o4 was added to a 80 ml deionized water and then ultrasonicated for 10 min for better dispersion of fe3o4 in the solution 6 g of fecl3 oxidant was added to the solution containing fe3o4 and was shaken for 30 min 0 8 ml pyrrole was syringed to the obtained mixture and then it was kept under constant shaking for 3 h at ambient temperature acetone was added to the solution to prevent further reaction the black powder nanocomposite obtained was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate became colorless and thereafter washed with acetone finally the obtained nanocomposite was dried at 100 c for 6 h under vacuum this adsorbent is called core shell ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite the preparation of the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites is graphically represented in fig 1 2 4 adsorption procedure in the present study adsorption of al 3 by ppy fe3o4 adsorbent was tested first a stock solution of aluminum nitrate at a concentration level of 1000 μg ml was prepared and by dilution desired al 3 solutions were taken all the experiments were tested at a 10 ml erlenmeyer flask which was placed in a water bath to keep the temperature constant to reach the maximum adsorption efficiency optimum values of ph 1 7 contact time 5 45 min initial al concentration 1 40 μg ml adsorbent dosage 50 500 μg ml and temperature 20 50 c were examined ph of the solution was adjusted by 0 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh under optimum conditions the effect of fe 2 na nh4 and so4 2 on the adsorption process was studied similarly ppy fe3o4 adsorbent reusability was tested to figure out the fluctuation of removal efficiency during the adsorption process finally an actual wastewater from a factory of aluminum was taken to evaluate the adsorption process in a real situation adsorption kinetics and isotherms were employed to describe the adsorption removal mechanism the amount of al 3 adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g and the removal percentages were calculated by the following equations q t c o c t v m r e m o v a l r a t e c o c t c o where co mg l is the initial al 3 concentration ct mg l is the concentration of al 3 at time t v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the mass of ppy fe3o4 used 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization to investigate the surface structure and morphology of the synthesized ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite sem images before and after adsorption were taken fig 2 it can be observed that the ppy fe3o4 composite before adsorption had a regular uniform spherical structure with particle diameters ranging from 30 to 150 nm mean diameter of the particle has calculated to be 81 nm which confirms the nanostructure of the developed ppy fe3o4 composite fig 3 b similarly after the adsorption of al 3 ions ppy fe3o4 still exhibited an approximately uniform morphology and did not experience a complete change in surface texture it can clearly be observed that adsorption process was successfully conducted and al 3 ions accumulate on the exterior surface of ppy fe3o4 these changes in the morphologies are in good agreement with the previous literature 40 41 tem images of ppy fe3o4 are given in fig 3a investigation of tem image reveals the presence of a spherical morphology on the surface of the ppy fe3o4 which is in accordance with the sem images as shown in the figure ppy nanoparticles are light colored which located in the outer portion of the nanocomposite shell and fe3o4 nanoparticles are located in the central part core with a dark color this confirms the core shell structure of ppy fe3o4 the ftir and xrd of al 3 adsorption before and adsorption are shown in fig 4 in the ftir spectrum of ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles a broad band around 578 cm 1 was corresponding to fe o stretching vibration bonds 42 the peaks at 1521 and 1474 cm 1 are resulted from symmetric and antisymmetric pyrrole ring stretching while the bands at 1103 and 1436 cm 1 are corresponding to c h stretching and conjugated c n stretching respectively the peaks approximately at 994 and 1033 cm 1 can be assigned to c h deformation and nh vibration compared with the original spectrum of ppy fe3o4 and after adsorption of al 3 n h wagging and c n in plane deformation peaks shifted to 1026 and 1251 cm 1 respectively illustrates the coordination of al 3 ions to nitrogen in pyrrole ring therefore the figure clearly reveals that the bands before and after adsorption have shifted to some degree indicating that the adsorption process was successfully concurred the ftir bands in fig 4 are in good agreement with those reported in the literature 43 44 in the case of xrd pattern the distinguished sharp peaks located at 31 8 36 08 37 44 42 12 53 72 56 72 and 63 24 are the main characteristic peaks of fe3o4 according to the to the cubic pattern jcpds no 72 2303 a xrd diffraction peak was observed at 2θ 20 5 which is a characteristic peak of amorphous ppy these peaks confirm that the synthesized nanocomposite was compromised of magnetic nanoparticle and ppy in the case of ppy fe3o4 before and after adsorption of al 3 new peaks were observed the peaks at 38 47 63 and 78 are attributed to al 3 ions adsorption n2 adsorption desorption measurements were used to find the porous properties of the ppy fe3o4 and ppy fe3o4 after al 3 adsorption as given in fig 5 ppy fe3o4 adsorption isotherm was of type iv based on brunauer s classification which showed the nanoporous nature of the adsorbent the pore size distribution calculated from desorption data using the bjh model suggested an average value of 18 40 nm which can be seen from fig b the bet surface area and the total pore volume for ppy fe3o4 before adsorption were found to be 49 55 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g respectively as it was expected after an adsorption process occurred bet surface area and the total pore volume for ppy fe3o4 decreased to 19 44 m2 g and 0 084 cm3 g respectively it confirms that al 3 was adsorbed on the surface of ppy fe3o4 or entered to pores resulting a decrease in surface area as well as pore volume fig 6 shows the edax spectra of the ppy fe3o4 the investigation of the spectrum and its peaks reveals the presence of major components such as fe n o c and cl the peaks such as fe are specifically related to fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles c and n specifically related to ppy edax spectra confirm that synthesized nanocomposite was formed from two different components 3 2 effect of initial ph value as surface properties of adsorbent and charged species of adsorbate are dependent on ph there is no doubt that ph adjustment before the adsorption process highly affects the efficiency of the whole process fig 7 a shows the effect of ph 1 to 7 on the removal efficiency of al 3 from synthetic solution by increasing ph value from 1 to 3 removal efficiency increased from 37 6 to 53 4 and a further increase in ph to 7 led to a loss in efficiency reached to about 9 it is obvious that the maximum removal efficiency was observed at ph 3 the similar phenomenon was found in the literature 45 the removal efficiency is highly dependent on the ph value to explain the mechanism of ph effect on the adsorption processes it is necessary to understand the surface charges on the adsorbate and adsorbent phzpc zero point charge is the ph at which the surface of the adsorbent is totally neutral below this value adsorbent owns a positive charge and beyond this value it is negatively charged according to previous studies phzpc of ppy fe3o4 was approximately determined to be 3 20 eqs 1 2 45 as reported in the literature aluminum exists in several species at different ph like al 3 al oh 2 al3 oh 4 5 al oh 4 and al oh 3 46 47 according to ft ir results the aluminum ions adsorption may be due to the interaction between al 3 and lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole rings however aluminum ions can be adsorbed on ppy via π metal interaction too after ph 3 al 3 converts to alo2 and adsorption efficiency decreases sharply the repulsion force between negative species of aluminum and ppy fe3o4 possessing a negative surface charge plays an important role in decreasing adsorption efficiency furthermore aluminum is soluble at acidic ph but under neutral or weakly alkaline media tends to form al oh 3 precipitation which is not beneficial in terms of adsorption efficiency 46 therefore following experiments were conducted at ph 3 1 p p y h p p y h p h p h z p c 2 p p y o h p p y o h p h p h z p c 3 3 effect of contact time the contact time is worthy of consideration since the effective interaction between ppy fe3o4 and al 3 ions occur once the adequate contact time is intended in the adsorption process fig 7b shows the variations of removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of ppy for al 3 with increasing the contact time it was observed that during the first 5 min of the reaction the removal percentage increased significantly and approximately 60 of al 3 ions were removed from the solution thereafter removal efficiency increased gradually and reach the maximum value at 20 min 71 removal and then followed by a slow and then fast decrease the reason for such these results is due to the fact that in the first 5 min of the contact time there are the large number of the free active adsorption sites on ppy fe3o4 in which rapidly can be occupied by analyte 48 50 further increase in contact time leads to a faceless number of sites being available and al 3 ions cannot well attract by the adsorption energy of adsorbent as shown in the figure adsorption capacity exhibited similar trends to removal efficiency which seems to be logical more removal efficiency engenders high adsorption capacity and vice versa another imperative point seen from the figure is that desorption happened after 25 min of the reaction the authors think that the weak interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate is the main factor for this observation also it can be attributed to the equilibrium between the al 3 ions loaded on the ppy fe3o4 and those in the solution which results in the desorption of the adsorbed adsorbates once the complete saturation of the adsorbent surface is reached by al 3 ions in view of adsorption capacity and removal percentage an optimum contact time 20 min was applied to the following experiments the adsorption process of this adsorbent for aluminum ions was fast and time efficient when compared with other adsorbents 51 52 3 4 effect of initial al 3 concentration determination of the proper pollutant concentration is a key parameter in the adsorption process design because of its direct influence on the amount of the adsorbent used amount of the sludge produced and the removal efficiency of the process generally higher aluminum ions in the solution require more active sites on the adsorbent to be removed the effect of the initial al 3 concentration on the removal efficiency and adsorbent capacity at ph 3 adsorbent dosage 200 μg ml and contact time 20 min is presented in fig 4 by increasing al 3 concentration from 1 to 40 μg ml removal efficiency and adsorption capacity changed from 71 06 to 50 36 and 3 55 to 100 7 mg g respectively fig 7c clearly indicates that an increase in al 3 concentration resulted in a diminish in removal efficiency and an increase in adsorption capacity fixed adsorbent dosage in the experiments implies the fact that there are specified number of accessible vacant sites on the adsorbent and once the al 3 concentration is gradually increased it is expected that removal efficiency to be decreased on the other hand the al 3 ions must be able to overcome the resistance of the mass transfer from the aqueous solution to the adsorbent surface when al 3 concentration increased to some degree a driving force will appear due to the gradient concentration between solid and liquid phase in which leads to the maximum interaction between ppy fe3o4 and al 3 ions in other word enhancing adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 by increasing aluminum ions concentration implements the idea that metals are willing to accumulate on the outer and inner surface of the adsorbent to obtain the maximum level of saturation based on the date the initial concentration of al 3 was chosen to be 5 μg ml for further experiments 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage an important element of total cost of adsorption operational systems is related to the amount of adsorbent used during the treatment so the optimum value of adsorbent is of great concern fig 7d denotes graphically the effect of various adsorbent dosages on the removal efficiency at ph 3 contact time 20 min and al 3 concentration 5 μg ml by increasing adsorbent dosage from 50 to 500 μg ml adsorption capacity continuously decreased from 65 14 to 4 98 mg g whereas removal efficiency showed an increased trend 65 to 79 and then falls down 79 to 49 increased removal efficiency can be attributed to the fact that there are more vacancies available active sites on the adsorbent which can bind to metal ion in the medium on the contrary continuously raising in the adsorbent amount beyond the optimum value leads to direct contact aggregation and collision of the adsorbent particles with each other and a bring down in the effective surface area will undoubtedly occur 53 under these circumstances a reduced surface area of the adsorbent engenders less removal efficiency as well it should be noted that once the high amount of adsorbent is introduced to the solution less number of sites will be occupied by the al 3 ions and the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent cannot be reached in fact ppy fe3o4 is still unsaturated which is not favorable in means of economic benefits and sludge production a trade off between adsorbent dosage removal efficiency and adsorption capacity must be calculated to have an optimum adsorption treatment process this trend has been observed in several ppy based composites 40 45 therefore subsequent experiments were conducted using 100 μg ml of ppy fe3o4 3 6 effect of temperature temperature is an important operational parameter that directly affects the adsorption capacity as well as the process efficiency 54 the influence of the temperate on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of al 3 from synthetic solution was determined at 20 25 30 40 and 50 c and is shown in fig 7e ph sample volume and contact time was 3 10 ml and 20 min respectively by increasing the temperature from 20 to 50 c removal efficiency and adsorption capacity decreased from 82 35 and 41 17 mg g to 59 88 and 29 94 mg g respectively as a matter of fact an increase in temperature causes a decrease in removal efficiency and adsorption capacity this behavior indicates that the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is exothermic in nature and the increase of temperature is not favorable for adsorption in addition thermodynamic parameters including gibb s free energy change δ g enthalpy change δ h and entropy change δ s provide significant insightful information regarding adsorption energy changes through the adsorption process the van t hoff equation is employed to determine thermodynamic parameters and it is shown as 38 3 ln q e c e δ s r δ h r t 4 δ g δ h t δ s where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j m o l k and t is the absolute temperature k van t hoff parameters are calculated from a linear plot of ln q e c e versus 1 t fig the thermodynamics parameters are listed in table 1 the negative values of δ g at different temperature indicate that the adsorption of al 3on ppy fe3o4 is feasible and the adsorption process is spontaneous the negative δ h value verifies the exothermic nature of al 3 ions adsorption on ppy fe3o4 which favors higher removal efficiency and adsorption capacity at a lower temperature negative entropy δ s value implies the affinity of the synthesized adsorbent toward al 3 ions in fact the negative entropy suggests the decrease in randomness at the solid solution interface during the adsorption process which can be attributed to the decrease in the degree of freedom of al 3 ions 3 7 effect of competing ions it is merely accepted that the presence of various kinds of competitive ions in the wastewater may intervene the adsorption process and so before designing the adsorption system identification of wastewater quality is of high importance wastewater effluent from a factory of aluminum can production analyzed for a period of six months and in all the samples analyzed the presence of sodium na ammonium nh 4 sulfate so 2 4 and ferrous fe 2 ions were confirmed also al 3 concentrations varied between 0 7 to 3 5 μg ml during the mentioned period but the average value was 1 8 μg ml in these experiments the al 3 concentration was fixed at 1 8 μg ml the obtained results are illustrated in fig 8 experiments were conducted under optimum values of contact time ph and adsorbent dosage the results in fig 7 indicate that the removal efficiency of the adsorption process did not reduce significantly in the presence of mentioned ions in other words a great advantage of ppy fe3o4 is its selectivity toward al 3 ions 3 8 reusability of the ppy fe3o4 adsorbent reusability is an important factor which is a worthy consideration for adsorption systems in order to reduce treatment cost and sludge production the economics of an adsorbent is determined by how many times it can be regenerated and utilized in adsorption desorption cycle in the present study reusability of the synthesized adsorbent was examined under optimum conditions and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 9 undoubtedly with consecutive use of ppy fe3o4 the removal efficiency and adsorbent capacity both reduce to some degree it was observed that when the adsorbent was employed from one to five times removal efficiency and adsorption capacity reduced from 83 3 and 41 69 mg g to 50 6 and 25 31 mg g respectively the high energetic chemical interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent cause al 3 ions bind to ppy fe3o4 surface and will not detach during regeneration cycles in this direction the accumulation of adsorbate on the adsorbent increased by repetitive use one of the greatest advantages of the synthesized adsorbent is that even after five time use the removal efficiency of al 3 was still higher that 50 the results revealed that ppy fe3o4 can be successfully employed for al 3 treatment from water and wastewater with high removal efficiency and minimum adsorbent amount 3 9 investigation on the al 3 removal from actual wastewater although the adsorption process revealed suitable removal efficiency from synthetic al 3 solutions it is important to examine the al 3 removal from actual wastewater thus wastewater samples were taken from a factory of aluminum cans and ferrous sodium ammonium and sulfate ions were the main ions in the wastewater as well as al3 ions operational parameters were as follows sample volume 10 ml ph 3 temperature 20 c adsorbent dosage 100 mg and contact time 20 min experiments were conducted through there different samples and the obtained results are listed in table 3 it is evident that the removal efficiency suppressed in comparison to the synthetic solution which is due to the presence of various inorganic ions which compete with al 3 to be adsorbed by ppy fe3o4 in which leads to a loss in removal efficiency generally treatment processes must be able to tolerate wastewater quality fluctuations in order to be reliable it can be observed from the table 2 that by variations in the concentration of ions in the influent wastewater the removal efficiency of al 3 was constant to some degree approximately 71 so the results revealed that synthesized adsorbent is capable of being used in actual wastewater with high al 3 ions removal efficiency 3 10 adsorption kinetic for an optimum design of the adsorption treatment process it is important to evaluate the rate of reactions between adsorbent and adsorbate the time required for an adsorption process to be completed is determined by the adsorption kinetics to investigate the kinetic mechanism of the al 3 adsorption process onto ppy fe3o4 four different models namely the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich models were employed to fit the adsorption data approximately pfo and pso are the most widely employed adsorption kinetic that have been employed in data interpretation of numerous adsorption treatment systems pfo model is based on the fact that interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent follows the weak interaction energy and it can well describe physisorption and the first stage of the reaction however pso is utilized to expound adsorption processes that interaction between adsorbent surface functional groups and adsorbate is chemical bonds and adsorbate cannot easily detach from the adsorbent pfo eq 5 and pso eq 6 are as follows 55 5 ln qe qt lnqe k1t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where k1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption and k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of adsorption qe is the amount of dye adsorbed on adsorbent at equilibrium and qt is the amount of dye adsorbed on adsorbent at time t adsorption parameters of pfo and pso will be calculated from a linear plot of ln qe qt against t and t qt against t respectively intraparticle diffusion idp and elovich models were used to describe the adsorption mechanism generally adsorption process involves consecutive steps 1 transference of the solute from solution bulk to the adjacent solid phase 2 movement of the solutes to the external surface of the adsorbent 3 migration of the pollutant molecules to the internal adsorbent pores 4 chemisorption due to the presence of functional groups idp model is employed to identify the importance of the al 3 ions diffusion into the internal pores of the ppy fe3o4 ipd model in fact declares the limiting rate step of the adsorption process by introducing the following equation which was firstly proposed by webber and morris in 1962 56 7 q t k p t 0 5 c where kp is the ipd rate constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant for any experiment mg g related to the thickness of the boundary layer the values of kp and c can be obtained by plotting qt against t0 5 elovich model can be employed to describe a chemical adsorption process over a energetically heterogeneous surface and equation is shown below 57 58 8 q e 1 β l n t 1 β l n α β where α and β are initial adsorption rate mg g min and desorption constant g mg respectively elovich parameters are calculated from linear plot of qe versus lnt fig 10 shows the examined kinetic models and table 3 represent all the parameters calculated from the models as well as obtained r2 values based on the fact that higher r2 value shows a better fit to experimental data it is clear that pso has the minimal r2 value 0 9905 the order of the r2 values was ascribed by pfo elovich idp pso suggesting that pso model is the suitable equation to describe the adsorption mechanism furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity qe calculated 39 84 mg g was in good agreement with experimental data qe experimental 36 mg g it is noteworthy saying that qe calculated and qe experimental for pfo model were 118 87 and 36 mg g respectively which demonstrate the inapplicability of this model to describe the treatment mechanism because of the large difference between them thus the adsorption mechanism followed a chemisorption that functional groups on the adsorbent surface as shown in the ftir test tend to bind a chemical reaction to al 3 ions via exchange or share of valence electrons 52 these findings confirm that the al 3 ions adsorption onto ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite is well described using linearize pso model through the whole range of process time moreover al 3 ions cannot be removed absolutely from the ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles in the desorption processes in the case of ipd it is obvious that it cannot describe kinetics adsorption data well due to low r2 value as can be seen ipd plot does not pass the origin which shows that it is not the only limiting step whereas as shown above pso also describe the adsorption process 58 the ipd model is linked by two straight lines during the al 3 ions adsorption process indicating the adsorption process was controlled by both surface and intraparticle diffusion processes the lowest r2 value was attributed to the elovich model and which reflect the unsuitability of the model to describe the al 3 adsorption by the synthesized adsorbent 3 11 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms have been widely utilized to expound adsorption mechanism in fact insightful date about adsorbent surface structure suitability of adsorption the energy of attraction between adsorbent and adsorbate and etc can be obtained from adsorption isotherms in this study isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin were examined to describe the adsorption mechanism of al 3 as a pollutant and ppy fe3o4 as a synthesized adsorbent langmuir isotherm implies that the number of vacant sites on the adsorbent is not countless and adsorbate accumulation on the adsorbent surface follows a monolayer disposition at a constant temperature furthermore uniformity and homogeneity of the adsorbent are other assumptions of langmuir isotherms the greatest drawback of the langmuir model is that this model believes that each site on the adsorbent has an equivalent adsorbent energy the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is given by the following equation 59 9 c e q e 1 k l q 0 c e q 0 where qe mg g is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration qm mg g is the langmuir constant representing maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of the binding sites isotherm parameters can be calculated by the linear plot of q e c e versus q e the favorability of the langmuir isotherm can be defined by dimension less equilibrium characteristics rl which is defined as 10 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl are the initial concentration of al 3 and langmuir constant respectively once rl value is between zero and one langmuir adsorption is applicable to fit the experimental data well however rl greater than one shows its inapplicability to solve the problems related to the langmuir model freundlich isotherm was proposed which is based on the fact that the adsorbent surface is heterogeneous and also multilayer of solute can be observed on the adsorbent surface a linear form of the freundlich isotherm expression is represented by the following equation 60 11 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf mg l n mg l and ce mg l are freundlich constant which represents adsorption capacity adsorption intensity and equilibrium concentration respectively the plot of lnqe versus lnce gives a straight line with slope kf and intercept 1 n freundlich isotherm can somehow determine if the adsorption process is a physisorption or chemisorption when n value is greater than one and lower than one adsorption is physical and chemical respectively it is obvious that once n 1 freundlich isotherm follows hendry isotherm which is valid at a very low concentration of adsorbate additionally as 1 n gets closer to zero the surface tends to be heterogeneous temkin isotherm developed by the cooperation of three scientists is based on the fact that adsorption energy decreased linearly by the occupation of the adsorbent sites this decline in energy is ascribed to the adsorbent adsorbate interaction 61 the implication of adsorbent and adsorbate interaction is one of the greatest high points of temkin isotherm in comparison to langmuir model the temkin isotherm is given by 62 12 q e b ln a t b ln c e where is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol a t is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g r is the universal gas constant j mol k and t is the absolute temperature at k from the plot of qe versus ce b and a t can be calculated from the slope b and intercepts b ln a t respectively fig 11 shows the plot of the isotherm models and calculated parameters are listed in table 4 according to the obtained r2 values it can be said that freundlich isotherm may describe the adsorption mechanism well the order of the r2 values was temkin langmuir freundlich thus as it was expected adsorbent surface would be heterogeneous and n value greater than one is indicative of the chemical bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent the result is in correspondence with adsorption kinetic in which pso and chemical adsorption were introduced as the adsorption mechanism in spite of the fact that langmuir isotherm is not the suitable model to describe adsorption mechanism when compared to freundlich model but the high r2 value of langmuir model signs that some parts of the adsorbent surface tend to be homogenous similarly 1 n value was approximately 0 89 that is a bit far away from zero furthermore rl values for all the experiment were between 0 and 1 thus indicating that the langmuir isotherm can by favorable low r2 value of temkin isotherm suggests poor fit with this model to sum up the adsorption mechanism seems to follow the freundlich model and the adsorbent surface is a combination of homogeneity and heterogeneity 3 12 adsorption mechanism to design a carefully optimized adsorption condition for al 3 ions removal from aqueous solutions it is essential to determine the adsorption mechanism as fully described before various parameters affected the efficiency of the process the experimental results indicated that ph had an obvious effect on the removal of al 3 the adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 was varied with its surface charge in fact when the ph of the solution was greater than phzpc ppy fe3o4 carries negative charges which was beneficial to the adsorption of positively charged al 3 via electrostatic attraction on the contrary owning the same charges on the adsorbent and adsorbate would definitely inhibit the adsorption efficiency due to the existence of electrostatic repulsion this phenomenon verifies that electrostatic force is not the only adsorption force therefore other forces must exist thorough adsorption the other main mechanism occurs through ion exchange reaction the al 3 ions might selectively coordinate with the n atoms within pyrrole units in a1 2 ratio making a complex ion compound fig 12 the results of adsorption isotherms and kinetics fitted well with freundlich and pso models in which verify chemical adsorption through ion exchange and electrostatic force furthermore it seems that chemisorption is the main adsorption process but physisorption is also effective due to the high bet surface area obtained in this study relatively high r2 value obtained from langmuir isotherm confirms this observation obviously sem images showed that ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 81 nm which is greater than al 3 ions radius and al 3 ions can easily adsorbed on the external pores and internal pores of ppy fe3o4 bet analysis before and after adsorption exhibited the occupation of the adsorbent pores therefore chemisorption and physisorption both are influential in adsorption of al 3 ions by ppy fe3o4 from aqueous media 3 13 comparison of ppy fe3o4 nanocomposite with other sorbents in terms of the adsorption efficiency maximum adsorbent capacity and required contact time to reach the full saturation of the adsorbent sites plays an important role al 3 ions removal from aqueous solutions have recently gained much attention however the literature survey revealed that there are limited numbers of studies regarding aluminum removal table 5 presents a comparison of maximum adsorption capacity and contact time with other earlier reported adsorbents in literature it is evident from this table that adsorption capacity of ppy fe3o4 toward al 3 ions is highly competitive and is higher than most of them requiring a low contact time is one of the greatest advantages of the synthesized adsorbent in the present study when compared to the other adsorbents nontoxicity high surface area easy separation and environmentally friendly are other good points of this adsorbent these results make the ppy fe3o4 nanocomposites promising effective adsorbent for the refining al 3 ions from aqueous media 4 conclusion from the obtained results it can be concluded that the synthesized ppy fe3o4 nanoparticles are a potential material for al 3 ions adsorption from aqueous solutions the synthesized nanocomposites showed a high bet surface area 49 55 m2 g a core shell structure the adsorption process was strongly affected by parameters such as ph contact time adsorbent dosage and temperature the equilibrium time for al 3 ions was determined as 20 min and optimum ph was 3 maximum adsorption efficiency of more than 80 was achieved at adsorbent dosage of 100 μg ml the value of δg was found negative in the adsorption of al 3 on ppy fe3o4 which confirmed the feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process the negative values of δh and δs suggested that the adsorption is exothermic in nature by relating the kinetic models to the experimental data it was noted that the adsorption of the target pollutant followed the pseudo second order rate kinetics isotherm modeling revealed that the freundlich equation could better described the adsorption process as compared to langmuir or temkin isotherm models moreover ppy fe3o4 exhibited removal efficiency of more than 50 even after five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles interestingly the prepared adsorbent showed high selectivity for al 3 ions even in the presence of other competing ions in view of all these outcomes it may be concluded that ppy fe3o4 could be a promising candidate for the removal of al 3 from aqueous solution 
14413,divalent iron and zinc cations can be removed from water by electrocoagulation ec with aluminium electrodes in a discontinuous system the effect of hydrocarbonate hco3 ion often present in liquid waste and in groundwater on the ec process has been investigated for the two ions the presence of hydrocarbonate strongly limits the ph variations by its buffering properties and reduces the rates of al dissolution by corrosion removal of the two cations was then shown to require longer treatment times and larger amounts of dissolved aluminium whereas the local ph gradients near the electrode surface with hco3 free water was previously shown to allow local formation of stable zn and fe hydroxides which actively contribute to their elimination the presence of hydrocarbonate nearly suppresses this positive phenomenon resulting in far less efficient ec treatment whereas removal of zinc cations from carbonated water can be considered as their simple adsorption on the al flocs fe2 ions are oxidized to fe oh 3 by air oxidation after their adsorption use of an overall adsorption model allowed quantitative comparison of the ec treatments with very different adsorption parameters for the two metal studied keywords electrocoagulation water treatment zinc divalent iron hydrogencarbonate ion 1 introduction treatment of waters issuing from industrial processes or drawn from natural reservoirs in the soil has become a tremendous domain of interest because of the increasing population of the planet and the progressive scarcity of rain water in numerous areas in particular heavy metal ions have to be efficiently removed from these waters in view to their possible use and distribution depending on the nature of the metal ions the maximal limit authorized by national or international organizations e g the world health organization ranges from 1 mg l down to 0 01 mg l for iron divalent iron present in groundwater is prone to oxidize at air oxygen to solid trivalent iron hydroxide or carbonate in water distribution systems zinc cations are more usually encountered in industrial waste e g rinsing waters of electrodeposition lines 1 mining industries 2 in addition to possible formation of solid zinc carbonate these cations can cause significant health problems e g nausea irritation and anemia 3 5 at the mg l level in drinking waters amongst the various techniques available for removal of heavy metal ions electrocoagulation ec has often been considered because of its efficiency its easy implementation and the moderate energy and costs induced 6 electrocoagulation relies upon the electrochemical generation of fe or al ions by dissolution of sacrificial anodes the trivalent cations formed favor destabilization of suspended matter and adsorption of various pollutants on solid trivalent hydroxides formed removal of cations of metals e g pb cd ni cu zn contained in various waters by ec has been investigated for the sake of a better understanding of the phenomena involved 3 7 8 al shannag et al 9 10 in addition to production of purified water from the above investigations removal of heavy metal cations me2 is allowed by occurrence of i specific adsorption of the pollutants by complexation with soluble species or by surface complexation on the al fe hydroxides flocs ii adsorption through electrical neutralization and electrostatic attraction between the pollutants and the charged flocs iii formation of me oh 2 near the cathode surface upon water reduction to hydrogen and hydroxide ions followed by co precipitation of the two hydroxides the case of divalent iron differs from the above metal cations because of the capacity of divalent iron to oxidize by air oxygen to poorly soluble iron hydroxide for ph as low as 4 in a previous paper 11 the formation of fe oh 2 in the vicinity of the cathode surface was shown to contribute greatly to fe2 removal in ec processes in chloride or sulfate containing waters whereas liquid phase oxidation of fe2 cations by air oxygen was found little significant because of the too moderate water ph on the contrary fe2 cations adsorbed on al oh 3 flocs and solid fe oh 2 are efficiently oxidized to fe oh 3 presence of hydrogencarbonate is an important factor to be accounted for in the treatment of most ground or natural waters because the buffering properties of this anion are to affect the ph variation in ec runs the performance of ec runs with zn2 solutions prepared with tap water without addition of chloride or sulfate has been shown promising by de mello ferreira et al 12 for the case of sufficient ph and hydrogencarbonate concentration the present work was aimed at investigating the effect of hco3 concentration on the separate removal of fe2 and zn2 cations by ec with al electrodes carefully designed experiments with single metal solutions of various hco3 concentrations have been carried out with monitoring of amounts of al dissolved and solution ph the presence of ca2 ions frequently present in tap water has also been studied interpretation of the data conducted with a formerly published adsorption model 13 allowed more accurate comparison of the behavior of the cations in the treatment 2 materials and methods zinc and iron cations were introduced as analytical grade sulfate salts feso4 7h2o and znso4 7h2o fisher in all solutions employed here fe2 and zn2 concentration was close to 10 mg l i e 0 179 and 0 159 mm respectively sodium chloride acros organics was also added to the various solutions to increase the ionic conductivity and to favor dissolution of aluminum surface of the electrodes by corrosion nb both electrochemical and chemical dissolutions of al produce hydrogen and hydroxide ions after the same stoichiometry 1 al h2o al3 3 oh 3 2 h2 sodium hydrogencarbonate and calcium chloride of analytical grade acros organics were also added at different concentrations as explained below fe and zn solutions were prepared with various contents of sodium hydrogencarbonate in the solutions with the same ionic conductivity 2 86 ms cm at 25 c the concentration of sodium chloride was varied accordingly as shown in table 1 solutions caf2 and cazn2 differ from solutions fe2 and zn2 by the presence of calcium the cell and the device used for electrocoagulation tests has been described in previous papers 11 the solution to be treated 2 l was circulated continuously in a circuit comprising the ec cell provided by two parallel 15 7 cm2 al 4 cu alloy plates a peristaltic pump and a tank the 1 cm gap allowed reasonable ohmic drop in the cell during the chronopotentiometric tests conducted at 1 5 ma cm2 with the dc current supply afx 2930 sb before switching on the current supply the solution ph was adjusted to 6 with diluted hcl or naoh solution for solutions fe0 and zn0 for the other solutions the initial ph adjustment was achieved by bubbling co2 in the tank until the set point ph was attained co2 bubbling was then stopped the tank was loosely covered by the lid to limit co2 losses and the ec run was started because no ions have been introduced in co2 bubbling and neglecting the change in h concentration in the ph adjustment procedure the solution conductivity was not changed from its initial value the cell voltage and the solution ph were monitored in the discontinuous runs the two phase medium were sampled at regular intervals for analysis zn2 and al iii concentrations were obtained by icp aes analysis after suitable dilution in acidified media 2 hno3 the concentrations of al fe and zn cations allowed an accuracy better than 2 in the determination fe2 was assayed using the 1 10 phenanthroline method with uv vis analysis doggaz et al 2018b the exact concentration of metal cations at t 0 was taken as that determined by chemical analysis after runs the surface of the two electrodes was observed by optical microscope dynolite and scanning electronic microscope jeol provided with edx analysis x ray diffraction of solid deposits was achieved with a philips apparatus cu kα and treatment of the spectra was carried out using highscore most of the runs presented have been replicated to check the reproducibility of the trends observed speciation in ec runs first bubbling co2 in hydrogencarbonate solutions is to result in increased overall concentrations of co2 hydrogencarbonate according to the equilibrium 2 co2 h2o hco3 h kco2 if formation of carbonate is neglected in the procedure therefore the overall content of co2 hydrogencarbonate is larger than the introduced amount given in table 1 for instance from the equilibrium constant of 2 reported in table 2 the overall concentration in solutions me2 at ph 6 was estimated at 19 4 mm using phreeqc increase in ph during ec tests is to convert part of co2 to hydrogencarbonate or even carbonate ions conversely should the ph decrease gaseous co2 desorbs from the solution during electrocoagulation zinc and iron can be present in the form of divalent cations remaining in the solution or adsorbed on the al hydroxide flocs or divalent metal hydroxides me oh 2 or for iron as fe oh 3 after air oxidation the presence of hydrogencarbonate ions can induce the formation of solid metal carbonate after the equilibria 3 hco3 co3 2 h khco3 4 me2 co3 2 meco3 s kmeco3 calcium carbonate could also be formed in tests conducted with solutions came2 the values for the various equilibrium constants and solubility products are reported in table 2 for the case of solutions me2 and came2 the lowest ph corresponding to solid precipitation at thermodynamic equilibrium has been estimated table 2 according to table 2 formation of solid carbonate is to be effective for ph as moderate at 6 or so however carbonates of most metals are known to form solids only for sufficient ion overconcentrations so that solid carbonates are to appear only at far larger ph conversely precipitation of zinc and iron hydroxides has been observed in beakers from ph close to 8 in agreement with the thermodynamic estimates in table 2 in the following text fe2 and zn2 concentrations represent the concentrations of divalent metal remaining in the solution in the form of me2 or me oh cations 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments effect of hydrogencarbonate ions along the run dissolution of aluminium by faradaic process and likely chloride catalysed corrosion are accompanied by oh generation principally at the cathode this results in increased ph values after a transient period as shown in fig 1 for fe2 containing solutions without hydrogencarbonate the ph increased from the first minutes with a steadier increasing trend until the end of the run ph 7 5 in the presence of hydrogencarbonate the ph varied quite less due to hco3 buffering properties attaining only 6 3 at the end of the run without a clear effect of hco3 concentration comparable profiles were found with zn2 solutions however with a slight decrease in ph down to 5 8 after 10 min with solutions zn1 and zn2 before a slow but regular increase to 6 3 after 60 min data not shown the amount of al in the media under treatment regularly increased over time fig 2 a and b dissolution of aluminium was at its highest in hydrogencarbonate free solutions fe0 and zn0 with faradaic yields equal to 2 0 and 2 7 for the removal of fe2 and zn2 respectively the difference between the two yields was shown by the different surface state of the al plates anode and cathode employed for the two series of data as checked by dedicated additional measurements with other al plates moreover for the same al plate couple replicate experiments revealed comparable dissolution rates of al within a few percents the nature of metal cations at low concentration does not impact visibly on al dissolution for the two metals the dissolution current yield was shown to be a decreasing function of the amount of hydrogencarbonate from solution me1 to me4 with current yield equal to 1 30 for solution fe4 and 1 75 for solution zn4 because the ph profiles depend very little on the hco3 concentration introduced the above reduction in current yield was likely due to the decreasing nacl content from solution me1 to me4 table 1 resulting in lower al corrosion rates besides the cell voltage usually in the order of 1 5 1 7 v was shown to increase by approx 100 mv in the course of the run with high hydrogencarbonate concentrations which may express passivation of the electrodes optical examination of the electrodes revealed the presence of deposits on the electrode surface after runs with hydrogencarbonate in addition to pronounced traces of corrosion deposits at the anode of a nearly white aspect appeared more compact than those at the cathode deposits at the cathode were nearly white after zn abatement and yellow or brownish after treatment of fe containing solutions data not shown the particular colour may be caused by the presence of trivalent iron oxide or hydroxides edx analysis however only revealed the presence of al and o elements and small little resolved peaks in xrd spectra indicated the formation of gibbsite α al oh 3 on the surface of the two electrodes the presence of solid al hydroxides on the metal could be linked to the nearly neutral ph of the buffering me1 me4 solutions contrary to the case of hydrogencarbonate free solutions for which far larger ph are to exist near the al plates surface due to oh generation removal of the two metal cations over time is shown in fig 3 a and b as for al dissolution with the same al electrodes the removal rate of divalent zn and fe cations differed by less than 5 solutions fe0 and zn0 appear to be the most suitable for removal of me2 by ec with abatement yields over 90 after 30 min upon a charge loading of 144 c l however with different concentrations of al dissolved the effect of hco3 concentration was not the same for the two metal cations investigated increasing hco3 concentration reduced significantly the treatment efficiency of solutions fe1 to fe4 with regular decrease of the treatment rate fig 3a after 60 min the abatement efficiency attained 72 with solution fe1 and only 27 for solution fe4 in contrast the time variations of zn2 concentration are little dependent on hco3 concentration with an abatement yield in the range 70 80 after 60 min without clear effect of the concentration fig 3b the strikingly different behaviours of solutions me0 from that of solutions me1 me4 can partly be explained by the solution ph during ec tests as follows without hydrogencarbonate the ph is prone to rapid change upon al dissolution and oh generation because of the restricted buffering properties of the solutions it has been estimated 17 by a simple model for oh generation at the electrode and its back diffusion to the liquid bulk that ph larger than 10 can be expected in the 40 μm film close to the cathode surface submitted to 1 5 ma cm2 for such ph zn2 and fe2 form divalent hydroxides which precipitate the hydroxides formed are known to remain as solids even after their back diffusion to the liquid bulk with a noticeably lower ph fig 1 with hydrogencarbonate the local increase in ph is rendered far less important by the buffering properties of the anion so that formation of solid fe oh 2 and zn oh 2 is presumably less significant in this case abatement of the metal cations is mainly achieved by their adsorption of the al hydroxides flocs with far lower overall efficiency of the treatment the strong effect of hydrogencarbonate concentration is partly linked to the different current yields of al dissolution commented above but only to a part for closer illustration of this effect the concentrations of metal cations were plotted against al iii concentration in fig 4 tests have shown that using al plates exhibiting higher or lower dissolution rates the abatement of metal cation was not correlated to time but to the amount of al iii formed this could justify the relationship between fe or zn concentrations to that of al iii treatment of hydrogencarbonate free solutions can be efficiently carried out with low amounts of dissolved al 32 mg l allowed abatement yield of fe2 and zn2 respectively equal to 87 and 92 conversely more al iii is required for ec treatment in the presence of hydrogencarbonate for the case of fe2 solutions the lower current efficiency of al dissolution with solution fe4 does not allow to compensate its troublesome treatment by ec fe2 abatement from this solution attains only 26 upon 33 mg l al iii for comparable al dosages treatment efficiency is near 40 from solutions fe2 and fe3 and 57 from low concentrated solution fe1 fig 4a the case of zinc removal differs visibly from that of iron with very comparable zn2 profiles with al iii dosage fig 4b from solutions zn1 zn4 with approx 60 removal efficiency with the above al iii concentration comparable to that with solution fe1 the above data can be expressed in terms of the ratio of zn removed over al flocs generated the ratio was observed to be a decreasing function of time and al iii concentration data not shown as a matter of fact for low al dosages iron and zinc species are efficiently trapped by al oh 3 flocs later in the run solid al oh 3 is a larger excess in the treatment of partly depleted solutions with an increasing fraction of vacant adsorption sites on the al flocs for solution fe0 this ratio is larger than 0 5 mg fe mg al in the first minutes and decreases to 0 18 after 60 min for a nearly total conversion with solution zn0 the ratio varies from 0 3 to 0 1 mg zn mg al along the treatment although efficient the abatement of zn2 from hco3 free solutions requires higher al dosages than that of fe2 the higher treatment rate with divalent iron likely benefits from its oxidation which likely occurs at solid state 11 18 in the presence of hydrocarbonate the zn al ratio is noticeably lower in the order of 0 10 mg mg for all zn containing solutions and with solutions fe2 and fe3 and still lower with solution fe4 the presence of hydrogencarbonate in the solution as in many natural or ground waters induces the formation of al zn flocs with a larger concentration of al for equivalent treatment efficiency more energy and more aluminium have to be spent this has a significant impact on the operating costs related to electricity and al plates 3 2 experiments effect of calcium ions for this purpose solutions cafe2 and cazn2 have been compared to the corresponding ca free solutions for both metals replicate experiments have been carried out with fresh solutions but without cleaning or polishing the surface of the al plates with a view to observing ageing or maturation phenomena of the electrode surfaces the ph variations with time with solutions came2 were very similar to those with me2 solutions data not shown without any visible change over the successive runs the ph exhibited a slight decrease in the first minutes before a regular increase with a ph up to 6 3 within 0 1 after 60 min al dissolution in came2 solutions was shown to proceed in a very similar way as in ca free solutions data not shown with both metals no clear effect of surface ageing or modification was observed the little significant scattering of data was mainly due to uncertainty in the experimental techniques for fe2 containing solutions al iii was generated with an overall current yield at 1 50 within 0 10 in solution cafe2 nearly 0 10 below the value obtained with fe2 medium for the case of zinc the difference was also limited with current efficiency with ca2 approx 0 15 below that in ca free solution zn2 iron abatement in ca free solutions was not significantly affected by experiment replication as shown in fig 5 a with very similar data in run 1 and run 4 conversely elimination of fe2 from solution cafe2 was less efficient in the first run with gradually increasing performance from run 4 fe2 species could be removed as efficiently as in solution fe2 the surface state of the electrodes appears to become more efficient over time for fe2 removal via chemical oxidation with zinc cations the lower performance of the first run although visible is far less important than with fe2 ions fig 5b and the following tests runs 2 and 3 gave efficiency equivalent to that without ca2 ion fig 5b finally fig 6 gives the variations of the metal concentrations with the al dosage in the ec device the slight difference in al dissolution yield induced by the presence of ca2 reduces to a part the difference in treatment performance for the first run with solution cafe2 the conclusions drawn above with fig 5 hold qualitatively for fig 6 with little effect of ca2 on metal cation abatement after sufficient maturation of the electrode surface nevertheless after the above maturation the overall performance with cafe2 solution was slightly larger than that with fe2 fig 6a for both metal cations supplying the liquid with 70 mg l al by ec allows approx 80 abatement far below the above performances with hco3 free solutions the electrodes recovered after the four successive runs with ca2 containing solutions exhibited light grey solid deposits in particular at the cathode at the anode small peaks of gibbsite could also be observed by xrd at the anode solid particles with a size in the order of 20 μm forming square agglomerates fig 7 a suggesting rhomboedric structure in agreement with the predominance of ca revealed by edx measurements xrd spectra of the cathode surface present well defined peaks which have been attributed to gibbsite as with solution me2 and to calcite and aragonite two forms of calcium carbonate with orthorhomboedric structure this is in agreement with formerly reported observations de mello fereira et al 2013 in spite of the presence of buffering hydrogencarbonate the ph in the very vicinity of the cathode surface can be large enough see table 2 to allow formation of calcium carbonate this solid which is to reduce the significance of al corrosion is known to accelerate the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii 19 then favouring its elimination from the solution as postulated above fig 6a data cafe2 run 4 3 3 overall modelling of the effects observed the experiments made and their qualitative interpretation confirmed the occurrence of various phenomena in the removal of fe2 and zn2 ions by electrocoagulation i adsorption of the cations on the al oh 3 flocs possibly followed by in situ

14413,divalent iron and zinc cations can be removed from water by electrocoagulation ec with aluminium electrodes in a discontinuous system the effect of hydrocarbonate hco3 ion often present in liquid waste and in groundwater on the ec process has been investigated for the two ions the presence of hydrocarbonate strongly limits the ph variations by its buffering properties and reduces the rates of al dissolution by corrosion removal of the two cations was then shown to require longer treatment times and larger amounts of dissolved aluminium whereas the local ph gradients near the electrode surface with hco3 free water was previously shown to allow local formation of stable zn and fe hydroxides which actively contribute to their elimination the presence of hydrocarbonate nearly suppresses this positive phenomenon resulting in far less efficient ec treatment whereas removal of zinc cations from carbonated water can be considered as their simple adsorption on the al flocs fe2 ions are oxidized to fe oh 3 by air oxidation after their adsorption use of an overall adsorption model allowed quantitative comparison of the ec treatments with very different adsorption parameters for the two metal studied keywords electrocoagulation water treatment zinc divalent iron hydrogencarbonate ion 1 introduction treatment of waters issuing from industrial processes or drawn from natural reservoirs in the soil has become a tremendous domain of interest because of the increasing population of the planet and the progressive scarcity of rain water in numerous areas in particular heavy metal ions have to be efficiently removed from these waters in view to their possible use and distribution depending on the nature of the metal ions the maximal limit authorized by national or international organizations e g the world health organization ranges from 1 mg l down to 0 01 mg l for iron divalent iron present in groundwater is prone to oxidize at air oxygen to solid trivalent iron hydroxide or carbonate in water distribution systems zinc cations are more usually encountered in industrial waste e g rinsing waters of electrodeposition lines 1 mining industries 2 in addition to possible formation of solid zinc carbonate these cations can cause significant health problems e g nausea irritation and anemia 3 5 at the mg l level in drinking waters amongst the various techniques available for removal of heavy metal ions electrocoagulation ec has often been considered because of its efficiency its easy implementation and the moderate energy and costs induced 6 electrocoagulation relies upon the electrochemical generation of fe or al ions by dissolution of sacrificial anodes the trivalent cations formed favor destabilization of suspended matter and adsorption of various pollutants on solid trivalent hydroxides formed removal of cations of metals e g pb cd ni cu zn contained in various waters by ec has been investigated for the sake of a better understanding of the phenomena involved 3 7 8 al shannag et al 9 10 in addition to production of purified water from the above investigations removal of heavy metal cations me2 is allowed by occurrence of i specific adsorption of the pollutants by complexation with soluble species or by surface complexation on the al fe hydroxides flocs ii adsorption through electrical neutralization and electrostatic attraction between the pollutants and the charged flocs iii formation of me oh 2 near the cathode surface upon water reduction to hydrogen and hydroxide ions followed by co precipitation of the two hydroxides the case of divalent iron differs from the above metal cations because of the capacity of divalent iron to oxidize by air oxygen to poorly soluble iron hydroxide for ph as low as 4 in a previous paper 11 the formation of fe oh 2 in the vicinity of the cathode surface was shown to contribute greatly to fe2 removal in ec processes in chloride or sulfate containing waters whereas liquid phase oxidation of fe2 cations by air oxygen was found little significant because of the too moderate water ph on the contrary fe2 cations adsorbed on al oh 3 flocs and solid fe oh 2 are efficiently oxidized to fe oh 3 presence of hydrogencarbonate is an important factor to be accounted for in the treatment of most ground or natural waters because the buffering properties of this anion are to affect the ph variation in ec runs the performance of ec runs with zn2 solutions prepared with tap water without addition of chloride or sulfate has been shown promising by de mello ferreira et al 12 for the case of sufficient ph and hydrogencarbonate concentration the present work was aimed at investigating the effect of hco3 concentration on the separate removal of fe2 and zn2 cations by ec with al electrodes carefully designed experiments with single metal solutions of various hco3 concentrations have been carried out with monitoring of amounts of al dissolved and solution ph the presence of ca2 ions frequently present in tap water has also been studied interpretation of the data conducted with a formerly published adsorption model 13 allowed more accurate comparison of the behavior of the cations in the treatment 2 materials and methods zinc and iron cations were introduced as analytical grade sulfate salts feso4 7h2o and znso4 7h2o fisher in all solutions employed here fe2 and zn2 concentration was close to 10 mg l i e 0 179 and 0 159 mm respectively sodium chloride acros organics was also added to the various solutions to increase the ionic conductivity and to favor dissolution of aluminum surface of the electrodes by corrosion nb both electrochemical and chemical dissolutions of al produce hydrogen and hydroxide ions after the same stoichiometry 1 al h2o al3 3 oh 3 2 h2 sodium hydrogencarbonate and calcium chloride of analytical grade acros organics were also added at different concentrations as explained below fe and zn solutions were prepared with various contents of sodium hydrogencarbonate in the solutions with the same ionic conductivity 2 86 ms cm at 25 c the concentration of sodium chloride was varied accordingly as shown in table 1 solutions caf2 and cazn2 differ from solutions fe2 and zn2 by the presence of calcium the cell and the device used for electrocoagulation tests has been described in previous papers 11 the solution to be treated 2 l was circulated continuously in a circuit comprising the ec cell provided by two parallel 15 7 cm2 al 4 cu alloy plates a peristaltic pump and a tank the 1 cm gap allowed reasonable ohmic drop in the cell during the chronopotentiometric tests conducted at 1 5 ma cm2 with the dc current supply afx 2930 sb before switching on the current supply the solution ph was adjusted to 6 with diluted hcl or naoh solution for solutions fe0 and zn0 for the other solutions the initial ph adjustment was achieved by bubbling co2 in the tank until the set point ph was attained co2 bubbling was then stopped the tank was loosely covered by the lid to limit co2 losses and the ec run was started because no ions have been introduced in co2 bubbling and neglecting the change in h concentration in the ph adjustment procedure the solution conductivity was not changed from its initial value the cell voltage and the solution ph were monitored in the discontinuous runs the two phase medium were sampled at regular intervals for analysis zn2 and al iii concentrations were obtained by icp aes analysis after suitable dilution in acidified media 2 hno3 the concentrations of al fe and zn cations allowed an accuracy better than 2 in the determination fe2 was assayed using the 1 10 phenanthroline method with uv vis analysis doggaz et al 2018b the exact concentration of metal cations at t 0 was taken as that determined by chemical analysis after runs the surface of the two electrodes was observed by optical microscope dynolite and scanning electronic microscope jeol provided with edx analysis x ray diffraction of solid deposits was achieved with a philips apparatus cu kα and treatment of the spectra was carried out using highscore most of the runs presented have been replicated to check the reproducibility of the trends observed speciation in ec runs first bubbling co2 in hydrogencarbonate solutions is to result in increased overall concentrations of co2 hydrogencarbonate according to the equilibrium 2 co2 h2o hco3 h kco2 if formation of carbonate is neglected in the procedure therefore the overall content of co2 hydrogencarbonate is larger than the introduced amount given in table 1 for instance from the equilibrium constant of 2 reported in table 2 the overall concentration in solutions me2 at ph 6 was estimated at 19 4 mm using phreeqc increase in ph during ec tests is to convert part of co2 to hydrogencarbonate or even carbonate ions conversely should the ph decrease gaseous co2 desorbs from the solution during electrocoagulation zinc and iron can be present in the form of divalent cations remaining in the solution or adsorbed on the al hydroxide flocs or divalent metal hydroxides me oh 2 or for iron as fe oh 3 after air oxidation the presence of hydrogencarbonate ions can induce the formation of solid metal carbonate after the equilibria 3 hco3 co3 2 h khco3 4 me2 co3 2 meco3 s kmeco3 calcium carbonate could also be formed in tests conducted with solutions came2 the values for the various equilibrium constants and solubility products are reported in table 2 for the case of solutions me2 and came2 the lowest ph corresponding to solid precipitation at thermodynamic equilibrium has been estimated table 2 according to table 2 formation of solid carbonate is to be effective for ph as moderate at 6 or so however carbonates of most metals are known to form solids only for sufficient ion overconcentrations so that solid carbonates are to appear only at far larger ph conversely precipitation of zinc and iron hydroxides has been observed in beakers from ph close to 8 in agreement with the thermodynamic estimates in table 2 in the following text fe2 and zn2 concentrations represent the concentrations of divalent metal remaining in the solution in the form of me2 or me oh cations 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiments effect of hydrogencarbonate ions along the run dissolution of aluminium by faradaic process and likely chloride catalysed corrosion are accompanied by oh generation principally at the cathode this results in increased ph values after a transient period as shown in fig 1 for fe2 containing solutions without hydrogencarbonate the ph increased from the first minutes with a steadier increasing trend until the end of the run ph 7 5 in the presence of hydrogencarbonate the ph varied quite less due to hco3 buffering properties attaining only 6 3 at the end of the run without a clear effect of hco3 concentration comparable profiles were found with zn2 solutions however with a slight decrease in ph down to 5 8 after 10 min with solutions zn1 and zn2 before a slow but regular increase to 6 3 after 60 min data not shown the amount of al in the media under treatment regularly increased over time fig 2 a and b dissolution of aluminium was at its highest in hydrogencarbonate free solutions fe0 and zn0 with faradaic yields equal to 2 0 and 2 7 for the removal of fe2 and zn2 respectively the difference between the two yields was shown by the different surface state of the al plates anode and cathode employed for the two series of data as checked by dedicated additional measurements with other al plates moreover for the same al plate couple replicate experiments revealed comparable dissolution rates of al within a few percents the nature of metal cations at low concentration does not impact visibly on al dissolution for the two metals the dissolution current yield was shown to be a decreasing function of the amount of hydrogencarbonate from solution me1 to me4 with current yield equal to 1 30 for solution fe4 and 1 75 for solution zn4 because the ph profiles depend very little on the hco3 concentration introduced the above reduction in current yield was likely due to the decreasing nacl content from solution me1 to me4 table 1 resulting in lower al corrosion rates besides the cell voltage usually in the order of 1 5 1 7 v was shown to increase by approx 100 mv in the course of the run with high hydrogencarbonate concentrations which may express passivation of the electrodes optical examination of the electrodes revealed the presence of deposits on the electrode surface after runs with hydrogencarbonate in addition to pronounced traces of corrosion deposits at the anode of a nearly white aspect appeared more compact than those at the cathode deposits at the cathode were nearly white after zn abatement and yellow or brownish after treatment of fe containing solutions data not shown the particular colour may be caused by the presence of trivalent iron oxide or hydroxides edx analysis however only revealed the presence of al and o elements and small little resolved peaks in xrd spectra indicated the formation of gibbsite α al oh 3 on the surface of the two electrodes the presence of solid al hydroxides on the metal could be linked to the nearly neutral ph of the buffering me1 me4 solutions contrary to the case of hydrogencarbonate free solutions for which far larger ph are to exist near the al plates surface due to oh generation removal of the two metal cations over time is shown in fig 3 a and b as for al dissolution with the same al electrodes the removal rate of divalent zn and fe cations differed by less than 5 solutions fe0 and zn0 appear to be the most suitable for removal of me2 by ec with abatement yields over 90 after 30 min upon a charge loading of 144 c l however with different concentrations of al dissolved the effect of hco3 concentration was not the same for the two metal cations investigated increasing hco3 concentration reduced significantly the treatment efficiency of solutions fe1 to fe4 with regular decrease of the treatment rate fig 3a after 60 min the abatement efficiency attained 72 with solution fe1 and only 27 for solution fe4 in contrast the time variations of zn2 concentration are little dependent on hco3 concentration with an abatement yield in the range 70 80 after 60 min without clear effect of the concentration fig 3b the strikingly different behaviours of solutions me0 from that of solutions me1 me4 can partly be explained by the solution ph during ec tests as follows without hydrogencarbonate the ph is prone to rapid change upon al dissolution and oh generation because of the restricted buffering properties of the solutions it has been estimated 17 by a simple model for oh generation at the electrode and its back diffusion to the liquid bulk that ph larger than 10 can be expected in the 40 μm film close to the cathode surface submitted to 1 5 ma cm2 for such ph zn2 and fe2 form divalent hydroxides which precipitate the hydroxides formed are known to remain as solids even after their back diffusion to the liquid bulk with a noticeably lower ph fig 1 with hydrogencarbonate the local increase in ph is rendered far less important by the buffering properties of the anion so that formation of solid fe oh 2 and zn oh 2 is presumably less significant in this case abatement of the metal cations is mainly achieved by their adsorption of the al hydroxides flocs with far lower overall efficiency of the treatment the strong effect of hydrogencarbonate concentration is partly linked to the different current yields of al dissolution commented above but only to a part for closer illustration of this effect the concentrations of metal cations were plotted against al iii concentration in fig 4 tests have shown that using al plates exhibiting higher or lower dissolution rates the abatement of metal cation was not correlated to time but to the amount of al iii formed this could justify the relationship between fe or zn concentrations to that of al iii treatment of hydrogencarbonate free solutions can be efficiently carried out with low amounts of dissolved al 32 mg l allowed abatement yield of fe2 and zn2 respectively equal to 87 and 92 conversely more al iii is required for ec treatment in the presence of hydrogencarbonate for the case of fe2 solutions the lower current efficiency of al dissolution with solution fe4 does not allow to compensate its troublesome treatment by ec fe2 abatement from this solution attains only 26 upon 33 mg l al iii for comparable al dosages treatment efficiency is near 40 from solutions fe2 and fe3 and 57 from low concentrated solution fe1 fig 4a the case of zinc removal differs visibly from that of iron with very comparable zn2 profiles with al iii dosage fig 4b from solutions zn1 zn4 with approx 60 removal efficiency with the above al iii concentration comparable to that with solution fe1 the above data can be expressed in terms of the ratio of zn removed over al flocs generated the ratio was observed to be a decreasing function of time and al iii concentration data not shown as a matter of fact for low al dosages iron and zinc species are efficiently trapped by al oh 3 flocs later in the run solid al oh 3 is a larger excess in the treatment of partly depleted solutions with an increasing fraction of vacant adsorption sites on the al flocs for solution fe0 this ratio is larger than 0 5 mg fe mg al in the first minutes and decreases to 0 18 after 60 min for a nearly total conversion with solution zn0 the ratio varies from 0 3 to 0 1 mg zn mg al along the treatment although efficient the abatement of zn2 from hco3 free solutions requires higher al dosages than that of fe2 the higher treatment rate with divalent iron likely benefits from its oxidation which likely occurs at solid state 11 18 in the presence of hydrocarbonate the zn al ratio is noticeably lower in the order of 0 10 mg mg for all zn containing solutions and with solutions fe2 and fe3 and still lower with solution fe4 the presence of hydrogencarbonate in the solution as in many natural or ground waters induces the formation of al zn flocs with a larger concentration of al for equivalent treatment efficiency more energy and more aluminium have to be spent this has a significant impact on the operating costs related to electricity and al plates 3 2 experiments effect of calcium ions for this purpose solutions cafe2 and cazn2 have been compared to the corresponding ca free solutions for both metals replicate experiments have been carried out with fresh solutions but without cleaning or polishing the surface of the al plates with a view to observing ageing or maturation phenomena of the electrode surfaces the ph variations with time with solutions came2 were very similar to those with me2 solutions data not shown without any visible change over the successive runs the ph exhibited a slight decrease in the first minutes before a regular increase with a ph up to 6 3 within 0 1 after 60 min al dissolution in came2 solutions was shown to proceed in a very similar way as in ca free solutions data not shown with both metals no clear effect of surface ageing or modification was observed the little significant scattering of data was mainly due to uncertainty in the experimental techniques for fe2 containing solutions al iii was generated with an overall current yield at 1 50 within 0 10 in solution cafe2 nearly 0 10 below the value obtained with fe2 medium for the case of zinc the difference was also limited with current efficiency with ca2 approx 0 15 below that in ca free solution zn2 iron abatement in ca free solutions was not significantly affected by experiment replication as shown in fig 5 a with very similar data in run 1 and run 4 conversely elimination of fe2 from solution cafe2 was less efficient in the first run with gradually increasing performance from run 4 fe2 species could be removed as efficiently as in solution fe2 the surface state of the electrodes appears to become more efficient over time for fe2 removal via chemical oxidation with zinc cations the lower performance of the first run although visible is far less important than with fe2 ions fig 5b and the following tests runs 2 and 3 gave efficiency equivalent to that without ca2 ion fig 5b finally fig 6 gives the variations of the metal concentrations with the al dosage in the ec device the slight difference in al dissolution yield induced by the presence of ca2 reduces to a part the difference in treatment performance for the first run with solution cafe2 the conclusions drawn above with fig 5 hold qualitatively for fig 6 with little effect of ca2 on metal cation abatement after sufficient maturation of the electrode surface nevertheless after the above maturation the overall performance with cafe2 solution was slightly larger than that with fe2 fig 6a for both metal cations supplying the liquid with 70 mg l al by ec allows approx 80 abatement far below the above performances with hco3 free solutions the electrodes recovered after the four successive runs with ca2 containing solutions exhibited light grey solid deposits in particular at the cathode at the anode small peaks of gibbsite could also be observed by xrd at the anode solid particles with a size in the order of 20 μm forming square agglomerates fig 7 a suggesting rhomboedric structure in agreement with the predominance of ca revealed by edx measurements xrd spectra of the cathode surface present well defined peaks which have been attributed to gibbsite as with solution me2 and to calcite and aragonite two forms of calcium carbonate with orthorhomboedric structure this is in agreement with formerly reported observations de mello fereira et al 2013 in spite of the presence of buffering hydrogencarbonate the ph in the very vicinity of the cathode surface can be large enough see table 2 to allow formation of calcium carbonate this solid which is to reduce the significance of al corrosion is known to accelerate the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii 19 then favouring its elimination from the solution as postulated above fig 6a data cafe2 run 4 3 3 overall modelling of the effects observed the experiments made and their qualitative interpretation confirmed the occurrence of various phenomena in the removal of fe2 and zn2 ions by electrocoagulation i adsorption of the cations on the al oh 3 flocs possibly followed by in situ

interesting topics in recent chemical researches and materials sciences bearing substantial properties such as nontoxicity high stability low cost and being easy to prepare crystalline tio2 semiconductor has received considerable attention for the past three decades 1 4 however the principal problem restricting the practical applications of titanium dioxide as one of the most efficient semiconductor based photocatalysts is the large band gap 3 2 ev and its insignificant response to visible irradiation sources during the last few years a progressively increased number of new semiconducting materials have been prepared and utilized as proper candidates for tio2 to solve the global issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution 5 7 as another strategy the development

the absorption of the pollutants was determined by uv spectrophotometer gbc cintra40 at λmax values of the pollutants the xrd patterns and the ftir spectra of the samples were recorded on a bruker d8

bacterial strains escherichia coli e coli atcc 8739 a gram negative bacterium and staphylococcus aureus s aureus ptcc 1431 a gram positive bacterium were investigated 2 2 2 the measurement of mic and mbc of the nanostructure determination of mic against the bacteria were performed by evaluation of optical density of each bacterial culture solution containing different dosages of the nanostructure after 24 h mbc was also done using the plate count method 37 2 2 3 the growth curves of bacterial cells exposed to different concentrations of the nanostructure the growth curves of bacterial cells exposed to the nanostructure powder were plotted briefly 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 2 5 mg ml of the solid powder were added to trypticase soy broth tsb medium dosage of 0 0 is introduced as control sample and concentration of bacterial cells was adjusted to 106 cfu colony forming unite ml after 24 h of shaking incubation at 37 c the growth curves of the bacterial solutions were attained by repeated examination of the optical density o d at 600 nm consequently 100 μl of each cultured bacterial solution was spread on tripticase soy agar tsa in 1 h intervals and the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h to find the number of viable bacterial cells in each bacterial culture treated by the nanostructure the number of the bacterial colonies in the plates was counted the as mentioned steps were

crystalline phase of the photocatalyst was demonstrated by the xrd pattern which is shown in fig 1 the characteristic diffraction peaks in 2 theta 23 8 39 3 46 4 and 56 8 are indexed to the crystalline phases of agi jcpds card no 09 0374 the sharp peaks appeared at 27 5 45 6 54 1 and 75 6 are assigned to the cubic phase of agcl nanocrystals red color jcpds no 31 1238 furthermore we observed the characteristic peaks related to the tetragonal crystalline phase of biocl at 27 5 31 9 46 4 and 66 7 green jcpds no 06 0249 and those of bioi at 31 9 73 4 and 84 4 blue color jcpds no 73 2062 the results of the xrd analysis affirmed that the product is a quaternary photocatalyst composed of biocl bioi agcl and agi crystalline phases where each segment could effectively act as a promoting agent to enhance the photoactivity under visible light the suitability of the precursors mainly moyi cl and tbai where simultaneously acted as template agent and halide sources used for synthesis is another factor intensely influenced the homogeneous growth of the multicomponent crystalline phases fig 2 displays the ftir spectra of the prepared sample the peak at 523 cm 1 assigned to the symmetrical stretching vibration of the obi bond which is a typical peak of bismuth oxihalides 22 this band can also be attributed to the stretching vibration of agx x cl and i bonds in the structures 38 the peak at 1460 cm 1 and the broaden peak at 3531 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of oh bonds and the stretching vibrations of adsorbed h2o molecules on the surface respectively the sharp absorption band around 2350 cm 1 can be attributed to the conjugation between agx and biox sections in the bulk 39 the band gap of the prepared nanocomposite was evaluated from the optical absorbance spectra by plotting the αhν 1 2 vs energy hν and extrapolating the linear part of the curve to zero 40 as exhibited in fig 3 the evaluated value of 2 65 ev implies that the product posses suitable capability for the photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants under visible irradiation and sun light the morphology of the prepared sample was studied by using of the sem images and the results are displayed in fig 4 the sem micrographs indicate that the samples possessed large scale 2d sheet like structures and the size of the particles was below 2 0 μm exhibiting the sample included unique morphology from fig 4 the thickness of the sheets was also estimated to be below 100 nm tem images were also provided to clarify the morphology of the prepared sample in details and the results is indicated in fig 5 as one can see the tem images obviously describe the sheet like morphology of the photocatalyst and exhibits that the prepared sheets have nanometric thickness using brunauer emmett teller bet analysis method and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the porosity of the prepared photocatalyst was examined and the specific surface area was evaluated to be 13 1 m2 g 1 according to the results of the bjh analysis the maximum distribution of the pores size in the final product is between 2 10 nm fig 6 taking advantage of high specific surface area value is very important for accelerating the heterogeneous reactions but it has negative effect when the targets chemically adsorb on the surface this causes poisoning the catalytic active sites and reducing the photocatalytic activity thus there was no worry about the pretty low specific surface area of the sample 3 2 photodegradation of the environmental pollutions and pathogenic bacteria photocatalytic activity of the product was examined by photdegradation of ab92 and 3m4n aqueous solutions 30 ml 20 ppm in the presence of 20 mg of the photocatalyst powder under a 160 w osram lamp as the visible irradiation source and the results are shown in fig 7 a and b besides dark tests wastewater solution photocatalyst powder in the absence of irradiation source and photolysis experiments wastewater solution the irradiation source were performed to find the sorption capacity of the photocatalyst and the results confirmed that the absorbance in the lambda max didn t decrease for both of the pollutant solutions in fact all the removal efficiency can be attributed to the photocatalytic activity of the prepared nanostructure as shown in fig 7a the photocatalyst was able to degrade the chromophoric structure of ab92 in 75 min moreover the concentration of 3m4n was considerably decreased after 120 min of the reaction time the uv spectra of 3m4n solution during the photocatalytic treatment are represented in fig 7b which implies the remarkable decrease of the contaminant concentration at the end of the reaction dark tests were also performed to find the sorption capacity of the photocatalyst and we found that the concentration of the wastewaters didn t change at all this was expectable because of the low specific surface area 13 1 m2 g 1 and unmodified surface of the nanoparticles as two effective factors that improve the sorption capability the experimental data also demonstrate that the photodegradation reactions over the prepared nanostructure obey pseudo first order kinetics from fig 8 a and b plotting ln a0 a versus time the rate constants were determined to be 0 012 and 0 045 min 1 for 3m4n and ab92 respectively the photocatalytic capacity of the product was also investigated under sun light and we found that 4 h of reaction time is required to achieve 90 efficiency of ab92 removal which points out the promising photocatalytic capacity of the quaternary nanocomposite for further using in the treatment of outdoor polluted environments a suitable mechanism for the degradation process is proposed as following 1 biocl i agcl i hυ e cb h vb 2 h

5 ring opening bond cleavage oxidyzing carboxylic acids ketones aldehydes 6 o h o 2 c o 2 h 2 o n o x electron hole pairs were generated on the surface of the photoactive nanoparticles suspended in the solution electrons transferring from the conduction bands cbs of the semiconducting segments which their cbs bands are located at higher potentials biocl and agi to the lower cbs of the other components bioi and agcl with lower potential and transferring the photogenerated holes from the valance bands vbs of the segments with lower potential to the higher potential vbs of the other segments reduce the ecb hvb recombination and this guaranties the improved photocatalytic capacity of the prepared sample the positive holes react with the species like o2 h2o and hydroxide ions in the aqueous solution to produce destroyer radicals oh o2 ho2 which are mainly responsible for degrading the organic pollutions and pathogenic microorganisms these processes are schematically shown in fig 9 minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were evaluated as two important parameters in the antibacterial experiments the lowest concentration of the solid powder that inhibited visible growth of the bacterial strain on broth medium mic was 1 0 mg ml and 0 1 mg ml for e coli and s aureus respectively the rate of mic of the nanostructure against both of the bacteria was 2 5 mg ml the viable growth of e coli was inhibited using 1 0 and 2 5 mg ml of the prepared sample while with 0 1 mg ml of the nanostructure the bacterial growth was detected in broth medium on the other hand all of used concentrations of the solid inhibited the growth of s aureus in broth medium bactericidal activities against the gram positive s aureus and gram negative e coli were almost identical fig 10 with 2 5 mg ml of the nanostructure powder no bacterial colonies were observed in the culture medium while the concentration of 1 25 mg ml inhibits considerably the growth of bacteria according to the results the bacterial inhibitory effect against s aureus was more vigorous than e coli which can be caused by the characteristics of cell wall structure of gram negative bacteria notable difference was not observed in high concentrations of the nanostructure especially about the atcc 8739 strain the growth curves for different concentrations of biocl agcl bioi agi against the bacteria are shown in fig 11 the bacterial growth for the culture medium treated with 0 1 mg ml of the nanostructure was slightly lower than that of the cells in the control group the number of e coli bacterial colonies for the culture treated with 1 0 and 2 5 mg ml were similar and much lower than the group of 0 1 mg ml all of three concentrations of the nanostructure in the bacterial cultures contained s aureus indicated antibacterial effect but the rate of activity was different the culture with higher concentration of the nanostructure showed better antibacterial activity comparing the antibacterial activity of biocl agcl bioi agi against e coli and s aureus bacteria an observable inhibition was detected by utilizing the lowest concentration 0 1 mg ml of the sample for e coli while the survival rate of the bacterial cells was significant when the similar test was performed with s aureus according to bacterial growth curves the sample showed more effective growth inhibition against e coli than s aureus which was discussed by the other studies 41 42 according to the obtained results all the concentrations of biocl agcl bioi agi showed antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains while the highest concentration exhibited more effective controlling capacity for the e coli infections than s aureus in other words the higher concentration was enabled to inhibit e coli growth in the culture medium much efficiently than s aureus 4 conclusions in summary the sheet like biocl agcl bioi agi quaternary nanocomposite as a unique heterojunction photocatalyst was homogenously synthesized by a facile co precipitation method the characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern well confirmed the successful homogeneous growth of the biocl bioi agcl and agi nanocrystals in the nanostructure according to the result of drs analysis the band gap energy was estimated to be 2 6 2 7 ev which implied the product was visible light active the experiments indicated that the prepared sample was able to degrade the 3m4n and ab92 contaminants in the aqueous phase lower than 120 min of the reaction time in addition to the evaluation of the rate constants 0 012 and 0 045 min 1 for 3m4n and ab92 respectively a suitable mechanism was proposed which remarked the role of free radicals during the photocatalytic treatment the antibacterial activity of the photocatalyst was also investigated and mbc was determined to be 1 25 mg ml against both gram negative and positive bacteria moreover the antibacterial results demonstrated the higher activity of the nanostructure against e coli which was explainable based on the multilayer structure of s aureus cell wall

sample for e coli while the survival rate of the bacterial cells was significant when the similar test was performed with s aureus according to bacterial growth curves the sample showed more effective growth inhibition against e coli than s aureus which was discussed by the other studies 41 42 according to the obtained results all the concentrations of biocl agcl bioi agi showed antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains while the highest concentration exhibited more effective controlling capacity for the e coli infections than s aureus in other words the higher concentration was enabled to inhibit e coli growth in the culture medium much efficiently than s aureus 4 conclusions in summary the sheet like biocl agcl bioi agi quaternary nanocomposite as a unique heterojunction photocatalyst was homogenously synthesized by a facile co precipitation method the characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern well confirmed the successful homogeneous growth of the biocl bioi agcl and agi nanocrystals in the nanostructure according to the result of drs analysis the band gap energy was estimated to be 2 6 2 7 ev which implied the product was visible light active the experiments indicated that the prepared sample was able to degrade the 3m4n and ab92 contaminants in the aqueous phase lower than 120 min of the reaction time in addition to the evaluation of the rate constants 0 012 and 0 045 min 1 for 3m4n and ab92 respectively a suitable mechanism was proposed which remarked the role of free radicals during the photocatalytic treatment the antibacterial activity of the photocatalyst was also investigated and mbc was determined to be 1 25 mg ml against both gram negative and positive bacteria moreover the antibacterial results demonstrated the higher activity of the nanostructure against e coli which was explainable based on the multilayer structure of s aureus cell wall
