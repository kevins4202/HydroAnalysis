4250,post fire hydrologic research typically focuses on the first few years after a wildfire leading to substantial uncertainty regarding the longevity of impacts the time needed for hydrologic function to return to pre fire conditions is critical information for post fire land and water management decisions this is particularly true in mediterranean climates where water is scarce and in high demand and the severity and area burned by wildfires are increasing in part uncertainty about hydrologic recovery is due to lack of a consistent definition or interpretation of what constitutes recovery here we systematically reviewed empirical studies from mediterranean climates with at least three years of post fire hydrologic data with the objectives of a assessing the recovery period b identifying a definition of post fire hydrologic recovery c demonstrating a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery and d outlining research needs and opportunities to better quantify post fire recovery we assessed the hydrologic effects reported in 38 sites that were monitored for 3 20 years eighteen sites were considered recovered within seven years however the recovery time was inconsistent across sites and was not related to location response variable or study design the likelihood of recovery within the study period also decreased with increasing proportion of the watershed area burned importantly we have also proposed a standardized definition and an approach to quantifying hydrologic recovery that may facilitate cross study comparisons and a deeper understanding of recovery specifically we propose hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post fire hydrologic function or condition of interest returns to the 95 confidence interval of the pre fire condition in support of this definition we have demonstrated applying this simple approach to assess recovery and presented future research topics to improve our understanding of long term post fire catchment responses in addition to the need for more studies that quantify hydrologic responses farther into the post fire period understanding post fire changes in soil structural and hydraulic properties through time will improve our mechanistic understanding of post fire hydrologic responses and recovery keywords post fire recovery long term catchment watershed burn recovery metric 1 introduction wildfire activity including length of wildfire season number of fires area burned and fire severity has increased in many areas of the world in recent decades abatzoglou and kolden 2013 reilly et al 2017 these rising trends are projected to continue in some regions due to climate change increasing population and fire suppression activities flannigan et al 2013 moritz et al 2012 concurrently there have been growing concerns about the economic social and environmental impacts of increasingly severe wildfires bowman et al 2017 schoennagel et al 2017 stevens rumann et al 2018 deficiencies in the literature exist concerning the magnitude extent and longevity of effects from wildfire on water supplies bladon et al 2014 hallema et al 2018a heath et al 2014 leonard et al 2017 mirus et al 2017 murphy et al 2015 rhoades et al 2019b the importance of addressing these knowledge deficiencies is critical due to increased fire activity in many regions that have concurrently experienced substantial declines in both water quantity and quality bladon 2018 martin 2016 nunes et al 2018 as such several studies have noted the need to include fire in local regional and global assessments of catchment vulnerability to the effects of disturbances on hydrologic processes kinoshita et al 2016 martin 2016 robinne et al 2018 2021 a growing number of studies have investigated the effects of wildfires on water quantity water quality aquatic ecology and downstream drinking water supply e g hallema et al 2018b kinoshita et al 2014 loiselle et al 2020 moody et al 2016 moreno et al 2020 rust et al 2018 many have shown that soil hydraulic properties and runoff generation mechanisms may be altered by wildfire ebel and moody 2017 ebel et al 2016 leading to increased annual water yields low flows and peak flows for several post fire years blount et al 2020 hallema et al 2017a saxe et al 2018 or even decades brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 niemeyer et al 2020 moreover exposed mineral soils are highly susceptible to hillslope erosion or debris flows which deliver sediment and other contaminants from burned hillslopes to streams nyman et al 2020 sheridan et al 2016 wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 combined these and other post fire changes in source water quantity and quality have the potential to propagate long distances downstream impacting aquatic ecosystem health and creating substantial challenges for drinking water treatment chow et al 2019 emelko et al 2011 2016 hohner et al 2019 many studies have shown a peak in hydrologic impacts during the first several years after wildfire i e initial response followed by a decline at varying rates before returning to the pre fire condition or some alternate stable state ebel 2020 ebel and mirus 2014 greenbaum et al 2021 noske et al 2016 vieira et al 2016 the longevity and trajectory of the recovery curve may be influenced by a range of factors including fire severity disturbance history post fire land management catchment physiography vegetation composition and regrowth soils geology climate and weather during the post fire years prats et al 2016 vieira et al 2015 wittenberg and inbar 2009 fig 1 in particular burn severity is often considered a key control on the magnitude of post fire hydrologic responses keeley 2009 moody et al 2016 vieira et al 2015 similarly post fire precipitation is another important control on hydrologic responses from burned areas often explaining much of the variability in local responses benavides solorio and macdonald 2005 hallema et al 2017b moody and martin 2001 murphy et al 2015 wu et al 2021 other important controls on downstream processes include the proportion of catchment burned bart 2016 hallema et al 2018b and the regrowth of vegetation which often is related to the regeneration mechanism i e seeding versus resprouting and post fire weather patterns keeley 1992 keeley and zedler 1978 kinoshita and hogue 2011 niemeyer et al 2020 evidence also shows that the recovery trajectory may be altered by the resiliency of the ecosystem in the face of increasing wildfire activity scheffer et al 2001 schoennagel et al 2017 the vast majority of studies investigating the effects of wildfire on water quantity or quality have focused on the initial 5 years effects e g florsheim et al 2017 saxe et al 2018 silins et al 2014 smith et al 2012 comparatively few studies have investigated the longer term effects of wildfire rhoades et al 2019a despite clear evidence of the essential value of long term research laudon et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2017 further few datasets include pre and post fire hydrologic responses from hillslopes or small catchments for periods long enough to statistically assess longer term post fire responses thus the longevity of post fire hydrologic effects is uncertain which hinders prediction of catchment processes during the post fire recovery period and longer term post fire management recent assessments of global wildfire risks to water security indicate that some of the most vulnerable cities e g cape town haifa istanbul and san francisco are located in mediterranean climates robinne et al 2018 2016 additionally because water demand often exceeds available resources due to tremendous variability in annual and seasonal precipitation dahm 2010 gasith and resh 1999 iglesias et al 2011 kondolf and batalla 2005 many regions with mediterranean climates rely on dams and water conveyance infrastructure conacher and sala 1998 kondolf and batalla 2005 thoms and sheldon 2000 which may be negatively impacted by elevated post wildfire sediment yields murphy et al 2018 post fire hydrologic responses in mediterranean climates generally result from long duration cyclonic or frontal systems where periods of high intensity precipitation can lead to overland flow these responses contrast with drivers or responses in other fire dominated climate regimes such as convective precipitation in areas with warm continental climates saxe et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 or the impacts of fire on subsurface flow in areas with boreal climates and permafrost ebel et al 2019 koch et al 2014 walvoord et al 2019 additionally a relatively large portion of post fire hydrologic research has occurred in mediterranean climates which provides an opportunity to combine the results from experiments with similar climates and vegetation to identify commonalities quantifying the legacy impacts of wildfire also remains challenging due to varying definitions of recovery thus there is a critical need to clarify the concept of post fire hydrologic recovery and apply more rigor in testing whether post fire responses have recovered to improve models and predictions for post fire land and water management decisions our working theory is that the post fire response measured as a departure from the pre fire range of variability would return to the pre fire condition within a predictable period constrained by some distribution of natural variability fig 1 this theoretical recovery period may differ by the hydrologic process of interest such as runoff generation transpiration or rainfall interception regardless of parameter of interest we hypothesize that the dominant controls on post fire recovery rates are burn severity precipitation timing and magnitude and vegetation regrowth and that these factors can lead to a wide range of possible post fire recovery trajectories fig 1 we further hypothesize that with enough information about post fire responses across a range of fire severity and post fire weather and vegetation conditions the recovery period can be predicted with reasonable accuracy our goal was to identify and summarize past research in mediterranean climates that could provide a sufficient level of information to quantify the likely range of post fire recovery periods to aid post fire management and research specifically we evaluated empirical studies in mediterranean climates to meet the following objectives a synthesize results from longer term post fire hydrologic studies to assess the recovery period and bound the recovery timescale b identify a common definition of post fire hydrologic recovery to unify terminology c demonstrate a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery across diverse catchment conditions and research or monitoring objectives and d outline research needs and opportunities to better quantify and predict post fire recovery we focused on studies addressing surface water quantity and sediment delivery however the general recovery framework and principles of analysis presented here are extensible to other physical and chemical water quality metrics 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics due to the dominant influence of temperature and precipitation regimes on vegetation composition and productivity bailey 1989 as well as the potential for similarities in hydrologic response and recovery hallema et al 2018b we have focused our analysis on climate type rather than ecoregion or location our review focused on areas with mediterranean climates as characterized by the köppen geiger classification system fig 2 all three mediterranean climates are described as temperate with dry summers and wet winters the driest summer month produces 40 mm of precipitation and less than one third of the precipitation of the wettest winter month peel et al 2007 the csa class has hot dry summers with maximum mean monthly temperature tmax greater than 22 c during at least one month and all months with a mean monthly temperature above 0 c the csb class has warm summers with tmax 22 c during all months at least four months with a mean temperature of at least 10 c and all months with a mean monthly temperature above 0 c peel et al 2007 the third class csc is for cold summers where between one and four months have mean temperature of at least 10 c but this class is much less prevalent and was not included in our review these climate conditions generally occur between 30 and 40 latitude lionello et al 2006 extending to about 49 north latitude in western north america peel et al 2007 more than half of the land area with mediterranean climates is located in the mediterranean basin with other major regions in southwestern

increases fire frequency archibald et al 2013 and when combined with the relatively high population densities and resultant increased human ignitions montenegro et al 2004 pausas et al 2008 van wilgen et al 2012 have led to increased wildfire occurrence and severity in recent decades bowman et al 2017 moritz et al 2014 2 2 literature search we focused our literature review on english language post wildfire hydrologic studies in regions with mediterranean köppen geiger csa hot dry summer or csb warm dry summer climate classifications peel et al 2007 we combined prior knowledge of the literature with systematic searches of databases to identify empirical studies that included at least three years of post fire field based hydrologic observations we also reviewed citations in identified articles to expand our literature search our search terms in georef scopus web of science and google scholar included either fire or burn combined with recovery hydrolog runoff catchment discharge flow or water the asterisk was used as a wildcard search character to include word fragments in a single search we screened the articles and government reports available through january 2021 and included them if the study a included sites affected by wildfire b was located in a csa or csb climate c quantified a hydrologic response including runoff evapotranspiration infiltration erosion sediment delivery or sediment concentration d measured responses at the plot 1 10 m2 hillslope 10 5000 m2 or catchment 5000 m2 scales and e included at least three years of post fire data we recorded the latitude longitude fire year post fire study duration measurement types and spatial scales soil texture pre fire vegetation and the proportion of the experimental unit or catchment burned for each included study we also recorded the burn severity classification when it was provided or when it could be assessed through the monitoring trends in burn severity data monitoring trends in burn severity 2019 we either retained the climate classification provided in the article or when no classification was provided we used the approximate location and local climate maps e g http stepsa org climate koppen geiger html to assign one for global consistency we mapped the study locations using the climate classifications from peel et al 2007 fig 2 we also recorded the stream order and whether the stream was perennial intermittent or ephemeral when provided in the articles or the classification could be determined by the location and google earth imagery google llc 2020 in some cases the original authors had indicated recovery however recovery was not assessed explicitly in most of the studies for consistency we assessed the state of recovery for the main hydrologic response variable using data presented in each original study and the same criteria we classified the recovery of each study using one of the following criteria depending on the available data a before after ba when pre fire data were included and the post fire response returned to the pre fire condition b control impacted ci when an unburned reference condition was included and the response in the burned site was similar to the response in the unburned site or c hypothetical h when no unburned reference data were provided and the post fire variable of interest attained a zero response i e equivalent to pre fire response in cases where published data and statistical analyses allowed more rigorous assessment we used those results in most cases such analyses were not available which necessitated using the hypothetical criterion as it was the simplest and most conservative criterion we could apply among the diverse studies when a single publication discussed post fire responses at multiple sites e g bart and hope 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2011 or from multiple conditions such as different vegetation types e g cerdà and doerr 2005 hubbert et al 2012 the multiple sites or conditions were treated independently some articles covered the same site over different periods or used different analyses e g cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 we treated those cases as a single study given the immense variability in spatial scale among the identified studies over 10 orders of magnitude we did not compare the studies in absolute terms also because of the different time steps used in the studies we did not attempt to normalize results by annual precipitation or some other index rather we examined site factors for similarities as an explanation for whether the sites recovered or not 2 3 post fire hydrologic recovery metrics and case studies hydrologic recovery following either natural or anthropogenic disturbance has been defined as the restoration of pre disturbance hydrologic characteristics such as interception evapotranspiration or streamflow to near pre disturbance conditions buttle et al 2018 hudson 2000 moreover assessment of recovery depends on the specific process output temporal and spatial scales and application or objective e g aquatic habitat flood protection recreation or community drinking water supply these different factors complicate the assessment of recovery yet the complexity can be reduced by metrics that simplify analysis although many possible metrics exist we suggest metrics that could be useful to various end users interested in post fire hydrologic recovery grouped in table 1 by potential use water supply water related hazard infrastructure and ecological habitat we used longer term datasets of pre and post fire precipitation and discharge from city creek california u s kinoshita and hogue 2015 and the rimbaud catchment in southern france lavabre et al 1993 to demonstrate the utility of metrics in assessing recovery the october november 2003 old fire burned approximately 87 of the city creek catchment 50 8 km2 including 13 at high severity and 57 at moderate severity kinoshita and hogue 2015 daily precipitation data 2860 san bernardino county 2018 and hourly discharge data 11055800 u s geological survey 2018 were obtained for water years 1 oct 30 sep 1989 2017 comparatively a fire occurred in the rimbaud catchment 1 46 km2 in august 1990 burning approximately 85 of the catchment at unspecified severity lavabre et al 1993 we obtained hourly precipitation and discharge data for water years 1968 2010 n folton institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l environnement et l agriculture personal communication 14 may 2018 for statistical analysis we used water years 1989 2003 for city creek and 1968 1990 for the rimbaud catchment for the pre fire periods we calculated several metrics for the pre and post fire periods runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve using an exponential fit and flows that were exceeded 90 q 90 low flow and 10 of the time q 10 high flow table 1 we also calculated the proportion of time with no flow at rimbaud which had intermittent streamflow the runoff ratios were calculated on annual timescales water years and the other metrics were calculated using hourly time steps consistent with the temporal resolution of the discharge data we removed observations when there was no flow for the frequency analyses this was more common at the rimbaud catchment given its smaller size and intermittency we also excluded data from rimbaud when more than 10 of the observations were missing water years 1986 and 2000 2002 we applied relatively simple statistics to assess hydrologic recovery using the selected metrics with the intent that a more accessible approach would increase the utility for a diverse group of users we calculated 95 confidence intervals for the pre fire metrics assuming a t distribution helsel and hirsch 2002 all the city creek metrics except the slope of the flow duration curve and the rimbaud q 90 showed some skewness so these values were log10 transformed before determining the confidence intervals we then calculated and plotted the metrics from the post fire period and considered that a state of recovery had been reached if the post fire metrics were within the 95 confidence interval from the pre fire period 3 results 3 1 systematic review of post fire hydrologic recovery our literature search and screening resulted in 28 studies covering 38 distinct sites that met our criteria for inclusion in our meta analysis of post fire hydrologic recovery in mediterranean climates table 2 study sites were located in the western u s california and arizona 23 sites or the mediterranean basin spain portugal italy israel france and greece 15 sites table 2 fig 2 our search also identified studies in south africa bosch et al 1986 scott and van wyk 1990 and south america morales et al 2013 but these were not empirical studies with at least three years of observations thus they were not included in the meta analysis no studies met our inclusion criteria from mediterranean climates in australia the middle east outside of israel chile east africa or asia the studies included in our analysis represented wildfires from 1924 to 2015 with study durations from 3 to 20 years table 2 the soil types in the included studies were mostly coarse textured except for four studies with either clay loam or clay soils table 3 the dominant pre fire vegetation in 17 sites was described as one of the sclerophyll shrub communities common in mediterranean climates table 3 one study included a site that had been experimentally converted from chaparral to a grassland four decades before the wildfire hubbert et al 2012 the remaining 20 sites were established in areas where forests or forest plantations were the dominant vegetation type and these were mostly pine but included other conifers oaks and eucalypts the spatial scale of the study sites ranged from 0 25 m2 plots which were used in a rainfall simulation experiment cerdà and doerr 2005 to a 6000 km2 region of greece which was used to assess the number of floods and debris flows diakakis et al 2017 table 3 only 20 of the 38 study sites provided some measure of burn severity e g moody et al 2013 vieira et al 2015 but all studies included the fraction of the experimental unit burned table 3 only four of the studies five sites provided an estimate of the fire recurrence periods so this characteristic was not analyzed in all but six of the studies cole et al 2020 diakakis et al 2017 doehring 1968 james and krumland 2018 keller et al 1997 olsen et al 2021 the authors presented some measure of streamflow or hillslope surface runoff table 4 doehring 1968 studied dry ravel and the subsequent evacuation of deposited sediment and downstream sediment delivery by post fire flows in california s san gabriel mountains four studies cole et al 2020 james and krumland 2018 keller et al 1997 olsen et al 2021 focused on sediment delivery and changes in hillslope or channel morphology while diakakis et al 2017 evaluated the number of floods and debris flows of the 33 study sites where streamflow persistence could be assessed only one site included a perennial stream and one included a quasi perennial stream perennial flow in all but the driest years table 3 eleven of the sites had intermittent streams and the remaining 20 sites including the hillslope studies had ephemeral flow table 3 two studies addressed erosion rates indirectly by reporting rill characteristics james and krumland 2018 olsen et al 2021 and two studies reported sediment concentrations greenbaum et al 2021 wu et al 2021 none of the studies quantified wildfire effects on evapotranspiration infiltration or subsurface flow or storage time steps for the studies were mostly annual n 24 followed by storm based n 9 monthly or seasonal n 4 and through a nine year period n 1 diakakis et al 2017 there was no consensus regarding the time to achieve hydrologic recovery across the 38 study sites fig 3 three of the largest sites 54 104 km2 aronica et al 2002 bart and hope 2010 identified no post fire response so recovery was essentially attained at year zero recovery was indicated during the study period at 15 sites ranging from two to seven years with a mean of 3 8 years and a standard deviation of 1 6 years fig 3 among the 20 sites without recovery the longest study period extended to 11 years after the fire cerdà and doerr 2005 fig 3 in this case the authors attributed the lack of recovery to the return of soil water repellency at the soil surface inherent water repellency as described by scott and van wyk 1990 resulting from pine forest regrowth and reestablishment of the litter layer the seemingly counterintuitive role of water repellency at this site which was greater in the 11th year than immediately after the fire suggests that fire affected soil water repellency can have a complex effect on post fire hydrologic responses sites reporting data for annual or longer periods were more likely to indicate recovery 14 of 25 sites than sites reporting data at storm monthly or seasonal resolution 4 of 13 sites fig 3 interestingly sites with shrubs as the dominant vegetation recovered during the study period more often 59 of 17 sites recovered than sites where trees dominated 37 of 19 sites recovered half of the two sites where grasses dominated or there was a mixture of tree shrub and grass cover had recovered when the shrub sites recovered the median recovery time was two years compared to five years for the treed sites n 7 and four years for the grass site in contrast the median duration of the studies where sites did not recover was six years when shrubs dominated n 7 and four years where trees grasses or a combination of trees shrubs and grasses were the dominant vegetation n 13 the recovered sites in the western u s were in either chaparral n 8 forest or plantation n 3 or grass n 1 sites comparatively the recovered sites in the mediterranean basin were located in forests n 4 or shrublands n 2 only one of the four sites in forest plantations recovered within the respective study periods james and krumland 2018 we found no relationship between fire year or soil texture and post fire recovery condition or recovery time burn severity is an important composite measure of the complex and heterogeneous effects of fire on soil properties and surface cover that may influence recovery rate burn severity classification was identified for only 20 of the 38 sites there was no apparent relationship between recovery and burn severity within this subset of studies however as the proportion of the experimental unit or catchment that burned increased the likelihood of recovery within the study duration decreased fig 4 of the 31 sites with more than 60 of the area impacted by fire only 12 appeared to have recovered excluding the diakakis et al 2017 regional scale study all six of the sites with 60 of the catchment area impacted by fire recovered fig 4 as the area of the study site increased the likelihood of recovery increased fig 4 we posit this was due to a greater probability of the smaller experimental units burning with uniform severity and the dilution of the immediate and long term post fire responses across the larger units with more complex burn severity mosaics at the extreme spatial scales in our meta analysis the lack of recovery after 11 years in the 0 25 m2 plots cerdà and doerr 2005 and the lack of immediate response in the 632 km2 catchment bart and hope 2010 exemplify the influence of homogeneity of burning at small scales and the dilution effect at larger scales 3 2 definition of recovery across the studies in our review we were unable to find a definition of recovery despite 13 of the studies including an assessment of recovery several studies related the hydrologic recovery at least in part to the burn severity kinoshita and hogue 2011 olsen et al 2021 robichaud et al 2013a 2008 or relatively rapid recovery of vegetation bart and hope 2010 cerdà and doerr 2005 cooper et al 2015 hubbert et al 2012 inbar et al 1998 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wu et al 2021 one study presented a conceptual model that suggested the recovery period varied with post fire precipitation keller et al 1997 and precipitation was indicated as a control on recovery in at least four other studies mayor et al 2007 robichaud et al 2013b shakesby et al 1993 vieira et al 2016 only one study addressed changes in soil properties as a control on hydrologic recovery andreu et al 2001 while another study suggested pre fire disturbance may affect post fire recovery rates vieira et al 2016 of the 19 study sites where hydrologic recovery had occurred or there was no post fire response we found only one study cosandey et al 2005 that presented a robust before after control impact baci analysis four other studies used before after analysis with no post fire control table 4 which also provides a relatively robust assessment of recovery when adequate pre fire data are available given the low number of long term gauging stations in catchments likely to be heavily impacted by wildfire control impact analyses using an unburned reference site as the control were most common and we deemed seven sites as recovered using data presented in this type of design bart and hope 2010 used prediction intervals from control and impacted catchments to identify post fire streamflow that exceeded the reference unburned condition of their six burned catchments only one arroyo seco exceeded the pre fire prediction intervals for annual monthly or seasonal flows during years three through five after the fire however the response had not yet recovered at the end of the five year study even when the simpler hypothetical criterion for recovery was applied there was no clear consensus about the length of time needed for hydrologic responses to return to pre fire conditions many of the studies used runoff measures relevant to the specific sites or objectives such as storm monthly or annual runoff rates or peak discharge rates however the variety of measurement methods and data reporting approaches made comparisons across sites difficult thus we suggest the use of metrics e g table 1 to help quantify recovery among diverse locations in future studies wherein recovery would be indicated when the post fire metrics fall within the confidence intervals of the pre fire metrics 3 3 demonstration of recovery metrics we used the unique longer term data from the city creek california and rimbaud france sites to test five metrics of streamflow to identify post fire recovery specifically we quantified runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve low flow q90 the proportion of time with no flow and high flow q10 at both locations the annual runoff ratios appeared cyclical and followed precipitation patterns fig 5 a and e both sites experienced dry conditions in the period just before the fire leading to lower pre fire runoff ratios based on the 95 confidence interval analysis city creek showed a clearer pattern of response and recovery than the rimbaud catchment fig 5 the city creek runoff ratios were higher than the pre fire period for the first three years after burning fig 5a when we analyzed only the first five or six years of post fire data it appeared like hydrologic recovery had occurred however the runoff ratio in the seventh and eighth years again exceeded the confidence limits from the pre fire condition illustrating the importance of longer term studies similarly the slopes of the flow duration curves and q90 low flows for city creek remained elevated for 10 11 years after the fire and showed only a gradual declining trend over this period fig 5b and c these results affirm previous analyses on this catchment kinoshita and hogue 2015 interestingly we did not observe a dramatic increase in the high flows q10 at city creek in the first several years after the fire followed by a slow decline over time fig 5d rather the response in q10 was somewhat cyclical and followed the pattern identified in the annual runoff ratio this observation was counter to the high flows reported in most of the studies in our review which were generally elevated for the first two years after the fire and then decreased over time anderson 1955 cooper et al 2015 garcía comendador et al 2017 robichaud et al 2013b in contrast to city creek the runoff ratios in the rimbaud catchment showed a muted response after the fire in 1990 fig 5e this response was somewhat cyclical and related to the post fire precipitation pattern like city creek the runoff ratios appeared to trend down over the study period fig 5e the slopes of the flow duration curves were elevated above the pre fire confidence interval for the first five years and for a subsequent seven year period after the fire fig 5f the q90 low flows followed a similar pattern as the slopes but with fewer points above the upper confidence limit fig 5g the rimbaud catchment demonstrates typical intermittent stream behavior where there was no flow 20 of the time before the fire the proportion of time with no flow averaged 21 after the fire but there was a distinct increasing trend in the fraction of time with no flow in the post fire period fig 5h we did not find a trend in the high flows q10 after the wildfire at rimbaud however there were many streamflow values below the lower pre fire confidence limit fig 5i in contrast to the original authors assessment of recovery after four years we considered the rimbaud site to have recovered after six years table 4 using the earlier analyses and finer resolution timescale cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of site physical factors on recovery we initially hypothesized that burn severity post fire precipitation and vegetation regrowth would be important factors in assessing post fire hydrologic recovery and that interactions among these factors can lead to a wide range of possible post fire recovery responses fig 1 in our synthesis of 28 studies spanning 38 sites from mediterranean climates we were unable to find consensus about the longevity of fire effects on local or regional hydrology in the 15 studies that showed a post fire response and then recovered the elevated post fire hydrologic effects persisted from two to seven years with longer recovery times generally occurring in catchments with a greater proportion of area burned there were too few studies that reported burn severity to support a general conclusion about this factor however the scale of inference combined with the area burned led to the important finding that a higher proportion of area burned resulted in a lower likelihood of recovery in the study period the spatial scales of the sites in our review were divided among hillslopes 0 005 km2 n 9 small catchments 0 005 5 km2 n 14 and medium or large catchments 5 km2 n 15 in general there was less variability in fire effects or other site characteristics at the smaller scales e g hillslopes the catchment scale provided spatial integration of the effects from heterogeneous catchment characteristics including burn severity larger catchments generally require greater infrastructure to quantify streamflow responses but larger catchments are also more likely to have long term gauging records that allow for more robust assessment of pre fire responses and hence post fire hydrologic recovery also as the size of the catchment increases the fraction of the area impacted by fire tends to decrease and the fire impacts become muted table 3 and harder to detect e g bart and hope 2010 wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 which may confound the assessment of recovery fig 4 our analysis identified differential responses and recovery trajectories that were strongly related to the local precipitation patterns in the post fire period for example in our city creek analysis water year 2005 had higher than normal precipitation which led to greater vegetation cover kinoshita and hogue 2011 however the slope of the flow duration curve and the q 90 low flows remained elevated compared to pre fire conditions fig 5b and c additionally wildfires often occur during dry periods or meteorological droughts pausas and fernandez munoz 2012 which can extend into the post fire period mayor et al 2007 and others e g florsheim et al 2017 reported dry periods after the wildfire which delayed the regrowth of vegetation in the burned area and may have led to longer recovery periods these complexities in the post fire period suggest that site specific assessments of recovery are needed and that many studies using similar metrics will be necessary to develop a general rule for post fire hydrologic recovery interestingly our review illustrated that on sites where vegetation recovered rapidly 18 studies there was either no post fire response or hydrologic recovery occurred during the study in part this was related to the mediterranean climates where the year round growing season and mild winter weather can facilitate rapid vegetation regrowth and facilitate post fire recovery however the relation between vegetation and hydrology is complex and vegetation regrowth alone may not serve as a clear indicator of hydrologic recovery evapotranspiration rates from early succession forests can be greater than rates in established forests leading to a lagged post fire decline in flows especially during dry periods brown et al 2005 langford 1976 watson et al 1999 this is a plausible explanation for the partial declines in streamflow relative to pre fire conditions in two studies kinoshita and hogue 2011 wittenberg and inbar 2009 as well as the increased proportion of time with no flow in the rimbaud catchment in the post fire period fig 5h further the recovery of understory vegetation is a critical component in re establishing pre fire hydrologic conditions increasing leaf area in trees shrubs forbs and grasses not only increases evapotranspiration rates it also increases the leaf litter associated with seasonal vegetation changes leading to greater interception and less runoff and erosion although we did not include soils in our initial hypothesis we recognize that temporal changes in post fire soil properties likely contribute to post fire recovery the time needed for soil structure redevelopment after severe wildfire is largely unknown the replacement of organic matter consumed by the fire reestablishment of the root network and other changes in soil properties such as re establishment of inherent water repellency found in unburned hillslopes doerr et al 2006 robichaud et al 2016 can lead to improved soil structure in burned soils over varying timescales these and other critical factors such as soil moisture status ebel 2013 geology robichaud et al 2013b climate regime wine and cadol 2016 and biological activity likely contribute to the changes in soil structure and the reestablishment of infiltration capacity considering the complexities that contribute to the occasionally ambiguous signals of recovery fig 1 fig 3 fig 4 additional research on the influence of vegetation regrowth and changes in soil hydraulic properties are needed to assess hydrologic recovery more completely 4 2 effects of climate on recovery the site specificity in hydrologic response and recovery observed across our review studies suggests even greater challenges for identifying trends in recovery among regions or climate types for example the american southwest with its monsoonal convective storms may produce post fire responses with larger magnitudes than other areas moody and martin 2009 and the occasional exceptional rainfall intensity in this region may confound assessments of recovery robichaud et al 2013b similarly despite more uniform precipitation conditions moody and martin 2009 areas with continental climates in the western u s can have recovery periods that can extend longer than five years larson nash et al 2018 robichaud et al 2013a 2016 defining a typical period for hydrologic recovery is also complicated by the temporal variability of high intensity rainfall and soil moisture status within mediterranean climates several studies related the observed rainfall intensity or erosivity to generation of post fire peak discharges or sediment delivery cosandey et al 2005 inbar et al 1998 mayor et al 2007 robichaud et al 2008 a substantial hydrologic or sediment delivery response can occur later in the post fire period if a high intensity rainfall event occurs on catchments where the vegetation surface litter and soil structure have not returned to pre fire conditions inbar et al 1998 robichaud et al 2008 the delayed responses can disrupt the apparent recovery trend and result in an erroneous assessment of recovery also the events may fall outside the typical two to three year window of post fire hydrologic monitoring and rigorous observation of these events may be missed altogether unusually large storms or extremely wet periods can cause large hydrologic responses regardless of the time since fire and the timing of these storms can also influence the assessment of whether a site has recovered inbar et al 1998 schmeer et al 2018 due to the risk of large responses recovery probably takes longer than is commonly understood which is an important consideration when planning research watershed monitoring or emergency management after large fires several studies in our systematic review refer to the likely effects of climate change on future fires and hence post fire hydrologic responses bart and hope 2010 cerdà and doerr 2005 cooper et al 2015 diakakis et al 2017 kinoshita and hogue 2015 mayor et al 2007 olsen et al 2021 vieira et al 2016 wittenberg and inbar 2009 any links between climate change and specific post fire responses are highly uncertain however climate change is expected to increase the length of fire seasons extent of fires and burn severity abatzoglou et al 2018 holden et al 2018 littell et al 2009 pausas and fernandez munoz 2012 furthermore climate models predict increases in variability in weather patterns in general including the possibility of more frequent droughts berg and hall 2015 polade et al 2014 and more frequent extreme precipitation ipcc 2014 pierce et al 2013 polade et al 2017 over some mediterranean regions including california and the mediterranean basin these combined factors will likely exacerbate post fire hydro geomorphic responses and increase variability in post fire hydrologic recovery fig 1 field campaign and modeling efforts that account for sources of variability in weather patterns and address the hydrologic changes related to post fire regeneration are needed to understand the array of possible post fire hydrologic recovery trajectories one critical step in this direction would be to improve our ability to scale inferences from hillslope scale studies to catchment scale responses wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 an additional concern with shifting wildfire regimes under current and future climates livneh et al 2013 williams et al 2019 is the increasing potential for entire watersheds to burn when combined with our observation that the likelihood of post fire hydrologic recovery within the study period decreased as the proportion of area burned increased it follows that catchments will be more likely to be in a fire effected state i e not recovered under future climate conditions 4 3 toward a consistent interpretation of post fire hydrologic recovery we propose that applying a standardized approach to describing and identifying recovery will help researchers policy makers and land managers understand the complexities of post fire hydrologic recovery and communicate recovery in more absolute terms the basis for our recommended approach is to adapt a common definition of recovery identify metrics e g table 1 relevant to specific needs fig 6 and apply a quantitative analysis to the selected metric using pre fire and post fire responses we suggest that hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post fire function or condition of interest returns to within the 95 confidence interval established for the pre fire period buttle et al 2018 gouveia et al 2010 hudson 2000 given sufficient data this approach can be transformed into a statistical test using varying degrees of rigor from a simple comparison of confidence limits in a baci experimental design as in our analysis to advanced statistical modeling only 12 of 38 sites in our literature search included pre and post fire data table 4 and only two of them included unburned controls in a baci design before after analysis provides a rigorous approach and can be informative in identifying possible post fire responses and recovery trends fig 5 however given the sparse distribution of monitored catchments especially at small spatial scales and in parts of the world where support for monitoring is less available using reference conditions e g control impacted in table 4 or experimental fire e g stoof et al 2012 can also advance our understanding of post fire hydrological effects and recovery in cases where sufficient hydrologic data are not available the analyst can use the tools and data that are available including personal experience and local knowledge and clearly state the uncertainty of their analysis in their assessment of hydrologic recovery we also recognize that external forcing from climate change changes in land use or invasion by non native species may preclude a landscape s return to the pre fire condition given the site specificity of these confounding factors we did not attempt to address these broad and complex issues in this systematic review adapting this approach will not only improve our ability to make rigorous assessments of recovery within a specific study it will also increase our ability to summarize responses and communicate across diverse fires and catchments as the depth and breadth of post fire hydrologic research continues to expand this approach will increase our understanding of long term effects and ability to be more conclusive regarding the timescale and controls on post fire hydrologic recovery 4 4 hydrologic response metrics we identified several possible metrics derived from commonly collected hydrologic data and related to impacts on water supply or human safety table 1 our relatively simple analysis using a subset of these metrics fig 5 highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate metric based on specific needs table 1 fig 6 for example while q90 can be important for long term water supply planning and for aquatic habitat it may be less relevant for immediate post fire flood hazard which is more appropriately assessed with q10 or the peak discharge in addition the selection of a specific metric should consider the temporal scale of the data and the response an example would be selecting peak discharge as a metric without considering whether the peak is rainfall or snow melt dominated and therefore mostly influenced by the form and intensity of the precipitation moody et al 2013 or snow melt rate analyzing the metrics using data at different timescales such as seasonal or storm flows may also have yielded more conclusive assessments of impact and recovery three studies at the rimbaud catchment in southern france cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 showed that post fire streamflow analyzed at the daily time step departed from the pre fire flow while seasonal and annual time steps did not show an effect of the fire on streamflow we chose a simple framework for assessing recovery of comparing pre and post wildfire 95 confidence intervals for hydrologic metrics because this approach is accessible to a broad range of potential users moreover this framework has the potential and flexibility to be expanded upon with more complicated analyses such as normalization by a standard pre fire value or use of mixed effects statistical modeling which may also allow a more distinct signal of the catchment response and recovery 4 5 research opportunities understanding responses across temporal scales is one of the key knowledge gaps currently facing the field of post fire hydrology it was surprisingly difficult to find studies that continued at least three years post fire while longer term studies necessitate substantial long term investment and commitment tetzlaff et al 2017 such efforts are likely to provide unexpected and critical knowledge to facilitate sustainable ecosystem and water management decisions for example long term data sets have recently provided unique insights about forest disturbance effects on summer low flows coble et al 2020 niemeyer et al 2020 perry and jones 2017 segura et al 2020 alternatively a lack of long term post fire studies may lead to an unintentional bias toward presumed short term effects and recovery in the early post fire period fig 3 as such investments in long term post fire research sites or resampling previously studied post fire sites would provide much needed information for understanding hydrologic recovery and resilience of fire prone ecosystems making data from monitoring and research studies publicly accessible would also allow greater synthesis and broader understanding of the variability in post fire recovery additionally our review highlighted the importance of consistent measurement of key parameters to facilitate cross site comparisons robinne et al 2020 we propose the following measurements be included in future post fire hydrologic studies percentages of the area of the experimental unit in different classes of an established burn severity classification system total precipitation and precipitation intensity fraction of bare soil or ground cover particularly for sediment delivery studies and vegetation cover fraction and type except for burn severity these measurements would be most useful in assessing temporal trends and recovery if continued for a period of at least 10 years additional studies of 10 year duration would greatly improve our understanding of medium to long term post fire catchment dynamics and better inform our ability to assess and predict post fire hydrologic recovery despite the critical importance of long term experimental watersheds for data based decisions by water suppliers land managers and emergency managers tetzlaff et al 2017 we are unaware of a long term experimental watershed study designed to improve our understanding of the range of effects from wildfire we recognize that long term post fire data are difficult to obtain especially given short term funding cycles the logistics of sustaining measurements over long periods and the inherent unpredictability of wildfire however from our experience it is much easier and less costly to continue monitoring an existing site or resample a previously used site than to implement a new research endeavor for example measurement intervals can be reduced over time without loss of important information as the rate of regrowth or the relative magnitude of the response decreases spatial scale is another important consideration in future research the fact that all but one of the distinct sites in our systematic review were intermittent or ephemeral underscores the need for additional research on non perennial streams which in general are in smaller catchments to better understand post fire hydrologic responses and recovery on the other hand future assessments of recovery at large catchment or ecosystem scales may become more prevalent by combining field based and remotely sensed data with numerical modeling to determine the impacts of geology climate vegetation and changes in soil structure on recovery of hydrologic processes coupling of spatially explicit data with hydrologic modeling has been applied in a number of recent problems across a range of modeling platforms e g bales et al 2018 miller et al 2011 tague et al 2004 these approaches are likely to become more sophisticated and more widely adapted by researchers and managers as technology such as airborne imaging advances and we continue to increase our understanding of post fire hydrological impacts 5 conclusions we applied a systematic approach to synthesize research on post fire hydrologic recovery in areas with mediterranean climates despite many studies on post fire hydrologic responses we identified only 28 studies covering 38 sites which met our criteria for inclusion in a systematic review these sites were in the western united states and the mediterranean basin and were used to study responses to fires that occurred between 1924 and 2015 in the 18 studies whose original data met our criteria for recovery timescales for hydrologic recovery ranged from zero i e no post fire response to seven years there was no clear pattern between recovery time and location or spatial scale of inference annual time steps were more likely to indicate recovery than shorter time steps and sites with a higher proportion of area burned were less likely to recover these findings suggest that responses that were aggregated through time or across space where unburned area occurred within the experimental unit dampened the more discrete responses from areas with homogenous fire impacts and that these dampening effects may be interpreted as recovery we propose a common definition of post fire hydrologic recovery when a specific post fire function or condition of interest returns to the 95 confidence interval of the pre fire condition we also note metrics that can be adjusted to meet the specific needs of various stakeholders and tested with different degrees of statistical rigor which we demonstrated using confidence interval testing following this approach may improve our ability to compare post fire hydrologic recovery across future studies the few studies available were insufficient to support or contradict our conceptual model of the recovery time needed for specific burn severity and post fire weather patterns we suggest some guidelines to help address this apparent deficiency in future post fire hydrologic studies we also identified several opportunities for additional research including increasing the duration of planned and ongoing post fire

4250,post fire hydrologic research typically focuses on the first few years after a wildfire leading to substantial uncertainty regarding the longevity of impacts the time needed for hydrologic function to return to pre fire conditions is critical information for post fire land and water management decisions this is particularly true in mediterranean climates where water is scarce and in high demand and the severity and area burned by wildfires are increasing in part uncertainty about hydrologic recovery is due to lack of a consistent definition or interpretation of what constitutes recovery here we systematically reviewed empirical studies from mediterranean climates with at least three years of post fire hydrologic data with the objectives of a assessing the recovery period b identifying a definition of post fire hydrologic recovery c demonstrating a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery and d outlining research needs and opportunities to better quantify post fire recovery we assessed the hydrologic effects reported in 38 sites that were monitored for 3 20 years eighteen sites were considered recovered within seven years however the recovery time was inconsistent across sites and was not related to location response variable or study design the likelihood of recovery within the study period also decreased with increasing proportion of the watershed area burned importantly we have also proposed a standardized definition and an approach to quantifying hydrologic recovery that may facilitate cross study comparisons and a deeper understanding of recovery specifically we propose hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post fire hydrologic function or condition of interest returns to the 95 confidence interval of the pre fire condition in support of this definition we have demonstrated applying this simple approach to assess recovery and presented future research topics to improve our understanding of long term post fire catchment responses in addition to the need for more studies that quantify hydrologic responses farther into the post fire period understanding post fire changes in soil structural and hydraulic properties through time will improve our mechanistic understanding of post fire hydrologic responses and recovery keywords post fire recovery long term catchment watershed burn recovery metric 1 introduction wildfire activity including length of wildfire season number of fires area burned and fire severity has increased in many areas of the world in recent decades abatzoglou and kolden 2013 reilly et al 2017 these rising trends are projected to continue in some regions due to climate change increasing population and fire suppression activities flannigan et al 2013 moritz et al 2012 concurrently there have been growing concerns about the economic social and environmental impacts of increasingly severe wildfires bowman et al 2017 schoennagel et al 2017 stevens rumann et al

2017 mirus et al 2017 murphy et al 2015 rhoades et al 2019b the importance of addressing these knowledge deficiencies is critical due to increased fire activity in many regions that have concurrently experienced substantial declines in both water quantity and quality bladon 2018 martin 2016 nunes et al 2018 as such several studies have noted the need to include fire in local regional and global assessments of catchment vulnerability to the effects of disturbances on hydrologic processes kinoshita et al 2016 martin 2016 robinne et al 2018 2021 a growing number of studies have investigated the effects of wildfires on water quantity water quality aquatic ecology and downstream drinking water supply e g hallema et al 2018b kinoshita et al 2014 loiselle et al 2020 moody et al 2016 moreno et al 2020 rust et al 2018 many have shown that soil hydraulic properties and runoff generation mechanisms may be altered by wildfire ebel and moody 2017 ebel et al 2016 leading to increased annual water yields low flows and peak flows for several post fire years blount et al 2020 hallema et al 2017a saxe et al 2018 or even decades brookhouse et al 2013 kuczera 1987 niemeyer et al 2020 moreover exposed mineral soils are highly susceptible to hillslope erosion or debris flows which deliver sediment and other contaminants from burned hillslopes to streams nyman et al 2020 sheridan et al 2016 wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 combined these and other post fire changes in source water quantity and quality have the potential to propagate long distances downstream impacting aquatic ecosystem health and creating substantial challenges for drinking water treatment chow et al 2019 emelko et al 2011 2016 hohner et al 2019 many studies have shown a peak in hydrologic impacts during the first

greenbaum et al 2021 noske et al 2016 vieira et al 2016 the longevity and trajectory of the recovery curve may be influenced by a range of factors including fire severity disturbance history post fire land management catchment physiography vegetation composition and regrowth soils geology climate and weather during the post fire years prats et al 2016 vieira et al 2015 wittenberg and inbar 2009 fig 1 in particular burn severity is often considered a key control on the magnitude of post fire hydrologic responses keeley 2009 moody et al 2016 vieira et al 2015 similarly post fire precipitation is another important control on hydrologic responses from burned areas often explaining much of the variability in local responses benavides solorio and macdonald 2005 hallema et al 2017b moody and martin 2001 murphy et al 2015 wu et al 2021 other important controls on downstream processes include the proportion of catchment burned bart 2016 hallema et al 2018b and the regrowth of vegetation which often is related to the regeneration mechanism i e seeding versus resprouting and post fire weather patterns keeley 1992 keeley and zedler 1978 kinoshita and hogue 2011 niemeyer et al 2020 evidence also shows that the recovery trajectory may be altered by the resiliency of the ecosystem in the face of increasing wildfire activity scheffer et al 2001 schoennagel et al 2017 the vast majority of studies investigating the effects of wildfire on water quantity or quality have focused on the initial 5 years effects e g florsheim et al 2017 saxe et al 2018 silins et al 2014 smith et al 2012 comparatively few studies have investigated the longer term effects of wildfire rhoades et al 2019a despite clear evidence of the essential value of long term research laudon et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2017 further few datasets include pre and post fire hydrologic responses from hillslopes or small catchments for periods long enough to statistically assess longer term post fire responses thus the longevity of post fire hydrologic effects is uncertain which hinders prediction of catchment processes during the post fire recovery period and longer term post fire management recent assessments of global wildfire risks to water security indicate that some of the most vulnerable cities e g cape town haifa istanbul and san francisco are located in mediterranean climates robinne et al 2018 2016 additionally because water demand often exceeds available resources due to tremendous variability in annual and seasonal precipitation dahm 2010 gasith and resh 1999 iglesias et al 2011 kondolf and batalla 2005 many regions with mediterranean climates rely on dams and water conveyance infrastructure conacher and sala 1998 kondolf and batalla 2005 thoms and sheldon 2000 which may be negatively impacted by elevated post wildfire sediment yields murphy et al 2018 post fire hydrologic responses in mediterranean climates generally result from long duration cyclonic or frontal systems where periods of high intensity precipitation can lead to overland flow these responses contrast with drivers or responses in other fire dominated climate regimes such as convective precipitation in areas with warm continental climates saxe et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 or the impacts of fire on subsurface flow in areas with boreal climates and permafrost ebel et al 2019 koch et al 2014 walvoord et al 2019 additionally a relatively large portion of post fire hydrologic research has occurred in mediterranean climates which provides an opportunity to combine the results from experiments with similar climates and vegetation to identify commonalities quantifying the legacy impacts of wildfire also remains challenging due to varying definitions of recovery thus there is a critical need to clarify the concept of post fire hydrologic recovery and apply more rigor in testing whether post fire responses have recovered to improve models and predictions for post fire land and water management decisions our working theory is that the post fire response measured as a departure from the pre fire range of variability would return to the pre fire condition within a predictable period constrained by some distribution of natural variability fig 1 this theoretical recovery period may differ by the hydrologic process of interest such as runoff generation transpiration or rainfall interception regardless of parameter of interest we hypothesize that the dominant controls on post fire recovery rates are burn severity precipitation timing and magnitude and vegetation regrowth and that these factors can lead to a wide range of possible post fire recovery trajectories fig 1 we further hypothesize that with enough information about post fire responses across a range of fire severity and post fire weather and vegetation conditions the recovery period can be predicted with reasonable accuracy our goal was to identify and summarize past research in mediterranean climates that could provide a sufficient level of information to quantify the likely range of post fire recovery periods to aid post fire management and research specifically we evaluated empirical studies in mediterranean climates to meet the following objectives a synthesize results from longer term post fire hydrologic studies to assess the recovery period and bound the recovery timescale b identify a common definition of post fire hydrologic recovery to unify terminology c demonstrate a simple analytical approach to aid in assessment of recovery across diverse catchment conditions and research or monitoring objectives and d outline research needs and opportunities to better quantify and predict post fire recovery we focused on studies addressing surface water quantity and sediment delivery however the general recovery framework and principles of analysis presented here are extensible to other physical and chemical water quality metrics 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics due to the dominant influence of temperature and precipitation regimes on vegetation composition and productivity bailey 1989 as well as the potential for similarities in hydrologic response and recovery hallema et al 2018b we have focused our analysis on climate type rather than ecoregion or location our review focused on areas with mediterranean climates as characterized by the köppen geiger classification system fig 2 all three mediterranean climates are described as temperate with dry summers and wet winters the driest summer month produces 40 mm of precipitation and less than one third of the precipitation of the wettest winter month peel et al 2007 the csa class has hot dry summers with maximum mean monthly temperature tmax greater than 22 c during at least one month and all months with a mean monthly temperature above 0 c the csb class has warm summers with tmax 22 c during all months at least four months with a mean temperature of at least 10 c and all months with a mean monthly temperature above 0 c peel et al 2007 the third class csc is for cold summers where between one and four months have mean temperature of at least 10 c but this class is much less prevalent and was not included in our review these climate conditions generally occur between 30 and 40 latitude lionello et al 2006 extending to about 49 north latitude in western north america peel et al 2007 more than half of the land area with mediterranean climates is located in the mediterranean basin with other major regions in southwestern

et al 2012 have led to increased wildfire occurrence and severity in recent decades bowman et al 2017 moritz et al 2014 2 2 literature search we focused our literature review on english language post wildfire hydrologic studies in regions with mediterranean köppen geiger csa hot dry summer or csb warm dry summer climate classifications peel et al 2007 we combined prior knowledge of the literature with systematic searches of databases to identify empirical studies that included at least three years of post fire field based hydrologic observations we also reviewed citations in identified articles to expand our literature search our search terms in georef scopus web of science and google scholar included either fire or burn combined with recovery hydrolog runoff catchment discharge flow or water the asterisk was used as a wildcard search character to include word fragments in a single search we screened the articles and government reports available through january 2021 and included them if the study a included sites affected by wildfire b was located in a csa or csb climate c quantified a hydrologic response including runoff evapotranspiration infiltration erosion sediment delivery or sediment concentration d measured responses at the plot 1 10 m2 hillslope 10 5000 m2 or catchment 5000 m2 scales and e included at least three years of post fire data we recorded the latitude longitude fire year post fire study duration measurement types and spatial scales soil texture pre fire vegetation and the proportion of the experimental unit or catchment burned for each included study we also recorded the burn severity classification when it was provided or when it could be assessed through the monitoring trends in burn severity data monitoring trends in burn severity 2019 we either retained the climate classification provided in the article or when no classification was provided we used the approximate location and local climate maps e g http stepsa org climate koppen geiger html to assign one for global consistency we mapped the study locations using the climate classifications from peel et al 2007 fig 2 we also recorded the stream order and whether the stream was perennial intermittent or ephemeral when provided in the articles or the classification could be determined by the location and google earth imagery google llc 2020 in some cases the original authors had indicated recovery however recovery was not assessed explicitly in most of the studies for consistency we assessed the state of recovery for the main hydrologic response variable using data presented in each original study and the same criteria we classified the recovery of each study using one of the following criteria depending on the available data a before after ba when pre fire data were included and the post fire response returned to the pre fire condition b control impacted ci when an unburned reference condition was included and the response in the burned site was similar to the response in the unburned site or c hypothetical h when no unburned reference data were provided and the post fire variable of interest attained a zero response i e equivalent to pre fire response in cases where published data and statistical analyses allowed more rigorous assessment we used those results in most cases such analyses were not available which necessitated using the hypothetical criterion as it was the simplest and most conservative criterion we could apply among the diverse studies when a single publication discussed post fire responses at multiple sites e g bart and hope 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2011 or from multiple conditions such as different vegetation types e g cerdà and doerr 2005 hubbert et al 2012 the multiple sites or conditions were treated independently some articles covered the same site over different periods or used different analyses e g cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 we treated those cases as a single study given the immense variability in spatial scale among the identified studies over 10 orders of magnitude we did not compare the studies in absolute terms also because of the different time steps used in the studies we did not attempt to normalize results by annual precipitation or some other index rather we examined site factors for similarities as an explanation for whether the sites recovered or not 2 3 post fire hydrologic recovery metrics and case studies hydrologic recovery following either natural or anthropogenic disturbance has been defined as the restoration of pre disturbance hydrologic characteristics such as interception evapotranspiration or streamflow to near pre disturbance conditions buttle et al 2018 hudson 2000 moreover assessment of recovery depends on the specific process output temporal and spatial scales and application or objective e g aquatic habitat flood protection recreation or community drinking water supply these different factors complicate the assessment of recovery yet the complexity can be reduced by metrics that simplify analysis although many possible metrics exist we suggest metrics that could be useful to various end users interested in post fire hydrologic recovery grouped in table 1 by potential use water supply water related hazard infrastructure and ecological habitat we used longer term datasets of pre and post fire precipitation and discharge from city creek california u s kinoshita and hogue 2015 and the rimbaud catchment in southern france lavabre et al 1993 to demonstrate the utility of metrics in assessing recovery the october november 2003 old fire burned approximately 87 of the city creek catchment 50 8 km2 including 13 at high severity and 57 at moderate severity kinoshita and hogue 2015 daily precipitation data 2860 san bernardino county 2018 and hourly discharge data 11055800 u s geological survey 2018 were obtained for water years 1 oct 30 sep 1989 2017 comparatively a fire occurred in the rimbaud catchment 1 46 km2 in august 1990 burning approximately 85 of the catchment at unspecified severity lavabre et al 1993 we obtained hourly precipitation and discharge data for water years 1968 2010 n folton institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l environnement et l agriculture personal communication 14 may 2018 for statistical analysis we used water years 1989 2003 for city creek and 1968 1990 for the rimbaud catchment for the pre fire periods we calculated several metrics for the pre and post fire periods runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve using an exponential fit and flows that were exceeded 90 q 90 low flow and 10 of the time q 10 high flow table 1 we also calculated the proportion of time with no flow at rimbaud which had intermittent streamflow the runoff ratios were calculated on annual timescales water years and the other metrics were calculated using hourly time steps consistent with the temporal resolution of the discharge data we removed observations when there was no flow for the frequency analyses this was more common at the rimbaud catchment given its smaller size and intermittency we also excluded data from rimbaud when more than 10 of the observations were missing water years 1986 and 2000 2002 we applied relatively simple statistics to assess hydrologic recovery using the selected metrics with the intent that a more accessible approach would increase the utility for a diverse group of users we calculated 95 confidence intervals for the pre fire metrics assuming a t distribution helsel and hirsch 2002 all the city creek metrics except the slope of the flow duration curve and the rimbaud q 90 showed some skewness so these values were log10 transformed before determining the confidence intervals we then calculated and plotted the metrics from the post fire period and considered that a state of recovery had been reached if the post fire metrics were within the 95 confidence interval from the pre fire period 3 results 3 1 systematic review of post fire hydrologic recovery our literature search and screening resulted in 28 studies covering 38 distinct sites that met our criteria for inclusion in our meta analysis of post fire hydrologic recovery in mediterranean climates table 2 study sites were located in the western u s california and arizona 23 sites or the mediterranean basin spain portugal italy israel france and greece 15 sites table 2 fig 2 our search also identified studies in south africa bosch et al 1986 scott and van wyk 1990 and south america morales et al 2013 but these were not empirical studies with at least three years of observations thus they were not included in the meta analysis no studies met our inclusion criteria from mediterranean climates in australia the middle east outside of israel chile east africa or asia the studies included in our analysis represented wildfires from 1924 to 2015 with study durations from 3 to 20 years table 2 the soil types in the included studies were mostly coarse textured except for four studies with either clay loam or clay soils table 3 the dominant pre fire vegetation in 17 sites was described as one of the sclerophyll shrub communities common in mediterranean climates table 3 one study included a site that had been experimentally converted from chaparral to a grassland four decades before the wildfire hubbert et al 2012 the remaining 20 sites were established in areas where forests or forest plantations were the dominant vegetation type and these were mostly pine but included other conifers oaks and eucalypts the spatial scale of the study sites ranged from 0 25 m2 plots which were used in a rainfall simulation experiment cerdà and doerr 2005 to a 6000 km2 region of greece which was used to assess the number of floods and debris flows diakakis et al 2017 table 3 only 20 of the 38 study sites provided some measure of burn severity e g moody et al 2013 vieira et al 2015 but all studies included the fraction of the experimental unit burned table 3 only four of the studies five sites provided an estimate of the fire recurrence periods so this characteristic was not analyzed in all but six of the studies cole et al 2020 diakakis et al 2017 doehring 1968 james and krumland 2018 keller et al 1997 olsen et al 2021 the authors presented some measure of streamflow or hillslope surface runoff table 4 doehring 1968 studied dry ravel and the subsequent evacuation of deposited sediment and downstream sediment delivery by post fire flows in california s san gabriel mountains four studies cole et al 2020 james and krumland 2018 keller et al 1997 olsen et al 2021 focused on sediment delivery and changes in hillslope or channel morphology while diakakis et al 2017 evaluated the number of floods and debris flows of the 33 study sites where streamflow persistence could be assessed only one site included a perennial stream and one included a quasi perennial stream perennial flow in all but the driest years table 3 eleven of the sites had intermittent streams and the remaining 20 sites including the hillslope studies had ephemeral flow table 3 two studies addressed erosion rates indirectly by reporting rill characteristics james and krumland 2018 olsen et al 2021 and two studies reported sediment concentrations greenbaum et al 2021 wu et al 2021 none of the studies quantified wildfire effects on evapotranspiration infiltration or subsurface flow or storage time steps for the studies were mostly annual n 24 followed by storm based n 9 monthly or seasonal n 4 and through a nine year period n 1 diakakis et al 2017 there was no consensus regarding the time to achieve hydrologic recovery across the 38 study sites fig 3 three of the largest sites 54 104 km2 aronica et al 2002 bart and hope 2010 identified no post fire response so recovery was essentially attained at year zero recovery was indicated during the study period at 15 sites ranging from two to seven years with a mean of 3 8 years and a standard deviation of 1 6 years fig 3 among the 20 sites without recovery the longest study period extended to 11 years after the fire cerdà and doerr 2005 fig 3 in this case the authors attributed the lack of recovery to the return of soil water repellency at the soil surface inherent water repellency as described by scott and van wyk 1990 resulting from pine forest regrowth and reestablishment of the litter layer the seemingly counterintuitive role of water repellency at this site which was greater in the 11th year than immediately after the fire suggests that fire affected soil water repellency can have a complex effect on post fire hydrologic responses sites reporting data for annual or longer periods were more likely to indicate recovery 14 of 25 sites than sites reporting data at storm monthly or seasonal resolution 4 of 13 sites fig 3 interestingly sites with shrubs as the dominant vegetation recovered during the study period more often 59 of 17 sites recovered than sites where trees dominated 37 of 19 sites recovered half of the two sites where grasses dominated or there was a mixture of tree shrub and grass cover had recovered when the shrub sites recovered the median recovery time was two years compared to five years for the treed sites n 7 and four years for the grass site in contrast the median duration of the studies where sites did not recover was six years when shrubs dominated n 7 and four years where trees grasses or a combination of trees shrubs and grasses were the dominant vegetation n 13 the recovered sites in the western u s were in either chaparral n 8 forest or plantation n 3 or grass n 1 sites comparatively the recovered sites in the mediterranean basin were located in forests n 4 or shrublands n 2 only one of the four sites in forest plantations recovered within the respective study periods james and krumland 2018 we found no relationship between fire year or soil texture and post fire recovery condition or recovery time burn severity is an important composite measure of the complex and heterogeneous effects of fire on soil properties and surface cover that may influence recovery rate burn severity classification was identified for only 20 of the 38 sites there was no apparent relationship between recovery and burn severity within this subset of studies however as the proportion of the experimental unit or catchment that burned increased the likelihood of recovery within the study duration decreased fig 4 of the 31 sites with more than 60 of the area impacted by fire only 12 appeared to have recovered excluding the diakakis et al 2017 regional scale study all six of the sites with 60 of the catchment area impacted by fire recovered fig 4 as the area of the study site increased the likelihood of recovery increased fig 4 we posit this was due to a greater probability of the smaller experimental units burning with uniform severity and the dilution of the immediate and long term post fire responses across the larger units with more complex burn severity mosaics at the extreme spatial scales in our meta analysis the lack of recovery after 11 years in the 0 25 m2 plots cerdà and doerr 2005 and the lack of immediate response in the 632 km2 catchment bart and hope 2010 exemplify the influence of homogeneity of burning at small scales and the dilution effect at larger scales 3 2 definition of recovery across the studies in our review we were unable to find a definition of recovery despite 13 of the studies including an assessment of recovery several studies related the hydrologic recovery at least in part to the burn severity kinoshita and hogue 2011 olsen et al 2021 robichaud et al 2013a 2008 or relatively rapid recovery of vegetation bart and hope 2010 cerdà and doerr 2005 cooper et al 2015 hubbert et al 2012 inbar et al 1998 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wu et al 2021 one study presented a conceptual model that suggested the recovery period varied with post fire precipitation keller et al 1997 and precipitation was indicated as a control on recovery in at least four other studies mayor et al 2007 robichaud et al 2013b shakesby et al 1993 vieira et al 2016 only one study addressed changes in soil properties as a control on hydrologic recovery andreu et al 2001 while another study suggested pre fire disturbance may affect post fire recovery rates vieira et al 2016 of the 19 study sites where hydrologic recovery had occurred or there was no post fire response we found only one study cosandey et al 2005 that presented a robust before after control impact baci analysis four other studies used before after analysis with no post fire control table 4 which also provides a relatively robust assessment of recovery when adequate pre fire data are available given the low number of long term gauging stations in catchments likely to be heavily impacted by wildfire control impact analyses using an unburned reference site as the control were most common and we deemed seven sites as recovered using data presented in this type of design bart and hope 2010 used prediction intervals from control and impacted catchments to identify post fire streamflow that exceeded the reference unburned condition of their six burned catchments only one arroyo seco exceeded the pre fire prediction intervals for annual monthly or seasonal flows during years three through five after the fire however the response had not yet recovered at the end of the five year study even when the simpler hypothetical criterion for recovery was applied there was no clear consensus about the length of time needed for hydrologic responses to return to pre fire conditions many of the studies used runoff measures relevant to the specific sites or objectives such as storm monthly or annual runoff rates or peak discharge rates however the variety of measurement methods and data reporting approaches made comparisons across sites difficult thus we suggest the use of metrics e g table 1 to help quantify recovery among diverse locations in future studies wherein recovery would be indicated when the post fire metrics fall within the confidence intervals of the pre fire metrics 3 3 demonstration of recovery metrics we used the unique longer term data from the city creek california and rimbaud france sites to test five metrics of streamflow to identify post fire recovery specifically we quantified runoff ratio slope of the flow duration curve low flow q90 the proportion of time with no flow and high flow q10 at both locations the annual runoff ratios appeared cyclical and followed precipitation patterns fig 5 a and e both sites experienced dry conditions in the period just before the fire leading to lower pre fire runoff ratios based on the 95 confidence interval analysis city creek showed a clearer pattern of response and recovery than the rimbaud catchment fig 5 the city creek runoff ratios were higher than the pre fire period for the first three years after burning fig 5a when we analyzed only the first five or six years of post fire data it appeared like hydrologic recovery had occurred however the runoff ratio in the seventh and eighth years again exceeded the confidence limits from the pre fire condition illustrating the importance of longer term studies similarly the slopes of the flow duration curves and q90 low flows for city creek remained elevated for 10 11 years after the fire and showed only a gradual declining trend over this period fig 5b and c these results affirm previous analyses on this catchment kinoshita and hogue 2015 interestingly we did not observe a dramatic increase in the high flows q10 at city creek in the first several years after the fire followed by a slow decline over time fig 5d rather the response in q10 was somewhat cyclical and followed the pattern identified in the annual runoff ratio this observation was counter to the high flows reported in most of the studies in our review which were generally elevated for the first two years after the fire and then decreased over time anderson 1955 cooper et al 2015 garcía comendador et al 2017 robichaud et al 2013b in contrast to city creek the runoff ratios in the rimbaud catchment showed a muted response after the fire in 1990 fig 5e this response was somewhat cyclical and related to the post fire precipitation pattern like city creek the runoff ratios appeared to trend down over the study period fig 5e the slopes of the flow duration curves were elevated above the pre fire confidence interval for the first five years and for a subsequent seven year period after the fire fig 5f the q90 low flows followed a similar pattern as the slopes but with fewer points above the upper confidence limit fig 5g the rimbaud catchment demonstrates typical intermittent stream behavior where there was no flow 20 of the time before the fire the proportion of time with no flow averaged 21 after the fire but there was a distinct increasing trend in the fraction of time with no flow in the post fire period fig 5h we did not find a trend in the high flows q10 after the wildfire at rimbaud however there were many streamflow values below the lower pre fire confidence limit fig 5i in contrast to the original authors assessment of recovery after four years we considered the rimbaud site to have recovered after six years table 4 using the earlier analyses and finer resolution timescale cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of site physical factors on recovery we initially hypothesized that burn severity post fire precipitation and vegetation regrowth would be important factors in assessing post fire hydrologic recovery and that interactions among these factors can lead to a wide range of possible post fire recovery responses fig 1 in our synthesis of 28 studies spanning 38 sites from mediterranean climates we were unable to find consensus about the longevity of fire effects on local or regional hydrology in the 15 studies that showed a post fire response and then recovered the elevated post fire hydrologic effects persisted from two to seven years with longer recovery times generally occurring in catchments with a greater proportion of area burned there were too few studies that reported burn severity to support a general conclusion about this factor however the scale of inference combined with the area burned led to the important finding that a higher proportion of area burned resulted in a lower likelihood of recovery in the study period the spatial scales of the sites in our review were divided among hillslopes 0 005 km2 n 9 small catchments 0 005 5 km2 n 14 and medium or large catchments 5 km2 n 15 in general there was less variability in fire effects or other site characteristics at the smaller scales e g hillslopes the catchment scale provided spatial integration of the effects from heterogeneous catchment characteristics including burn severity larger catchments generally require greater infrastructure to quantify streamflow responses but larger catchments are also more likely to have long term gauging records that allow for more robust assessment of pre fire responses and hence post fire hydrologic recovery also as the size of the catchment increases the fraction of the area impacted by fire tends to decrease and the fire impacts become muted table 3 and harder to detect e g bart and hope 2010 wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 which may confound the assessment of recovery fig 4 our analysis identified differential responses and recovery trajectories that were strongly related to the local precipitation patterns in the post fire period for example in our city creek analysis water year 2005 had higher than normal precipitation which led to greater vegetation cover kinoshita and hogue 2011 however the slope of the flow duration curve and the q 90 low flows remained elevated compared to pre fire conditions fig 5b and c additionally wildfires often occur during dry periods or meteorological droughts pausas and fernandez munoz 2012 which can extend into the post fire period mayor et al 2007 and others e g florsheim et al 2017 reported dry periods after the wildfire which delayed the regrowth of vegetation in the burned area and may have led to longer recovery periods these complexities in the post fire period suggest that site specific assessments of recovery are needed and that many studies using similar metrics will be necessary to develop a general rule for post fire hydrologic recovery interestingly our review illustrated that on sites where vegetation recovered rapidly 18 studies there was either no post fire response or hydrologic recovery occurred during the study in part this was related to the mediterranean climates where the year round growing season and mild winter weather can facilitate rapid vegetation regrowth and facilitate post fire recovery however the relation between vegetation and hydrology is complex and vegetation regrowth alone may not serve as a clear indicator of hydrologic recovery evapotranspiration rates from early succession forests can be greater than rates in established forests leading to a lagged post fire decline in flows especially during dry periods brown et al 2005 langford 1976 watson et al 1999 this is a plausible explanation for the partial declines in streamflow relative to pre fire conditions in two studies kinoshita and hogue 2011 wittenberg and inbar 2009 as well as the increased proportion of time with no flow in the rimbaud catchment in the post fire period fig 5h further the recovery of understory vegetation is a critical component in re establishing pre fire hydrologic conditions increasing leaf area in trees shrubs forbs and grasses not only increases evapotranspiration rates it also increases the leaf litter associated with seasonal vegetation changes leading to greater interception and less runoff and erosion although we did not include soils in our initial hypothesis we recognize that temporal changes in post fire soil properties likely contribute to post fire recovery the time needed for soil structure redevelopment after severe wildfire is largely unknown the replacement of organic matter consumed by the fire reestablishment of the root network and other changes in soil properties such as re establishment of inherent water repellency found in unburned hillslopes doerr et al 2006 robichaud et al 2016 can lead to improved soil structure in burned soils over varying timescales these and other critical factors such as soil moisture status ebel 2013 geology robichaud et al 2013b climate regime wine and cadol 2016 and biological activity likely contribute to the changes in soil structure and the reestablishment of infiltration capacity considering the complexities that contribute to the occasionally ambiguous signals of recovery fig 1 fig 3 fig 4 additional research on the influence of vegetation regrowth and changes in soil hydraulic properties are needed to assess hydrologic recovery more completely 4 2 effects of climate on recovery the site specificity in hydrologic response and recovery observed across our review studies suggests even greater challenges for identifying trends in recovery among regions or climate types for example the american southwest with its monsoonal convective storms may produce post fire responses with larger magnitudes than other areas moody and martin 2009 and the occasional exceptional rainfall intensity in this region may confound assessments of recovery robichaud et al 2013b similarly despite more uniform precipitation conditions moody and martin 2009 areas with continental climates in the western u s can have recovery periods that can extend longer than five years larson nash et al 2018 robichaud et al 2013a 2016 defining a typical period for hydrologic recovery is also complicated by the temporal variability of high intensity rainfall and soil moisture status within mediterranean climates several studies related the observed rainfall intensity or erosivity to generation of post fire peak discharges or sediment delivery cosandey et al 2005 inbar et al 1998 mayor et al 2007 robichaud et al 2008 a substantial hydrologic or sediment delivery response can occur later in the post fire period if a high intensity rainfall event occurs on catchments where the vegetation surface litter and soil structure have not returned to pre fire conditions inbar et al 1998 robichaud et al 2008 the delayed responses can disrupt the apparent recovery trend and result in an erroneous assessment of recovery also the events may fall outside the typical two to three year window of post fire hydrologic monitoring and rigorous observation of these events may be missed altogether unusually large storms or extremely wet periods can cause large hydrologic responses regardless of the time since fire and the timing of these storms can also influence the assessment of whether a site has recovered inbar et al 1998 schmeer et al 2018 due to the risk of large responses recovery probably takes longer than is commonly understood which is an important consideration when planning research watershed monitoring or emergency management after large fires several studies in our systematic review refer to the likely effects of climate change on future fires and hence post fire hydrologic responses bart and hope 2010 cerdà and doerr 2005 cooper et al 2015 diakakis et al 2017 kinoshita and hogue 2015 mayor et al 2007 olsen et al 2021 vieira et al 2016 wittenberg and inbar 2009 any links between climate change and specific post fire responses are highly uncertain however climate change is expected to increase the length of fire seasons extent of fires and burn severity abatzoglou et al 2018 holden et al 2018 littell et al 2009 pausas and fernandez munoz 2012 furthermore climate models predict increases in variability in weather patterns in general including the possibility of more frequent droughts berg and hall 2015 polade et al 2014 and more frequent extreme precipitation ipcc 2014 pierce et al 2013 polade et al 2017 over some mediterranean regions including california and the mediterranean basin these combined factors will likely exacerbate post fire hydro geomorphic responses and increase variability in post fire hydrologic recovery fig 1 field campaign and modeling efforts that account for sources of variability in weather patterns and address the hydrologic changes related to post fire regeneration are needed to understand the array of possible post fire hydrologic recovery trajectories one critical step in this direction would be to improve our ability to scale inferences from hillslope scale studies to catchment scale responses wagenbrenner and robichaud 2014 an additional concern with shifting wildfire regimes under current and future climates livneh et al 2013 williams et al 2019 is the increasing potential for entire watersheds to burn when combined with our observation that the likelihood of post fire hydrologic recovery within the study period decreased as the proportion of area burned increased it follows that catchments will be more likely to be in a fire effected state i e not recovered under future climate conditions 4 3 toward a consistent interpretation of post fire hydrologic recovery we propose that applying a standardized approach to describing and identifying recovery will help researchers policy makers and land managers understand the complexities of post fire hydrologic recovery and communicate recovery in more absolute terms the basis for our recommended approach is to adapt a common definition of recovery identify metrics e g table 1 relevant to specific needs fig 6 and apply a quantitative analysis to the selected metric using pre fire and post fire responses we suggest that hydrologic recovery has occurred when a specific post fire function or condition of interest returns to within the 95 confidence interval established for the pre fire period buttle et al 2018 gouveia et al 2010 hudson 2000 given sufficient data this approach can be transformed into a statistical test using varying degrees of rigor from a simple comparison of confidence limits in a baci experimental design as in our analysis to advanced statistical modeling only 12 of 38 sites in our literature search included pre and post fire data table 4 and only two of them included unburned controls in a baci design before after analysis provides a rigorous approach and can be informative in identifying possible post fire responses and recovery trends fig 5 however given the sparse distribution of monitored catchments especially at small spatial scales and in parts of the world where support for monitoring is less available using reference conditions e g control impacted in table 4 or experimental fire e g stoof et al 2012 can also advance our understanding of post fire hydrological effects and recovery in cases where sufficient hydrologic data are not available the analyst can use the tools and data that are available including personal experience and local knowledge and clearly state the uncertainty of their analysis in their assessment of hydrologic recovery we also recognize that external forcing from climate change changes in land use or invasion by non native species may preclude a landscape s return to the pre fire condition given the site specificity of these confounding factors we did not attempt to address these broad and complex issues in this systematic review adapting this approach will not only improve our ability to make rigorous assessments of recovery within a specific study it will also increase our ability to summarize responses and communicate across diverse fires and catchments as the depth and breadth of post fire hydrologic research continues to expand this approach will increase our understanding of long term effects and ability to be more conclusive regarding the timescale and controls on post fire hydrologic recovery 4 4 hydrologic response metrics we identified several possible metrics derived from commonly collected hydrologic data and related to impacts on water supply or human safety table 1 our relatively simple analysis using a subset of these metrics fig 5 highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate metric based on specific needs table 1 fig 6 for example while q90 can be important for long term water supply planning and for aquatic habitat it may be less relevant for immediate post fire flood hazard which is more appropriately assessed with q10 or the peak discharge in addition the selection of a specific metric should consider the temporal scale of the data and the response an example would be selecting peak discharge as a metric without considering whether the peak is rainfall or snow melt dominated and therefore mostly influenced by the form and intensity of the precipitation moody et al 2013 or snow melt rate analyzing the metrics using data at different timescales such as seasonal or storm flows may also have yielded more conclusive assessments of impact and recovery three studies at the rimbaud catchment in southern france cosandey et al 2005 folton et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2014 showed that post fire streamflow analyzed at the daily time step departed from the pre fire flow while seasonal and annual time steps did not show an effect of the fire on streamflow we chose a simple framework for assessing recovery of comparing pre and post wildfire 95 confidence intervals for hydrologic metrics because this approach is accessible to a broad range of potential users moreover this framework has the potential and flexibility to be expanded upon with more complicated analyses such as normalization by a standard pre fire value or use of mixed effects statistical modeling which may also allow a more distinct signal of the catchment response and recovery 4 5 research opportunities understanding responses across temporal scales is one of the key knowledge gaps currently facing the field of post fire hydrology it was surprisingly difficult to find studies that continued at least three years post fire while longer term studies necessitate substantial long term investment and commitment tetzlaff et al 2017 such efforts are likely to provide unexpected and critical knowledge to facilitate sustainable ecosystem and water management decisions for example long term data sets have recently provided unique insights about forest disturbance effects on summer low flows coble et al 2020 niemeyer et al 2020 perry and jones 2017 segura et al 2020 alternatively a lack of long term post fire studies may lead to an unintentional bias toward presumed short term effects and recovery in the early post fire period fig 3 as such investments in long term post fire research sites or resampling previously studied post fire sites would provide much needed information for understanding hydrologic recovery and resilience of fire prone ecosystems making data from monitoring and research studies publicly accessible would also allow greater synthesis and broader understanding of the variability in post fire recovery additionally our review highlighted the importance of consistent measurement of key parameters to facilitate cross site comparisons robinne et al 2020 we propose the following measurements be included in future post fire hydrologic studies percentages of the area of the experimental unit in different classes of an established burn severity classification system total precipitation and precipitation intensity fraction of bare soil or ground cover particularly for sediment delivery studies and vegetation cover fraction and type except for burn severity these measurements would be most useful in assessing temporal trends and recovery if continued for a period of at least 10 years additional studies of 10 year duration would greatly improve our understanding of medium to long term post fire catchment dynamics and better inform our ability to assess and predict post fire hydrologic recovery despite the critical importance of long term experimental watersheds for data based decisions by water suppliers land managers and emergency managers tetzlaff et al 2017 we are unaware of a long term experimental watershed study designed to improve our understanding of the range of effects from wildfire we recognize that long term post fire data are difficult to obtain especially given short term funding cycles the logistics of sustaining measurements over long periods and the inherent unpredictability of wildfire however from our experience it is much easier and less costly to continue monitoring an existing site or resample a previously used site than to implement a new research endeavor for example measurement intervals can be reduced over time without loss of important information as the rate of regrowth or the relative magnitude of the response decreases spatial scale is another important consideration in future research the fact that all but one of the distinct sites in our systematic review were intermittent or ephemeral underscores the need for additional research on non perennial streams which in general are in smaller catchments to better understand post fire hydrologic responses and recovery on the other hand future assessments of recovery at large catchment or ecosystem scales may become more prevalent by combining field based and remotely sensed data with numerical modeling to determine the impacts of geology climate vegetation and changes in soil structure on recovery of hydrologic processes coupling of spatially explicit data with hydrologic modeling has been applied in a number of recent problems across a range of modeling platforms e g bales et al 2018 miller et al 2011 tague et al 2004 these approaches are likely to become more sophisticated and more widely adapted by researchers and managers as technology such as airborne imaging advances and we continue to increase our understanding of post fire hydrological impacts 5 conclusions we applied a systematic approach to synthesize research on post fire hydrologic recovery in areas with mediterranean climates despite many studies on post fire hydrologic responses we identified only 28 studies covering 38 sites which met our criteria for inclusion in a systematic review these sites were in the western united states and the mediterranean basin and were used to study responses to fires that occurred between 1924 and 2015 in the 18 studies whose original data met our criteria for recovery timescales for hydrologic recovery ranged from zero i e no post fire response to seven years there was no clear pattern between recovery time and location or spatial scale of inference annual time steps were more likely to indicate recovery than shorter time steps and sites with a higher proportion of area burned were less likely to recover these findings suggest that responses that were aggregated through time or across space where unburned area occurred within the experimental unit dampened the more discrete responses from areas with homogenous fire impacts and that these dampening effects may be interpreted as recovery we propose a common definition of post fire hydrologic recovery when a specific post fire function or condition of interest returns to the 95 confidence interval of the pre fire condition we also note metrics that can be adjusted to meet the specific needs of various stakeholders and tested with different degrees of statistical rigor which we demonstrated using confidence interval testing following this approach may improve our ability to compare post fire hydrologic recovery across future studies the few studies available were insufficient to support or contradict our conceptual model of the recovery time needed for specific burn severity and post fire weather patterns we suggest some guidelines to help address this apparent deficiency in future post fire hydrologic studies we also identified several opportunities for additional research including increasing the duration of planned and ongoing post fire

coinciding with peak water demand and are driven mainly by melting of mountain snowpack accumulated the previous winter in wsf practice snowpack is measured and provided as a primary input to river hydrology models implemented and operated on a subbasin by subbasin basis these models fall into two categories process simulation models that explicitly represent the underlying physics of watershed scale runoff generation and data driven phenomenological models that account for the physics implicitly using empirical input output mappings of predictors to predictands a wide variety of specific models fall under these broad umbrellas each with advantages and disadvantages singh and woolhiser 2002 perkins et al 2009 gelfan and motovilov 2009 bourdin et al 2012 weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 hrachowitz and clark 2017 fleming and gupta 2020 even incremental improvements in wsf skill can provide well over 100 million per year in additional public benefit for a single river in the western us yao and georgakakos 2001 hamlet et al 2002 wsf improvements are also critically needed due to narrowing margins between increasing water demand under growing populations and decreasing manageable water supply under climate change which is reducing snowpack through warmer winter temperatures e g barnett et al 2005 clarke et al 2015 bor 2016 this climate change induced decline in the hydrologic role of snowpack in western us watersheds also reduces the inherent seasonal predictability of river runoff harrison and bales 2016 harpold et al 2020 the implications of these skill losses are reminiscent of biology s red queen hypothesis which posits that evolutionary progress is required of a species to simply maintain its status relative to competitors in effect geophysical modelers are competing against climate change which by decreasing predictability of seasonal runoff forces continual forecasting innovation to maintain constant skill it follows that skill improvements require even more aggressive advances indeed increased water management flexibility is a leading goal in the bureau of reclamation s us west wide climate change adaptation strategy with improved hydrometeorological forecasting as a central element bor 2016 collectively these considerations have led to intense ongoing interest in improving wsf models in western north america related research directions are diverse some examples include garen 1998 mahabir et al 2003 hsieh et al 2003 mcguire et al 2006 wood and lettenmaier 2006 kennedy et al 2009 gobena and gan 2009 gobena and gan 2010 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 robertson et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 demargne et al 2014 pagano et al 2009 pagano et al 2004 trubilowicz et al 2015 harpold et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2016 beckers et al 2016 mendoza et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 and peñuela et al 2020 1 2 nrcs water supply forecasting the next generation model and machine learning the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service nrcs has been monitoring snowpack and predicting runoff in the western us since the dust bowl of the 1930s perkins et al 2009 it operates the snotel mountain climate and snow monitoring network with over 850 sites across the region additionally its current operational wsf platform is the largest stand alone system regionally and to our knowledge the largest data driven system globally with over 600 forecast locations in the colorado missouri columbia rio grande klamath and other basins fig 1 nrcs uses several wsf models the primary method is a probabilistic form of principal component regression pcr implemented in the nrcs viper software platform it was adapted to wsf by nrcs to facilitate linear regression under predictor multicollinearity garen 1992 james et al 2013 pcr has since been widely adopted for operational wsf and as a wsf modeling tool in hydrology snow and climate research e g moradkhani and meier 2010 oubeidillah et al 2011 hsieh et al 2003 najafi and moradkhani 2016 eldaw et al 2003 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 regonda et al 2006a regonda et al 2006b kennedy et al 2009 harpold et al 2016 lehner et al 2017 perkins et al 2009 beckers et al 2016 fleming and goodbody 2019 glabau et al 2020 though successful the technique is decades old has known technical issues and required revisiting for potential upgrades or replacement a particular point of interest was potential adoption of machine learning ml a branch of artificial intelligence ai here we use ml and ai interchangeably for convenience involving algorithms that detect patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions however developing an ai based next generation nrcs wsf model involved overcoming long standing roadblocks to transitioning ml from research into a genuine operational river forecasting environment ai was applied to streamflow prediction over 25 years ago hsu et al 1995 minns and hall 1996 despite ongoing research demonstrating forecast skill improvements over statistical and process based hydrologic models migration to operational river hydrology has been limited with no openly documented adoption of ai by operational wsf systems in the western us reasons include its black box character and resulting lack of geophysical explainability lack of emphasis on generating prediction uncertainty estimates and concerns about overtraining abrahart et al 2012 fleming et al 2015 underlying these specific issues there may be two broader questions one is fundamental some have recently argued that the ongoing evolution of machine learning has yielded substantially new and superior approaches to physically understanding hydrological systems which the hydrologic community as a whole has not yet acknowledged or adjusted to nearing et al 2021 the other is practical in particular it has been the collective qualitative observation of the authors working with both ai and operational river forecasting over several decades that these two communities of practice are largely disconnected operational hydrologists typically have little familiarity with ai and often feel uncomfortable with it whereas researchers specializing in ml applications to hydrology often focus on exploring the latest ai innovations rather than meeting the needs of operational hydrologists the approach taken therefore was to determine a holistic set of characteristics required of a next generation wsf model and work hand in hand with the operational community to craft an integrative solution meeting those specific requirements several well proven techniques from ai statistical modeling evolutionary computing ensemble modeling and other areas were selected and combined to form this novel hybrid approach fleming and goodbody 2019 termed the multi model machine learning metasystem m4 1 3 study goals in this study we apply m4 and evaluate its performance characteristics and suitability for widespread operational implementation despite technical vetting in the data science literature and initial demonstrations of hydrologic applicability fleming and goodbody 2019 wsf testing of m4 so far has been too limited to justify broad operational adoption yet any next generation nrcs operational wsf method must demonstrate applicability and performance advantages relative to existing operational systems over the wide range of geophysical environments encountered across the nrcs wsf system which spans the deserts of new mexico to the icefields of alaska and the associated diversity of statistical problem characteristics data availability and other practical factors further a telling and necessary test of any prototype prediction system is to run it live in the same operational environment it is ultimately intended to serve in given the aforementioned lack of uptake of ml by the operational community such operational testing may also speak more widely if indirectly to overall suitability of ai for routine mainstream large scale river forecasting and in particular whether the design philosophy and technical solutions used in developing m4 are effective at bridging that research applications gap to address these questions about the practical capabilities of m4 we performed two sets of testing first hindcasting was completed for 20 test cases spanning 11 locations sampling diverse hydroclimatic settings second live operational testing was performed for a subset of 5 of these locations during the 2020 forecast season though accuracy improvements are vital acceptance by operational forecast hydrologists additionally requires assessment of a broader set of performance characteristics e g weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 whateley et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 peñuela et al 2020 fleming et al 2021 other questions evaluated include effectiveness of efforts to build high levels of robustness flexibility and automation into the new approach logistical feasibility of associated workflows and computations in a time and resource constrained setting typical of agencies that run such forecast systems operationally consistency of performance capabilities across a variety of watershed characteristics without the need for manual case by case local scale fine tuning of modeling procedures and physical plausibility of outcomes including both generation of physically reasonable predictions and amenability of the resulting forecasts to interpretation in terms of current seasonal climatic conditions and known hydrologic processes the influence these additional considerations have on which technologies are adopted into operational systems should not be underestimated nor is it unique to nrcs forecast software platforms at operational agencies have been recently developed or updated like viper at nrcs see above the hydrological ensemble forecast system hefs at national weather service river forecast centers and pyforecast at the bureau of reclamation e g demargne et al 2014 perkins et al 2009 https github com usbr pyforecast nevertheless fundamental geophysical modeling concepts fleming and gupta 2020 underlying these platforms have not seen major upgrades in decades hartmann et al 2002 pagano et al 2004 hefs uses the 1970s era sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma and snow 17 process models and while the modular pyforecast platform has flexibility to easily incorporate innovative modeling techniques both viper and current development versions of pyforecast largely focus on 1990s era pcr and other linear regression variants moreover model implementation and operation generally remain reliant on an archaic style of subjective manual hydrologist intervention research implementing a so called over the loop otl paradigm using automated and objective processes has not in general successfully migrated to large scale mainstream river forecast systems in the region seo et al 2003 wood et al 2020 persistent use of seemingly outdated but proven methods which has been interpreted by some as technical stagnation e g hartmann et al 2002 has occurred largely because new methods whether physics based or data driven have often failed to match key needs of the operational hydrology community for detailed discussions see e g weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 whateley et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 peñuela et al 2020 as one example benefits provided by ai are significant but accompanied by drawbacks restricting operationalization see section 1 2 the m4 approach and the pragmatic testing regimen for it presented here are intended to address these roadblocks to migrating otl and ai based methods into operational wsf accordingly evaluations are completed here within the context of the existing nrcs wsf system as described in detail below doing so leverages experiential knowledge and established best practices around operational wsf in the us west and enables meaningful comparisons to current operational techniques 1 4 manuscript organization the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the established overall framework for data driven operational wsf models in western north america which as noted above we adopt here to ensure apples to apples comparisons of m4 against current methods it then presents specific test cases and datasets considered section 3 provides a brief qualitative summary of m4 focusing on linkages to operational forecast community needs this short synopsis is not intended to be comprehensive and readers are referred to fleming and goodbody 2019 for detailed technical descriptions of m4 section 4 summarizes the results of hindcast and live operational testing this includes discussion of performance metrics with comparisons to the existing system geophysical interpretability of results and other topics broader implications to acceptance of ai in operational hydrology are also briefly discussed finally section 5 concludes with a summary and outlines research and operationalization plans note that to our knowledge after full roll out into production systems at nrcs m4 will be the largest migration of ai into a genuine operational river forecast environment to date 2 data 2 1 standard wsf problem structure to evaluate m4 in a realistic operational wsf context we set up the overall prediction problem in a manner closely resembling the existing nrcs forecast system which is in turn broadly similar to most other statistically based operational wsf models in western north america the predictand target in ml nomenclature is spring summer runoff volume which is measured at a us geological survey streamgage with nrcs adjustments as needed for upstream diversions or at some other hydrometric monitoring site predictors consist of snow water equivalent swe and wintertime to date accumulated precipitation measurements at mountain climate monitoring stations predominantly nrcs snotel or similar sites various other datasets like antecedent streamflow are sometimes used as supplemental predictors note that wsf research has extensively tested additional data types like remotely sensed swe gridded precipitation datasets seasonal scale numerical climate model forecasts and other products but so far these experimental predictors have experienced limited uptake into operational wsf systems in the western us to illustrate a typical statistically based wsf model might predict on march 1 the upcoming april 1 july 31 cumulative flow volume at a given point on a given river using as predictors march 1 swe and october 1 february 28 total precipitation measured at snotel sites within or near the watershed boundary upstream of the streamgage the number of such sites varies widely depending on the basin but about a half dozen to two dozen is roughly typical as part of the modeling process the input datasets are usually amalgamated in some way into an index that serves as the regression predictor or in the ml nomenclature a feature that is presented to the supervised learning algorithm 2 2 test cases hindcast testing considered 20 test cases corresponding to january 1 and april 1 forecast dates at 11 existing nrcs forecast locations fig 1 these locations span diverse geophysical environments including a glacier fed alaskan river several southwestern desert rivers a watershed with large volcanic aquifer contributions to flow a comparatively winter rain dominated pacific northwest basin a sierra nevada snowpack fed endorheic california nevada watershed missouri sub basins in both the northern and southern rocky mountains colorado river and rio grande headwaters and so forth see table 1 for summaries these test cases also sample diverse statistical characteristics like nonlinear functional forms and heteroscedastic and non normally distributed errors e g owyhee river linear stationary gaussian behaviors e g yellowstone river and multiple predictive inputs corresponding to both wintertime hydroclimate and complex internal watershed dynamics e g deschutes river in addition live operational testing was undertaken during the 2020 forecast season for a subset of 5 of these locations gila deschutes yellowstone owyhee and truckee rivers trained at multiple consecutive forecast issue dates january 1 february 1 march 1 and april 1 this forms a total of 20 live operational test cases that partially overlap with the 20 hindcasting test cases as noted in section 2 1 to facilitate meaningful comparisons against current systems the method was implemented in a fashion including dataset selection similar to existing statistical operational wsf models for each test case spring summer runoff volume over the river s established primary management period usually april july was the target a candidate pool of input variables was assembled to serve as the basis for feature extraction for each test case specific variables were closely consistent with existing operational nrcs models for the same combination of location issue date and target period forecast horizon and include year to date precipitation and current snow water equivalent swe at the forecast date at nrcs snotel or related e g california cooperative snow survey program mountain climate monitoring sites and for certain basins antecedent streamflow we did not capitalize here on emerging alternative predictor types like remotely sensed or climate modeling products although the method is designed in part with those predictors in mind as discussed below the result therefore reflects a minimum estimate of potential advantages of the method again following typical procedure for statistically based operational wsf in the western us we used data over a standard 30 year hydroclimatic normal period 1986 2015 this choice usually reflects a pragmatic attempt to balance longer datasets for better training and testing vs record length limitations that could restrict the number of sites for which models can be developed a common secondary motivation is to help mitigate impacts from various climatic and land cover nonstationarties on model development by restricting the record length used to a recent period which is reasonably representative of current conditions and over which the cumulative impacts of nonstationarities can be reasonably presumed at most forecast locations to be sufficiently limited for developing and testing a seasonal scale prediction model 3 method 3 1 general as noted in section 1 this study uses the recently developed m4 prediction analytics engine mathematical and computational details of m4 are too lengthy to be repeated here in the interest of conciseness readers are referred to fleming and goodbody 2019 instead section 3 2 provides a brief qualitative synopsis of the model focusing on summarizing how specific operational wsf needs were identified and what design steps were taken in an effort to meet those requirements section 3 3 then describes application of this method to the test cases outlined in section 2 3 2 summary of m4 prediction engine 3 2 1 design process concept and criteria preparatory steps during initial m4 development included a thorough inventory and assessment of needs and options before undertaking detailed technical design the process began with documenting the existing nrcs system which like many operational wsf systems has evolved organically over the decades its capabilities and limitations were then assessed including documentation of known issues discovered during forecast operations over the years and completion of extensive statistical diagnostics progress in data driven wsf was reviewed with an eye to identifying the most promising potential directions for a next generation nrcs model implications of global anthropogenic climate change on requirements for wsf were additionally considered finally an initial blueprint and preliminary scoping models were developed to test potential ideas the overall conclusions were that a new wsf model was warranted that ai was the best solution pathway for nrcs and that for ai to be effective and useful in a practical operational hydrology context it must be deployed in a highly application specific way similar conclusions have been reached in other fields e g meredig 2018 the resulting design concept was framed as a convergence of detailed hydrologic process knowledge a mature understanding of potentially applicable machine learning concepts and tools and practical operational water management requirements fig 2 top this led in turn to identification of 9 specific design criteria table 2 several existing techniques met some of these criteria but none adequately satisfied all a hybrid approach was therefore developed fleming and goodbody 2019 specifically to meet these design requirements fig 2 bottom see section 3 2 2 3 2 2 overview fig 2 sketches the main elements of m4 in summary the metasystem consists of six semi independent forecast systems each centered around a different supervised learning algorithm a pool of candidate input predictor variables is defined by the hydrologist for a given forecast problem combination of forecast location issue date and target period similar to current generation statistical wsf models in western north america section 2 principal component analysis pca an unsupervised statistical learning technique is used for pattern recognition in the input data matrix and the extracted features are directed to the supervised learning models supervised learners include two substantially different kinds of neural network a monotone artificial neural network mann and a monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn linear regression lr quantile regression with adjustments to ensure non crossing quantiles qr random forests rf and a support vector machine svm more specifically support vector regression a genetic algorithm ga optimizes feature extraction and selection separately for each forecast system that is which of the input predictor variables in the candidate pool and corresponding pca modes to retain the ga objective function uses a penalty to ensure that multiple predictors are retained which is operationally important for functional redundancy in the event of sensor failures or other technical issues the result of each semi independent system is a forecast distribution i e a probability density function for future seasonal flow volume in standard operational wsf practice in the western us this uncertainty information is presented as prediction intervals corresponding to 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 quantile respectively 90 70 30 and 10 exceedance probability flow volumes m4 generates these intervals using either intrinsic probability models for the two quantile regression techniques mcqrnn and qr or a box cox transform space based heuristic for the other models both are nonparametric methods that accommodate heteroscedastic and non gaussian error distributions results are averaged across the models to form an ensemble mean best estimate with prediction intervals algorithmic logic is introduced at various points to automate various processes including but not limited to hyperparameter optimization or to ensure certain conditions are met by the solution like an ensemble pruning algorithm contributing to strictly nonnegative predictions fleming and goodbody 2019 provide important methodological details around regularization essentially overtraining mitigation hyperparameter selection and tuning pre calibration and optimization of high level machine learning parameters prediction interval generation optimal feature extraction further information on each of the constituent statistical and machine learning models and how they are implemented within m4 and other key m4 technical elements in the interest of conciseness readers are referred there for complete descriptions of the data science underlying the m4 prediction analytics engine assessed in this study that said we briefly elaborate below on two aspects that warrant particular attention from a more general operational hydrologic modeling perspective explainable ai and autonomous machine learning these two concepts and the pragmatic approaches used to achieve or at least adequately approximate them for our purposes are summarized in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 respectively additionally all the methods used to collectively form m4 were specifically chosen to help satisfy particular requirements outlined in table 2 some related points around technique selection are briefly summarized in section 3 2 5 3 2 3 geophysical consistency and explainability we borrow the term physics aware ai from materials science meredig 2018 it is a broad but useful term that refers to general intersections between ml applications and the underlying process physics or qualitative domain specific knowledge more broadly of the problem to which ml is applied it is a holistic concept primarily focusing on making ai useful to mainstream science and engineering users through such mechanisms as explainable machine learning theory guided data science and a general alignment of machine learning solutions with existing bodies of physical knowledge of the system being modeled and associated practical considerations like the inherent data sparseness of certain fields many specific technical approaches fall under this rubric moreover given the centrality of explainable machine learning to the future of ai it is an extremely dynamic computer science research topic in which new paradigms emerge on a regular basis though many of these are far from ready for use in high stakes operational river forecasting systems at sdos we adopted a comparatively straightforward strongly pragmatic and wsf focused approach that concentrates on balancing two m4 design criteria generating forecasts that are physically reasonable and explainable criterion 6 in table 2 while using well proven ml algorithms criterion 7 three general steps were taken 1 automation notwithstanding features engineering in m4 remains hydrologist directed through input candidate pool selection and decisions around the maximum number of pca modes the genetic algorithm is permitted to retain these choices reflect end user knowledge around representativeness reliability quirks and capabilities of potential input variables or measurement sites and geophysical interpretations of pca modes which in practice are known to usually correspond to watershed scale indices of hydroclimatic forcing or aquifer stream interactions e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 see also section 4 it is a key location in the ai development process for domain experts to insert physical hydrologic knowledge that a hydrologist should select candidate predictors may seem obvious to water resource scientists and engineers but runs contrary to some contemporary ai directions like certain data mining and big data applications 2 wsf was reframed as a low dimensional problem with a parsimonious solution this is not in itself physics aware ai however pca input pre processing and compact ml architectures enable direct graphical visualization of input output relationships in most cases revealing relationships the ai discovered and facilitating their geophysical interpretation criterion 9 therefore supports criterion 6 3 monotonicity and nonnegativity constraints are imposed at various locations within m4 this includes selection of specific machine learning methods allowing nonnegativity mcqrnn and monotonicity mann mcqrnn constraints inclusion of nonlinear supervised learners into the multi model ensemble that can track nonlinear relationships and thus further contribute to avoidance of negative valued predictions mann mcqrnn rf svm see section 4 for an example of such nonlinearities and how m4 captures and communicates them conversely inclusion of linear supervised learners as a small subset of the multi model ensemble to further contribute to monotonicity of the final ensemble solution qr lr careful and application specific regularization related hyperparameter pre calibration steps see also section 3 2 4 that enable but place limits on nonlinearity and a final ensemble pruning algorithm to further enforce non negativity as mentioned above see also fig 2 these functional characteristics of monotonicity and nonnegativity correspond to known aspects of hydroclimatic relationships for example that runoff volume cannot be negative valued or that a heavy snowpack does not all else held equal lead to low flow volume again for details see fleming and goodbody 2019 most of these steps constitute theory guided ai that is a priori alignment of ai algorithms with known geophysical processes see karpatne et al 2017 doing so in turn encourages geophysical explainability examples are discussed in section 4 additional regularization is an added benefit as theory guided a priori constraints limit the solution space available to the machine learning algorithm and therefore reduce fitting to noise e g karpatne et al 2017 zhang and zhang 1999 more broadly these elements of the m4 metasystem may intersect with another high level evolutionary trajectory in machine learning the transition from first wave handcrafted knowledge to second wave statistical learning to now emerging third wave contextual learning ai for a synopsis see launchberry 2021 kratzert et al 2018 and fleming and goodbody 2019 might be considered early attempts at integrating third wave ai philosophies and capabilities into hydrologic prediction but approach this challenge differently kratzert et al 2018 explore potential abilities of particular deep learning architectures to capture and reveal certain hydrologic processes with minimal or no application of a priori geophysical knowledge that is early experiments suggest this approach can learn some geophysical context without significant a priori guidance m4 instead moves more incrementally toward third wave approaches by leveraging second wave and certain aspects of still relevant launchberry 2021 first wave ai approaches to achieve specific operational goals in practical water resource science that necessarily include the application of machine learning within a predefined but broad geophysically relevant solution space which is then refined by m4 on a case by case basis that is it learns within a broad set of theory guided constraints monotonicity nonnegativity etc and capabilities subject matter expert guided features engineering genetic algorithm based feature selection etc that reflect overall geophysical context of the general problem class western north american wsf and in doing so it refines that geophysical context through the hydroclimatically interpretable solutions it learns and communicates for each river see section 4 2 2 for examples 3 2 4 automl and pre calibration improved automation criterion 2 of table 2 was achieved by judicious and application specific use of autonomous machine learning automl in the data science nomenclature e g thornton et al 2013 guyon et al 2015 and pre calibration algorithms were developed to automate most optimization and decision points including setting ml hyperparameters one example is automated determination of optimal ann hidden layer size on the basis of cross validated goodness of fit and information theoretic metrics fleming and goodbody 2019 in other cases hyperparameters were set to robust default pre calibrated values based on extensive experimentation section 3 2 1 using a subset of wsf test cases one example was completing during initial prototype testing hundreds of m4 training runs to locate generally usable defaults for the population size and number of generations in the genetic algorithm and defining a user protocol for diverging from those defaults if desired in general this operational wsf specific combination of automl algorithms and default hyperparameters involved establishing reasonable trade offs for instance increasing the population size and the number of generations in the genetic algorithm improves out of sample prediction skill but the relationship is nonlinear and quickly reaches a point of diminishing returns balancing this observation against minimization of run times helped set default values similarly in creating automl algorithms to automate optimal ann topology selection the better up to a point pattern recognition capabilities enabled by additional hidden layer neurons were balanced against associated training complications like longer run times and greater susceptibility to both overtraining and conversely trapping in local minima in the nonlinear neural network cost function e g hsieh 2009 automl is additionally facilitated in m4 by selecting methods that match the statistical and physical requirements of western us wsf i e criterion 4 supports criterion 2 table 2 specifically nonlinear ai techniques heteroscedastic and non gaussian prediction intervals and enforcement of non negativity constraints reduce the amount of manual hydrologist intervention in the form of selecting and applying predictand transforms for instance required to develop and operate wsf models sections 1 3 and 3 2 see also examples in section 4 3 2 5 some relationships to other ai philosophies as noted above the goal of m4 is to fuse existing methods into a hybrid that meets the specific design criteria we defined for a next generation ai based us west wide operational wsf model at nrcs this practical applications focused design philosophy is not generally typical of ai research in water resource science and engineering see again section 1 and to help illustrate how it motivates certain methodological choices in m4 development it is helpful to consider a few examples one example is how design criterion 8 was approached model equifinality and using multi model ensembles to address it are well established hydrologic concepts but are usually reserved for process simulation models e g beven and binley 1992 bourdin et al 2014 similar concepts have emerged independently in the statistical and ai communities but usually involve ensembles of nearly identical models such as committees formed from bootstrap aggregated bagged neural networks e g breiman 1996 breiman 2001 wolpert 1996 burnham and anderson 2002 in contrast strong methodological diversity within a multi model ensemble is desirable reducing error correlation across constituent models and increasing noise suppression within the ensemble e g monteleoni et al 2011 a complementary concept is that at a geophysical level we might expect certain models to work better in certain environments yet the final wsf system must function well across a wide range of hydroclimatic settings and terrestrial hydrologic processes sections 1 and 2 this implies that model diversity within the multi model ensemble might improve consistency of prediction accuracy across the nrcs system insofar as poor performance of one or more of the models in some particular location may be compensated by good performance of other models in the ensemble and vice versa at other locations this is intimately related to the underlying reasons why multi model ensembles are effective in geophysical modeling for details see hagedorn et al 2005 we therefore chose several fundamentally different supervised ai methods to include in the multi model ensemble fig 2 for instance anns imitate the brain s biological network of neurons and synapses rfs reflect the decision tree framework of human choice and svms are abstract hyperdimensional mathematical constructs as a corollary m4 constitutes a super ensemble with respect to some of its constituent ai methods that are in turn ensemble learners i e random forests and bagged neural networks as another example that a method is not currently chosen for m4 does not imply we are critical of it only that it is not presently judged to adequately satisfy the multi faceted and operations oriented design criteria table 2 or other basic fitness for purpose see e g cunderlik et al 2013 considerations in nrcs wsf consider for instance deep learning sequential online learning and transfer learning these three branches of ai show substantial promise in hydrologic testing e g lima et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 however to our knowledge none has experienced even initial wsf testing failing criterion 7 at this time additionally deep learning is often computationally expensive to the point of imposing restrictive hardware requirements potentially failing criterion 3 and while deep learning appears to offer strong knowledge discovery capabilities in some geoscientific applications e g reichstein et al 2019 nearing et al 2021 it remains unclear whether deep learning architectures which by definition are complex are amenable to fast and easy geophysical interpretation of the type needed in our operational forecasting application potentially failing criterion 6 see also section 4 2 2 transfer learning is potentially advantageous to building models for many forecast sites and dates but m4 can be trained rapidly due to automl pre calibration section 3 2 4 and some simple parallelization across processor cores on a standard personal computer see above and fleming and goodbody 2019 further hydrologic experimentation so far with these three classes of ai has largely focused on hourly or daily flood prediction which has different requirements from seasonal volume forecasting for instance deep learning was developed largely for big data whereas standard operational wsf problems generally involve modestly sized datasets see section 2 that may not effectively capitalize on or even be adequate for deep learning similarly online sequential learning has advantages in cases of rapid new data acquisition but in wsf only one new sample appears per year section 2 by the same token however ai and its hydrologic applications are fast evolving fields encompassing many existing and emerging techniques this rapid development pace motivates design criterion 5 a modular expandable structure that facilitates integrating new ai methods into m4 table 2 3 3 application to test cases 3 3 1 retrospective analysis hindcast testing was performed for each of the 20 test cases described in section 2 five metrics described immediately below were used to measure hindcast performance several additional more qualitative evaluation criteria were also considered as discussed in section 3 3 3 root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 quantify deterministic prediction accuracy rmse provides an intuitive sense of typical predictive error and is closely related to regression standard error and r2 gives the proportion of target variance explained by the model we also consider the ranked probability skill score rpss a measure of the probabilistic skill of the model framed in terms of its ability relative to a naïve climatology forecast to predict the probability of dry normal or wet years as defined by terciles of the observed flow volumes e g wiegel et al 2007 guihan 2014 fleming and goodbody 2019 rmse r2 and rpss were assessed using cross validated predictions calculated by the general method of garen 1992 which is widely used for wsf applications of pcr in the western us except for rpss in the case of the two quantile regression methods which was estimated using their intrinsic probability models see also e g pagano et al 2004 rosenberg et al 2011 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 these conventional accuracy metrics do not penalize the negative valued and therefore non physical predictions made by standard statistical models in some cases see criterion 4 in table 2 examples are provided in section 4 or reward the physical acceptability of predictions made by m4 a more comprehensive portrayal of model performance is therefore provided by additionally tracking binary metrics that flag whether or not the model predicted best estimates and the lowest of the associated prediction intervals considered in standard wsf applications section 3 2 2 meet the physicality requirement of being nonnegative for all available sample times 3 3 2 live operations live operational testing was undertaken during the 2020 forecast season for a subset of five locations at multiple forecast issue dates section 2 for the 1 february and 1 march forecast dates predictor candidate pools were similar to those used in hindcasting for the 1 january and 1 april operational forecasts the same models were used as in hindcasting see section 2 operational testing was completed alongside but separately from the existing pcr based nrcs forecast system the primary goals of the live testing were to confirm compliance of m4 with two core requirements of an operational wsf system related workflows must be logistically feasible in a time and resource constrained operational environment and any given forecast must be readily and succinctly explainable in terms of known geophysical processes and current climatic conditions 3 3 3 evaluation criteria the evaluation criteria approximately reflect the practical design criteria outlined in section 3 2 and table 2 for hindcast testing assessment included the five quantitative metrics described in section 3 3 1 and in particular relative performance improvements for these metrics compared to the linear pcr benchmark of the existing nrcs system see section 3 3 4 below additionally robustness ease of use and automation potential were qualitatively assessed during both hindcast and operational testing this included ability to train and operate m4 model suites across a diverse set of test cases quickly with no manual tuning we also assessed amenability of the resulting forecasts to interpretation focusing on live operational tests and ability to infer a relatable storyline around the current forecast this is a requirement for achieving user and client buy in for an operational wsf system but is conventionally regarded as a challenge for ml section 1 3 3 4 benchmark current nrcs operational pcr models as developed and implemented in the viper operational forecasting software platform garen 1992 perkins et al 2009 see also sections 1 2 and 1 3 for the test cases section 2 provide a challenging and broadly relevant performance benchmark for m4 pcr models are the basis of nrcs and other operational wsf systems represent a general reference point as a standard linear gaussian statistical regression approach and are widely used in hydroclimatic research section 1 2 using pcr based wsfs as a point of comparison for m4 is further reinforced by studies suggesting relative to extended streamflow prediction esp based process simulation models currently in western north american operational use similar accuracy as well as better prediction uncertainty intervals due to under dispersion common in the ensemble spreads of most operational esp systems e g gobena and gan 2010 harpold et al 2020 prediction intervals for the benchmark model are generated using a heuristic typical of current operational pcr based wsf including nrcs systems and widely employed in other regression applications that is error is assumed to follow a stationary normal distribution centered at the best estimate prediction with a standard deviation equal to the regression standard error e g garen 1992 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2013 benchmark model performance was tracked using the same criteria and procedures described in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrospective testing 4 1 1 an introductory example the owyhee river preliminary comparison of outcomes for the owyhee river april 1 publication date fig 1 see section 2 2 against conventional pcr techniques provides a sense of the practical benefits of m4 and a useful starting point for more detailed examination of test case results note that this river is known from operational nrcs experience to be one of the more challenging forecast points in the western us for reasons that will become apparent below and is therefore an instructive litmus test fig 3 a gives hindcast predictions from conventional pcr as used by nrcs and others for several samples the best estimate runoff predictions are negative valued and therefore physically impossible additionally it does not generate required time varying and asymmetric prediction bounds which are obviously too wide in low flow years and too narrow in high flow years further contributing to negative valued prediction intervals these issues are routinely addressed successfully in pcr based wsf using predictand transforms a common approach to applying classical statistical models to nonlinear non stationary and non gaussian prediction problems however such procedures require manual user intervention to determine whether a transform is needed and if so which one this is a slow non otl procedure sections 1 and 3 depends on expert opinion undermining objectivity reproducibility and defensibility and does not separate distributional modifications from functional form modifications see fleming and goodbody 2019 moreover in operational practice at a few locations multiple models are maintained in the current nrcs system such as a non transformed primary model giving the best overall performance and a transformed model used on an as needed basis to avoid negative valued predictions during dry years or other complications if done well cf wood et al 2020 vs weber et al 2012 these subjective ad hoc time consuming model development and selection choices can improve the accuracy and flexibility of traditional linear models but are even further removed from an ideal otl workflow in contrast fig 3 b shows m4 generates strictly non negative best estimate forecasts and associated prediction intervals the prediction bounds can when needed vary in width from year to year and be asymmetric about the best estimate no user input or intervention was required apart from specifying the input variable candidate pool m4 additionally gives better forecast skill than linear pcr as discussed in subsequent sections 4 1 2 performance within multi model ensemble the benefit of extending multi model ensembles to a diverse set of supervised machine learning methods for wsf section 3 2 5 see also fleming and goodbody 2019 is confirmed by comparative results on test sites across the western us table 3 equifinality is pervasive as commonly seen for hydrologic and other models beven and binley 1992 wolpert 1996 burnham and anderson 2002 hagedorn et al 2005 relative to other techniques within the metasystem a certain individual modeling method may for a given test case perform best on one metric but worst on another or for a given forecast date perform best at one location but not at others or for a given location perform well for one forecast date but not for others table 3 multi model ensembles provide an established means for addressing such model selection uncertainty and give tangible performance improvements table 3 the ensemble mean forecast distribution frequently one or more performance metrics in each of nine test cases beats the performance of any of its constituent ensemble members through mutual error cancellation a known advantage of ensemble modeling perhaps more importantly metasystem mean performance almost without exception beats matches or is second best to all of its constituent systems this is far more consistent performance across performance metrics locations and forecast dates than any of the six individual modeling techniques within the metasystem such consistency is a fundamental but occasionally overlooked advantage of multi model ensemble means hagedorn et al 2005 and is important for reliable efficient and effective application across a large region with diverse geophysical and statistical characteristics see ensemble modeling discussion in section 3 2 5 4 1 3 performance relative to existing system fig 4 and table 3 reveal the m4 ensemble mean forecast distribution also meets or in most cases beats the current nrcs wsf model for every quantitative performance measure recall from section 3 3 4 that this current pcr model is a meaningful general benchmark for operational wsf skill in the western us on average r2 and rpss improve by over 50 and rmse is reduced by 13 these accuracy improvements on 20 diverse test cases appear to mainly reflect a combination of flexibility provided by nonlinear machine learning robustness provided by methodologically diverse multi model ensembles and embedding of geophysical process constraints section 3 2 for rivers like the deschutes where preliminary diagnostics section 3 2 1 suggested no significant departures from linear stationary gaussian processes improvements were comparatively modest in such cases the ensemble ai essentially retrieves a linear stationary gaussian model as expected if regularization is properly implemented hsieh et al 2003 fleming 2007 by the same token benefits relative to the existing system were strongest for test cases like owyhee gila clark canyon and truckee which are nonlinear non gaussian or heteroscedastic and or where the existing system produced occasional non physical negative predictions note the final ensemble mean forecast distribution was always non negative a key advantage over the current statistical model which in 6 hindcast test cases provided a forecast distribution containing non physical values in at least one year these advantages are also qualitatively obvious for individual cases section 4 1 1 4 2 live operational testing 4 2 1 general performance live testing at a subset of 5 forecast locations during the 2020 forecast season section 3 3 alongside the current operational system was undertaken primarily to evaluate certain practical aspects of actually using m4 in a genuinely operational setting the testing confirmed logistical feasibility of associated near real time workflows and m4 was found reliable and simple to use with no need for manual intervention this otl approach stands in contrast to existing operational wsf models which in practice often require manual subjective choices during operations around rebuilding using different predictor sets or transforms statistical models or adjustments of parameters internal states or input data values process models see sections 1 and 3 further during part of the 2020 forecast season manual snow survey sites could not be monitored due to the covid 19 pandemic and impacts of the associated quarantine on field surveys it was found that m4 modeling suites previously developed for certain forecast points and dates that made particularly heavy use of manual snow survey data were easily and quickly retrained during routine forecast operations to use only telemetered snotel data this example illustrates that in practice the metasystem can provide needed flexibility and convenience when an unexpected operational condition arises out of sample forecast accuracy comparisons to other methods were performed in the hindcasting of section 4 1 3 and obviously were not a goal for live operational testing little can be gleaned in this respect from a single forecast season which effectively amounts to a sample of one in wsf it is nevertheless encouraging to preliminarily note that considering all 4 forecast dates at all 5 locations mean rmse improvement over the benchmark model in live operations was 10 roughly comparable to improvements seen in hindcasting additionally in operations the range in the best estimate 2020 spring summer volume forecast across all 4 forecast issue dates for a given river decreased relative to the current nrcs model by 21 averaged across the 5 sites if this apparent increase in the stability of the best estimate prediction value from one forecast date to the next for a given river during a given forecast season is rigorously confirmed in further operational testing it may reflect the inherent performance consistency advantages provided by multi model ensemble averaging see section 4 1 2 provided it is not at the expense of decreased accuracy and the opposite is seen here as noted above such steadiness in the forecast is in general viewed as a desirable operational characteristic by sdos because it simplifies hydroclimatic interpretations and client communications 4 2 2 geophysical interpretation of two live ai based forecasts ability to readily determine how model behaviors relate to physical hydrologic processes is necessary for meeting professional responsibilities around assessing the reliability of forecasts used for high impact water management decisions and for verification diagnostics physical interpretability is also vital for communicating forecasts to clients who often include the general public such as why a river volume prediction increased or decreased and by how much since the last forecast date recall from section 1 that for some western us rivers experiencing complex or contentious water management issues wsfs are legal requirements specified by legislation court decisions or international treaties such forecasts are routinely subject to intense public and even political scrutiny amenability to physical explanation is therefore a prerequisite for operational wsf systems in the region including those based on statistical and machine learning methods e g garen 1992 weber et al 2012 fleming and goodbody 2019 fleming et al 2021 as discussed in sections 1 and 3 such relatable hydroclimatic storylines are widely perceived to run contrary to the nominally black box nature of machine learning in turn slowing the migration of ai into operational hydrology some successful early attempts notwithstanding e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 explainable or glass box ai largely remains at the cutting edge of geoscience kratzert et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 mcgovern et al 2019 nearing et al 2021 our live operational forecasting provided an opportunity to test the pragmatic wsf specific approach to explainable machine learning implemented in m4 section 3 2 3 two examples are summarized below these were the most complicated interpretive scenarios encountered during live operational testing and as such illustrate ability of the m4 metasystem to extract geophysical process reasoning from an ai based predictive approach we first consider the february 1 2020 operational forecast of 101 normal for february may 2020 gila river flow volume during m4 training candidate predictors for this operational test case were forecast date swe and water year to date precipitation at a few sites in this remote mountain tributary to the lower colorado river table 1 fig 1 similar to the current wsf system section 2 in this particular test case for all models in m4 the genetic algorithm retained only the leading pca mode which given the candidate predictors used is a de facto watershed scale index of wintertime climate conditions and in particular basin water inputs the genetic algorithm effectively casts votes for which geophysical drivers among the candidates in the pool it thinks most important thus the resulting popular vote across models along with the pca eigenvector illuminate which inputs most influence the forecast we see table 4 that some predictors e g silver creek divide swe were more popular than others e g signal peak swe whereas eigenvector weights across retained predictors were roughly uniform for a given model in this case further dimensionality reduction section 3 allows direct visualization of the ensemble mean empirical input output map detected by m4 fig 5 in this example such a graphical representation illustrates the relationship between the sole retained feature in each model the leading pca mode which as noted previously is an index of wintertime precipitation inputs and the sole target february may volume averaged across constituent models the relationship exhibits a shallower slope in dry years fig 5 this decrease in the first derivative of the input output map during drought conditions is a functional form that is known from both m4 testing and nrcs operational experience with current wsf models to be especially widespread in semi arid rivers like the gila and capturing it in a wsf model is needed to avoid negative valued predictions sometimes generated by linear models over the relevant state space blue dashed line in fig 5 see also section 4 1 this nonlinearity reflects several geophysical causes wet year flow is closely coupled with and therefore sensitive to variations in winter precipitation and snowpack giving a steeper curve in contrast during dry years a higher proportion of springtime snowmelt goes to refilling soil moisture and aquifer storage before producing a flow response in this desert river that is the phenomenon can be viewed as an approximate seasonal scale analogy to the well known nonlinearity of daily or hourly rainfall runoff relationships infiltration limits reached during storms reduce the mitigating impact of soil moisture storage and more directly couple surface runoff to rainfall fluctuations increasing surface runoff generation per unit precipitation whereas stable baseflow contributions from soil aquifer channel wetland and other natural storage mechanisms partly flatten the rainfall runoff relationship during dry spells additionally wet year runoff efficiency improves due to proportionately lower evapotranspiration losses reflecting cooler temperatures and greater cloud cover associated with wet conditions here giving a greater runoff increase per unit precipitation increase lukas and harding 2020 these factors may also dovetail with climate elasticity if flow volume dependence on precipitation inputs follows a power law for a given river its precipitation elasticity of runoff is fixed and equal to the power law exponent sankasubramanian et al 2001 though additional work would be required to formally tie the curve in fig 5 to climate elasticity preliminary power law fits to this input output relationship non parametrically estimated by m4 following simple linear rescaling to ensure positive valued pc1 scores implies an elasticity of roughly 2 r2 0 95 consistent with colorado basin elasticity estimates from standard methods e g vano et al 2012 that this nonlinearity is strongest in semi arid rivers also seems consistent with vano et al 2012 who found higher elasticities in drier basins all things considered it seems clear that nonlinear relationships between climate forcing and watershed response empirically detected by m4 are explainable in terms of known hydrological processes connect data driven wsf to broader concepts in watershed hydrology and climate science and suggest specific future research directions in physical hydrology collectively belying the conventional black box view of machine learning moreover with the foregoing interpretive tools and context in mind the forecast of near normal runoff issued operationally by m4 on february 1 2020 is easily diagnosed to form a relatable and compact storyline for clients from table 4 precipitation overall was somewhat above normal throughout the watershed that in turn increased soil moisture basin wide as well as snowpack at silver creek divide which among the snotel sites considered in this test case is the most northerly highest elevation on average highest swe and generally most informative given its selection by all six models for spring runoff prediction these factors pushed up the forecast however snowpack was very low in the south signal peak and east lookout mountain presumably reflecting temperature controlled variations in winter precipitation phase across this southwestern new mexico watershed pulling spring summer runoff projections back down to near normal additionally in part because of nonlinear relationships between wintertime weather and runoff volume fig 5 which occur because snowpack and precipitation are not the sole environmental processes affecting streamflow percentages of normal match only approximately between observed inputs and predicted flow our second example is the january 1 2020 operational forecast of 71 normal for april july 2020 deschutes river flow volume during m4 training candidate predictors for this operational test case were forecast date swe and water year to date precipitation at a few sites in the remote mountain headwaters of this mid columbia river tributary table 1 fig 1 and antecedent streamflow this is similar to the current wsf system section 2 use of antecedent streamflow reflects the large known impact of volcanic aquifers in generating and stabilizing deschutes river flows surface water groundwater interactions are unusually pronounced here leading to muted seasonality in flow and strong memory in streamflow time series table 1 e g o connor et al 2003 risley et al 2005 resulting popular votes see above and eigenvectors are given in table 5 the popular vote cast by the genetic algorithm across the six constituent m4 models favors irish taylor precipitation and in particular antecedent deschutes streamflow the only candidate variable retained by all models in this test case the genetic algorithm selected only the leading mode for half the models and both the leading and second modes for the remainder for models retaining only the leading mode qr rf and svm two of the five candidate predictors were selected accumulated precipitation at either three creeks meadow or irish taylor and antecedent flow the corresponding eigenvector weights were equal across the two predictors for a given model for models retaining both the leading and second pca modes lr mann mcqrnn the leading mode eigenvector predominantly weighted snow or precipitation whereas the second mode loading pattern predominantly weighted antecedent flow recall that pca mode order is determined by relative ability to explain variance in the input matrix not relative ability to explain variance in the target when those modes are used as predictive features in a supervised learner overall then various ga optimized models address the combination of two distinct forcing mechanisms wintertime hydroclimate and groundwater conditions in one of two ways qr rf and svm retain a single pca mode which aggregates the effects of both forcing mechanisms for lr mann and mcqrnn the leading pca mode gives a watershed scale index of seasonal climate to date as in other test cases e g foregoing gila river example whereas the second mode indexes groundwater contributions for all six constituent m4 models functional forms in this test case were approximately linear as expected based on hindcast testing and preliminary diagnostics see section 4 1 3 graphical representations cannot be compactly provided for the ensemble mean response as in fig 5 because different models retain different numbers of features for the deschutes but we can easily examine the input output maps for each of the six models individually a representative example is provided in fig 6 illustrating a nearly planar response surface extracted by one of the artificial neural networks mechanisms for the apparent absence of substantial nonlinearity here requires further study but comparisons of functional forms across several test cases from different hydroclimatic settings not shown here for conciseness strongly suggest that it reflects water abundance in some way a possible explanation is that the aforementioned plentiful aquifer contributions to streamflow plus heavy snowmelt and precipitation inputs to this very wet pacific northwest basin near the crest of the cascades range are such that basin water balance does not become sufficiently depleted even in drought years for the form of the input output mapping to change as a function of wetness as seen in the gila and other semi arid or arid basins where flow volumes can approach zero in dry years and the functional form must therefore level off at low flows as in fig 5 as for the gila river above with these interpretive tools and context in mind the january 1 2020 operational april july volume forecast for the deschutes river is easily diagnosed to form a relatable and compact storyline for clients very early winter january 1 swe and accumulated precipitation data are typically poor indicators of the total snowpack that will be eventually available for spring summer melt in the upper deschutes basin they therefore offer limited wsf skill at this january publication date and are collectively given less influence on the ensemble forecast by m4 in contrast the only candidate predictor retained in all six m4 methods is antecedent flow consistent with the unique hydrogeologic characteristics of the deschutes river stabilizing its flows and generating extensive time series memory that facilitates forecasting in an autoregressive model like fashion note that this relationship between catchment storage and streamflow memory and the resulting streamflow forecasting capability can also be explicitly tied to a finite difference approximation to the linear reservoir model of watershed hydrology for details see fleming 2007 and references therein the 74 normal value of antecedent flow with some additional support from the 71 normal value of swe at three creeks meadow for the mann model therefore brings up the ensemble mean predicted volume to 71 of normal despite dry wintertime conditions to january 1 2020 model structures optimized feature sets and associated hydroclimatic explanations varied significantly across test cases as would be expected given their geophysical diversity however it was found that straightforward physical interpretations of the models and of their operational forecasts in light of currently observed conditions were readily apparent in all cases in general these explanations were roughly similar to or simpler than those for the two operational test cases detailed above 4 3 mainstreaming ai in hydrology some implications of m4 operational viability much effort has been invested over recent decades in improving physics oriented process simulation models of river hydrology in theory these models have certain advantages over data driven volume prediction methods such as improved physical process diagnostics better suitability for nonstationary environments and ability to generate daily streamflow traces that are useful in some applications moreover the nominally black box nature of machine learning exacerbates relative even to classical statistical methods the shortcomings of data driven prediction frameworks relative to more explicitly physics oriented approaches given these considerations is ai a viable alternative at all for operational wsf the results of this study provide some insight into that question which is increasingly pressing as on the one hand water scarcity and the associated need for better hydrometeorological forecasts increase and on the other hand ai progressively permeates science and society in what has been termed the fourth paradigm of science hey et al 2009 and subsequently the fourth industrial revolution schwab 2017 it is useful to begin by identifying some general advantages of data driven models for operational wsf statistical volume modeling is a proven method that remains the backbone of most wsf systems in western north america often serving as either the sole prediction technology or as a complement to esps some organizations currently running statistical wsf models include nrcs california department of water resources colorado basin river forecast center bc hydro bureau of reclamation and army corps of engineers forecasts in the columbia basin british columbia river forecast centre and alberta environment reasons for continued interest in data driven models include intrinsically lower development and operation costs similar forecast skill greater amenability to new predictive data types like multiple climate indices operational simplicity and robustness and easier and more accurate estimates of forecast uncertainty relative to esps e g gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 hsieh et al 2003 grantz et al 2005 harpold et al 2016 regonda et al 2006a rosenberg et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 minxue et al 2016 mendoza et al 2017 robertson et al 2013 there is also accumulating evidence that certain carefully implemented machine learning algorithms can make accurate hydroclimatic predictions under conditions not sampled during a historical training period that is extrapolate successfully schnorbus and cannon 2014 shrestha et al 2017 kratzert et al 2019 facilitating their use in a changing climate for instance conversely some theoretical advantages of process based models over data driven approaches are incompletely realized in practice for instance diagnosing forecast failures in complex process models is not always straightforward and process simulation streamflow models sufficiently accurate for widespread operational use by the applied water resource community normally contain parameters requiring de facto statistical calibration to historical records potentially undermining applicability to nonstationary environments more fundamental considerations also motivate temporally coarse grained prediction techniques like data driven seasonal volume models temporal aggregation often simplifies the underlying statistical physics of any system and the optimal level of model detail and complexity required to describe and predict that system therefore depends on problem timescale specifically temporal data aggregation typically increases the signal to noise ratio of lower frequency geophysical processes and can at least partially linearize functional relationships and attenuate statistical complications like autocorrelation if the aggregation interval exceeds the decorrelation timescale and non gaussian distributions reflecting the central limit theorem for details around these general principles and some specific hydrology and climate examples see e g packard et al 1980 finney et al 1998 daw et al 2003 penland 1996 hsieh 2009 newman 2007 newman 2012 micovic and quick 2009 and fleming and barton 2015 hydrologic process simulation models usually contain strongly nonlinear serially correlated and non gaussian physics relevant to the hourly to daily timescales at which they typically operate this is obviously needed for short term flood forecasting but represents a multiple 2 to nearly 4 order of magnitude mismatch to the task of predicting on an annual basis accumulated spring summer flow volume a few months ahead based mainly on snowpack data most of the additional information generated by a process simulation model is therefore effectively discarded when outcomes are integrated to form the seasonal volume predictions that are the primary basis for western us water management despite these advantages and a quarter century of research applications of ai to hydrologic prediction that consistently demonstrate better accuracy than both process simulation and conventional statistical methods e g nearing et al 2021 ml has largely failed to penetrate operational hydrology in general and wsf in particular reasons were summarized in section 1 and primarily relate to lack of alignment of ai based hydrologic models with the specific practical needs of operational wsf including but not limited to geophysical explainability also as briefly summarized in sections 1 and 3 m4 was therefore designed to satisfy those specific practical criteria fleming and goodbody 2019 verifying whether m4 can actually accomplish that task in practice was a major goal of this study the retrospective and live operational testing conducted here demonstrate that these nrcs design criteria appear to have been met by m4 with broader potential implications for transitioning ai into operational systems relative to similarly configured conventional pcr based nrcs wsf models which as noted above have accuracies approximately typical of operational wsf systems in the western us including process based esp models section 3 3 4 the metasystem provides better forecast skill and more realistic prediction intervals is more robust and automated more consistently yields physically reasonable outcomes both integrates and is interpretable in terms of physical hydrologic process knowledge is applicable across strongly heterogeneous geophysical environments spanning the western us and alaska and functions well in a genuine operational setting though technically more complex than current generation statistically based operational wsf methods it requires fewer resources to implement and operate relative to many process simulation models considered collectively these testing results show that with careful and application specific design and implementation ai has capacity to bridge the gap from research to operations in a large operational wsf setting at a major service delivery organization given that water resource science engineering and management is ultimately a practical field and that viability in applied operational settings is therefore a key test for the overall relevance of hydrologic modeling technologies this demonstration establishes a positive general precedent and perhaps an implementation template for operational hydrologic applications of ml that said certain m4 characteristics may additionally suggest a path for combining process based and ai based models for both theoretical and practical reasons physics oriented process simulation hydrological models will continue playing a major role in operational wsf in the western us improvements to such physics oriented approaches may in turn prove valuable to improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of wsf related information generated for water managers and the general public the multi model ensemble philosophy underlying m4 may enable a means for integrating those advances with concurrent ml advances this is discussed in section 5 5 conclusions to summarize in a fundamental departure from legacy wsf systems and philosophies we investigated an otl approach based on a recently developed multi model ensemble prediction analytics engine m4 that incorporates automated and explainable ai in this study m4 was tested in both retrospective applications and live forecast operations for a relatively large and hydroclimatically diverse sample of test cases drawn from the current nrcs forecast system this testing suggests m4 meets the theoretical and practical needs that nrcs defined for its operational wsf environment including geophysical interpretability objectivity efficiency predictive performance robustness ease of implementation and use by an operational team and other key attributes ability to generate clear hydroclimatic storylines is particularly notable given the black box reputation of machine learning and the need for such geophysical explanations in operational wsf practice satisfying these criteria is in turn a required step in m4 adoption by nrcs as the basis for the next generation of the largest stand alone operational wsf system in the western us which to our knowledge will be the first successful migration of ai into a genuinely operational large scale river prediction system the result demonstrates that past roadblocks to operationalization of machine learning in hydrology can be overcome with careful and collaborative multi disciplinary design and in particular by a development philosophy that focuses on first identifying the practical operational needs of sdos and then working hand in hand with the operational community to develop suitably purpose specific machine learning solutions that meet those needs this may set a positive precedent for transitioning ai from research to practice in water resource science engineering and management going forward at least three general research and development directions are apparent the first is a production software environment to facilitate large scale operational deployment of m4 at nrcs by serving as a platform and interface for the prediction engine the prototype platform currently under development in collaboration with research partners is based on a modeling as a service maas construct implemented on a private cloud david et al 2014 functionalities span database linkages a graphical user interface multi user server based implementation amenable to distributed and remote computing straightforward prediction engine version updating and interactive capabilities around graphics mapping data pre processing and forecast distribution post processing second the combination of improved accuracy from nonlinear machine learning methods a robust process for applying these ai algorithms in a physics aware and operational wsf specific way dimensionality reduction and the flexibility of a modular ensemble framework may collectively engender faster and more widespread and successful integration of m4 with other methods and products than often feasible in current generation operational river prediction platforms for example numerical climate models offer some seasonal scale prediction skill but the results require somewhat elaborate downscaling procedures to use as input to hydrologic process simulation models and overall present operational process based and statistical hydrology models alike do not appear to be sufficiently accurate and generalizable to capitalize effectively on the additional information these climate models may provide gobena and gan 2010 yuan et al 2013 mendoza et al 2017 in contrast significant improvements in predictive capacity of the nonlinear ai metasystem relative to existing operational wsf technologies together with its data compression steps and a relatively high level of data agnosticism create a platform that should in principle be intrinsically more amenable to quickly and effectively leveraging emerging high dimensional operational wsf inputs these predictors include process based mountain snow e g isnobal hedrick et al 2019 and seasonal to subseasonal s2s climate e g cfsv2 saha et al 2014 model predictions and snow remote sensing e g modis tran et al 2019 and data assimilation e g aso painter et al 2016 products this in turn provides potential opportunities for further wsf skill improvements we are also collaborating with research partners to complement pca with a new form of non negative matrix factorization vesselinov et al 2019 to further improve physical interpretability of forecasts fleming et al 2021 and additional supervised learning systems may be integrated beyond the six used here third the multi threaded philosophy underlying this collection of semi independent forecast systems can be easily extended to ingest forecasts from outside sources into its ensemble including process simulation model based operational wsfs though rare precedent exists for fusing data driven and physics based hydrologic predictions into model agnostic ensembles najafi and moradkhani 2016 this creates opportunities to integrate m4 forecasts with for example esps from us geological survey prms process simulation models that nrcs operates at selected locations leavesley et al 2010 leverage innovations in physics based hydrologic prediction models being developed elsewhere e g wrf hydro and the noaa national water model cohen et al 2018 and reinstate formal multi agency forecast coordination between nrcs and national weather service river forecast centers that predominantly use esps pagano et al 2014 doing so could improve diversity within the multi model ensemble and capitalize on the advantages of both ai based and process based models see sections 3 2 5 4 1 2 and 4 3 wsfs from alternative statistical models operated by other sdos like the bureau of reclamation and california department of water resources could similarly be included where available note that while operation of several wsf models across several government agencies may appear inefficient the multiple governance goals and technical approaches associated with that diversity is known to provide long term adaptability robustness and much needed operational redundancy for western us water management see extensive reviews by doyle 2012 hrachowitz and clark 2017 the primary drawback for water managers is determining how in practice to use these multiple sometimes partially conflicting sources of wsf information blending multiple hydrologic modeling paradigms into the multi model framework as suggested above would provide a mechanism for addressing this current practices gap combined with aforementioned likely improvements in ability to use emerging predictor sources this implies the metasystem has potential to grow into a rigorous and nimble integration platform for bringing together multiple data sources and prediction modeling technologies in turn helping promote more accurate robust and

4251,western us water management is underpinned by spring summer water supply forecasts wsfs from hydrologic models forced primarily by winter mountain snowpack data the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service nrcs operates the largest such system regionally nrcs recently developed a next generation wsf prototype the multi model machine learning metasystem m4 here we test this ensemble artificial intelligence ai based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational wsf model in 20 hindcasting test cases spanning diverse environments across the western us and alaska on average out of sample r2 and rpss improved over 50 and rmse improved 13 relative to current benchmarks the m4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes belying the black box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients this was accomplished using wsf focused pragmatic solutions like popular votes for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems and graphical visualization of reduced dimension ai extracted nonlinear feature target relationships we also found that certain m4 technical design elements including autonomous machine learning automl hyperparameter pre calibration and theory guided data science collectively permitted automated over the loop training and operation overall the analyses confirmed m4 meets requirements for nrcs operational adoption this finding signals that despite negligible operational community uptake of machine learning so far suitably purpose designed novel ai systems have capacity to transition into large scale practical applications with service delivery organizations it appears m4 will be the largest ai migration into operational river forecasting to date it may ultimately provide a broader integration platform for harnessing multiple data and model types keywords water supply forecasting operational hydrology explainable machine learning hydrologic modeling water

and negotiation of forward contracts for hydropower among other economic planning choices wsfs can have good skill despite poor weather forecast accuracy over the same seasonal scale prediction horizons because of large lags between the overall annual cycles of meteorological forcing and watershed response in western north america for most rivers here flows peak in spring and summer coinciding with peak water demand and are driven mainly by melting of mountain snowpack accumulated the previous winter in wsf practice snowpack is measured and provided as a primary input to river hydrology models implemented and operated on a subbasin by subbasin basis these models fall into two categories process simulation models that explicitly represent the underlying physics of watershed scale runoff generation and data driven phenomenological models that account for the physics implicitly using empirical input output mappings of predictors to predictands a wide variety of specific models fall under these broad umbrellas each with advantages and disadvantages singh and woolhiser 2002 perkins et al 2009 gelfan and motovilov 2009 bourdin et al 2012 weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 hrachowitz and clark 2017 fleming and gupta 2020 even incremental improvements in wsf skill can provide well over 100 million per year in additional public benefit for a single river in the western us yao and georgakakos 2001 hamlet et al 2002 wsf improvements are also critically needed due to narrowing margins between increasing water demand under growing populations and decreasing manageable water supply under climate change which is reducing snowpack through warmer winter temperatures e g barnett et al 2005 clarke et al 2015 bor 2016 this climate change induced decline in the hydrologic role of snowpack in western us watersheds also reduces the inherent seasonal predictability of river runoff harrison and bales 2016 harpold et al 2020 the implications of these skill losses are reminiscent of biology s red queen hypothesis which posits that evolutionary progress is required of a species to simply maintain its status relative to competitors in effect geophysical modelers are competing against climate change which by decreasing predictability of seasonal runoff forces continual forecasting innovation to maintain constant skill it follows that skill improvements require even more aggressive advances indeed increased water management flexibility is a leading goal in the bureau of reclamation s us west wide climate change adaptation strategy with improved hydrometeorological forecasting as a central element bor 2016 collectively these considerations have led to intense ongoing interest in improving wsf models in western north america related research directions are diverse some examples include garen 1998 mahabir et al 2003 hsieh et al 2003 mcguire et al 2006 wood and lettenmaier 2006 kennedy et al 2009 gobena and gan 2009 gobena and gan 2010 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 robertson et al 2013 fleming and dahlke 2014 demargne et al 2014 pagano et al 2009 pagano et al 2004 trubilowicz et al 2015 harpold et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2016 beckers et al 2016 mendoza et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 and peñuela et al 2020 1 2 nrcs water supply forecasting the next generation model and machine learning the us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service nrcs has been monitoring snowpack and predicting runoff in the western us since the dust bowl of the 1930s perkins et al 2009 it operates the snotel mountain climate and snow monitoring network with over 850 sites across the region additionally its current operational wsf platform is the largest stand alone system regionally and to our knowledge the largest data driven system globally with over 600 forecast locations in the colorado missouri columbia rio grande klamath and other basins fig 1 nrcs uses several wsf models the primary method is a probabilistic form of principal component regression pcr implemented in the nrcs viper software platform it was adapted to wsf by nrcs to facilitate linear regression under predictor multicollinearity garen 1992 james et al 2013 pcr has since been widely adopted for operational wsf and as a wsf modeling tool in hydrology snow and climate research e g moradkhani and meier 2010 oubeidillah et al 2011 hsieh et al 2003 najafi and moradkhani 2016 eldaw et al 2003 rosenberg et al 2011 gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 regonda et al 2006a regonda et al 2006b kennedy et al 2009 harpold et al 2016 lehner et al 2017 perkins et al 2009 beckers et al 2016 fleming and goodbody 2019 glabau et al 2020 though successful the technique is decades old has known technical issues and required revisiting for potential upgrades or replacement a particular point of interest was potential adoption of machine learning ml a branch of artificial intelligence ai here we use ml and ai interchangeably for convenience involving algorithms that detect patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions however developing an ai based next generation nrcs wsf model involved overcoming long standing roadblocks to transitioning ml from research into a genuine operational river forecasting environment ai was applied to streamflow prediction over 25 years ago hsu et al 1995 minns and hall 1996 despite ongoing research demonstrating forecast skill improvements over statistical and process based hydrologic models migration to operational river hydrology has been limited with no openly documented adoption of ai by operational wsf systems in the western us reasons include its black box character and resulting lack of geophysical explainability lack of emphasis on generating prediction uncertainty estimates and concerns about overtraining abrahart et al 2012 fleming et al 2015 underlying these specific issues there may be two broader questions one is fundamental some have recently argued that the ongoing evolution of machine learning has yielded substantially new and superior approaches to physically understanding hydrological systems which the hydrologic community as a whole has not yet acknowledged or adjusted to nearing et al 2021 the other is practical in particular it has been the collective qualitative observation of the authors working with both ai and operational river forecasting over several decades that these two communities of practice are largely disconnected operational hydrologists typically have little familiarity with ai and often feel uncomfortable with it whereas researchers specializing in ml applications to hydrology often focus on exploring the latest ai innovations rather than meeting the needs of operational hydrologists the approach taken therefore was to determine a holistic set of characteristics required of a next generation wsf model and work hand in hand with the operational community to craft an integrative solution meeting those specific requirements several well proven techniques from ai statistical modeling evolutionary computing ensemble modeling and other areas were selected and combined to form this novel hybrid approach fleming and goodbody 2019 termed the multi model machine learning metasystem m4 1 3 study goals in this study we apply m4 and evaluate its performance characteristics and suitability for widespread operational implementation despite technical vetting in the data science literature and initial demonstrations of hydrologic applicability fleming and goodbody 2019 wsf testing of m4 so far has been too limited to justify broad operational adoption yet any next generation nrcs operational wsf method must demonstrate applicability and performance advantages relative to existing operational systems over the wide range of geophysical environments encountered across the nrcs wsf system which spans the deserts of new mexico to the icefields of alaska and the associated diversity of statistical problem characteristics data availability and other practical factors further a telling and necessary test of any prototype prediction system is to run it live in the same operational environment it is ultimately intended to serve in given the aforementioned lack of uptake of ml by the operational community such operational testing may also speak more widely if indirectly to overall suitability of ai for routine mainstream large scale river forecasting and in particular whether the design philosophy and technical solutions used in developing m4 are effective at bridging that research applications gap to address these questions about the practical capabilities of m4 we performed two sets of testing first hindcasting was completed for 20 test cases spanning 11 locations sampling diverse hydroclimatic settings second live operational testing was performed for a subset of 5 of these locations during the 2020 forecast season though accuracy improvements are vital acceptance by operational forecast hydrologists additionally requires assessment of a broader set of performance characteristics e g weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 whateley et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 peñuela et al 2020 fleming et al 2021 other questions evaluated include effectiveness of efforts to build high levels of robustness flexibility and automation into the new approach logistical feasibility of associated workflows and computations in a time and resource constrained setting typical of agencies that run such forecast systems operationally consistency of performance capabilities across a variety of watershed characteristics without the need for manual case by case local scale fine tuning of modeling procedures and physical plausibility of outcomes including both generation of physically reasonable predictions and amenability of the resulting forecasts to interpretation in terms of current seasonal climatic conditions and known hydrologic processes the influence these additional considerations have on which technologies are adopted into operational systems should not be underestimated nor is it unique to nrcs forecast software platforms at operational agencies have been recently developed or updated like viper at nrcs see above the hydrological ensemble forecast system hefs at national weather service river forecast centers and pyforecast at the bureau of reclamation e g demargne et al 2014 perkins et al 2009 https github com usbr pyforecast nevertheless fundamental geophysical modeling concepts fleming and gupta 2020 underlying these platforms have not seen major upgrades in decades hartmann et al 2002 pagano et al 2004 hefs uses the 1970s era sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma and snow 17 process models and while the modular pyforecast platform has flexibility to easily incorporate innovative modeling techniques both viper and current development versions of pyforecast largely focus on 1990s era pcr and other linear regression variants moreover model implementation and operation generally remain reliant on an archaic style of subjective manual hydrologist intervention research implementing a so called over the loop otl paradigm using automated and objective processes has not in general successfully migrated to large scale mainstream river forecast systems in the region seo et al 2003 wood et al 2020 persistent use of seemingly outdated but proven methods which has been interpreted by some as technical stagnation e g hartmann et al 2002 has occurred largely because new methods whether physics based or data driven have often failed to match key needs of the operational hydrology community for detailed discussions see e g weber et al 2012 cunderlik et al 2013 whateley et al 2015 fleming and goodbody 2019 peñuela et al 2020 as one example benefits provided by ai are significant but accompanied by drawbacks restricting operationalization see section 1 2 the m4 approach and the pragmatic testing regimen for it presented here are intended to address these roadblocks to migrating otl and ai based methods into operational wsf accordingly evaluations are completed here within the context of the existing nrcs wsf system as described in detail below doing so leverages experiential knowledge and established best practices around operational wsf in the us west and enables meaningful comparisons to current operational techniques 1 4 manuscript organization the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the established overall framework for data driven operational wsf models in western north america which as noted above we adopt here to ensure apples to apples comparisons of m4 against current methods it then presents specific test cases and datasets considered section 3 provides a brief qualitative summary of m4 focusing on linkages to operational forecast community needs this short synopsis is not intended to be comprehensive and readers are referred to fleming and goodbody 2019 for detailed technical descriptions of m4 section 4 summarizes the results of hindcast and live operational testing this includes discussion of performance metrics with comparisons to the existing system geophysical interpretability of results and other topics broader implications to acceptance of ai in operational hydrology are also briefly discussed finally section 5 concludes with a summary and outlines research and operationalization plans note that to our knowledge after full roll out into production systems at nrcs m4 will be the largest migration of ai into a genuine operational river forecast environment to date 2 data 2 1 standard wsf problem structure to evaluate m4 in a realistic operational wsf context we set up the overall prediction problem in a manner closely resembling the existing nrcs forecast system which is in turn broadly similar to most other statistically based operational wsf models in western north america the predictand target in ml nomenclature is spring summer runoff volume which is measured at a us geological survey streamgage with nrcs adjustments as needed for upstream diversions or at some other hydrometric monitoring site predictors consist of snow water equivalent swe and wintertime to date accumulated precipitation measurements at mountain climate monitoring stations predominantly nrcs snotel or similar sites various other datasets like antecedent streamflow are sometimes used as supplemental predictors note that wsf research has extensively tested additional data types like remotely sensed swe gridded precipitation datasets seasonal scale numerical climate model forecasts and other products but so far these experimental predictors have experienced limited uptake into operational wsf systems in the western us to illustrate a typical statistically based wsf model might predict on march 1 the upcoming april 1 july 31 cumulative flow volume at a given point on a given river using as predictors march 1 swe and october 1 february 28 total precipitation measured at snotel sites within or near the watershed boundary upstream of the streamgage the number of such sites varies widely depending on the basin but about a half dozen to two dozen is roughly typical as part of the modeling process the input datasets are usually amalgamated in some way into an index that serves as the regression predictor or in the ml nomenclature a feature that is presented to the supervised learning algorithm 2 2 test cases hindcast testing considered 20 test cases corresponding to january 1 and april 1 forecast dates at 11 existing nrcs forecast locations fig 1 these locations span diverse geophysical environments including a glacier fed alaskan river several southwestern desert rivers a watershed with large volcanic aquifer contributions to flow a comparatively winter rain dominated pacific northwest basin a sierra nevada snowpack fed endorheic california nevada watershed missouri sub basins in both the northern and southern rocky mountains colorado river and rio grande headwaters and so forth see table 1 for summaries these test cases also sample diverse statistical characteristics like nonlinear functional forms and heteroscedastic and non normally distributed errors e g owyhee river linear stationary gaussian behaviors e g yellowstone river and multiple predictive inputs corresponding to both wintertime hydroclimate and complex internal watershed dynamics e g deschutes river in addition live operational testing was undertaken during the 2020 forecast season for a subset of 5 of these locations gila deschutes yellowstone owyhee and truckee rivers trained at multiple consecutive forecast issue dates january 1 february 1 march 1 and april 1 this forms a total of 20 live operational test cases that partially overlap with the 20 hindcasting test cases as noted in section 2 1 to facilitate meaningful comparisons against current systems the method was implemented in a fashion including dataset selection similar to existing statistical operational wsf models for each test case spring summer runoff volume over the river s established primary management period usually april july was the target a candidate pool of input variables was assembled to serve as the basis for feature extraction for each test case specific variables were closely consistent with existing operational nrcs models for the same combination of location issue date and target period forecast horizon and include year to date precipitation and current snow water equivalent swe at the forecast date at nrcs snotel or related e g california cooperative snow survey program mountain climate monitoring sites and for certain basins antecedent streamflow we did not capitalize here on emerging alternative predictor types like remotely sensed or climate modeling products although the method is designed in part with those predictors in mind as discussed below the result therefore reflects a minimum estimate of potential advantages of the method again following typical procedure for statistically based operational wsf in the western us we used data over a standard 30 year hydroclimatic normal period 1986 2015 this choice usually reflects a pragmatic attempt to balance longer datasets for better training and testing vs record length limitations that could restrict the number of sites for which models can be developed a common secondary motivation is to help mitigate impacts from various climatic and land cover nonstationarties on model development by restricting the record length used to a recent period which is reasonably representative of current conditions and over which the cumulative impacts of nonstationarities can be reasonably presumed at most forecast locations to be sufficiently limited for developing and testing a seasonal scale prediction model 3 method 3 1 general as noted in section 1 this study uses the recently developed m4 prediction analytics engine mathematical and computational details of m4 are too lengthy to be repeated here in the interest of conciseness readers are referred to fleming and goodbody 2019 instead section 3 2 provides a brief qualitative synopsis of the model focusing on summarizing how specific operational wsf needs were identified and what design steps were taken in an effort to meet those requirements section 3 3 then describes application of this method to the test cases outlined in section 2 3 2 summary of m4 prediction engine 3 2 1 design process concept and criteria preparatory steps during initial m4 development included a thorough inventory and assessment of needs and options before undertaking detailed technical design the process began with documenting the existing nrcs system which like many operational wsf systems has evolved organically over the decades its capabilities and limitations were then assessed including documentation of known issues discovered during forecast operations over the years and completion of extensive statistical diagnostics progress in data driven wsf was reviewed with an eye to identifying the most promising potential directions for a next generation nrcs model implications of global anthropogenic climate change on requirements for wsf were additionally considered finally an initial blueprint and preliminary scoping models were developed to test potential ideas the overall conclusions were that a new wsf model was warranted that ai was the best solution pathway for nrcs and that for ai to be effective and useful in a practical operational hydrology context it must be deployed in a highly application specific way similar conclusions have been reached in other fields e g meredig 2018 the resulting design concept was framed as a convergence of detailed hydrologic process knowledge a mature understanding of potentially applicable machine learning concepts and tools and practical operational water management requirements fig 2 top this led in turn to identification of 9 specific design criteria table 2 several existing techniques met some of these criteria but none adequately satisfied all a hybrid approach was therefore developed fleming and goodbody 2019 specifically to meet these design requirements fig 2 bottom see section 3 2 2 3 2 2 overview fig 2 sketches the main elements of m4 in summary the metasystem consists of six semi independent forecast systems each centered around a different supervised learning algorithm a pool of candidate input predictor variables is defined by the hydrologist for a given forecast problem combination of forecast location issue date and target period similar to current generation statistical wsf models in western north america section 2 principal component analysis pca an unsupervised statistical learning technique is used for pattern recognition in the input data matrix and the extracted features are directed to the supervised learning models supervised learners include two substantially different kinds of neural network a monotone artificial neural network mann and a monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn linear regression lr quantile regression with adjustments to ensure non crossing quantiles qr random forests rf and a support vector machine svm more specifically support vector regression a genetic algorithm ga optimizes feature extraction and selection separately for each forecast system that is which of the input predictor variables in the candidate pool and corresponding pca modes to retain the ga objective function uses a penalty to ensure that multiple predictors are retained which is operationally important for functional redundancy in the event of sensor failures or other technical issues the result of each semi independent system is a forecast distribution i e a probability density function for future seasonal flow volume in standard operational wsf practice in the western us this uncertainty information is presented as prediction intervals corresponding to 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 quantile respectively 90 70 30 and 10 exceedance probability flow volumes m4 generates these intervals using either intrinsic probability models for the two quantile regression techniques mcqrnn and qr or a box cox transform space based heuristic for the other models both are nonparametric methods that accommodate heteroscedastic and non gaussian error distributions results are averaged across the models to form an ensemble mean best estimate with prediction intervals algorithmic logic is introduced at various points to automate various processes including but not limited to hyperparameter optimization or to ensure certain conditions are met by the solution like an ensemble pruning algorithm contributing to strictly nonnegative predictions fleming and goodbody 2019 provide important methodological details around regularization essentially overtraining mitigation hyperparameter selection and tuning pre calibration and optimization of high level machine learning parameters prediction interval generation optimal feature extraction further information on each of the constituent statistical and machine learning models and how they are implemented within m4 and other key m4 technical elements in the interest of conciseness readers are referred there for complete descriptions of the data science underlying the m4 prediction analytics engine assessed in this study that said we briefly elaborate below on two aspects that warrant particular attention from a more general operational hydrologic modeling perspective explainable ai and autonomous machine learning these two concepts and the pragmatic approaches used to achieve or at least adequately approximate them for our purposes are summarized in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 respectively additionally all the methods used to collectively form m4 were specifically chosen to help satisfy particular requirements outlined in table 2 some related points around technique selection are briefly summarized in section 3 2 5 3 2 3 geophysical consistency and explainability we borrow the term physics aware ai from materials science meredig 2018 it is a broad but useful term that refers to general intersections between ml applications and the underlying process physics or qualitative domain specific knowledge more broadly of the problem to which ml is applied it is a holistic concept primarily focusing on making ai useful to mainstream science and engineering users through such mechanisms as explainable machine learning theory guided data science and a general alignment of machine learning solutions with existing bodies of physical knowledge of the system being modeled and associated practical considerations like the inherent data sparseness of certain fields many specific technical approaches fall under this rubric moreover given the centrality of explainable machine learning to the future of ai it is an extremely dynamic computer science research topic in which new paradigms emerge on a regular basis though many of these are far from ready for use in high stakes operational river forecasting systems at sdos we adopted a comparatively straightforward strongly pragmatic and wsf focused approach that concentrates on balancing two m4 design criteria generating forecasts that are physically reasonable and explainable criterion 6 in table 2 while using well proven ml algorithms criterion 7 three general steps were taken 1 automation notwithstanding features engineering in m4 remains hydrologist directed through input candidate pool selection and decisions around the maximum number of pca modes the genetic algorithm is permitted to retain these choices reflect end user knowledge around representativeness reliability quirks and capabilities of potential input variables or measurement sites and geophysical interpretations of pca modes which in practice are known to usually correspond to watershed scale indices of hydroclimatic forcing or aquifer stream interactions e g garen 1992 fleming and goodbody 2019 see also section 4 it is a key location in the ai development process for domain experts to insert physical hydrologic knowledge that a hydrologist should select candidate predictors may seem obvious to water resource scientists and engineers but runs contrary to some contemporary ai directions like certain data mining and big data applications 2 wsf was reframed as a low dimensional problem with a parsimonious solution this is not in itself physics aware ai however pca input pre processing and compact ml architectures enable direct graphical visualization of input output relationships in most cases revealing relationships the ai discovered and facilitating their geophysical interpretation criterion 9 therefore supports criterion 6 3 monotonicity and nonnegativity constraints are imposed at various locations within m4 this includes selection of specific machine learning methods allowing nonnegativity mcqrnn and monotonicity mann mcqrnn constraints inclusion of nonlinear supervised learners into the multi model ensemble that can track nonlinear relationships and thus further contribute to avoidance of negative valued predictions mann mcqrnn rf svm see section 4 for an example of such nonlinearities and how m4 captures and communicates them conversely inclusion of linear supervised learners as a small subset of the multi model ensemble to further contribute to monotonicity of the final ensemble solution qr lr careful and application specific regularization related hyperparameter pre calibration steps see also section 3 2 4 that enable but place limits on nonlinearity and a final ensemble pruning algorithm to further enforce non negativity as mentioned above see also fig 2 these functional characteristics of monotonicity and nonnegativity correspond to known aspects of hydroclimatic relationships for example that runoff volume cannot be negative valued or that a heavy snowpack does not all else held equal lead to low flow volume again for details see fleming and goodbody 2019 most of these steps constitute theory guided ai that is a priori alignment of ai algorithms with known geophysical processes see karpatne et al 2017 doing so in turn encourages geophysical explainability examples are discussed in section 4 additional regularization is an added benefit as theory guided a priori constraints limit the solution space available to the machine learning algorithm and therefore reduce fitting to noise e g karpatne et al 2017 zhang and zhang 1999 more broadly these elements of the m4 metasystem may intersect with another high level evolutionary trajectory in machine learning the transition from first wave handcrafted knowledge to second wave statistical learning to now emerging third wave contextual learning ai for a synopsis see launchberry 2021 kratzert et al 2018 and fleming and goodbody 2019 might be considered early attempts at integrating third wave ai philosophies and capabilities into hydrologic prediction but approach this challenge differently kratzert et al 2018 explore potential abilities of particular deep learning architectures to capture and reveal certain hydrologic processes with minimal or no application of a priori geophysical knowledge that is early experiments suggest this approach can learn some geophysical context without significant a priori guidance m4 instead moves more incrementally toward third wave approaches by leveraging second wave and certain aspects of still relevant launchberry 2021 first wave ai approaches to achieve specific operational goals in practical water resource science that necessarily include the application of machine learning within a predefined but broad geophysically relevant solution space which is then refined by m4 on a case by case basis that is it learns within a broad set of theory guided constraints monotonicity nonnegativity etc and capabilities subject matter expert guided features engineering genetic algorithm based feature selection etc that reflect overall geophysical context of the general problem class western north american wsf and in doing so it refines that geophysical context through the hydroclimatically interpretable solutions it learns and communicates for each river see section 4 2 2 for examples 3 2 4 automl and pre calibration improved automation criterion 2 of table 2 was achieved by judicious and application specific use of autonomous machine learning automl in the data science nomenclature e g thornton et al 2013 guyon et al 2015 and pre calibration algorithms were developed to automate most optimization and decision points including setting ml hyperparameters one example is automated determination of optimal ann hidden layer size on the basis of cross validated goodness of fit and information theoretic metrics fleming and goodbody 2019 in other cases hyperparameters were set to robust default pre calibrated values based on extensive experimentation section 3 2 1 using a subset of wsf test cases one example was completing during initial prototype testing hundreds of m4 training runs to locate generally usable defaults for the population size and number of generations in the genetic algorithm and defining a user protocol for diverging from those defaults if desired in general this operational wsf specific combination of automl algorithms and default hyperparameters involved establishing reasonable trade offs for instance increasing the population size and the number of generations in the genetic algorithm improves out of sample prediction skill but the relationship is nonlinear and quickly reaches a point of diminishing returns balancing this observation against minimization of run times helped set default values similarly in creating automl algorithms to automate optimal ann topology selection the better up to a point pattern recognition capabilities enabled by additional hidden layer neurons were balanced against associated training complications like longer run times and greater susceptibility to both overtraining and conversely trapping in local minima in the nonlinear neural network cost function e g hsieh 2009 automl is additionally facilitated in m4 by selecting methods that match the statistical and physical requirements of western us wsf i e criterion 4 supports criterion 2 table 2 specifically nonlinear ai techniques heteroscedastic and non gaussian prediction intervals and enforcement of non negativity constraints reduce the amount of manual hydrologist intervention in the form of selecting and applying predictand transforms for instance required to develop and operate wsf models sections 1 3 and 3 2 see also examples in section 4 3 2 5 some relationships to other ai philosophies as noted above the goal of m4 is to fuse existing methods into a hybrid that meets the specific design criteria we defined for a next generation ai based us west wide operational wsf model at nrcs this practical applications focused design philosophy is not generally typical of ai research in water resource science and engineering see again section 1 and to help illustrate how it motivates certain methodological choices in m4 development it is helpful to consider a few examples one example is how design criterion 8 was approached model equifinality and using multi model ensembles to address it are well established hydrologic concepts but are usually reserved for process simulation models e g beven and binley 1992 bourdin et al 2014 similar concepts have emerged independently in the statistical and ai communities but usually involve ensembles of nearly identical models such as committees formed from bootstrap aggregated bagged neural networks e g breiman 1996 breiman 2001 wolpert 1996 burnham and anderson 2002 in contrast strong methodological diversity within a multi model ensemble is desirable reducing error correlation across constituent models and increasing noise suppression within the ensemble e g monteleoni et al 2011 a complementary concept is that at a geophysical level we might expect certain models to work better in certain environments yet the final wsf system must function well across a wide range of hydroclimatic settings and terrestrial hydrologic processes sections 1 and 2 this implies that model diversity within the multi model ensemble might improve consistency of prediction accuracy across the nrcs system insofar as poor performance of one or more of the models in some particular location may be compensated by good performance of other models in the ensemble and vice versa at other locations this is intimately related to the underlying reasons why multi model ensembles are effective in geophysical modeling for details see hagedorn et al 2005 we therefore chose several fundamentally different supervised ai methods to include in the multi model ensemble fig 2 for instance anns imitate the brain s biological network of neurons and synapses rfs reflect the decision tree framework of human choice and svms are abstract hyperdimensional mathematical constructs as a corollary m4 constitutes a super ensemble with respect to some of its constituent ai methods that are in turn ensemble learners i e random forests and bagged neural networks as another example that a method is not currently chosen for m4 does not imply we are critical of it only that it is not presently judged to adequately satisfy the multi faceted and operations oriented design criteria table 2 or other basic fitness for purpose see e g cunderlik et al 2013 considerations in nrcs wsf consider for instance deep learning sequential online learning and transfer learning these three branches of ai show substantial promise in hydrologic testing e g lima et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 however to our knowledge none has experienced even initial wsf testing failing criterion 7 at this time additionally deep learning is often computationally expensive to the point of imposing restrictive hardware requirements potentially failing criterion 3 and while deep learning appears to offer strong knowledge discovery capabilities in some geoscientific applications e g reichstein et al 2019 nearing et al 2021 it remains unclear whether deep learning architectures which by definition are complex are amenable to fast and easy geophysical interpretation of the type needed in our operational forecasting application potentially failing criterion 6 see also section 4 2 2 transfer learning is potentially advantageous to building models for many forecast sites and dates but m4 can be trained rapidly due to automl pre calibration section 3 2 4 and some simple parallelization across processor cores on a standard personal computer see above and fleming and goodbody 2019 further hydrologic experimentation so far with these three classes of ai has largely focused on hourly or daily flood prediction which has different requirements from seasonal volume forecasting for instance deep learning was developed largely for big data whereas standard operational wsf problems generally involve modestly sized datasets see section 2 that may not effectively capitalize on or even be adequate for deep learning similarly online sequential learning has advantages in cases of rapid new data acquisition but in wsf only one new sample appears per year section 2 by the same token however ai and its hydrologic applications are fast evolving fields encompassing many existing and emerging techniques this rapid development pace motivates design criterion 5 a modular expandable structure that facilitates integrating new ai methods into m4 table 2 3 3 application to test cases 3 3 1 retrospective analysis hindcast testing was performed for each of the 20 test cases described in section 2 five metrics described immediately below were used to measure hindcast performance several additional more qualitative evaluation criteria were also considered as discussed in section 3 3 3 root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 quantify deterministic prediction accuracy rmse provides an intuitive sense of typical predictive error and is closely related to regression standard error and r2 gives the proportion of target variance explained by the model we also consider the ranked probability skill score rpss a measure of the probabilistic skill of the model framed in terms of its ability relative to a naïve climatology forecast to predict the probability of dry normal or wet years as defined by terciles of the observed flow volumes e g wiegel et al 2007 guihan 2014 fleming and goodbody 2019 rmse r2 and rpss were assessed using cross validated predictions calculated by the general method of garen 1992 which is widely used for wsf applications of pcr in the western us except for rpss in the case of the two quantile regression methods which was estimated using their intrinsic probability models see also e g pagano et al 2004 rosenberg et al 2011 lehner et al 2017 fleming and goodbody 2019 these conventional accuracy metrics do not penalize the negative valued and therefore non physical predictions made by standard statistical models in some cases see criterion 4 in table 2 examples are provided in section 4 or reward the physical acceptability of predictions made by m4 a more comprehensive portrayal of model performance is therefore provided by additionally tracking binary metrics that flag whether or not the model predicted best estimates and the lowest of the associated prediction intervals considered in standard wsf applications section 3 2 2 meet the physicality requirement of being nonnegative for all available sample times 3 3 2 live operations live operational testing was undertaken during the 2020 forecast season for a subset of five locations at multiple forecast issue dates section 2 for the 1 february and 1 march forecast dates predictor candidate pools were similar to those used in hindcasting for the 1 january and 1 april operational forecasts the same models were used as in hindcasting see section 2 operational testing was completed alongside but separately from the existing pcr based nrcs forecast system the primary goals of the live testing were to confirm compliance of m4 with two core requirements of an operational wsf system related workflows must be logistically feasible in a time and resource constrained operational environment and any given forecast must be readily and succinctly explainable in terms of known geophysical processes and current climatic conditions 3 3 3 evaluation criteria the evaluation criteria approximately reflect the practical design criteria outlined in section 3 2 and table 2 for hindcast testing assessment included the five quantitative metrics described in section 3 3 1 and in particular relative performance improvements for these metrics compared to the linear pcr benchmark of the existing nrcs system see section 3 3 4 below additionally robustness ease of use and automation potential were qualitatively assessed during both hindcast and operational testing this included ability to train and operate m4 model suites across a diverse set of test cases quickly with no manual tuning we also assessed amenability of the resulting forecasts to interpretation focusing on live operational tests and ability to infer a relatable storyline around the current forecast this is a requirement for achieving user and client buy in for an operational wsf system but is conventionally regarded as a challenge for ml section 1 3 3 4 benchmark current nrcs operational pcr models as developed and implemented in the viper operational forecasting software platform garen 1992 perkins et al 2009 see also sections 1 2 and 1 3 for the test cases section 2 provide a challenging and broadly relevant performance benchmark for m4 pcr models are the basis of nrcs and other operational wsf systems represent a general reference point as a standard linear gaussian statistical regression approach and are widely used in hydroclimatic research section 1 2 using pcr based wsfs as a point of comparison for m4 is further reinforced by studies suggesting relative to extended streamflow prediction esp based process simulation models currently in western north american operational use similar accuracy as well as better prediction uncertainty intervals due to under dispersion common in the ensemble spreads of most operational esp systems e g gobena and gan 2010 harpold et al 2020 prediction intervals for the benchmark model are generated using a heuristic typical of current operational pcr based wsf including nrcs systems and widely employed in other regression applications that is error is assumed to follow a stationary normal distribution centered at the best estimate prediction with a standard deviation equal to the regression standard error e g garen 1992 hyndman and athanasopoulos 2013 benchmark model performance was tracked using the same criteria and procedures described in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 retrospective testing 4 1 1 an introductory example the owyhee river preliminary comparison of outcomes for the owyhee river april 1 publication date fig 1 see section 2 2 against conventional pcr techniques provides a sense of the practical benefits of m4 and a useful starting point for more detailed examination of test case results note that this river is known from operational nrcs experience to be one of the more challenging forecast points in the western us for reasons that will become apparent below and is therefore an instructive litmus test fig 3 a gives hindcast predictions from conventional pcr as used by nrcs and others for several samples the best estimate runoff predictions are negative valued and therefore physically impossible additionally it does not generate required time varying and asymmetric prediction bounds which are obviously too wide in low flow years and too narrow in high flow years further contributing to negative valued prediction intervals these issues are routinely addressed successfully in pcr based wsf using predictand transforms a common approach to applying classical statistical models to nonlinear non stationary and non gaussian prediction problems however such procedures require manual user intervention to determine whether a transform is needed and if so which one this is a slow non otl procedure sections 1 and 3 depends on expert opinion undermining objectivity reproducibility and defensibility and does not separate distributional modifications from functional form modifications see fleming and goodbody 2019 moreover in operational practice at a few locations multiple models are maintained in the current nrcs system such as a non transformed primary model giving the best overall performance and a transformed model used on an as needed basis to avoid negative valued predictions during dry years or other complications if done well cf wood et al 2020 vs weber et al 2012 these subjective ad hoc time consuming model development and selection choices can improve the accuracy and flexibility of traditional linear models but are even further removed from an ideal otl workflow in contrast fig 3 b shows m4 generates strictly non negative best estimate forecasts and associated prediction intervals the prediction bounds can when needed vary in width from year to year and be asymmetric about the best estimate no user input or intervention was required apart from specifying the input variable candidate pool m4 additionally gives better forecast skill than linear pcr as discussed in subsequent sections 4 1 2 performance within multi model ensemble the benefit of extending multi model ensembles to a diverse set of supervised machine learning methods for wsf section 3 2 5 see also fleming and goodbody 2019 is confirmed by comparative results on test sites across the western us table 3 equifinality is pervasive as commonly seen for hydrologic and other models beven and binley 1992 wolpert 1996 burnham and anderson 2002 hagedorn et al 2005 relative to other techniques within the metasystem a certain individual modeling method may for a given test case perform best on one metric but worst on another or for a given forecast date perform best at one location but not at others or for a given location perform well for one forecast date but not for others table 3 multi model ensembles provide an established means for addressing such model selection uncertainty and give tangible performance improvements table 3 the ensemble mean forecast distribution frequently one or more performance metrics in each of nine test cases beats the performance of any of its constituent ensemble members through mutual error cancellation a known advantage of ensemble modeling perhaps more importantly metasystem mean performance almost without exception beats matches or is second best to all of its constituent systems this is far more consistent performance across performance metrics locations and forecast dates than any of the six individual modeling techniques within the metasystem such consistency is a fundamental but occasionally overlooked advantage of multi model ensemble means hagedorn et al 2005 and is important for reliable efficient and effective application across a large region with diverse geophysical and statistical characteristics see ensemble modeling discussion in section 3 2 5 4 1 3 performance relative to existing system fig 4 and table 3 reveal the m4 ensemble mean forecast distribution also meets or in most cases beats the current nrcs wsf model for every quantitative performance measure recall from section 3 3 4 that this current pcr model is a meaningful general benchmark for operational wsf skill in the western us on average r2 and rpss improve by over 50 and rmse is reduced by 13 these accuracy improvements on 20 diverse test cases appear to mainly reflect a combination of flexibility provided by nonlinear machine learning robustness provided by methodologically diverse multi model ensembles and embedding of geophysical process constraints section 3 2 for rivers like the deschutes where preliminary diagnostics section 3 2 1 suggested no significant departures from linear stationary gaussian processes improvements were comparatively modest in such cases the ensemble ai essentially retrieves a linear stationary gaussian model as expected if regularization is properly implemented hsieh et al 2003 fleming 2007 by the same token benefits relative to the existing system were strongest for test cases like owyhee gila clark canyon and truckee which are nonlinear non gaussian or heteroscedastic and or where the existing system produced occasional non physical negative predictions note the final ensemble mean forecast distribution was always non negative a key advantage over the current statistical model which in 6 hindcast test cases provided a forecast distribution containing non physical values in at least one year these advantages are also qualitatively obvious for individual cases section 4 1 1 4 2 live operational testing 4 2 1 general performance live testing at a subset of 5 forecast locations during the 2020 forecast season section 3 3 alongside the current operational system was undertaken primarily to evaluate certain practical aspects of actually using m4 in a genuinely operational setting the testing confirmed logistical feasibility of associated near real time workflows and m4 was found reliable and simple to use with no need for manual intervention this otl approach stands in contrast to existing operational wsf models which in practice often require manual subjective choices during operations around rebuilding using different predictor sets or transforms statistical models or adjustments of parameters internal states or input data values process models see sections 1 and 3 further during part of the 2020 forecast season manual snow survey sites could not be monitored due to the covid 19 pandemic and impacts of the associated quarantine on field surveys it was found that m4 modeling suites previously developed for certain forecast points and dates that made particularly heavy use of manual snow survey data were easily and quickly retrained during routine forecast operations to use only telemetered snotel data this example illustrates that in practice the metasystem can provide needed flexibility and convenience when an unexpected operational condition arises out of sample forecast accuracy comparisons to other methods were performed in the hindcasting of section 4 1 3 and obviously were not a goal for live operational testing little can be gleaned in this respect from a single forecast season which effectively amounts to a sample of one in wsf it is nevertheless encouraging to preliminarily note that considering all 4 forecast dates at all 5 locations mean rmse improvement over the benchmark model in live operations was 10 roughly comparable to improvements seen in hindcasting additionally in operations the range in the best estimate 2020 spring summer volume forecast across all 4 forecast issue dates for a given river decreased relative to the current nrcs model by 21 averaged across the 5 sites if this apparent increase in the stability of the best estimate prediction value from one forecast date to the next for a given river during a given forecast season is rigorously confirmed in further operational testing it may reflect the inherent performance consistency advantages provided by multi model ensemble averaging see section 4 1 2 provided it is not at the expense of decreased accuracy and the opposite is seen here as noted above such steadiness in the forecast is in general viewed as a desirable operational characteristic by sdos because it simplifies hydroclimatic interpretations and client communications 4 2 2 geophysical interpretation of two live ai based forecasts ability to readily determine how model behaviors relate to physical hydrologic processes is necessary for meeting professional responsibilities around assessing the reliability of forecasts used for high impact water management decisions and for verification diagnostics physical interpretability is also vital for communicating forecasts to clients who often include the general public such as why a river volume prediction increased or decreased and by how much since the last forecast date recall from section 1 that for some western us rivers experiencing complex or contentious water management issues wsfs are legal requirements specified by legislation court decisions or international treaties such forecasts are routinely subject to intense public and even political scrutiny amenability to physical explanation is therefore a prerequisite for operational wsf systems in the region including those based on statistical and machine learning methods e g garen 1992 weber et al 2012 fleming and goodbody 2019 fleming et al 2021 as discussed in sections 1 and 3 such relatable hydroclimatic storylines are widely perceived to run contrary to the nominally black box nature of machine learning in turn slowing the migration of ai into operational hydrology some successful early attempts notwithstanding e g cannon and mckendry 2002 fleming 2007 explainable or glass box ai largely remains at the cutting edge of geoscience kratzert et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 mcgovern et al 2019 nearing et al 2021 our live operational forecasting provided an opportunity to test the pragmatic wsf specific approach to explainable machine learning implemented in m4 section 3 2 3 two examples are summarized below these were the most complicated interpretive scenarios encountered during live operational testing and as such illustrate ability of the m4 metasystem to extract geophysical process reasoning from an ai based predictive approach we first consider the february 1 2020 operational forecast of 101 normal for february may 2020 gila river flow volume during m4 training candidate predictors for this operational test case were forecast date swe and water year to date precipitation at a few sites in this remote mountain tributary to the lower colorado river table 1 fig 1 similar to the current wsf system section 2 in this particular test case for all models in m4 the genetic algorithm retained only the leading pca mode which given the candidate predictors used is a de facto watershed scale index of wintertime climate conditions and in particular basin water inputs the genetic algorithm effectively casts votes for which geophysical drivers among the candidates in the pool it thinks most important thus the resulting popular vote across models along with the pca eigenvector illuminate which inputs most influence the forecast we see table 4 that some predictors e g silver creek divide swe were more popular than others e g signal peak swe whereas eigenvector weights across retained predictors were roughly uniform for a given model in this case further dimensionality reduction section 3 allows direct visualization of the ensemble mean empirical input output map detected by m4 fig 5 in this example such a graphical representation illustrates the relationship between the sole retained feature in each model the leading pca mode which as noted previously is an index of wintertime precipitation inputs and the sole target february may volume averaged across constituent models the relationship exhibits a shallower slope in dry years fig 5 this decrease in the first derivative of the input output map during drought conditions is a functional form that is known from both m4 testing and nrcs operational experience with current wsf models to be especially widespread in semi arid rivers like the gila and capturing it in a wsf model is needed to avoid negative valued predictions sometimes generated by linear models over the relevant state space blue dashed line in fig 5 see also section 4 1 this nonlinearity reflects several geophysical causes wet year flow is closely coupled with and therefore sensitive to variations in winter precipitation and snowpack giving a steeper curve in contrast during dry years a higher proportion of springtime snowmelt goes to refilling soil moisture and aquifer storage before producing a flow response in this desert river that is the phenomenon can be viewed as an approximate seasonal scale analogy to the well known nonlinearity of daily or hourly rainfall runoff relationships infiltration limits reached during storms reduce the mitigating impact of soil moisture storage and more directly couple surface runoff to rainfall fluctuations increasing surface runoff generation per unit precipitation whereas stable baseflow contributions from soil aquifer channel wetland and other natural storage mechanisms partly flatten the rainfall runoff relationship during dry spells additionally wet year runoff efficiency improves due to proportionately lower evapotranspiration losses reflecting cooler temperatures and greater cloud cover associated with wet conditions here giving a greater runoff increase per unit precipitation increase lukas and harding 2020 these factors may also dovetail with climate elasticity if flow volume dependence on precipitation inputs follows a power law for a given river its precipitation elasticity of runoff is fixed and equal to the power law exponent sankasubramanian et al 2001 though additional work would be required to formally tie the curve in fig 5 to climate elasticity preliminary power law fits to this input output relationship non parametrically estimated by m4 following simple linear rescaling to ensure positive valued pc1 scores implies an elasticity of roughly 2 r2 0 95 consistent with colorado basin elasticity estimates from standard methods e g vano et al 2012 that this nonlinearity is strongest in semi arid rivers also seems consistent with vano et al 2012 who found higher elasticities in drier basins all things considered it seems clear that nonlinear relationships between climate forcing and watershed response empirically detected by m4 are explainable in terms of known hydrological processes connect data driven wsf to broader concepts in watershed hydrology and climate science and suggest specific future research directions in physical hydrology collectively belying the conventional black box view of machine learning moreover with the foregoing interpretive tools and context in mind the forecast of near normal runoff issued operationally by m4 on february 1 2020 is easily diagnosed to form a relatable and compact storyline for clients from table 4 precipitation overall was somewhat above normal throughout the watershed that in turn increased soil moisture basin wide as well as snowpack at silver creek divide which among the snotel sites considered in this test case is the most northerly highest elevation on average highest swe and generally most informative given its selection by all six models for spring runoff prediction these factors pushed up the forecast however snowpack was very low in the south signal peak and east lookout mountain presumably reflecting temperature controlled variations in winter precipitation phase across this southwestern new mexico watershed pulling spring summer runoff projections back down to near normal additionally in part because of nonlinear relationships between wintertime weather and runoff volume fig 5 which occur because snowpack and precipitation are not the sole environmental processes affecting streamflow percentages of normal match only approximately between observed inputs and predicted flow our second example is the january 1 2020 operational forecast of 71 normal for april july 2020 deschutes river flow volume during m4 training candidate predictors for this operational test case were forecast date swe and water year to date precipitation at a few sites in the remote mountain headwaters of this mid columbia river tributary table 1 fig 1 and antecedent streamflow this is similar to the current wsf system section 2 use of antecedent streamflow reflects the large known impact of volcanic aquifers in generating and stabilizing deschutes river flows surface water groundwater interactions are unusually pronounced here leading to muted seasonality in flow and strong memory in streamflow time series table 1 e g o connor et al 2003 risley et al 2005 resulting popular votes see above and eigenvectors are given in table 5 the popular vote cast by the genetic algorithm across the six constituent m4 models favors irish taylor precipitation and in particular antecedent deschutes streamflow the only candidate variable retained by all models in this test case the genetic algorithm selected only the leading mode for half the models and both the leading and second modes for the remainder for models retaining only the leading mode qr rf and svm two of the five candidate predictors were selected accumulated precipitation at either three creeks meadow or irish taylor and antecedent flow the corresponding eigenvector weights were equal across the two predictors for a given model for models retaining both the leading and second pca modes lr mann mcqrnn the leading mode eigenvector predominantly weighted snow or precipitation whereas the second mode loading pattern predominantly weighted antecedent flow recall that pca mode order is determined by relative ability to explain variance in the input matrix not relative ability to explain variance in the target when those modes are used as predictive features in a supervised learner overall then various ga optimized models address the combination of two distinct forcing mechanisms wintertime hydroclimate and groundwater conditions in one of two ways qr rf and svm retain a single pca mode which aggregates the effects of both forcing mechanisms for lr mann and mcqrnn the leading pca mode gives a watershed scale index of seasonal climate to date as in other test cases e g foregoing gila river example whereas the second mode indexes groundwater contributions for all six constituent m4 models functional forms in this test case were approximately linear as expected based on hindcast testing and preliminary diagnostics see section 4 1 3 graphical representations cannot be compactly provided for the ensemble mean response as in fig 5 because different models retain different numbers of features for the deschutes but we can easily examine the input output maps for each of the six models individually a representative example is provided in fig 6 illustrating a nearly planar response surface extracted by one of the artificial neural networks mechanisms for the apparent absence of substantial nonlinearity here requires further study but comparisons of functional forms across several test cases from different hydroclimatic settings not shown here for conciseness strongly suggest that it reflects water abundance in some way a possible explanation is that the aforementioned plentiful aquifer contributions to streamflow plus heavy snowmelt and precipitation inputs to this very wet pacific northwest basin near the crest of the cascades range are such that basin water balance does not become sufficiently depleted even in drought years for the form of the input output mapping to change as a function of wetness as seen in the gila and other semi arid or arid basins where flow volumes can approach zero in dry years and the functional form must therefore level off at low flows as in fig 5 as for the gila river above with these interpretive tools and context in mind the january 1 2020 operational april july volume forecast for the deschutes river is easily diagnosed to form a relatable and compact storyline for clients very early winter january 1 swe and accumulated precipitation data are typically poor indicators of the total snowpack that will be eventually available for spring summer melt in the upper deschutes basin they therefore offer limited wsf skill at this january publication date and are collectively given less influence on the ensemble forecast by m4 in contrast the only candidate predictor retained in all six m4 methods is antecedent flow consistent with the unique hydrogeologic characteristics of the deschutes river stabilizing its flows and generating extensive time series memory that facilitates forecasting in an autoregressive model like fashion note that this relationship between catchment storage and streamflow memory and the resulting streamflow forecasting capability can also be explicitly tied to a finite difference approximation to the linear reservoir model of watershed hydrology for details see fleming 2007 and references therein the 74 normal value of antecedent flow with some additional support from the 71 normal value of swe at three creeks meadow for the mann model therefore brings up the ensemble mean predicted volume to 71 of normal despite dry wintertime conditions to january 1 2020 model structures optimized feature sets and associated hydroclimatic explanations varied significantly across test cases as would be expected given their geophysical diversity however it was found that straightforward physical interpretations of the models and of their operational forecasts in light of currently observed conditions were readily apparent in all cases in general these explanations were roughly similar to or simpler than those for the two operational test cases detailed above 4 3 mainstreaming ai in hydrology some implications of m4 operational viability much effort has been invested over recent decades in improving physics oriented process simulation models of river hydrology in theory these models have certain advantages over data driven volume prediction methods such as improved physical process diagnostics better suitability for nonstationary environments and ability to generate daily streamflow traces that are useful in some applications moreover the nominally black box nature of machine learning exacerbates relative even to classical statistical methods the shortcomings of data driven prediction frameworks relative to more explicitly physics oriented approaches given these considerations is ai a viable alternative at all for operational wsf the results of this study provide some insight into that question which is increasingly pressing as on the one hand water scarcity and the associated need for better hydrometeorological forecasts increase and on the other hand ai progressively permeates science and society in what has been termed the fourth paradigm of science hey et al 2009 and subsequently the fourth industrial revolution schwab 2017 it is useful to begin by identifying some general advantages of data driven models for operational wsf statistical volume modeling is a proven method that remains the backbone of most wsf systems in western north america often serving as either the sole prediction technology or as a complement to esps some organizations currently running statistical wsf models include nrcs california department of water resources colorado basin river forecast center bc hydro bureau of reclamation and army corps of engineers forecasts in the columbia basin british columbia river forecast centre and alberta environment reasons for continued interest in data driven models include intrinsically lower development and operation costs similar forecast skill greater amenability to new predictive data types like multiple climate indices operational simplicity and robustness and easier and more accurate estimates of forecast uncertainty relative to esps e g gobena et al 2013 risley et al 2005 fleming and dahlke 2014 hsieh et al 2003 grantz et al 2005 harpold et al 2016 regonda et al 2006a rosenberg et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 minxue et al 2016 mendoza et al 2017 robertson et al 2013 there is also accumulating evidence that certain carefully implemented machine learning algorithms can make accurate hydroclimatic predictions under conditions not sampled during a historical training period that is extrapolate successfully schnorbus and cannon 2014 shrestha et al 2017 kratzert et al 2019 facilitating their use in a changing climate for instance conversely some theoretical advantages of process based models over data driven approaches are incompletely realized in practice for instance diagnosing forecast failures in complex process models is not always straightforward and process simulation streamflow models sufficiently accurate for widespread operational use by the applied water resource community normally contain parameters requiring de facto statistical calibration to historical records potentially undermining applicability to nonstationary environments more fundamental considerations also motivate temporally coarse grained prediction techniques like data driven seasonal volume models temporal aggregation often simplifies the underlying statistical physics of any system and the optimal level of model detail and complexity required to describe and predict that system therefore depends on problem timescale specifically temporal data aggregation typically increases the signal to noise ratio of lower frequency geophysical processes and can at least partially linearize functional relationships and attenuate statistical complications like autocorrelation if the aggregation interval exceeds the decorrelation timescale and non gaussian distributions reflecting the central limit theorem for details around these general principles and some specific hydrology and climate examples see e g packard et al 1980 finney et al 1998 daw et al 2003 penland 1996 hsieh 2009 newman 2007 newman 2012 micovic and quick 2009 and fleming and barton 2015 hydrologic process simulation models usually contain strongly nonlinear serially correlated and non gaussian physics relevant to the hourly to daily timescales at which they typically operate this is obviously needed for short term flood forecasting but represents a multiple 2 to nearly 4 order of magnitude mismatch to the task of predicting on an annual basis accumulated spring summer flow volume a few months ahead based mainly on snowpack data most of the additional information generated by a process simulation model is therefore effectively discarded when outcomes are integrated to form the seasonal volume predictions that are the primary basis for western us water management despite these advantages and a quarter century of research applications of ai to hydrologic prediction that consistently demonstrate better accuracy than both process simulation and conventional statistical methods e g nearing et al 2021 ml has largely failed to penetrate operational hydrology in general and wsf in particular reasons were summarized in section 1 and primarily relate to lack of alignment of ai based hydrologic models with the specific practical needs of operational wsf including but not limited to geophysical explainability also as briefly summarized in sections 1 and 3 m4 was therefore designed to satisfy those specific practical criteria fleming and goodbody 2019 verifying whether m4 can actually accomplish that task in practice was a major goal of this study the retrospective and live operational testing conducted here demonstrate that these nrcs design criteria appear to have been met by m4 with broader potential implications for transitioning ai into operational systems relative to similarly configured conventional pcr based nrcs wsf models which as noted above have accuracies approximately typical of operational wsf systems in the western us including process based esp models section 3 3 4 the metasystem provides better forecast skill and more realistic prediction intervals is more robust and automated more consistently yields physically reasonable outcomes both integrates and is interpretable in terms of physical hydrologic process knowledge is applicable across strongly heterogeneous geophysical environments spanning the western us and alaska and functions well in a genuine operational setting though technically more complex than current generation statistically based operational wsf methods it requires fewer resources to implement and operate relative to many process simulation models considered collectively these testing results show that with careful and application specific design and implementation ai has capacity to bridge the gap from research to operations in a large operational wsf setting at a major service delivery organization given that water resource science engineering and management is ultimately a practical field and that viability in applied operational settings is therefore a key test for the overall relevance of hydrologic modeling technologies this demonstration establishes a positive general precedent and perhaps an implementation template for operational hydrologic applications of ml that said certain m4 characteristics may additionally suggest a path for combining process based and ai based models for both theoretical and practical reasons physics oriented process simulation hydrological models will continue playing a major role in operational wsf in the western us improvements to such physics oriented approaches may in turn prove valuable to improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of wsf related information generated for water managers and the general public the multi model ensemble philosophy underlying m4 may enable a means for integrating those advances with concurrent ml advances this is discussed in section 5 5 conclusions to summarize in a fundamental departure from legacy wsf systems and philosophies we investigated an otl approach based on a recently developed multi model ensemble prediction analytics engine m4 that incorporates automated and explainable ai in this study m4 was tested in both retrospective applications and live forecast operations for a relatively large and hydroclimatically diverse sample of test cases drawn from the current nrcs forecast system this testing suggests m4 meets the theoretical and practical needs that nrcs defined for its operational wsf environment including geophysical interpretability objectivity efficiency predictive performance robustness ease of implementation and use by an operational team and other key attributes ability to generate clear hydroclimatic storylines is particularly notable given the black box reputation of machine learning and the need for such geophysical explanations in operational wsf practice satisfying these criteria is in turn a required step in m4 adoption by nrcs as the basis for the next generation of the largest stand alone operational wsf system in the western us which to our knowledge will be the first successful migration of ai into a genuinely operational large scale river prediction system the result demonstrates that past roadblocks to operationalization of machine learning in hydrology can be overcome with careful and collaborative multi disciplinary design and in particular by a development philosophy that focuses on first identifying the practical operational needs of sdos and then working hand in hand with the operational community to develop suitably purpose specific machine learning solutions that meet those needs this may set a positive precedent for transitioning ai from research to practice in water resource science engineering and management going forward at least three general research and development directions are apparent the first is a production software environment to facilitate large scale operational deployment of m4 at nrcs by serving as a platform and interface for the prediction engine the prototype platform currently under development in collaboration with research partners is based on a modeling as a service maas construct implemented on a private cloud david et al 2014 functionalities span database linkages a graphical user interface multi user server based implementation amenable to distributed and remote computing straightforward prediction engine version updating and interactive capabilities around graphics mapping data pre processing and forecast distribution post processing second the combination of improved accuracy from nonlinear machine learning methods a robust process for applying these ai algorithms in a physics aware and operational wsf specific way dimensionality reduction and the flexibility of a modular ensemble framework may collectively engender faster and more widespread and successful integration of m4 with other methods and products than often feasible in current generation operational river prediction platforms for example numerical climate models offer some seasonal scale prediction skill but the results require somewhat elaborate downscaling procedures to use as input to hydrologic process simulation models and overall present operational process based and statistical hydrology models alike do not appear to be sufficiently accurate and generalizable to capitalize effectively on the additional information these climate models may provide gobena and gan 2010 yuan et al 2013 mendoza et al 2017 in contrast significant improvements in predictive capacity of the nonlinear ai metasystem relative to existing operational wsf technologies together with its data compression steps and a relatively high level of data agnosticism create a platform that should in principle be intrinsically more amenable to quickly and effectively leveraging emerging high dimensional operational wsf inputs these predictors include process based mountain snow e g isnobal hedrick et al 2019 and seasonal to subseasonal s2s climate e g cfsv2 saha et al 2014 model predictions and snow remote sensing e g modis tran et al 2019 and data assimilation e g aso painter et al 2016 products this in turn provides potential opportunities for further wsf skill improvements we are also collaborating with research partners to complement pca with a new form of non negative matrix factorization vesselinov et al 2019 to further improve physical interpretability of forecasts fleming et al 2021 and additional supervised learning systems may be integrated beyond the six used here third the multi threaded philosophy underlying this collection of semi independent forecast systems can be easily extended to ingest forecasts from outside sources into its ensemble including process simulation model based operational wsfs though rare precedent exists for fusing data driven and physics based hydrologic predictions into model agnostic ensembles najafi and moradkhani 2016 this creates opportunities to integrate m4 forecasts with for example esps from us geological survey prms process simulation models that nrcs operates at selected locations leavesley et al 2010 leverage innovations in physics based hydrologic prediction models being developed elsewhere e g wrf hydro and the noaa national water model cohen et al 2018 and reinstate formal multi agency forecast coordination between nrcs and national weather service river forecast centers that predominantly use esps pagano et al 2014 doing so could improve diversity within the multi model ensemble and capitalize on the advantages of both ai based and process based models see sections 3 2 5 4 1 2 and 4 3 wsfs from alternative statistical models operated by other sdos like the bureau of reclamation and california department of water resources could similarly be included where available note that while operation of several wsf models across several government agencies may appear inefficient the multiple governance goals and technical approaches associated with that diversity is known to provide long term adaptability robustness and much needed operational redundancy for western us water management see extensive reviews by doyle 2012 hrachowitz and clark 2017 the primary drawback for water managers is determining how in practice to use these multiple sometimes partially conflicting sources of wsf information blending multiple hydrologic modeling paradigms into the multi model framework as suggested above would provide a mechanism for addressing this current practices gap combined with aforementioned likely improvements in ability to use emerging predictor sources this implies the metasystem has potential to grow into a rigorous and nimble integration platform for bringing together multiple data sources and prediction modeling technologies in turn helping promote more accurate robust and usable wsfs across the american west credit authorship contribution statement sean w fleming conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology project administration software validation

4252,stochastic nature of streamflow poses significant challenges in attaining a reliable forecasting model in general variational mode decomposition vmd can improve the forecast performance but easily expose the sub signals to boundary effect furthermore one model is not able to adapt all properties of different sub series accordingly we have two aims in this study one is to propose an adaptive weight combined forecasting model to improve the middle and long term streamflow forecast skill it adapts the boundary effect in such a way that its inputs come from decomposition during calibration sets and outputs are extracted from decomposition during the entire series the other one is to link system performance improvement i e the forecast skill to the forecast value to address the gap in methodologies appropriate for data limited locations only hydrological time series collected four artificial intelligence based models coupled with adaptive appendant and parameter optimization are developed as hybrid adaptive ha for forecasting each sub signal decomposed by vmd in the proposed forecast model the multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo algorithm is then employed to combine individual forecasts based on performance based weighting strategies and provide the pareto optimal ensemble forecasts the proposed model is applied to forecast streamflow 1 to 6 months ahead of two stations in the yellow river china and the results show that the ensemble forecasts can increase the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient by 0 10 7 96 and reducing the values of root mean squared error by 1 08 32 11 compared to the ha model the relationship between the forecast skill and its value can be strongly affected by decision makers priorities but the relative improvement in hydropower generation obtained by the compromised forecasts going from 0 02 to 3 39 indicates that improved forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions keywords streamflow forecast forecast skill value relationship weights combined forecasts ai based model hydropower generation 1 introduction accurate middle and long term streamflow forecasts are vital for water resource managers to maximize water use potential over long periods tan et al 2018 numerous physical models have been proposed to forecast streamflow in the past decades meng et al 2017 patil and ramsankaran 2017 nanda et al 2019 giuliani et al 2020 however data requirements parameter uncertainties and structure complexities mean the physical models may not be readily used in some applications an alternative is to use data driven models due to their ease of implementation low information requirements and rapid real time operation features ahani et al 2018 zhang et al 2018

literature statistical models like multiple linear regression and autoregressive moving average models assume that the relationship between input and output is linear mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 such models will limit the model s capability to handle non linear time series in comparison the ai based models are successful in modeling and forecasting non linear hydrological processes guo et al 2020c niu et al 2020a the widely used ai based approaches include back propagation neural networks bpnn li et al 2018 extreme learning machine elm adnan et al 2019 and least squares support vector machine lssvm guo et al 2020b due to the successful development of deep learning technology deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks rnns have achieved great success in forecasting fields long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru are two of the most popular rnns in the field of deep learning which have been used to tackle runoff forecast problems in recent years bi et al 2020 gao et al 2020 guo et al 2020c however it remains challenging to accurately forecast non linear and non stationary features together only using single ai based models in contrast hybrid models that couple decomposition ensemble technology and ai techniques can take advantage of their capability to extract useful information hidden in complex hydrological time series and thus make an improved ai based forecast model wavelet transform wt empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd are commonly used techniques that decompose the original signal into several sub signals that can be easily modeled by ai based methods fang et al 2019 meng et al 2019 rezaie balf et al 2019 sun et al 2019 hadi et al 2020 niu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020b in many hybrid models the entire time series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some ai based models in such forecast framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment zuo et al 2020a however the validation information is not available at the present moment for streamflow forecasting therefore streamflow hindcasting is not practical for a real forecast the entire streamflow series should be first divided into training and validation sets and the training set is then decomposed into sub signals and applied to train the forecast models in addition the decomposition results vary with the length of the time series and thus the use of a predefined decomposition model in the calibration period may bring significant errors tan et al 2018 each model has its particular strengths and weaknesses indicating that an individual ai based model may have its unavoidable disadvantages and not be able to adapt to all properties of different sub series in comparison studies on the combined forecast methods have achieved remarkable attention more and more studies have shown that the combined forecast models can achieve higher forecasting accuracy and better forecasting stability than the single model forecasting zhang et al 2017 jiang and liu 2019 wu et al 2020 the principle of the combined models is to obtain the optimal combining weights through maximizing forecast performance between the ordinary series and combining forecasts forecast skill is often characterized by attributes such as reliability sharpness bias and accuracy there is no single objective function that can represent all the features of runoff hydrographs liu et al 2019 in this case how to determine the weights in a combined model is a multi objective optimization problem and thus can be solved by multi objective evolutional algorithms moeas e g non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 spea2 and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso quinn et al 2017 fang et al 2018 tian et al 2019 guo et al 2020a gupta et al 2020 recently grey wolf optimizer gwo mirjalili et al 2014 inspired by the headship hierarchy and hunting strategy of grey wolves has attracted wide attention which is demonstrated more suitable than other prevalent optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso gravitational search algorithm gsa and ant lion optimizer alo bilandi et al 2020 guo et al 2020b naserbegi et al 2020 asghari et al 2021 el zeiny et al 2021 the multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo mirjalili et al 2016 inheriting the merits of the original gwo has been successfully applied in some fields li et al 2019 karakoyun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 fountas and vaxevanidis 2021 but rarely in the hydrological field streamflow forecasts are gradually used to design reservoir operation options the term forecast value represents the operational value realized through the use of forecasts in decision making yang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge however while a considerable research effort has been made to develop methods to improve forecast skill and the criterion to quantify forecast skill the evaluation of forecast value is still lacking and very recently started to appear forecast value is generally expected to increase with forecast skill but it may also vary based on other factors such as operational strategies shamir 2017 alexander et al 2020 hadi et al 2020 several studies even disprove the assumption that higher skill always leads to improved decisions goddard et al 2010 anghileri et al 2019 a forecast driven optimization operation is often performed for a fixed time horizon at monthly or seasonal time resolution however there is often a mismatch between the information needed for reservoir operations and the skillful lead time of the reservoir inflow forecast anghileri et al 2016 therefore to enhance reservoir operation it is necessary to acquire knowledge on how decisions with different horizons impact a forecast driven operation in this study we try to answer the two following questions 1 how to improve streamflow forecast skill 2 what factors will influence the forecast skill value relationship building on the above mentioned studies we propose an ai based forecast driven management framework in this study aiming 1 to develop a novel multi step combined model for improving streamflow forecast skill 2 to evaluate the forecast skill value relationship through informing reservoir operational decisions vmd first decomposes the original time series into a finite set of sub components in the combined forecast model the ai based models including elm lssvm lstm and gru with an adaptive mechanism are developed to forecast each decomposition signal the individual forecasts are obtained by reconstructing the sub series to further improve the forecasting capacity of the combined model the mogwo algorithm is employed to determine the optimal coefficients of weight and bias and the final forecast results can be integrated from each hybrid ai based model in the reservoir operation framework forecast driven operations using model predictive control are developed and system performances will be measured in terms of hydropower generation the ai based forecast driven management framework is tested on the upper yellow river basin china the adaptive multi step combined forecast model is used to model and forecast streamflow of two stations from 1 month ahead to 6 month ahead then the forecast driven operation is performed on a multi hydropower system our contributions are as follows 1 an adaptive weight combined forecasting model is developed for multi step streamflow forecasting both decomposition and forecast models are highly adaptive future information is not used in the decomposition ensemble framework to improve the forecast efficiency and boundary effect is tolerated to improve forecast accuracy 2 mogwo algorithm is developed to find the optimal weights of the combined model fast and accuratly multi objective optimization determining model weights can overcome the drawbacks that no single objective function can represent all the features of runoff hydrographs 3 our work couples a skillful statistical streamflow forecast with a non site specific multi reservoir model to inform operations it aims to address the gap in methodologies appropriate for data limited locations only hydrological time series collected and help understand how the system and its optimization model are sensitive to streamflow forecasts of different skill and operational strategies 2 methodology the experimental approach followed in the study is shown in fig 1 and described in the following sections 2 1 adaptive multi step combined forecast model many studies have reported that it was difficult to conclude which individual model provides the best streamflow prediction the combined forecasting model integrating the results of several models makes it a more promising model than individual ones generally we can determine the model weights by averaging all available forecasts in contrast we can also choose to minimize several cost functions or objective criteria to obtain combination of weights and biases in this case a combined forecast model consists of two components one is an internal forecast model including some individual models and the other one is an external ensemble model eliminating the model uncertainty according to different forecasts the main procedure of the proposed combined forecast model is presented in fig 2 2 1 1 internal individual forecast model it is convenient that emd and eemd automatically decompose modal components based on data however they may suffer mode aliasing and endpoint effects during the decomposition process in comparison vmd firstly proposed by dragomiretskiy in 2014 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 is an adaptive signal processing method it decomposes the signal into non recursive and variational modes controls the convergence conditions and achieves adaptive decomposition of the non stationary signal it has been reported that vmd can obtain higher forecast accuracy and greater robustness than emd or eemd in many several pieces of literature hu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 therefore the vmd method is developed to decompose the original streamflow series practically four individual ai based models are used as the internal forecast models to generate the multi step streamflow forecasts including extreme learning machine elm least square support vector machine lssvm long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru the detailed descriptions of the four ai based models can be found in supplements the forecast accuracy of the ai based model is easily affected by the parameters for example the values of weights and biases in elm are randomly chosen at the beginning of training therefore the parameters in ai based models are normally optimized by minimizing the differences between the observed and forecasting values using many optimization methods such as gsa alo gwo and grid search gs gwo proposed in 2014 mirjalili et al 2014 is a relatively novel meta heuristic algorithm better performance on parameters optimization has been reported than other algorithms including ga pso gsa and alo bilandi et al 2020 guo et al 2020b naserbegi et al 2020 asghari et al 2021 el zeiny et al 2021 in our study the parameters in lssvm and elm are optimized by the gwo algorithm it can be named gwo lssvm and gwo elm due to the high parallelism and flexible operation gs is widely used in deep neural networks yoo 2019 priyadarshini and cotton 2021 therefore lstm and gru are optimized by the gs method which can be represented by gs lstm and gs gru according to the above introduction the internal forecasting model is first based on data decomposition by vmd and then forecasting by hybrid ai based models 2 1 1 1 decomposition vmd vmd is a novel signal process method it aims to decompose a non stationary signal f into an ensemble of k imf components u k k 1 2 k with a center frequency of w k its main principle is iteratively searching for the optimal solution of a constrained variational problem through minimizing each imf s center frequency and bandwidth the constrained variational problem can be expressed as dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 1 min u k w k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 subject to k 1 k u k t f t where δ t is the dirac distribution is the convolution operator e j w k t is the phasor description of the center frequency of the modal function on the complex plane a quadratic penalty term α and lagrangian multipliers λ are introduced to transform the constrained variational problem into an unconstrained problem to obtain the optimal solution the augmented lagrangian is described as follows dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 2 l u k w k λ α k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 f t k 1 k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k 1 k u k t the saddle point of the augmented lagrangian function is then calculated using the alternate direction method of multipliers and to determine the optimal solutions u k and w k the specific decomposition steps are as follows step 1 define the number of modes k step 2 initialize parameters u k 1 w k 1 and λ set the number of iterations n 1 step 3 update u k and w k by eqs 3 5 3 u k n 1 w f w i 1 k 1 u i n w λ w 2 1 2 α w w k 2 4 w k n 1 0 w u k n 1 w 2 d w 0 u k n 1 w 2 d w 5 λ n 1 w λ n w τ f w k 1 k u k n 1 w where u k n 1 w λ w and x w are the fourier transforms of the signal u k n 1 t λ t and x t respectively τ is the update coefficient of the lagrangian multiplication usually τ 0 step 4 let n n 1 repeat the above step 3 until the following conditions are met 6 k 1 k u k n 1 u k n 2 2 u k n 2 2 ε where ε is a convergence threshold usually ε 1e 6 according to the above variational mode decomposition theory there are two parameters that should be defined in advance they are the mode number k and the quadratic penalty term α 2 1 1 2 proposed hybrid adaptive forecasting model the process of the hybrid adaptive ha forecasting model is described as follows step 1 parameter initialization initialize the parameters used in the hybrid forecasting model step 2 data decomposition the original non stationary series is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions imfs y k k 1 2 k using vmd specifically determining the optimal decomposition level k by observing the center frequency aliasing phenomenon of the last sub signal was suggested in this study step 3 adaptive appendant according to the adaptive strategy shown in fig 3 sequentially append the new data to the original set to generate new appended signals decompose each appended signal into k sets of appended sub signals x k k 1 2 k using vmd it should be noted that the number of decomposition components is constant with the length of the time series step 4 sample generation assume that the predicted target is y k t d d is the leading time and the predictors are x k t l x k t l 1 x k t 1 x k t l is the previous lag generate modeling samples using the sub signals as shown in table 1 then divide the sub signals into an initial training set where the training set length is 70 of the data length and a validation set where the validation set length is 30 of the data length step 5 adaptive bias corrected forecasts the internal steps in detail are as follows i initialize the data number in the validation period m 1 ii calibrate ai based models for each sub series and calculate the bias between the simulation and observation of each sub series in the training period iii forecast each sub series for the d period ahead x k v a l i m m m m d using the direct strategies described as follows 7 horizon t 1 q t 1 f f q t q t 1 q t l horizon t 1 q t 2 f f q t q t 1 q t l horizon t 1 q t d f f q t q t 1 q t l iv calibrate ai based models for each sub series bias and then forecast each sub series bias for d period ahead bia s k v a l i m m m m d using the direct strategies x k v a l i m plus bia s k v a l i m are treated as the real forecasts v append x k v a l i m m m m d into the calibration data vi if m m l stop otherwise let m m d and then repeat steps ii to iv step 6 forecast reconstruction the prediction results of each imf component are summarized and the final prediction results are obtained 2 1 2 external ensemble forecast model forecast combination is performed based on the fact that no single model could capture any specific time series pattern a better choice is pooling forecasts obtained from different forecasting models zhou et al 2019 the method tries to determine the optimal combining weights and biases through optimizing performance measures between the ordinary series and combining forecasts the combining forecasts can be given by 8 y q w t b q 1 1 q 2 1 q t 1 q 1 2 q 2 2 q t 2 q 1 n q 2 n q t n w 1 w 2 w n b where q is the matrix comprises of the forecasts from individual models w is the weighting matrix i 1 n w i 1 b is bias and n is the numbers of the individual forecast model the method now requires the optimization of performance measures one must not rely solely on any single indicator when evaluating the performance of hydrological forecast models low flow forecasting plays an vitial role in water resource management as emergency measures should be taken in time to ensure normal water supply besides peak flow forecasting is important to disseminate information on reservoir operation and timely flood warning consequently indicators utilized to evaluate model accuracy and forecast ability of high or low magnitude data in this study consist of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse karunanithi et al 1994 and mean absolute relative error mare γ xie et al 2019 which are commonly used in the field of streamflow forecasting the nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the data series and can describe the tracking ability of the predicted value to the measured value and it is used to evaluate the stability of the predicted values the rmse represents the error between the forecasted and observed values and it is used to characterize the overall prediction precision the mare γ computes the average absolute relative error between the forecasted and observed values of the top or low γ streamflow data and it is used to identify the forecast accuracy of different magnitude 9 max n s e 1 t 1 t q t o q t f t 1 t q t o q o 10 min r m s e 1 t t 1 t q t o q t f 2 11 min mare γ 1 t γ t 1 t γ q t o q t f q t o 100 where q o is the observed streamflow and q f is the forecasted streamflow m3 s q o is the mean values of the observed streamflow m3 s t γ is the number of the top bottom γ streamflow data the nse can be used to evaluate the stability of the forecasted value and the nse value is 1 rmse is used to characterize the overall forecast accuracy while mare computes the average absolute relative error of predicts of the top bottom γ streamflow data mae and mare values are 0 it is clear from the definitions of these indicators that a model with larger values of nse or smaller values of rmse and mare provides better forecasting accuracy than other comparative models several studies showed no single objective function representing all the features of runoff hydrographs such as the peak flow and runoff volume thus the forecast models should be calibrated over more than one performance indicator based on multi objective optimization algorithms 2 2 multi objective grey wolf optimizer algorithm gwo proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 is a new single objective optimization algorithm it is inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves there is a strict social dominant hierarchy in grey wolves including the alpha wolves α the beta wolves β the delta wolves δ and the omega wolves ω the positions of a grey wolf in gwo are updated according to the positions of α β and δ by the following strategies mirjalili et al 2014 12 d p c x p t x t x t 1 1 3 p α β δ x p t a d p where d p represents the distance between the grey wolf and prey x p t and x t are the position of prey and grey wolf at tth iteration respectively c and a are coefficient vectors which can be calculated as follows 13 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 a r 2 a 2 2 t t max where r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in 0 1 t max is the maximum number of iterations unlike single objective optimization aiming to obtain a single solution multi objective optimization is concerned with finding non dominant solutions termed as pareto solutions in this study the multi objective grey wolf optimizer mogwo is applied to calibrate the combined forecast model mogwo developed by mirjalili et al 2016 is extended from gwo in such a way that two added components are employed to accommodate multi objective optimization problems one component is a fix sized external archive to store the current non dominant solutions during each iteration by comparing the newly obtained solution with the archive solutions the individuals in the external archive are updated once numbers exceed the archive limitation the grid mechanism is first performed to re arrange the objective space segmentation then one of the solutions in the most crowded segment is randomly deleted while the new solution is inserted into the least crowded segment the other component is a selection strategy to determine the wolf leader according to the roulette wheel method in such a mechanism shown in eq 14 the less crowded segment has a higher probability of generating new leaders mirjalili et al 2016 14 p i c n i where c is a constant number greater than one and n is the number of obtained pareto optimal solutions in the ith segment the pseudocodes of gwo and mogwo can be found in supplements 2 3 forecast driven operations using model predictive control model predictive control mpc uses forecast data to determine future environmental conditions e g reservoir release pricing signals and energy asset status over a specified time horizon rawlings 2000 in our study mpc performs reservoir operation in such a way that the forecasts are implemented into an optimization formulation that schedules reservoir release and executes dispatch choices at the first time step once new forecasts are generated the later optimal dispatch for the next time step is revised using the updated forecasts the procedure of mpc for reservoir operation is shown in fig 4 the optimization formulation consists of an objective function and constraints here the maximization of the total power generation is chosen as the objective function and the mathematical formula can be established as below max e t 1 t p 1 p a p q p t e h p t δ t 15 h p t 1 2 z p t u z p t 1 u z p t d where e is the total generation of hydropower system p is the number of reservoirs t is the number of periods δt is the time period hp t z p t u and z p t d are the water head forebay water level and downstream water level of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively q p t e is the turbine discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period and ap is the generation coefficient of the p th hydropower reservoir the objective function is subject to the following operating constraints 1 water balance equation 16 v p t 1 v p t i p t q p t e q p t s δ t where ip t q p t e and q p t s are the inflow turbine discharge and surplus discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively vp t is the storage volume of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period 2 storage volume constraint 17 v p t min v p t v p t max where v p t min and v p t max are the minimum and maximum reservoir storage of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively v p t f z p t u f denotes the non linear functions between storage and water level of the p th hydropower reservoir 3 turbine discharge constraints 18 q p t e min q p t e q p t e max where q p t e min and q p t e max are the minimum and maximum turbine discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 4 reservoir release constraints 19 q p t min q p t e q p t s q p t max where q p t min and q p t max are the minimum and maximum reservoir release of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 5 power output constraints 20 p p t min a p q p t e h p t p p t max where p p t min and p p t max are the minimum and maximum power outputs of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 3 case studies 3 1 study area and data the yellow river is the second longest river in china and ranked as the sixth longest river globally with the total length estimated to be approximately 5464 km and the drainage basin covering 75 3 104 km2 deng et al 2020 the upper yellow river basin uyrb as shown in fig 5 is one of the thirteen major hydropower bases in china si et al 2019 twenty five reservoirs have been built or planned in this area with 16 3483 gw of total installed capacity undertaking the important task of transporting clean energy to the north west electricity network accordingly accurate streamflow forecasts are essential to assure high hydropower generation in uyrb tangnaihai tnh and lanzhou lz stations are located in the mainstream of the yellow river the monthly streamflow datasets obtained at tnh and lz stations in uyrb are used to demonstrate the adaptive bias corrected combined forecasts model both streamflow series are naturalized which means the effects of human activities have been removed the non parametric mann kendall mk trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to explore the presence of monotonic trends for the two time series it indicates that the two time series show a non significant decrease the test statistic z of the tnh station is 1 698 while that of the lz station is 1 670 the runoff series of the tnh station covers a period of 576 months from january 1963 to december 2010 while that of the lz station covers a period of 660 months from january 1956 to december 2010 for each case 70 of the streamflow series were selected as the initial training set while 30 of the streamflow series were selected as the validation set to further verify whether improved forecasts lead to improved values or not the downstream reservoirs are used to tackle the hydropower generation problems by implementing the forecasts as the reservoir inflow in this case longyangxia and daxia reservoirsare selected as the corresponding reservoirs of which tnh station mainly controls longyangxia inflow and daxia inflow is represented by lz station the lyx reservoir is normally treated as the first reservoir in uyrb while there are several reservoirs located upstream of the dx reservoir most of the reservoirs located upstream of the dx reservoir are run off river reservoirs which approximately release the same volume as the inflow and have no influence on dx reservoir there is an exception that the lijaxia ljx reservoir is a yearly regulated reservoir which can have an effect on the monthly inflow of the dx reservoir however due to the limitation of data availability we are not able to collect the inflow information for the ljx reservoir in our study we have to ignore the influence of ljx reservoir on dx reservoir and have an assumption that the inflow of dx reservoir is controlled by the release of lyx and the interval inflow between two reservoirs the main characteristics of longyangxia lyx and daxia dx reservoirs are shown in table 2 3 2 model development 3 2 1 data decomposition with vmd as suggested by zuo et al 2020a the quadratic penalty term α and the convergence tolerance ɛ of vmd are generally set to 2000 and 1e 9 respectively we can determine the optimal decomposition mode number of vmd through the aliasing phenomenon of the center frequency of the last imf given vmd of lz station as an example we evaluate k from k 2 to k 9 the 9th imf of lz exhibits an apparent aliasing phenomenon area surrounded by a red rectangular border in fig 6 therefore to avoid spurious components as much as possible the k of vmd for the lz station is chosen as 8 similarly the k of vmd for the tnh station is chosen as 9 3 2 2 forecast computational setting gwo optimizes the parameters in lssvm and elm the ranges of σ and γ are set as 0 1 1000 and 0 1 100 respectively the initial weights and biases in elm are set to 1 1 selecting the hyperparameters of lstm and gru models such as the number of hidden layers hidden units the dropout rate and the learning rate remains a difficult task the number of batches is set to 512 as used by kratzert et al 2018 because the decomposed sub signals are relatively stationary the low number of hidden layer is sufficient for simulating the predictor predict and streamflow relationship therefore the number of hidden layers is set to 1 as used by zuo et al 2020a the hidden units and the dropout rate are optimized by the grid search gs method while the learning rate is set as 0 1 and the other hyperparameters of the lstm models are set to default values in tensor flow as zuo et al 2020a suggested the number of hidden units is designed as 2 4 8 16 32 and 64 to avoid overfitting of lstm and gru the dropout rate is designed based on 10 levels ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 further the entire data in rnns lstm and gru is divided into two subsets including a training set and a validation set to avoid the over fitting problem in the ai based model the training set is used to compute the gradient and update the weights and biases of the network while the validation set over which the errors are monitored during the training process and is used to decide when to stop training after each ai based model completes forecasts the mogwo algorithm is applied to calibrate the combined forecast model with a diverse combination of weights and biases based on experiments the population size npop setting the maximum number of generation nmaxgen and the external archive size nea are set to 100 10000 and 1000 respectively it should be noted that the adaptive mechanism may be time consuming as we set a long validation period however this problem exists only in our research stage and will not limit the practical application of the adaptive mechanism in a real world forecast managers just need to forecast the streamflow of the next few periods without validation as the forecast continues the validation set data are appended into the calibration set gradually in the adaptive forecast experiment and thus the calibration period will always change therefore in the following sections we only show the forecast results in the validation period besides hydrological forecasting accuracy the length of the foresight period is also of great significance for guiding reservoir operation to analyze the complicated relationship between skill and performance in streamflow forecasts and reservoir operation together 1 2 3 4 5 6 month ahead are selected as the target forecast horizon 3 2 3 reservoir operation computational setting the reservoir operation system contains two reservoirs i e lyx and dx reservoirs lyx reservoir is a regulatory reservoir while the dx reservoir is considered as a run of river hydropower station referred to si et al 2019 the initial fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir is set to the same as the actual historical water level 2566 38 m and that of the dx reservoir is set as the normal water levels throughout the entire period in addition the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir should be lowered below the flood limited water level of 2594 m before july i e the beginning of the flood seasons and this level should be maintained until the end of september i e the end of the flood seasons the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir should be lower than the normal water level of 2600 m during other months i e the non flood seasons the minimum water released from each reservoir should meet the downstream ecological water requirement while the maximum water release is below the designed flood level requirement in this study the downstream ecological water requirement of each month is calculated using the tennant methods guo et al 2019 the reservoir operation optimization using inflow forecasts is performed over 10 consecutive hydrological years from july 2000 to june 2010 the period is selected to ensure that it does not cover the calibration period in a particular foresight period all forecasted inflows are implemented into a hydropower optimization formulation that scheduled reservoir release and executed dispatch choices at the first month directed by the mpc method in this way with one month as a time step there are a total of 120 operation tasks for each configuration the optimization task is solved by applying the gwo algorithm to search for the decision variables based on experimental validation we find that each optimization could reach convergence with the population size npop setting 100 and the maximum number of generation nmaxgen setting 100 3 3 results 3 3 1 individual hybrid model forecasts the non adaptive model na and the single adaptive sa model are used as the benchmark to demonstrate how much improvements can be obtained according to the adaptive hybrid forecasting model statistical analysis is carried out on the forecast evaluation indicators under different foresight horizons the statistical results at tnh and lz stations are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively results clearly show that for both tnh and lz stations the performances of the signal adaptive model are better than those of the non adaptive model for example for the lssvm model at the tnh station compared with the nse value of the non adaptive method ha lssvm the signal adaptive sa lssvm model yields improvements of approximately 7 70 25 76 as for rmse values sa lssvm exhibits a reduction of 9 41 19 76 compared to na lssvm similar results can be obtained by elm lstm and gru models this analysis demonstrates that the adaptive prediction in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback of the time series can efficiently modify forecast model parameters and therefore more accurate forecasts can be achieved for both tnh and lz stations compared with the single model prediction results the hybrid prediction model after processed by vmd is always better than the single model prediction taking tnh station as an example the proposed hybrid method using the lssvm ha lssvm model can reduce the values of rmse by 32 21 54 13 and increase the values of nse by 17 22 23 02 compared to the single lssvm sa lssvm model for all three forecasting models na sa and ha the rmse increases and the nse coefficient decreases as the forecast period increases it is noted that for the na methods all ai based models produce the smallest nse below 0 8 and the highest rmse above 200 m3 s while for the sa method the ai based models only behave relatively good at 1 month ahead in contrast the values of nse for the proposed adaptive hybrid model remain above 0 8 and the values of rmse remain below 150 m3 s which can more satisfy the formulation of reservoir operation moreover the mare can project model performance into various magnitude ranges of the data in this study the mare values associated with the top 95 and bottom 5 data have been calculated respectively the proposed ha models generate much smaller mare 95 values than the other two comparative models for example the mare 95 values of the ha lssvm model at the tnh station are reduced by 5 24 26 15 and 35 91 60 93 respectively compared to the na lssvm and sa lssvm model in contrast there are no apparent increments on mare 5 values between ha lssvm and the other two comparative models the mare 5 values are higher than mare 95 values this is because the bottom streamflow value is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error there is an interesting finding that lssvm is inferior to the two rnn models in the non adaptive experiment i e na while lssvm outperforms lstm and gru when streamflow forecasting takes account of the adaptive mechanism i e sa and ha given the tnh station as an instance the nse values of ha lssvm are higher than that of ha lstm and ha gru while the rmse values of na lssvm are higher than that of na lstm and na gru lstm and gru can generate comparable performance under different forecast horizons in comparison elm performs relatively stable although statistical indicators can accurately assess the predictive power of each dataset of the model the hydrographs and scatter plots can more intuitively assess the temporal correspondence between observed data and model prediction value given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples fig 7 and fig 8 show the hydrograph results of the multi step runoff series predictions for the tnh station it can be seen that the results shown in these two figures are consistent with the statistical results the time series of the ha model the orange line is closest to the ideal series observation the black line and the overall prediction effect is the best followed by sa the green line and na the pink line models as observed from the violin plots ha generates a more similar distribution with the observation than the other two comparative models fig 9 shows the corresponding scatter prediction results for the tnh station it can be clearly seen that the ha model can produce a better agreement between forecasts and observation obviously the proposed ha method performs best when the forecast horizon is one month which is also better than the other comparative models when the foresight period is six months as observed from fig 9 it is worth noting that that the longer the foresight period the worse the fitting effect which is caused by the continuous accumulation of errors clearly the ha model has much higher forecast accuracy than the other two comparative models in the flood seasons and it can well forecast both peak occurrence time and peak flow especially the na model will generally overestimate peak flow in the flood seasons however reservoir managers may plan an advanced release to save storage for the coming floods according to the wrong information resulting in a possible water deficit simultaneously no significant improvements on streamflow forecasts are noted in the dry seasons among na sa and ha models unlike some seasonal forecasts the model in our study is used both in low normal and high flow seasons to improve the overall performance the forecasted peak flow may be lower than the observed one while the forecasted low flow may be higher than the observed one that is to say the proposed ha model cannot always perform well on the whole hydrograph and may fail to forecast in some extreme points i e both high and low flows the hydrographs and scatter plots at the lz station are presented in supplements and similar analysis and results can be obtained 3 3 2 weights combined forecasts each model has its particular strengths and weaknesses meaning that an individual ai based model may have its unavoidable disadvantages and not be able to perform well on the whole hydrograph or different streamflow features our simulations reveal that there are clear differences between the lssvm elm and rnns methods for example for 1 month ahead streamflow prediction at tnh station the mare 95 value obtained by ha lstm 13 56 is higher than that obtained by ha gru 11 06 while mape 5 value of ha lstm 60 67 is much lower than that of ha gru 76 19 this phenomenon can also be detected for the 4 month ahead 11 81 for ha lssvm versus 16 58 for ha gru mare 95 and 80 57 for ha lssvm vs 66 69 for ha gru mare 95 note that the smaller values of mare indicate a better forecasting model the model performance uncertainty makes it necessary to combine individual forecasts the weighted combination forecasts obtained by the mogwo algorithm are displayed in fig 10 and fig 11 for tnh and lz stations in each of the plots the nse rmse and mare 95 are plotted on the x y and z axes respectively the color of the markers indicates the mare 5 values with colors ranging from yellow representing the low value to blue representing the high value the black arrow refers to the direction of optimization thus an ideal solution would be located at the bottom right corner high value of nse and low value of rmse and mare 95 of the plot and represented by a red low mare 5 marker it is depicted that the nse has an inverse relationship with rmse inverse relationship i e the former increase with the increase of the latter while the nse has a positive relationship with the mare 95 positive relationship i e the former increase with the increase of the latter there is a complicated relationship between nse and mare 5 that lower mare 5 values may result in either high nse values or low nse values for example fig 11 d displays that mare 5 values are below 40 m3 s but the values of nse can be higher than 0 9 or lower than 0 8 it is noticeable in fig 10 and fig 11 that the single ai based forecasts can be dominated by the pareto optimal combined forecasts provided by the pareto optimal combined ensemble forecasts more than one solution can dominate each individual forecast model termed as dominated models the model farthest deviating from the individual model of the dominated models is chosen as the target model to quantify the complex skill value relationship the performance of each dominated model during evaluation periods for two hydrological stations are listed in table 5 for example ha lssvm at 1 month ahead generates a forecast with an nse value of 0 961 an rmse value of 87 20 m3 s a mare 95 value of 9 54 and a mare 5 value of 44 99 it is inferior to a forecast selected from the combination sets with values of nse being 0 962 rmse being 86 23 m3 s mare 95 being 8 44 and mare 5 being 38 55 in total for the lz station the weights combined model can increase the values of nse by approximately 0 10 7 79 and decrease the values of rmse mare 95 and mare 5 by approximately 1 08 32 11 0 76 43 85 0 05 80 85 compared to the ha model respectively for the lz station the weights combined model is capable of improving the values of nse by approximately 0 21 7 96 and reducing the values of rmse mare 95 and mare 5 by approximately 1 39 27 14 0 09 42 63 1 16 68 83 compared to the ha model respectively the results mean that the model performance of the combined forecasts is more satisfactory than that of the single hybrid model in addition the pareto optimal combined forecasts have an extension on each performance measure for instance the combined forecasts for 1 month ahead at the tnh station have nse values ranging from 0 778 to 0 964 rmse values ranging from 83 38 m3 s to 207 92 m3 s mape 95 ranging from 2 03 to 10 60 and mape 5 ranging from 20 20 to 80 91 while each individual forecast with performance measures belongs to the corresponding ranges it makes possible that diverse forecasts are determined according to decision makers preferences on different performance indicators forecast skill after multi objective optimization seems still sensitive to lead time for instance it can be seen that the nse values decrease with a range of 0 896 0 962 and the rmse values increase from 86 26 to 142 03 m3 s as the forecast period increases at the lssvm dominated point for the tnh station as above mentioned the mare 5 values are much higher than mare 95 values this is because the bottom streamflow value is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error fig 12 and fig 13 display the forecast results in the validation periods obtained by the combined forecast model for tnh and lz stations given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples the yellow area indicates the ensemble forecasts with a diverse combination of weights and biases it can be found that the different combinations of weights and biases behave similarly in the streamflow forecasting however when it comes to a specific skill score slight differences can be viewed the combined model at 1 month ahead has higher forecast accuracy than that at 6 month ahead in the flood seasons clearly the combined model at 6 month ahead will underestimate several extreme peak flows in the flood seasons an apparent underestimation can also be observed in low flow periods especially for the 6 month ahead forecasts similar to previous studies tan et al 2018 because the combination deals with multi objectives and hence provides a set of pareto optimal solutions we can select different forecasts to answer what other factors influence the forecast skill value relationship e g operational priorities the performance of the indictor based model during evaluation periods for the two hydrological stations is shown in table 6 it is evident that nse based and rmse based models will share the same results due to the inverse relationship between nse and rmse indictors in comparison a mare 95 based model is opposite to a mare 5 based model due to the fact that the objective function used for calibration in a mare 95 based model has the tendency to pay more attention to high flows these forecast models have the feature that moving from one objective to another along the trade off surface results in improving one objective while causing deterioration in at least one other objective in comparison the compromised model that balances the diverse and sometimes conflicting requirements can also be present as a benchmark in the following forecast driven reservoir operations given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples the forecast results in the validation periods obtained by the indicator based forecast model for tnh and lz stations can be found in supplements 3 3 3 forecast driven reservoir operations in this section we explore to identify the relation between the increase in forecast skill and the resulting gain in forecast value the forecast value is presented here as the system hydropower generation in practice the decision making priorities are not solely related to hydropower generation and here we take the indicator of hydropower as an example to help understand the complicated relationship between the forecast skill and its value for decision making the reservoir operation performance obtained by the observed streamflow series is taken as the perfect forecast value and the reservoir operations post evaluated on observation are designed as the actual forecast value the non adaptive na and single adaptive sa models are also presented as the benchmark we start by analyzing the average annual forecast value over the simulation period 2001 2010 for different forecast results na sa ha dominated compromised and perfect as presented in fig 14 the relative improvement in performance with an average value of 0 07 between ha and dominated forecasts is very small while it is larger between ha and na or sa forecasts with average values of 0 96 and 0 48 respectively however the gain in hydropower generation does not always seem to be sensitive to the gain in skill for instance the gains in skill using ha lssvm 528 11 107 kw h or its dominated forecast 527 60 107 kw h at 5 month ahead do not necessarily translate into an improvement in hydropower generation than using sa lssvm forecast 530 00 107 kw h similar results can be obtained by lstm and gru for clarity of illustration we focus on the compromised forecast we choose this forecast because it seems to best reflect the current preferences of the decision maker whose priority is to maintain a good forecast from different perspectives the compromised forecast values at different forecast horizons between 481 22 and 545 22 107 kw h almost outperform all of the compared models the relative improvements are going from 0 02 to 3 39 with very few exceptions all 96 cases but only 5 decreased beyond the specific case investigated here it may provide a useful reference for decision makers to determine an accurate forecast from the ensemble forecasts another interesting observation in fig 14 is that the annual hydropower generation varies widely with the increase of the foresight period the range of variation goes from approximately 470 107 to 540 107 kw h for all forecasts provided by the ensemble forecasts we now analyze the average annual forecast value under four indicator based operational policy scenarios i e nse rmse mare 95 and mare 5 it is evident that nse based and rmse based forecasts will share the same results due to the inverse relationship between nse and rmse indicators table 7 displays the post evaluation annual forecast values under the four operational policy scenarios the distance in operating performance between mare 95 based and mare 5 based forecasts are very small as the forecast period increases when comparing each indicator based forecast with the perfect forecast value respectively we notice that the perfect forecast performs more similarly with the nse based or rmse based forecast than that with the mare based forecast with the top 95 or bottom 5 the reason for this is that the indicator of nse and rmse values is derived from the whole series it is depicted that the compromised operation can outperform the perfect operation at different horizons but it does not always perform better than the four indicator based operations lower than mare 95 based and mare 5 based under 1 month ahead as reported in table 7 at 1 and 2 month ahead in the scenarios where the top 95 dataset are optimized only the forecast value is much better than that in other comparative scenarios while this seems to suggest that peak flow forecast has useful values on hydropower generation it should be noted that in addition to a good performance on peak flow forecasting the general series can fit well with observed series under such a short foresight period the nse or rmse based forecasts are superior to others even though they fail to capture the peak flow at a longer forecast period i e at 5 and 6 month ahead overall the above analysis indicates a necessary accurate forecast on general flow as well as the peak flow last we compare the average seasonal forecast value under four indicator based operational policy scenarios fig 15 as expected the seasonal hydropower generation of autumn jas july august and september accounts for 32 13 38 33 of the annual hydropower generation followed by that of summer amj april may and june and autumn jas july august and september and lowest one is in winter ond october november and december with a range of 10 77 17 94 the results that the perfect forecast performs more similarly with nse or rmse based forecast than that with mare based forecast with the top 95 or bottom 5 can also be found at the seasonal scale the hydropower generation gradually decreases in jas and ond with the increase of forecast periods while that gradually increases in jfm and amj another noticeable finding is that the mare 95 based forecast generates much more hydropower in amj than other indicator based models at a more extended forecast period e g from 3 month ahead to 6 month ahead this is achieved by the fact that a regulatory reservoir can make up low inflow in amj in consideration of accurate peak forecast in jas similar performance can be found in jas obtained by the mare 5 based forecast based on the same reasons 4 discussion 4 1 improved forecast skill in our study we have chosen gwo as the target algorithm to optimize parameters in lssvm and elm due to its advantage of only a few control parameters and easy implementation given the non adaptive forecast na model as an example the lssvm and elm for tnh and lz stations optimized using gsa and alo were presented to demonstrate the better performance of gwo as observed from tables 8 and 9 it was worth noting that elm gwo could produce a better agreement between forecasts and observation than elm gas and elm alo at different forecast times for tnh and lz stations in comparison lssvm gwo lssvm gas lssvm alo obtained similar forecast performance it should be noted that only two parameters in lssvm were optimized while 13 parameters in elm asked for optimization that was to say gwo maintained a much better performance on complicated parameters optimization than alo and gas and could be adopted as the target method as for lstm and gru the gs method was used to select the optimal model structure due to the high parallelism and flexible operation here the non adaptive forecast na model at 1 month ahead was employed as examples to illustrate the track of the optimal model structure of lstm and gru the four performance indictors obtained by different model structures different numbers of hidden units and dropout rate were shown in fig 16 and fig 17 for the tnh station the results indicated that the optimal nse and rmse values were obtained for the model structure with a dropout rate from 0 1 to 0 3 and hidden units from 16 to 64 for both lstm and gru similar results could be obtained for the lz station accordingly an optimal forecast had a lower dropout rate and a more significant number of hidden units zuo et al 2020a have evaluated the dropout rate ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 on the performance index of normalized root mean square error nrmse they also reported that an optimal nrmse value corresponded to a low dropout rate 0 00 in general the forecast performance can be improved using vmd to produce cleaner signals the significant improvements are generated because the hybrid model can take advantage of vmd extracting different resolution intervals and thus the features of each sub series such as periodicity and volatility can then be separated resulting in an impressive reduction in modeling difficulty in other words it is difficult for a single forecasting model to accurately simulate the non linear and non stationary properties of the natural streamflow since only one resolution component is utilized however in many vmd based forecast models the entire time series is decomposed into sub signals and then divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models in such forecast framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment to overcome this drawback in some vmd based forecast models the entire time series is divided into training and validation sets first and later decomposed into sub signals however it can expose the sub signals to the boundary effect zuo et al 2020a zuo et al 2020b making predicting streamflow problematic there are three ways of handling the boundary effect through 1 improving the decomposition algorithms quilty and adamowski 2018 2 reducing the boundary effect zhang et al 2015 3 adapting the boundary effect tan et al 2018 in this study we built an improved decomposition ensemble model that could tolerate the boundary effect whose inputs x came from decomposition during calibration and outputs y were extracted from entire series decomposing generally speaking using an unchanged forecast model may bring significant errors the inputs should be updated as long as new information was appended termed as an adaptive model the adaptive mechanism has been demonstrated as effective and promising in several studies tan et al 2018 guo et al 2020b the models used in our study were also adaptive each decomposition model was updated in the proposed model as long as d period new streamflow information was added we used four ai based models as the target model i e two static models lssvm and elm and two dynamic rnn models lstm and gru section 3 3 1 indicated that lssvm was inferior to the two rnn models in the na experiment while lssvm outperformed lstm and gru when streamflow forecasting took account of the adaptive mechanism i e sa and ha as demonstrated by kratzert et al 2018 and ni et al 2020 rnns could enhance the streamflow forecasting performance by automatically remembering or forgetting the previous input information however the adaptive modification of the forecasting model made it possible to constantly re model the complex input output relationship when both current and historical information is considered hence it made little sense to include the delivery of previous information as for the na experiments lssvm and elm had a constant forecasting model but rnns forgetting previous information to some extent could make sure forecasting dynamic thus leading to the latest information contributing more to forecasting this explained why lstm and gru were superior to lssvm and elm in the non adaptive experiments but inferior in the adaptive experiments lstm and gru could generate comparable performance under different forecast horizons gru had more superficial structures and fewer parameters and required less time for modeling and it might be the preferred method for streamflow forecasts than lstm which was also suggested by gao et al 2020 section 3 3 2 indicated that the proposed combined method with a lack of meteorological observations e g rainfall evaporation and temperature as input predictors outperforms all of the compared methods possible reasons for the superiority of the hybrid method are analyzed below first to tolerate the boundary effect the adaptive appendant was adopted and no future information was included in the predictors when decomposing the streamflow series the adaptive prediction could automatically identify how the nearest historical streamflow information affected the future streamflow and introduce the real time error correction to model parameters second vmd decomposed the original streamflow into different relatively stationary signals facilitating effective identification of noise terms hidden inside the original runoff data series finally instead of selecting a random individual ai based forecast model the swarm intelligence algorithms e g gwo or grid search methods were first adopted to identify the optimal computational parameters and then all individual models were combined and biased based on multi objective optimization algorithms e g mogwo which could effectively improve the generalization ability of each ai based model however the proposed combined method in some cases failed to fit the low streamflow as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the properties of vmd that the reconstruction of sub signals sometimes could not wholly reproduce or even deviate from the original streamflow was believed to have an effect on this underestimation this was because vmd would remove some noise components from the original streamflow zuo et al 2020a zuo et al 2020b in this case even though each sub signal was accurately predicted the proposed ha methods might fail to fit the original streamflow in future work instead of using the summation of the sub signals to predict original streamflow we might directly model the relationship between the sub signals and the original streamflow to eliminate this drawback of vmd 4 2 from forecast skill to value for reservoir managers advanced knowledge of the inflow is beneficial as it allows for better planning the forecast driven operation was performed on a multi hydropower system longyangxia and daxia reservoirs the general assumption was that a gain in forecast skill should result in a gain in forecast value giuliani et al 2020 we first analyzed the average annual forecast value among different forecasts na sa ha dominated compromised and perfect we showed that using information from a multi step forecast ensemble to predict the inflows into the reservoirs and inform the operating decision could increase hydropower generation both dominated and compromised forecasts values were better than the perfect forecast value nevertheless there were few exceptions e g sa lssvm forecasts performed better than ha lssvm forecasts at 5 month ahead through comparing the differences between ha and dominated forecasts high forecast skill to ha and na low forecast skill or ha and sa forecasts low forecast skill we also found that it would have no significant effect on forecast value when the forecast skill increased to a high degree the compromised forecast could maintain a good forecast from different perspectives and be typically treated as the preferred forecast in reality it generated the hydropower generation at different forecast horizons ranging from 481 22 to 545 22 107 kw h and would almost outperform all of the compared models the relative improvements were between 0 02 and 3 39 with very few exceptions all 96 cases but only 5 decreased it indicated that improved forecasts proposed in our study were potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions the relationship between forecast skill and value seemed to be relatively weak for example at 1 month ahead the ha lssvm forecast achieved nse increases of 30 57 with respect to the na lssvm forecast but it would only improve hydropower generation by 0 34 however when calculating the relative change on nse between two models it should be noted that even a small deviation will lead to a large relative improvement since the nse value was smaller than one in comparison the hydropower generation value was around 500 107 kw h a slight relative improvement could maintain an absolute increase by 1 63 107 kw h it was valuable to the yellow river while we found a relatively weak relationship between forecast skill and value we also found that the relationship was not linear and positive and was strongly affected by the decision makers priorities as also demonstrated by peñuela et al 2020 this was obtained according to the comparison on forecast value among the four indicator based operational policy scenarios i e nse rmse mare 95 and mare 5 as they came from the same set of pareto optimal solutions it might be hard to identify which forecast was the best however once they were used to inform decision making they behaved differently on forecast value recall that the mare 95 based forecast was opposite to the mare 5 based forecast due to the fact that the objective function used for calibration in the mare 95 based forecast tended to pay more attention to high flows nevertheless as the foresight period increased mare 95 based and mare 5 based forecasts performed similarly and they were even inferior to the nse rmse based or the compromised forecasts the general relationship between the forecast skill and forecast value might be limited by the deterministic optimization operation in our study anghileri et al 2019 reported that if the full streamflow forecast ensemble was used for example in a stochastic optimization scheme the value could be further enhanced because the optimization could account for the entire uncertainty provided by the ensemble forecast several studies have demonstrated that stochastic optimization operation could weaken the linear or positive relationship between forecast skill and value ficchì et al 2016 guo et al 2020a guo et al 2020b guo et al 2020c peñuela et al 2020 it would be interesting to analyze reservoir operations performance when accounting for forecast uncertainty for a real time optimization based on medium and long term forecasts the biggest challenge was the absence of enough foresight periods anghileri et al 2019 as shown in fig 14 the annual hydropower generation varied widely with the increase of foresight periods the apparent improvement was due to the fact that a longer forecast period was equal to a longer operation period as there was no enough complementation within streamflow under a shorter forecast operating horizon the hydropower generation was mainly dominated by the reservoir inflow the reservoir would release a lot at the beginning of the operation period to maximize the hydropower generation leading to a low fore bay level during the last long term period in comparison for the sake of the whole operating period the reservoir would take account of both current and future reservoir information under a longer forecast horizon this was also why the hydropower generation gradually decreases in jas and ond with the increase of forecast periods while gradually increases in jfm and amj this illustrated the importance of forecast horizons and it was necessary to lengthen the forecast horizon and therefore operating horizon in a real time optimization system informed by seasonal forecasts to improve reservoir operation 5 conclusions this work focused on an improved combined model for streamflow forecasts and an exploration of the relation between forecast skill and value monthly streamflow data from two stations in the yellow river china tangnaihai and lanzhou stations were collected to demonstrate the forecast skill of the developed model while the forecast value was obtained according to a real time multi hydropower system longyangxia and daxia reservoirs the combined forecast model consisted of two components one was an internal model including four hybrid adaptive ai based models coupled with adaptive appendant data decomposition and parameter optimization the other one was an external ensemble model determining the optimal combining weights and biases based on the individual forecasts through optimizing performance measures taking the non adaptive non decomposition and individual forecast models for comparative analysis the combined forecast model could provide better forecasting results from 1 month ahead to 6 month ahead and was a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of middle and long term streamflow prediction the relative improvement in performance with an average value of 0 07 between using ha and dominated forecasts is very small while it is larger between using ha and na or sa forecasts with average values of 0 96 and 0 48 respectively it indicated that the use of middle and long term forecasts could improve the efficiency of reservoir operation but the forecast value would have no significant changes when the forecast skill increased to a high degree the relative improvement in hydropower generation going from 0 02 to 3 39 of the compromised forecasts indicates that improved forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions according to the four indicator based operational policy scenarios the relationship between the forecast skill and its value for decision making was strongly affected by decision makers priorities in summary it was necessary to extend the forecast horizon and therefore operating horizon in a real time optimization system informed by seasonal forecasts to improve reservoir operation overall our study provided some nice insights into the streamflow forecasts with a lack of meteorological observations as input predictors and the complex relationship between forecast skill and its value for decision making although the results we obtained in this study were specific to the uyrb such a multi step forecast generation and a multi reservoir forecast driven operation could be further applied to other study sites however our informed operation work was also subject to some limitations that could be overcome in future studies first the current forecast value was mainly evaluated upon hydropower a reservoir was usually performed for multiple purposes including additional objectives not accounted for in our model rather than hydropower generation only forecast value was generally expected to increase with forecast skill but it might also vary based on other factors such as operational objectives future studies would extend the analysis to other economic sectors e g water supply flood protection or other irrigated agricultural systems e g agriculture allocations it should be noted that uyrb is comprised of 25 reservoirs with 16 3483 gw of total installed capacity however we have only considered two reservoirs for performance evaluation in uyrb i e lyx and dx reservoirs in addition to it the operation of the reservoirs located upstream definitely influences the amount of water available in the river as streamflow due to the limitation of data availability we were not able to quantify the effects of upstream river flow regulation on lanzhou station and thereby the performance of the dx reservoir it would be more comprehensive and useful to operate all reservoirs and evaluate their performance on both prediction and operation in addition how to efficiently couple the short term forecasts with the long term forecasts and inform the multi reservoir operation in the yellow river or other basins can be investigated in further studies another limitation in the presented results was the relatively normal points used to fit the forecast skill value relationship to improve our understanding of the forecast skill value relationship as well as make forecast information more valuable it would also be interesting to test the sensitivity of our results to the use of multiple events e g more frequent and intense extreme events like drought or typhoon events credit authorship

4252,stochastic nature of streamflow poses significant challenges in attaining a reliable forecasting model in general variational mode decomposition vmd can improve the forecast performance but easily expose the sub signals to boundary effect furthermore one model is not able to adapt all properties of different sub series accordingly we have two aims in this study one is to propose an adaptive weight combined forecasting model to improve the middle and long term streamflow forecast skill it adapts the boundary effect in such a way that its inputs come from decomposition during calibration sets and outputs are extracted from decomposition during the entire series the other one is to link system performance improvement i e the forecast skill to the forecast value to address the gap in methodologies appropriate for data limited locations only hydrological time series collected four artificial intelligence based models coupled with adaptive appendant and parameter optimization are developed as hybrid adaptive ha for forecasting each sub signal decomposed by vmd in the proposed forecast model the multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo algorithm is then employed to combine individual forecasts based on performance based weighting strategies and provide the pareto optimal ensemble forecasts the proposed model is applied to forecast streamflow 1 to 6 months ahead of two stations in the yellow river china and the results show that the ensemble forecasts can increase the values of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient by 0 10 7 96 and reducing the values of root mean squared error by 1 08 32 11 compared to the ha model the relationship between the forecast skill and its value can be strongly affected by decision makers priorities but the relative improvement in hydropower generation obtained by the compromised forecasts going from 0 02 to 3 39 indicates that improved forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions keywords streamflow forecast forecast skill value relationship weights combined forecasts ai based model hydropower generation 1 introduction accurate middle and long term streamflow forecasts are vital for water resource managers to maximize water use potential over long periods tan et al 2018 numerous physical models have been proposed to forecast streamflow in the past decades meng et al 2017 patil and ramsankaran 2017 nanda et al 2019 giuliani et al 2020 however data requirements parameter uncertainties and structure complexities mean the physical models may not be readily used in some applications an alternative is to use data driven models due to their ease of implementation low information requirements and rapid real time operation features ahani et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 yaghoubi et al 2019 the last few decades have seen a rapidly growing interest in forecasting streamflow time series using data driven models tongal and booij 2018 yaseen et al 2018 luo et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 saraiva et al 2021 two major types of forecast models i e statistical models and artificial intelligence based ai based models have been well studied and investigated in the literature statistical models like multiple linear regression and autoregressive moving average models assume that the relationship between input and output is linear mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 such models will limit the model s capability to handle non linear time series in comparison the ai based models are successful in modeling and forecasting non linear hydrological processes guo et al 2020c niu et al 2020a the widely used ai based approaches include back propagation neural networks bpnn li et al 2018 extreme learning machine elm adnan et al 2019 and least squares support vector machine lssvm guo et al 2020b due to the successful development of deep learning technology deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks rnns have achieved great success in forecasting fields long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru are two of the most popular rnns in the field of deep learning which have been used to tackle runoff forecast problems in recent years bi et al 2020 gao et al 2020 guo et al 2020c however it remains challenging to accurately forecast non linear and non stationary features together only using single ai based models in contrast hybrid models that couple decomposition ensemble technology and ai techniques can take advantage of their capability to extract useful information hidden in complex hydrological time series and thus make an improved ai based forecast model wavelet transform wt empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd are commonly used techniques that decompose the original signal into several sub signals that can be easily modeled by ai based methods fang et al 2019 meng et al 2019 rezaie balf et al 2019 sun et al 2019 hadi et al 2020 niu et al 2020b zuo et al 2020b in many hybrid models the entire time series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some ai based models in such forecast framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment zuo et al 2020a however the validation information is not available at the present moment for streamflow forecasting therefore streamflow hindcasting is not practical for a real forecast the entire streamflow series should be first divided into training and validation sets and the training set is then decomposed into sub signals and applied to train the forecast models in addition the decomposition results vary with the length of the time series and thus the use of a predefined decomposition model in the calibration period may bring significant errors tan et al 2018 each model has its particular strengths and weaknesses indicating that an individual ai based model may have its unavoidable disadvantages and not be able to adapt to all properties of different sub series in comparison studies on the combined forecast methods have achieved remarkable attention more and more studies have shown that the combined forecast models can achieve higher forecasting accuracy and better forecasting stability than the single model forecasting zhang et al 2017 jiang and liu 2019 wu et al 2020 the principle of the combined models is to obtain the optimal combining weights through maximizing forecast performance between the ordinary series and combining forecasts forecast skill is often characterized by attributes such as reliability sharpness bias and accuracy there is no single objective function that can represent all the features of runoff hydrographs liu et al 2019 in this case how to determine the weights in a combined model is a multi objective optimization problem and thus can be solved by multi objective evolutional algorithms moeas e g non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 spea2 and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso quinn et al 2017 fang et al 2018 tian et al 2019 guo et al 2020a gupta et al 2020 recently grey wolf optimizer gwo mirjalili et al 2014 inspired by the headship hierarchy and hunting strategy of grey wolves has attracted wide attention which is demonstrated more suitable than other prevalent optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso gravitational search algorithm gsa and ant lion optimizer alo bilandi et al 2020 guo et al 2020b naserbegi et al 2020 asghari et al 2021 el zeiny et al 2021 the multi objective grey wolf optimization mogwo mirjalili et al 2016 inheriting the merits of the original gwo has been successfully applied in some fields li et al 2019 karakoyun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 fountas and vaxevanidis 2021 but rarely in the hydrological field streamflow forecasts are gradually used to design reservoir operation options the term forecast value represents the operational value realized through the use of forecasts in decision making yang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge however while a considerable research effort has been made to develop methods to improve forecast skill and the criterion to quantify forecast skill the evaluation of forecast value is still lacking and very recently started to appear forecast value is generally expected to increase with forecast skill but it may also vary based on other factors such as operational strategies shamir 2017 alexander et al 2020 hadi et al 2020 several studies even disprove the assumption that higher skill always leads to improved decisions goddard et al 2010 anghileri et al 2019 a forecast driven optimization operation is often performed for a fixed time horizon at monthly or seasonal time resolution however there is often a mismatch between the information needed for reservoir operations and the skillful lead time of the reservoir inflow forecast anghileri et al 2016 therefore to enhance reservoir operation it is necessary to acquire knowledge on how decisions with different horizons impact a forecast driven operation in this study we try to answer the two following questions 1 how to improve streamflow forecast skill 2 what factors will influence the forecast skill value relationship building on the above mentioned studies we propose an ai based forecast driven management framework in this study aiming 1 to develop a novel multi step combined model for improving streamflow forecast skill 2 to evaluate the forecast skill value relationship through informing reservoir operational decisions vmd first decomposes the original time series into a finite set of sub components in the combined forecast model the ai based models including elm lssvm lstm and gru with an adaptive mechanism are developed to forecast each decomposition signal the individual forecasts are obtained by reconstructing the sub series to further improve the forecasting capacity of the combined model the mogwo algorithm is employed to determine the optimal coefficients of weight and bias and the final forecast results can be integrated from each hybrid ai based model in the reservoir operation framework forecast driven operations using model predictive control are developed and system performances will be measured in terms of hydropower generation the ai based forecast driven management framework is tested on the upper yellow river basin china the adaptive multi step combined forecast model is used to model and forecast streamflow of two stations from 1 month ahead to 6 month ahead then the forecast driven operation is performed on a multi hydropower system our contributions are as follows 1 an adaptive weight combined forecasting model is developed for multi step streamflow forecasting both decomposition and forecast models are highly adaptive future information is not used in the decomposition ensemble framework to improve the forecast efficiency and boundary effect is tolerated to improve forecast accuracy 2 mogwo algorithm is developed to find the optimal weights of the combined model fast and accuratly multi objective optimization determining model weights can overcome the drawbacks that no single objective function can represent all the features of runoff hydrographs 3 our work couples a skillful statistical streamflow forecast with a non site specific multi reservoir model to inform operations it aims to address the gap in methodologies appropriate for data limited locations only hydrological time series collected and help understand how the system and its optimization model are sensitive to streamflow forecasts of different skill and operational strategies 2 methodology the experimental approach followed in the study is shown in fig 1 and described in the following sections 2 1 adaptive multi step combined forecast model many studies have reported that it was difficult to conclude which individual model provides the best streamflow prediction the combined forecasting model integrating the results of several models makes it a more promising model than individual ones generally we can determine the model weights by averaging all available forecasts in contrast we can also choose to minimize several cost functions or objective criteria to obtain combination of weights and biases in this case a combined forecast model consists of two components one is an internal forecast model including some individual models and the other one is an external ensemble model eliminating the model uncertainty according to different forecasts the main procedure of the proposed combined forecast model is presented in fig 2 2 1 1 internal individual forecast model it is convenient that emd and eemd automatically decompose modal components based on data however they may suffer mode aliasing and endpoint effects during the decomposition process in comparison vmd firstly proposed by dragomiretskiy in 2014 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 is an adaptive signal processing method it decomposes the signal into non recursive and variational modes controls the convergence conditions and achieves adaptive decomposition of the non stationary signal it has been reported that vmd can obtain higher forecast accuracy and greater robustness than emd or eemd in many several pieces of literature hu et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 therefore the vmd method is developed to decompose the original streamflow series practically four individual ai based models are used as the internal forecast models to generate the multi step streamflow forecasts including extreme learning machine elm least square support vector machine lssvm long short term memory network lstm and gated recurrent unit gru the detailed descriptions of the four ai based models can be found in supplements the forecast accuracy of the ai based model is easily affected by the parameters for example the values of weights and biases in elm are randomly chosen at the beginning of training therefore the parameters in ai based models are normally optimized by minimizing the differences between the observed and forecasting values using many optimization methods such as gsa alo gwo and grid search gs gwo proposed in 2014 mirjalili et al 2014 is a relatively novel meta heuristic algorithm better performance on parameters optimization has been reported than other algorithms including ga pso gsa and alo bilandi et al 2020 guo et al 2020b naserbegi et al 2020 asghari et al 2021 el zeiny et al 2021 in our study the parameters in lssvm and elm are optimized by the gwo algorithm it can be named gwo lssvm and gwo elm due to the high parallelism and flexible operation gs is widely used in deep neural networks yoo 2019 priyadarshini and cotton 2021 therefore lstm and gru are optimized by the gs method which can be represented by gs lstm and gs gru according to the above introduction the internal forecasting model is first based on data decomposition by vmd and then forecasting by hybrid ai based models 2 1 1 1 decomposition vmd vmd is a novel signal process method it aims to decompose a non stationary signal f into an ensemble of k imf components u k k 1 2 k with a center frequency of w k its main principle is iteratively searching for the optimal solution of a constrained variational problem through minimizing each imf s center frequency and bandwidth the constrained variational problem can be expressed as dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 1 min u k w k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 subject to k 1 k u k t f t where δ t is the dirac distribution is the convolution operator e j w k t is the phasor description of the center frequency of the modal function on the complex plane a quadratic penalty term α and lagrangian multipliers λ are introduced to transform the constrained variational problem into an unconstrained problem to obtain the optimal solution the augmented lagrangian is described as follows dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 2 l u k w k λ α k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 f t k 1 k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k 1 k u k t the saddle point of the augmented lagrangian function is then calculated using the alternate direction method of multipliers and to determine the optimal solutions u k and w k the specific decomposition steps are as follows step 1 define the number of modes k step 2 initialize parameters u k 1 w k 1 and λ set the number of iterations n 1 step 3 update u k and w k by eqs 3 5 3 u k n 1 w f w i 1 k 1 u i n w λ w 2 1 2 α w w k 2 4 w k n 1 0 w u k n 1 w 2 d w 0 u k n 1 w 2 d w 5 λ n 1 w λ n w τ f w k 1 k u k n 1 w where u k n 1 w λ w and x w are the fourier transforms of the signal u k n 1 t λ t and x t respectively τ is the update coefficient of the lagrangian multiplication usually τ 0 step 4 let n n 1 repeat the above step 3 until the following conditions are met 6 k 1 k u k n 1 u k n 2 2 u k n 2 2 ε where ε is a convergence threshold usually ε 1e 6 according to the above variational mode decomposition theory there are two parameters that should be defined in advance they are the mode number k and the quadratic penalty term α 2 1 1 2 proposed hybrid adaptive forecasting model the process of the hybrid adaptive ha forecasting model is described as follows step 1 parameter initialization initialize the parameters used in the hybrid forecasting model step 2 data decomposition the original non stationary series is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions imfs y k k 1 2 k using vmd specifically determining the optimal decomposition level k by observing the center frequency aliasing phenomenon of the last sub signal was suggested in this study step 3 adaptive appendant according to the adaptive strategy shown in fig 3 sequentially append the new data to the original set to generate new appended signals decompose each appended signal into k sets of appended sub signals x k k 1 2 k using vmd it should be noted that the number of decomposition components is constant with the length of the time series step 4 sample generation assume that the predicted target is y k t d d is the leading time and the predictors are x k t l x k t l 1 x k t 1 x k t l is the previous lag generate modeling samples using the sub signals as shown in table 1 then divide the sub signals into an initial training set where the training set length is 70 of the data length and a validation set where the validation set length is 30 of the data length step 5 adaptive bias corrected forecasts the internal steps in detail are as follows i initialize the data number in the validation period m 1 ii calibrate ai based models for each sub series and calculate the bias between the simulation and observation of each sub series in the training period iii forecast each sub series for the d period ahead x k v a l i m m m m d using the direct strategies described as follows 7 horizon t 1 q t 1 f f q t q t 1 q t l horizon t 1 q t 2 f f q t q t 1 q t l horizon t 1 q t d f f q t q t 1 q t l iv calibrate ai based models for each sub series bias and then forecast each sub series bias for d period ahead bia s k v a l i m m m m d using the direct strategies x k v a l i m plus bia s k v a l i m are treated as the real forecasts v append x k v a l i m m m m d into the calibration data vi if m m l stop otherwise let m m d and then repeat steps ii to iv step 6 forecast reconstruction the prediction results of each imf component are summarized and the final prediction results are obtained 2 1 2 external ensemble forecast model forecast combination is performed based on the fact that no single model could capture any specific time series pattern a better choice is pooling forecasts obtained from different forecasting models zhou et al 2019 the method tries to determine the optimal combining weights and biases through optimizing performance measures between the ordinary series and combining forecasts the combining forecasts can be given by 8 y q w t b q 1 1 q 2 1 q t 1 q 1 2 q 2 2 q t 2 q 1 n q 2 n q t n w 1 w 2 w n b where q is the matrix comprises of the forecasts from individual models w is the weighting matrix i 1 n w i 1 b is bias and n is the numbers of the individual forecast model the method now requires the optimization of performance measures one must not rely solely on any single indicator when evaluating the performance of hydrological forecast models low flow forecasting plays an vitial role in water resource management as emergency measures should be taken in time to ensure normal water supply besides peak flow forecasting is important to disseminate information on reservoir operation and timely flood warning consequently indicators utilized to evaluate model accuracy and forecast ability of high or low magnitude data in this study consist of nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse karunanithi et al 1994 and mean absolute relative error mare γ xie et al 2019 which are commonly used in the field of streamflow forecasting the nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the data series and can describe the tracking ability of the predicted value to the measured value and it is used to evaluate the stability of the predicted values the rmse represents the error between the forecasted and observed values and it is used to characterize the overall prediction precision the mare γ computes the average absolute relative error between the forecasted and observed values of the top or low γ streamflow data and it is used to identify the forecast accuracy of different magnitude 9 max n s e 1 t 1 t q t o q t f t 1 t q t o q o 10 min r m s e 1 t t 1 t q t o q t f 2 11 min mare γ 1 t γ t 1 t γ q t o q t f q t o 100 where q o is the observed streamflow and q f is the forecasted streamflow m3 s q o is the mean values of the observed streamflow m3 s t γ is the number of the top bottom γ streamflow data the nse can be used to evaluate the stability of the forecasted value and the nse value is 1 rmse is used to characterize the overall forecast accuracy while mare computes the average absolute relative error of predicts of the top bottom γ streamflow data mae and mare values are 0 it is clear from the definitions of these indicators that a model with larger values of nse or smaller values of rmse and mare provides better forecasting accuracy than other comparative models several studies showed no single objective function representing all the features of runoff hydrographs such as the peak flow and runoff volume thus the forecast models should be calibrated over more than one performance indicator based on multi objective optimization algorithms 2 2 multi objective grey wolf optimizer algorithm gwo proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 is a new single objective optimization algorithm it is inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves there is a strict social dominant hierarchy in grey wolves including the alpha wolves α the beta wolves β the delta wolves δ and the omega wolves ω the positions of a grey wolf in gwo are updated according to the positions of α β and δ by the following strategies mirjalili et al 2014 12 d p c x p t x t x t 1 1 3 p α β δ x p t a d p where d p represents the distance between the grey wolf and prey x p t and x t are the position of prey and grey wolf at tth iteration respectively c and a are coefficient vectors which can be calculated as follows 13 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 a r 2 a 2 2 t t max where r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in 0 1 t max is the maximum number of iterations unlike single objective optimization aiming to obtain a single solution multi objective optimization is concerned with finding non dominant solutions termed as pareto solutions in this study the multi objective grey wolf optimizer mogwo is applied to calibrate the combined forecast model mogwo developed by mirjalili et al 2016 is extended from gwo in such a way that two added components are employed to accommodate multi objective optimization problems one component is a fix sized external archive to store the current non dominant solutions during each iteration by comparing the newly obtained solution with the archive solutions the individuals in the external archive are updated once numbers exceed the archive limitation the grid mechanism is first performed to re arrange the objective space segmentation then one of the solutions in the most crowded segment is randomly deleted while the new solution is inserted into the least crowded segment the other component is a selection strategy to determine the wolf leader according to the roulette wheel method in such a mechanism shown in eq 14 the less crowded segment has a higher probability of generating new leaders mirjalili et al 2016 14 p i c n i where c is a constant number greater than one and n is the number of obtained pareto optimal solutions in the ith segment the pseudocodes of gwo and mogwo can be found in supplements 2 3 forecast driven operations using model predictive control model predictive control mpc uses forecast data to determine future environmental conditions e g reservoir release pricing signals and energy asset status over a specified time horizon rawlings 2000 in our study mpc performs reservoir operation in such a way that the forecasts are implemented into an optimization formulation that schedules reservoir release and executes dispatch choices at the first time step once new forecasts are generated the later optimal dispatch for the next time step is revised using the updated forecasts the procedure of mpc for reservoir operation is shown in fig 4 the optimization formulation consists of an objective function and constraints here the maximization of the total power generation is chosen as the objective function and the mathematical formula can be established as below max e t 1 t p 1 p a p q p t e h p t δ t 15 h p t 1 2 z p t u z p t 1 u z p t d where e is the total generation of hydropower system p is the number of reservoirs t is the number of periods δt is the time period hp t z p t u and z p t d are the water head forebay water level and downstream water level of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively q p t e is the turbine discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period and ap is the generation coefficient of the p th hydropower reservoir the objective function is subject to the following operating constraints 1 water balance equation 16 v p t 1 v p t i p t q p t e q p t s δ t where ip t q p t e and q p t s are the inflow turbine discharge and surplus discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively vp t is the storage volume of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period 2 storage volume constraint 17 v p t min v p t v p t max where v p t min and v p t max are the minimum and maximum reservoir storage of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively v p t f z p t u f denotes the non linear functions between storage and water level of the p th hydropower reservoir 3 turbine discharge constraints 18 q p t e min q p t e q p t e max where q p t e min and q p t e max are the minimum and maximum turbine discharge of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 4 reservoir release constraints 19 q p t min q p t e q p t s q p t max where q p t min and q p t max are the minimum and maximum reservoir release of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 5 power output constraints 20 p p t min a p q p t e h p t p p t max where p p t min and p p t max are the minimum and maximum power outputs of the p th hydropower reservoir at the t th period respectively 3 case studies 3 1 study area and data the yellow river is the second longest river in china and ranked as the sixth longest river globally with the total length estimated to be approximately 5464 km and the drainage basin covering 75 3 104 km2 deng et al 2020 the upper yellow river basin uyrb as shown in fig 5 is one of the thirteen major hydropower bases in china si et al 2019 twenty five reservoirs have been built or planned in this area with 16 3483 gw of total installed capacity undertaking the important task of transporting clean energy to the north west electricity network accordingly accurate streamflow forecasts are essential to assure high hydropower generation in uyrb tangnaihai tnh and lanzhou lz stations are located in the mainstream of the yellow river the monthly streamflow datasets obtained at tnh and lz stations in uyrb are used to demonstrate the adaptive bias corrected combined forecasts model both streamflow series are naturalized which means the effects of human activities have been removed the non parametric mann kendall mk trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to explore the presence of monotonic trends for the two time series it indicates that the two time series show a non significant decrease the test statistic z of the tnh station is 1 698 while that of the lz station is 1 670 the runoff series of the tnh station covers a period of 576 months from january 1963 to december 2010 while that of the lz station covers a period of 660 months from january 1956 to december 2010 for each case 70 of the streamflow series were selected as the initial training set while 30 of the streamflow series were selected as the validation set to further verify whether improved forecasts lead to improved values or not the downstream reservoirs are used to tackle the hydropower generation problems by implementing the forecasts as the reservoir inflow in this case longyangxia and daxia reservoirsare selected as the corresponding reservoirs of which tnh station mainly controls longyangxia inflow and daxia inflow is represented by lz station the lyx reservoir is normally treated as the first reservoir in uyrb while there are several reservoirs located upstream of the dx reservoir most of the reservoirs located upstream of the dx reservoir are run off river reservoirs which approximately release the same volume as the inflow and have no influence on dx reservoir there is an exception that the lijaxia ljx reservoir is a yearly regulated reservoir which can have an effect on the monthly inflow of the dx reservoir however due to the limitation of data availability we are not able to collect the inflow information for the ljx reservoir in our study we have to ignore the influence of ljx reservoir on dx reservoir and have an assumption that the inflow of dx reservoir is controlled by the release of lyx and the interval inflow between two reservoirs the main characteristics of longyangxia lyx and daxia dx reservoirs are shown in table 2 3 2 model development 3 2 1 data decomposition with vmd as suggested by zuo et al 2020a the quadratic penalty term α and the convergence tolerance ɛ of vmd are generally set to 2000 and 1e 9 respectively we can determine the optimal decomposition mode number of vmd through the aliasing phenomenon of the center frequency of the last imf given vmd of lz station as an example we evaluate k from k 2 to k 9 the 9th imf of lz exhibits an apparent aliasing phenomenon area surrounded by a red rectangular border in fig 6 therefore to avoid spurious components as much as possible the k of vmd for the lz station is chosen as 8 similarly the k of vmd for the tnh station is chosen as 9 3 2 2 forecast computational setting gwo optimizes the parameters in lssvm and elm the ranges of σ and γ are set as 0 1 1000 and 0 1 100 respectively the initial weights and biases in elm are set to 1 1 selecting the hyperparameters of lstm and gru models such as the number of hidden layers hidden units the dropout rate and the learning rate remains a difficult task the number of batches is set to 512 as used by kratzert et al 2018 because the decomposed sub signals are relatively stationary the low number of hidden layer is sufficient for simulating the predictor predict and streamflow relationship therefore the number of hidden layers is set to 1 as used by zuo et al 2020a the hidden units and the dropout rate are optimized by the grid search gs method while the learning rate is set as 0 1 and the other hyperparameters of the lstm models are set to default values in tensor flow as zuo et al 2020a suggested the number of hidden units is designed as 2 4 8 16 32 and 64 to avoid overfitting of lstm and gru the dropout rate is designed based on 10 levels ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 further the entire data in rnns lstm and gru is divided into two subsets including a training set and a validation set to avoid the over fitting problem in the ai based model the training set is used to compute the gradient and update the weights and biases of the network while the validation set over which the errors are monitored during the training process and is used to decide when to stop training after each ai based model completes forecasts the mogwo algorithm is applied to calibrate the combined forecast model with a diverse combination of weights and biases based on experiments the population size npop setting the maximum number of generation nmaxgen and the external archive size nea are set to 100 10000 and 1000 respectively it should be noted that the adaptive mechanism may be time consuming as we set a long validation period however this problem exists only in our research stage and will not limit the practical application of the adaptive mechanism in a real world forecast managers just need to forecast the streamflow of the next few periods without validation as the forecast continues the validation set data are appended into the calibration set gradually in the adaptive forecast experiment and thus the calibration period will always change therefore in the following sections we only show the forecast results in the validation period besides hydrological forecasting accuracy the length of the foresight period is also of great significance for guiding reservoir operation to analyze the complicated relationship between skill and performance in streamflow forecasts and reservoir operation together 1 2 3 4 5 6 month ahead are selected as the target forecast horizon 3 2 3 reservoir operation computational setting the reservoir operation system contains two reservoirs i e lyx and dx reservoirs lyx reservoir is a regulatory reservoir while the dx reservoir is considered as a run of river hydropower station referred to si et al 2019 the initial fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir is set to the same as the actual historical water level 2566 38 m and that of the dx reservoir is set as the normal water levels throughout the entire period in addition the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir should be lowered below the flood limited water level of 2594 m before july i e the beginning of the flood seasons and this level should be maintained until the end of september i e the end of the flood seasons the fore bay water level of the lyx reservoir should be lower than the normal water level of 2600 m during other months i e the non flood seasons the minimum water released from each reservoir should meet the downstream ecological water requirement while the maximum water release is below the designed flood level requirement in this study the downstream ecological water requirement of each month is calculated using the tennant methods guo et al 2019 the reservoir operation optimization using inflow forecasts is performed over 10 consecutive hydrological years from july 2000 to june 2010 the period is selected to ensure that it does not cover the calibration period in a particular foresight period all forecasted inflows are implemented into a hydropower optimization formulation that scheduled reservoir release and executed dispatch choices at the first month directed by the mpc method in this way with one month as a time step there are a total of 120 operation tasks for each configuration the optimization task is solved by applying the gwo algorithm to search for the decision variables based on experimental validation we find that each optimization could reach convergence with the population size npop setting 100 and the maximum number of generation nmaxgen setting 100 3 3 results 3 3 1 individual hybrid model forecasts the non adaptive model na and the single adaptive sa model are used as the benchmark to demonstrate how much improvements can be obtained according to the adaptive hybrid forecasting model statistical analysis is carried out on the forecast evaluation indicators under different foresight horizons the statistical results at tnh and lz stations are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively results clearly show that for both tnh and lz stations the performances of the signal adaptive model are better than those of the non adaptive model for example for the lssvm model at the tnh station compared with the nse value of the non adaptive method ha lssvm the signal adaptive sa lssvm model yields improvements of approximately 7 70 25 76 as for rmse values sa lssvm exhibits a reduction of 9 41 19 76 compared to na lssvm similar results can be obtained by elm lstm and gru models this analysis demonstrates that the adaptive prediction in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback of the time series can efficiently modify forecast model parameters and therefore more accurate forecasts can be achieved for both tnh and lz stations compared with the single model prediction results the hybrid prediction model after processed by vmd is always better than the single model prediction taking tnh station as an example the proposed hybrid method using the lssvm ha lssvm model can reduce the values of rmse by 32 21 54 13 and increase the values of nse by 17 22 23 02 compared to the single lssvm sa lssvm model for all three forecasting models na sa and ha the rmse increases and the nse coefficient decreases as the forecast period increases it is noted that for the na methods all ai based models produce the smallest nse below 0 8 and the highest rmse above 200 m3 s while for the sa method the ai based models only behave relatively good at 1 month ahead in contrast the values of nse for the proposed adaptive hybrid model remain above 0 8 and the values of rmse remain below 150 m3 s which can more satisfy the formulation of reservoir operation moreover the mare can project model performance into various magnitude ranges of the data in this study the mare values associated with the top 95 and bottom 5 data have been calculated respectively the proposed ha models generate much smaller mare 95 values than the other two comparative models for example the mare 95 values of the ha lssvm model at the tnh station are reduced by 5 24 26 15 and 35 91 60 93 respectively compared to the na lssvm and sa lssvm model in contrast there are no apparent increments on mare 5 values between ha lssvm and the other two comparative models the mare 5 values are higher than mare 95 values this is because the bottom streamflow value is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error there is an interesting finding that lssvm is inferior to the two rnn models in the non adaptive experiment i e na while lssvm outperforms lstm and gru when streamflow forecasting takes account of the adaptive mechanism i e sa and ha given the tnh station as an instance the nse values of ha lssvm are higher than that of ha lstm and ha gru while the rmse values of na lssvm are higher than that of na lstm and na gru lstm and gru can generate comparable performance under different forecast horizons in comparison elm performs relatively stable although statistical indicators can accurately assess the predictive power of each dataset of the model the hydrographs and scatter plots can more intuitively assess the temporal correspondence between observed data and model prediction value given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples fig 7 and fig 8 show the hydrograph results of the multi step runoff series predictions for the tnh station it can be seen that the results shown in these two figures are consistent with the statistical results the time series of the ha model the orange line is closest to the ideal series observation the black line and the overall prediction effect is the best followed by sa the green line and na the pink line models as observed from the violin plots ha generates a more similar distribution with the observation than the other two comparative models fig 9 shows the corresponding scatter prediction results for the tnh station it can be clearly seen that the ha model can produce a better agreement between forecasts and observation obviously the proposed ha method performs best when the forecast horizon is one month which is also better than the other comparative models when the foresight period is six months as observed from fig 9 it is worth noting that that the longer the foresight period the worse the fitting effect which is caused by the continuous accumulation of errors clearly the ha model has much higher forecast accuracy than the other two comparative models in the flood seasons and it can well forecast both peak occurrence time and peak flow especially the na model will generally overestimate peak flow in the flood seasons however reservoir managers may plan an advanced release to save storage for the coming floods according to the wrong information resulting in a possible water deficit simultaneously no significant improvements on streamflow forecasts are noted in the dry seasons among na sa and ha models unlike some seasonal forecasts the model in our study is used both in low normal and high flow seasons to improve the overall performance the forecasted peak flow may be lower than the observed one while the forecasted low flow may be higher than the observed one that is to say the proposed ha model cannot always perform well on the whole hydrograph and may fail to forecast in some extreme points i e both high and low flows the hydrographs and scatter plots at the lz station are presented in supplements and similar analysis and results can be obtained 3 3 2 weights combined forecasts each model has its particular strengths and weaknesses meaning that an individual ai based model may have its unavoidable disadvantages and not be able to perform well on the whole hydrograph or different streamflow features our simulations reveal that there are clear differences between the lssvm elm and rnns methods for example for 1 month ahead streamflow prediction at tnh station the mare 95 value obtained by ha lstm 13 56 is higher than that obtained by ha gru 11 06 while mape 5 value of ha lstm 60 67 is much lower than that of ha gru 76 19 this phenomenon can also be detected for the 4 month ahead 11 81 for ha lssvm versus 16 58 for ha gru mare 95 and 80 57 for ha lssvm vs 66 69 for ha gru mare 95 note that the smaller values of mare indicate a better forecasting model the model performance uncertainty makes it necessary to combine individual forecasts the weighted combination forecasts obtained by the mogwo algorithm are displayed in fig 10 and fig 11 for tnh and lz stations in each of the plots the nse rmse and mare 95 are plotted on the x y and z axes respectively the color of the markers indicates the mare 5 values with colors ranging from yellow representing the low value to blue representing the high value the black arrow refers to the direction of optimization thus an ideal solution would be located at the bottom right corner high value of nse and low value of rmse and mare 95 of the plot and represented by a red low mare 5 marker it is depicted that the nse has an inverse relationship with rmse inverse relationship i e the former increase with the increase of the latter while the nse has a positive relationship with the mare 95 positive relationship i e the former increase with the increase of the latter there is a complicated relationship between nse and mare 5 that lower mare 5 values may result in either high nse values or low nse values for example fig 11 d displays that mare 5 values are below 40 m3 s but the values of nse can be higher than 0 9 or lower than 0 8 it is noticeable in fig 10 and fig 11 that the single ai based forecasts can be dominated by the pareto optimal combined forecasts provided by the pareto optimal combined ensemble forecasts more than one solution can dominate each individual forecast model termed as dominated models the model farthest deviating from the individual model of the dominated models is chosen as the target model to quantify the complex skill value relationship the performance of each dominated model during evaluation periods for two hydrological stations are listed in table 5 for example ha lssvm at 1 month ahead generates a forecast with an nse value of 0 961 an rmse value of 87 20 m3 s a mare 95 value of 9 54 and a mare 5 value of 44 99 it is inferior to a forecast selected from the combination sets with values of nse being 0 962 rmse being 86 23 m3 s mare 95 being 8 44 and mare 5 being 38 55 in total for the lz station the weights combined model can increase the values of nse by approximately 0 10 7 79 and decrease the values of rmse mare 95 and mare 5 by approximately 1 08 32 11 0 76 43 85 0 05 80 85 compared to the ha model respectively for the lz station the weights combined model is capable of improving the values of nse by approximately 0 21 7 96 and reducing the values of rmse mare 95 and mare 5 by approximately 1 39 27 14 0 09 42 63 1 16 68 83 compared to the ha model respectively the results mean that the model performance of the combined forecasts is more satisfactory than that of the single hybrid model in addition the pareto optimal combined forecasts have an extension on each performance measure for instance the combined forecasts for 1 month ahead at the tnh station have nse values ranging from 0 778 to 0 964 rmse values ranging from 83 38 m3 s to 207 92 m3 s mape 95 ranging from 2 03 to 10 60 and mape 5 ranging from 20 20 to 80 91 while each individual forecast with performance measures belongs to the corresponding ranges it makes possible that diverse forecasts are determined according to decision makers preferences on different performance indicators forecast skill after multi objective optimization seems still sensitive to lead time for instance it can be seen that the nse values decrease with a range of 0 896 0 962 and the rmse values increase from 86 26 to 142 03 m3 s as the forecast period increases at the lssvm dominated point for the tnh station as above mentioned the mare 5 values are much higher than mare 95 values this is because the bottom streamflow value is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error fig 12 and fig 13 display the forecast results in the validation periods obtained by the combined forecast model for tnh and lz stations given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples the yellow area indicates the ensemble forecasts with a diverse combination of weights and biases it can be found that the different combinations of weights and biases behave similarly in the streamflow forecasting however when it comes to a specific skill score slight differences can be viewed the combined model at 1 month ahead has higher forecast accuracy than that at 6 month ahead in the flood seasons clearly the combined model at 6 month ahead will underestimate several extreme peak flows in the flood seasons an apparent underestimation can also be observed in low flow periods especially for the 6 month ahead forecasts similar to previous studies tan et al 2018 because the combination deals with multi objectives and hence provides a set of pareto optimal solutions we can select different forecasts to answer what other factors influence the forecast skill value relationship e g operational priorities the performance of the indictor based model during evaluation periods for the two hydrological stations is shown in table 6 it is evident that nse based and rmse based models will share the same results due to the inverse relationship between nse and rmse indictors in comparison a mare 95 based model is opposite to a mare 5 based model due to the fact that the objective function used for calibration in a mare 95 based model has the tendency to pay more attention to high flows these forecast models have the feature that moving from one objective to another along the trade off surface results in improving one objective while causing deterioration in at least one other objective in comparison the compromised model that balances the diverse and sometimes conflicting requirements can also be present as a benchmark in the following forecast driven reservoir operations given 1 and 6 month ahead as examples the forecast results in the validation periods obtained by the indicator based forecast model for tnh and lz stations can be found in supplements 3 3 3 forecast driven reservoir operations in this section we explore to identify the relation between the increase in forecast skill and the resulting gain in forecast value the forecast value is presented here as the system hydropower generation in practice the decision making priorities are not solely related to hydropower generation and here we take the indicator of hydropower as an example to help understand the complicated relationship between the forecast skill and its value for decision making the reservoir operation performance obtained by the observed streamflow series is taken as the perfect forecast value and the reservoir operations post evaluated on observation are designed as the actual forecast value the non adaptive na and single adaptive sa models are also presented as the benchmark we start by analyzing the average annual forecast value over the simulation period 2001 2010 for different forecast results na sa ha dominated compromised and perfect as presented in fig 14 the relative improvement in performance with an average value of 0 07 between ha and dominated forecasts is very small while it is larger between ha and na or sa forecasts with average values of 0 96 and 0 48 respectively however the gain in hydropower generation does not always seem to be sensitive to the gain in skill for instance the gains in skill using ha lssvm 528 11 107 kw h or its dominated forecast 527 60 107 kw h at 5 month ahead do not necessarily translate into an improvement in hydropower generation than using sa lssvm forecast 530 00 107 kw h similar results can be obtained by lstm and gru for clarity of illustration we focus on the compromised forecast we choose this forecast because it seems to best reflect the current preferences of the decision maker whose priority is to maintain a good forecast from different perspectives the compromised forecast values at different forecast horizons between 481 22 and 545 22 107 kw h almost outperform all of the compared models the relative improvements are going from 0 02 to 3 39 with very few exceptions all 96 cases but only 5 decreased beyond the specific case investigated here it may provide a useful reference for decision makers to determine an accurate forecast from the ensemble forecasts another interesting observation in fig 14 is that the annual hydropower generation varies widely with the increase of the foresight period the range of variation goes from approximately 470 107 to 540 107 kw h for all forecasts provided by the ensemble forecasts we now analyze the average annual forecast value under four indicator based operational policy scenarios i e nse rmse mare 95 and mare 5 it is evident that nse based and rmse based forecasts will share the same results due to the inverse relationship between nse and rmse indicators table 7 displays the post evaluation annual forecast values under the four operational policy scenarios the distance in operating performance between mare 95 based and mare 5 based forecasts are very small as the forecast period increases when comparing each indicator based forecast with the perfect forecast value respectively we notice that the perfect forecast performs more similarly with the nse based or rmse based forecast than that with the mare based forecast with the top 95 or bottom 5 the reason for this is that the indicator of nse and rmse values is derived from the whole series it is depicted that the compromised operation can outperform the perfect operation at different horizons but it does not always perform better than the four indicator based operations lower than mare 95 based and mare 5 based under 1 month ahead as reported in table 7 at 1 and 2 month ahead in the scenarios where the top 95 dataset are optimized only the forecast value is much better than that in other comparative scenarios while this seems to suggest that peak flow forecast has useful values on hydropower generation it should be noted that in addition to a good performance on peak flow forecasting the general series can fit well with observed series under such a short foresight period the nse or rmse based forecasts are superior to others even though they fail to capture the peak flow at a longer forecast period i e at 5 and 6 month ahead overall the above analysis indicates a necessary accurate forecast on general flow as well as the peak flow last we compare the average seasonal forecast value under four indicator based operational policy scenarios fig 15 as expected the seasonal hydropower generation of autumn jas july august and september accounts for 32 13 38 33 of the annual hydropower generation followed by that of summer amj april may and june and autumn jas july august and september and lowest one is in winter ond october november and december with a range of 10 77 17 94 the results that the perfect forecast performs more similarly with nse or rmse based forecast than that with mare based forecast with the top 95 or bottom 5 can also be found at the seasonal scale the hydropower generation gradually decreases in jas and ond with the increase of forecast periods while that gradually increases in jfm and amj another noticeable finding is that the mare 95 based forecast generates much more hydropower in amj than other indicator based models at a more extended forecast period e g from 3 month ahead to 6 month ahead this is achieved by the fact that a regulatory reservoir can make up low inflow in amj in consideration of accurate peak forecast in jas similar performance can be found in jas obtained by the mare 5 based forecast based on the same reasons 4 discussion 4 1 improved forecast skill in our study we have chosen gwo as the target algorithm to optimize parameters in lssvm and elm due to its advantage of only a few control parameters and easy implementation given the non adaptive forecast na model as an example the lssvm and elm for tnh and lz stations optimized using gsa and alo were presented to demonstrate the better performance of gwo as observed from tables 8 and 9 it was worth noting that elm gwo could produce a better agreement between forecasts and observation than elm gas and elm alo at different forecast times for tnh and lz stations in comparison lssvm gwo lssvm gas lssvm alo obtained similar forecast performance it should be noted that only two parameters in lssvm were optimized while 13 parameters in elm asked for optimization that was to say gwo maintained a much better performance on complicated parameters optimization than alo and gas and could be adopted as the target method as for lstm and gru the gs method was used to select the optimal model structure due to the high parallelism and flexible operation here the non adaptive forecast na model at 1 month ahead was employed as examples to illustrate the track of the optimal model structure of lstm and gru the four performance indictors obtained by different model structures different numbers of hidden units and dropout rate were shown in fig 16 and fig 17 for the tnh station the results indicated that the optimal nse and rmse values were obtained for the model structure with a dropout rate from 0 1 to 0 3 and hidden units from 16 to 64 for both lstm and gru similar results could be obtained for the lz station accordingly an optimal forecast had a lower dropout rate and a more significant number of hidden units zuo et al 2020a have evaluated the dropout rate ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 on the performance index of normalized root mean square error nrmse they also reported that an optimal nrmse value corresponded to a low dropout rate 0 00 in general the forecast performance can be improved using vmd to produce cleaner signals the significant improvements are generated because the hybrid model can take advantage of vmd extracting different resolution intervals and thus the features of each sub series such as periodicity and volatility can then be separated resulting in an impressive reduction in modeling difficulty in other words it is difficult for a single forecasting model to accurately simulate the non linear and non stationary properties of the natural streamflow since only one resolution component is utilized however in many vmd based forecast models the entire time series is decomposed into sub signals and then divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models in such forecast framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment to overcome this drawback in some vmd based forecast models the entire time series is divided into training and validation sets first and later decomposed into sub signals however it can expose the sub signals to the boundary effect zuo et al 2020a zuo et al 2020b making predicting streamflow problematic there are three ways of handling the boundary effect through 1 improving the decomposition algorithms quilty and adamowski 2018 2 reducing the boundary effect zhang et al 2015 3 adapting the boundary effect tan et al 2018 in this study we built an improved decomposition ensemble model that could tolerate the boundary effect whose inputs x came from decomposition during calibration and outputs y were extracted from entire series decomposing generally speaking using an unchanged forecast model may bring significant errors the inputs should be updated as long as new information was appended termed as an adaptive model the adaptive mechanism has been demonstrated as effective and promising in several studies tan et al 2018 guo et al 2020b the models used in our study were also adaptive each decomposition model was updated in the proposed model as long as d period new streamflow information was added we used four ai based models as the target model i e two static models lssvm and elm and two dynamic rnn models lstm and gru section 3 3 1 indicated that lssvm was inferior to the two rnn models in the na experiment while lssvm outperformed lstm and gru when streamflow forecasting took account of the adaptive mechanism i e sa and ha as demonstrated by kratzert et al 2018 and ni et al 2020 rnns could enhance the streamflow forecasting performance by automatically remembering or forgetting the previous input information however the adaptive modification of the forecasting model made it possible to constantly re model the complex input output relationship when both current and historical information is considered hence it made little sense to include the delivery of previous information as for the na experiments lssvm and elm had a constant forecasting model but rnns forgetting previous information to some extent could make sure forecasting dynamic thus leading to the latest information contributing more to forecasting this explained why lstm and gru were superior to lssvm and elm in the non adaptive experiments but inferior in the adaptive experiments lstm and gru could generate comparable performance under different forecast horizons gru had more superficial structures and fewer parameters and required less time for modeling and it might be the preferred method for streamflow forecasts than lstm which was also suggested by gao et al 2020 section 3 3 2 indicated that the proposed combined method with a lack of meteorological observations e g rainfall evaporation and temperature as input predictors outperforms all of the compared methods possible reasons for the superiority of the hybrid method are analyzed below first to tolerate the boundary effect the adaptive appendant was adopted and no future information was included in the predictors when decomposing the streamflow series the adaptive prediction could automatically identify how the nearest historical streamflow information affected the future streamflow and introduce the real time error correction to model parameters second vmd decomposed the original streamflow into different relatively stationary signals facilitating effective identification of noise terms hidden inside the original runoff data series finally instead of selecting a random individual ai based forecast model the swarm intelligence algorithms e g gwo or grid search methods were first adopted to identify the optimal computational parameters and then all individual models were combined and biased based on multi objective optimization algorithms e g mogwo which could effectively improve the generalization ability of each ai based model however the proposed combined method in some cases failed to fit the low streamflow as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the properties of vmd that the reconstruction of sub signals sometimes could not wholly reproduce or even deviate from the original streamflow was believed to have an effect on this underestimation this was because vmd would remove some noise components from the original streamflow zuo et al 2020a zuo et al 2020b in this case even though each sub signal was accurately predicted the proposed ha methods might fail to fit the original streamflow in future work instead of using the summation of the sub signals to predict original streamflow we might directly model the relationship between the sub signals and the original streamflow to eliminate this drawback of vmd 4 2 from forecast skill to value for reservoir managers advanced knowledge of the inflow is beneficial as it allows for better planning the forecast driven operation was performed on a multi hydropower system longyangxia and daxia reservoirs the general assumption was that a gain in forecast skill should result in a gain in forecast value giuliani et al 2020 we first analyzed the average annual forecast value among different forecasts na sa ha dominated compromised and perfect we showed that using information from a multi step forecast ensemble to predict the inflows into the reservoirs and inform the operating decision could increase hydropower generation both dominated and compromised forecasts values were better than the perfect forecast value nevertheless there were few exceptions e g sa lssvm forecasts performed better than ha lssvm forecasts at 5 month ahead through comparing the differences between ha and dominated forecasts high forecast skill to ha and na low forecast skill or ha and sa forecasts low forecast skill we also found that it would have no significant effect on forecast value when the forecast skill increased to a high degree the compromised forecast could maintain a good forecast from different perspectives and be typically treated as the preferred forecast in reality it generated the hydropower generation at different forecast horizons ranging from 481 22 to 545 22 107 kw h and would almost outperform all of the compared models the relative improvements were between 0 02 and 3 39 with very few exceptions all 96 cases but only 5 decreased it indicated that improved forecasts proposed in our study were potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions the relationship between forecast skill and value seemed to be relatively weak for example at 1 month ahead the ha lssvm forecast achieved nse increases of 30 57 with respect to the na lssvm forecast but it would only improve hydropower generation by 0 34 however when calculating the relative change on nse between two models it should be noted that even a small deviation will lead to a large relative improvement since the nse value was smaller than one in comparison the hydropower generation value was around 500 107 kw h a slight relative improvement could maintain an absolute increase by 1 63 107 kw h it was valuable to the yellow river while we found a relatively weak relationship between forecast skill and value we also found that the relationship was not linear and positive and was strongly affected by the decision makers priorities as also demonstrated by peñuela et al 2020 this was obtained according to the comparison on forecast value among the four indicator based operational policy scenarios i e nse rmse mare 95 and mare 5 as they came from the same set of pareto optimal solutions it might be hard to identify which forecast was the best however once they were used to inform decision making they behaved differently on forecast value recall that the mare 95 based forecast was opposite to the mare 5 based forecast due to the fact that the objective function used for calibration in the mare 95 based forecast tended to pay more attention to high flows nevertheless as the foresight period increased mare 95 based and mare 5 based forecasts performed similarly and they were even inferior to the nse rmse based or the compromised forecasts the general relationship between the forecast skill and forecast value might be limited by the deterministic optimization operation in our study anghileri et al 2019 reported that if the full streamflow forecast ensemble was used for example in a stochastic optimization scheme the value could be further enhanced because the optimization could account for the entire uncertainty provided by the ensemble forecast several studies have demonstrated that stochastic optimization operation could weaken the linear or positive relationship between forecast skill and value ficchì et al 2016 guo et al 2020a guo et al 2020b guo et al 2020c peñuela et al 2020 it would be interesting to analyze reservoir operations performance when accounting for forecast uncertainty for a real time optimization based on medium and long term forecasts the biggest challenge was the absence of enough foresight periods anghileri et al 2019 as shown in fig 14 the annual hydropower generation varied widely with the increase of foresight periods the apparent improvement was due to the fact that a longer forecast period was equal to a longer operation period as there was no enough complementation within streamflow under a shorter forecast operating horizon the hydropower generation was mainly dominated by the reservoir inflow the reservoir would release a lot at the beginning of the operation period to maximize the hydropower generation leading to a low fore bay level during the last long term period in comparison for the sake of the whole operating period the reservoir would take account of both current and future reservoir information under a longer forecast horizon this was also why the hydropower generation gradually decreases in jas and ond with the increase of forecast periods while gradually increases in jfm and amj this illustrated the importance of forecast horizons and it was necessary to lengthen the forecast horizon and therefore operating horizon in a real time optimization system informed by seasonal forecasts to improve reservoir operation 5 conclusions this work focused on an improved combined model for streamflow forecasts and an exploration of the relation between forecast skill and value monthly streamflow data from two stations in the yellow river china tangnaihai and lanzhou stations were collected to demonstrate the forecast skill of the developed model while the forecast value was obtained according to a real time multi hydropower system longyangxia and daxia reservoirs the combined forecast model consisted of two components one was an internal model including four hybrid adaptive ai based models coupled with adaptive appendant data decomposition and parameter optimization the other one was an external ensemble model determining the optimal combining weights and biases based on the individual forecasts through optimizing performance measures taking the non adaptive non decomposition and individual forecast models for comparative analysis the combined forecast model could provide better forecasting results from 1 month ahead to 6 month ahead and was a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of middle and long term streamflow prediction the relative improvement in performance with an average value of 0 07 between using ha and dominated forecasts is very small while it is larger between using ha and na or sa forecasts with average values of 0 96 and 0 48 respectively it indicated that the use of middle and long term forecasts could improve the efficiency of reservoir operation but the forecast value would have no significant changes when the forecast skill increased to a high degree the relative improvement in hydropower generation going from 0 02 to 3 39 of the compromised forecasts indicates that improved forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic decisions according to the four indicator based operational policy scenarios the relationship between the forecast skill and its value for decision making was strongly affected by decision makers priorities in summary it was necessary to extend the forecast horizon and therefore operating horizon in a real time optimization system informed by seasonal forecasts to improve reservoir operation overall our study provided some nice insights into the streamflow forecasts with a lack of meteorological observations as input predictors and the complex relationship between forecast skill and its value for decision making although the results we obtained in this study were specific to the uyrb such a multi step forecast generation and a multi reservoir forecast driven operation could be further applied to other study sites however our informed operation work was also subject to some limitations that could be overcome in future studies first the current forecast value was mainly evaluated upon hydropower a reservoir was usually performed for multiple purposes including additional objectives not accounted for in our model rather than hydropower generation only forecast value was generally expected to increase with forecast skill but it might also vary based on other factors such as operational objectives future studies would extend the analysis to other economic sectors e g water supply flood protection or other irrigated agricultural systems e g agriculture allocations it should be noted that uyrb is comprised of 25 reservoirs with 16 3483 gw of total installed capacity however we have only considered two reservoirs for performance evaluation in uyrb i e lyx and dx reservoirs in addition to it the operation of the reservoirs located upstream definitely influences the amount of water available in the river as streamflow due to the limitation of data availability we were not able to quantify the effects of upstream river flow regulation on lanzhou station and thereby the performance of the dx reservoir it would be more comprehensive and useful to operate all reservoirs and evaluate their performance on both prediction and operation in addition how to efficiently couple the short term forecasts with the long term forecasts and inform the multi reservoir operation in the yellow river or other basins can be investigated in further studies another limitation in the presented results was the relatively normal points used to fit the forecast skill value relationship to improve our understanding of the forecast skill value relationship as well as make forecast information more valuable it would also be interesting to test the sensitivity of our results to the use of multiple events e g more frequent and intense extreme events like drought or typhoon events credit authorship

4253,the western part of the drava alluvial aquifer system located in northern croatia contains significant amounts of groundwater which is primarily used for public water supply and irrigation the groundwater of this system contains high concentrations of nitrate which is why aquifer system is classified as a groundwater body of poor chemical status under the water framework directive wfd we investigated the groundwater age in this aquifer system and compared the nitrate concentrations in groundwater and the nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity with respect to the estimated mean groundwater age we used a combination of the environmental tracers chlorofluorocarbons cfcs cfc 12 cfc 11 and cfc 113 sulphur hexafluoride sf6 tritium 3h and noble gases by applying lumped parameter models we determined the groundwater age in aquifers at different depths on comparing the recharge year historical data on nitrate concentrations in groundwater and nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity we found that these elements are closely related our investigation was also supported by the results of numerical simulation of the evolution of nitrate concentration in the saturated zone of the aquifer the decrease in agricultural pressure caused a decrease in the nitrate concentrations in the youngest shallow and oxic groundwater however the trend of increasing nitrate concentrations in the deeper part of the aquifer can last for many years our research supports the thesis that groundwater age is an important criterion for assessing the effectiveness of protection measures taken in groundwater management and implementation of the wfd and nitrate directive keywords porous media groundwater age distribution nitrogen pressure agriculture nitrate concentration trend modelling 1 introduction for sustainable groundwater management it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of the complex and diverse processes of groundwater recharge and the processes that occur during groundwater flow there is a large number of terms and phrases in literature on groundwater which refer to the age and lifetime of a groundwater molecule for instance the groundwater age represents the time taken by a water molecule to reach a specific location for such as an observation well from the moment it was recharged into the subsurface system kazemi et al 2006 the groundwater residence time is another commonly used term and represents the time taken by water particles to travel from the recharge area to an aquifer discharge area such as a river or spring modica et al 1998 suckow 2014 provides basic definitions such as the idealised age as one that corresponds to the results of particle tracking and piston flow model of groundwater flow mean residence time involving an age distribution and apparent age the idealised groundwater age is the time taken by water to travel from groundwater table to the sampling site torgersen et al 2013 suckow 2014 this definition is suitable for groundwater age dating methods based on dissolved gases such as 3h 3he chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 because it is a measure of the time elapsed since the water was last in contact with the atmosphere age is generally determined by matching the measured concentration of dissolved gases in the sample with the corresponding input concentration of the same gases in a given year of recharge in nature the occurrence of various physical and chemical processes affects the concentrations of dissolved substances in the aquifer hence the groundwater age estimated using concentrations of dissolved substance is not necessarily equal to the time of water transport in principle the accuracy of a particular groundwater age depends on how these substances are carried by water the concentrations of all solutes are to some extent influenced by the transport processes their concentrations can be affected by chemical and physical processes during transport such as degradation sorption diffusion and dispersion therefore it is important to understand that the age of groundwater determined from the concentrations of these tracers actually represents the age of the tracers the concept of residence time is independent of the definition of idealised age suckow 2014 in natural groundwater systems the residence time depends on the position of the water molecule in the catchment area for example the residence time in a gravel layer of high hydraulic conductivity will vary from the residence time in a clay layer with low conductivity considering the residence times in an actual aquifer system it is clear that the water samples represent a mixture of idealised ages the mean for a mathematically defined mixture of different idealised ages can be calculated using lumped parameter models lpms each of such models exhibits its own age distribution curve for groundwater management the shape of the age distribution in these models is more significant than the actual mean value suckow 2014 for some tracers or tracer combinations such as 14c and 3h 3he the sample age can be derived using a mathematical formula suckow 2014 suggests using the term apparent tracer age to denote the age derived from this method groundwater age data can help estimate not only the recharge area flow path and amount of groundwater that can be used sustainably but also the lag of groundwater in relation to a pollution event and expected future pollution discharged into groundwater bodies e g visser 2009 groundwater quality generally improves with a time lag from the cessation of pollution input the extent of improvement depends on the type of pollution in the case of groundwater pollution by nitrates that are relatively stable in an oxic environment which is characteristic of the study area the duration of poor groundwater quality primarily depends on the mean age of groundwater from the cessation or reduction of nitrate input considering this groundwater age is becoming an important tool for assessing the effectiveness of protection measures nitrate leaching into groundwater is a major source of pollution caused by intensive agriculture studies conducted in many countries have found that the measured nitrate concentrations are closely related to agricultural practices broers and van der grift 2004 lindsey et al 2003 cambray et al 2005 stockmarr et al 2005 seifert et al 2008 van grinsven et al 2016 furthermore it was reported that the protection measures applied in agricultural production in denmark have affected nitrate concentrations in groundwater hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 the analysis of the effectiveness of protection measures and trends was primarily considered with regard to the impact of agricultural production on increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater this is because increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater are the among the most pressing environmental concerns in many countries a review of the status of the environment and the consequences of the time lag of nitrate concentrations in groundwater in relation to the time of application of measures and the load from agricultural production in europe and north america led to the conclusion that a water protection policy aimed at reducing or preventing nitrate pollution in water must take into account the time lag of groundwater and the transport of solutes through the unsaturated and saturated zone vero et al 2018 this lag must be quantified in order to establish realistic deadlines thresholds and expectations and to plan effective water management practices in this regard it is necessary to determine the groundwater age that is the groundwater residence time of groundwater polluted by nitrates in which the measured nitrate concentrations can be related to the historical input of nitrogen into groundwater thus the reversal trend in agricultural pollution as required by the european union water framework directive wfd can be demonstrated or the effects of implemented protection measures on nitrate reduction in groundwater can be assessed visser 2009 the study area represents intensive agricultural areas a combination of mostly 85 crop production intensive vegetable production and livestock breeding bubalo et al 2014 additionally there are many cattle and chicken farms high value intensively managed crops such as vegetables and other irrigated agricultural crops to which large amounts of nitrogen fertiliser are usually applied can significantly contribute to nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater bubalo et al 2014 the application of organic fertilisers manure additionally contributes to nitrate leaching higher rates of nitrate losses were recorded in manure treatment than in compost and inorganic n treatments basso and ritchie 2005 thomsen 2005 groundwater quality and quantity monitoring in the varaždin area has been conducted on an ongoing basis for several years it has been observed that the groundwater is oxic and has high nitrate concentrations which are associated with agricultural production and intensive application of fertilisers and manure nitrate concentrations have been increasing in groundwater since the 1970s and a trend reversal has been achieved in the last 15 years this paper provides for the first time a comprehensive assessment of the dependence of nitrate concentration in groundwater on agricultural activity in croatia we investigated the groundwater age in this aquifer system and compared the nitrate concentrations in groundwater with the nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity with respect to the groundwater age the atmospheric trace gases cfc 11 cfc 12 cfc 113 and sf6 as well as the radioactive isotope of hydrogen tritium and its product helium 3 were used for the groundwater age estimation the production of cfcs started in early 1940s its concentrations gradually began to decrease after the adoption of the montreal protocol in the second half of the 1980s however the concentration of sf6 is still increasing the high 3h concentrations in the atmosphere were consequences of thermonuclear tests which began in 1952 peak concentrations of 3h in rainfall were recorded in 1963 and 1964 the data over the last 20 years suggest a nearly constant mean annual 3h concentration dulinski et al 2019 krajcar bronić et al 2020 we employed the lpm to determine the groundwater age in aquifers at different depths by comparing the recharge year historical data on nitrate concentrations in groundwater and nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity we found that they are closely related to each other these findings were supported by the results of numerical simulations of the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the saturated zone of the aquifer 2 case study the varaždin area is located in the valley of the drava river at an altitude of 170 200 m above sea level it is bounded to the north by the drava river and to the west and south by mountainous areas the valley is dominated by arable land and meadows the largest settlement in the area is the city of varaždin in the wider study area two hydroelectric power plants are built on the drava river with associated inflow channels accumulation lakes engine rooms and drainage canals fig 1 according to köppen s classification of climate types the varaždin area belongs to the cfb climate type šegota and filipčić 1996 it has a moderately warm humid climate with warm summers the mean annual air temperatures for the periods 1960 1991 and 1971 2000 were 9 9 c and 10 2 c respectively zaninović et al 2008 the average annual rainfall for the same period was 879 2 and 843 1 mm respectively the varaždin area is composed of quaternary sediments within which an alluvial aquifer of intergranular porosity is formed figs 1 2 the lithological composition of the aquifer is dominated by gravel and sand with subordinate silt and clay contents in the westernmost part of the area the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reaches 300 m day larva 2008 it gradually decreases downstream approximately reaching 170 m day in the area east of the bartolovac pumping site fig 1 the thickness of the aquifer increases from west to east fig 2 the aquifer is covered by a thin occasionally absent layer of semipermeable deposits allowing high amounts of precipitation infiltration but also increasing vulnerability of groundwater to pollution by a high degree the aquifer is unconfined in hydrogeological terms a semipermeable interlayer aquitard divides the aquifer into an upper and a lower aquifers this aquitard of regional importance appears in the vicinity of varaždin and extends further downstream it is composed of silt and clay with a high sand content and a thickness of a few meters however the layer is occasionally absent groundwater recharge in the study area is mainly achieved through rainfall infiltration the recharge rates are relatively high and range from 20 to 30 of annual precipitation depending on the thickness and permeability of the covering layer and type of land use urumović et al 1981 patrčević 1995 the drava river is in direct contact with the aquifer and drains groundwater under natural conditions the construction of the hydroelectric power plants on the drava river altered the natural conditions consequently the aquifer is recharged in the vicinity of the accumulation lakes while the drainage canals intensively drain the groundwater fig 1 3 data and methods in our approach four input variables hydrogeological data historical groundwater quality data historical pressure from agriculture data and environmental tracers were selected and then evaluated and processed the interrelation between individual segments of the research is shown in fig 3 3 1 groundwater sampling for cfcs and sf6 analyses groundwater sampling was conducted during two periods 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 table 1 eight samples were collected from the observation boreholes at three depths table 1 all samples were collected with a submersible pump grundfos mp1 prior to sampling at least three borehole volumes of water were pumped out with a pumping rate of about 0 4 l s after reaching stable conditions for temperature electrical conductivity and ph groundwater samples were collected in a low flow regime with a pumping rate of 1 l min samples for the analyses of cfcs and sf6 were collected following the methods described by oster et al 1996 samples were collected in 500 ml glass bottles stored in containers filled with the same water to prevent contamination groundwater samples were collected in 1 l high density polyethylene bottles for analyses of 3h and in copper tubes with a volume of 40 ml for analyses of noble gases as described by weiss 1968 after purifying the copper tubes with at least 10 volumes of tubing the copper tubes were sealed at both ends with clamps 3 2 groundwater quality data groundwater quality monitoring data were collected from the national monitoring database for which the hrvatske vode a legal entity for water management in croatia is responsible and from the groundwater quality databases in the investigated recharge areas of the pumping sites table 2 3 3 analysis of cfcs and 3h 3he analyses of cfcs and sf6 were performed in spurenstofflabor wachenheim germany using gas chromatography following the methods described by oster et al 1996 tritium and noble gases were analysed in isotoptech zrt debrecen hungary the samples were measured using a helix sft and a vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer and were determined using the method described by palcsu et al 2010 3 4 groundwater age assessment methods groundwater age dating using the atmospheric trace gases is based on henry s law of solubility using this method the historical date at which a parcel of water was recharged to a groundwater system can be calculated a notable assumption is that at this point the water samples were at equilibrium with the gas concentration in the unsaturated zone the procedure applied for converting the measured concentrations in groundwater samples expressed in picomol per liter pmol l or femtomol per liter fmol l to the atmospheric equivalent concentration eac expressed in parts per billion per volume pptv is described in kazemi et al 2006 and iaea 2006 a recharge elevation of 200 m and a recharge temperature of 10c table 2 as well as a groundwater salinity of 500 mg l were used the physical and chemical properties of cfcs were taken from kazemi et al 2006 cook and herczeg 2000 bu and warner 1995 cook and solomon 1995 warner and weiss 1985 and for sf6 from cosgrove and walkley 1981 the obtained eac values were then compared to the graphs of cfc concentrations in the air in the northern hemisphere https water usgs gov lab software air curve index htm and the year when the analysed cfcs infiltrated into the groundwater via precipitation was determined groundwater recharge to perform groundwater dating with the sparingly soluble sf6 tracer excess air must be considered kazemi et al 2006 chambers et al 2019 for the majority of groundwater systems the excess air is in the range of 1 3 cm3 l at standard temperature and pressure stp busemberg and plummer 2000 according to the graph which displays the correction factors for excess air as a function of recharge temperature chambers et al 2019 the excess air correction factor for sf6 was assumed to be 0 8 which corresponds to 2 cm3 l at an stp the cfc concentrations were not corrected the advantages and disadvantages of groundwater dating with cfcs and sf6 are described in kazemi et al 2006 and chambers et al 2019 busenberg and plummer 2000 considered that the sf6 method is useful for dating very young groundwater and recharge in urban environments where cfcs can be elevated owing to local anthropogenic sources in groundwater younger than the mid 1960s the highest concentrations of 3h can no longer be registered due its radioactive decay into 3he however the apparent age of groundwater can be calculated from the 3h 3he ratio in a groundwater sample schlosser et al 1988 1989 solomon et al 1992 1993 tolstikhin and kamenskiy 1969 3h input refers to the 3h concentration which enters the saturated zone at the time of recharge assuming piston flow conditions the output represents the sum of 3h and 3he trit in the sample the historical 3h data for precipitation at the vienna ljubljana and zagreb global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations were analysed as input data for 3h iaea wmo groundwater ages were also calculated using lpms maloszewski and zuber 1996 which are useful for describing groundwater systems with a small number of parameters maloszewski et al 1992 maloszewski et al 2002 lpms are the simplest and most convenient for systems limited to one or two parameters containing young water and concentrations of modern tracers such as seasonally variable 18o 2h 3h 85kr cfcs and sf6 as input variables maloszewski and zuber 1996 in this study cfc and sf6 data inputs were presented as their atmospheric mixing ratios in precipitation for the northern hemisphere atmosphere the historical 3h data for precipitation at the vienna gnip station were used as input data for 3h the lpms are represented mathematically as residence time distribution functions or age distribution functions g t małoszewski and zuber 1982 a water sample is considered to be composed of many parcels with various flow paths leading to the sampling site each parcel represents a relatively discrete groundwater age and tracer concentration mathematically all lpms for steady state flow systems with a time variable tracer input are convolution integrals as follows 1 c out t t c in t g t t e λ t t d t where cout is the output tracer concentration in groundwater well borehole or spring cin is the input tracer concentration in the system t is the sampling date t is the entry time into the system and g t t is the residence time distribution or the age distribution function the term e λ t t d t is related to radioactive decay the terms g t t and e λ t t d t are functions of the idealised age which is the time difference between infiltration and output time the equation for the mean age of the groundwater sample τ is 2 τ s t t t g t t d t in this study tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 was used for the model calculations flow model calculations were conducted using the piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm partial exponential model pem and dispersion model dm maloszewski and zuber 1996 the pfm can be applied to hydrogeologic settings where the flow lines are assumed to have the same residence time and dispersion and diffusion are negligible in the emm approximation the flow lines are assumed to have an exponential distribution with regard to the residence time it is applicable to unconfined aquifers of constant thickness receiving uniform recharge the pem is applicable to the same types of aquifers as for the emm however it is used when only the lower part of the aquifer is sampled the dm includes dispersion and advective flow and can give an approximate description of age distributions in samples from many aquifer types it uses the dispersion parameter dp which is the inverse of the peclet number małoszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 2002 or the ratio of the dispersion coefficient d to the product of velocity v and outlet position x jurgens et al 2012 3 5 agricultural n pressure and comparison with nitrate concentrations in groundwater one of the primary sources of nitrogen and simultaneously an indicator of the intensity of agriculture in croatia is the fertiliser application per unit area romić et al 2014 the production of mineral fertilisers demand and prices of agricultural products and other specific global circumstances influenced the increase in the use of plant nutrients through fertilisation especially after the second world war in croatia as well in some other eu member states e g germany mineral fertiliser sales statistics are available at the national level ondrašek et al 2021 a fertiliser factory petrokemija d d established in 1968 is a major source of historical data on fertiliser application as for manure poultry farms are the primary source in the study area this study uses available historical data on the production and fertiliser application and manure in both europe and croatia the sources of data were expert reports romić et al 2014 published papers van grinsven et al 2015 dalgaard et al 2014 hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 and statistical data available at food and agriculture organization fao http www fao org faostat en data ef and croatian bureau of statistics cbs https www dzs hr hrv system stat databases htm the methodology of comparing nitrate concentrations in groundwater with agricultural n pressures involved several steps firstly collected historical data on nitrate concentrations at each site were reduced to the mean annual concentrations then the sampling year was converted to the groundwater recharge year assuming a constant groundwater age at each groundwater sampling point hansen et al 2017 this means that the recharge year i e the year when nitrates entered groundwater was calculated for each annual nitrate concentration as the difference between the sampling year i e the year with the known nitrate concentration at the considered location and the groundwater age finally the obtained recharge years with the corresponding nitrate concentrations in the groundwater were compared with the historical data of agricultural n pressures 3 6 numerical model of groundwater flow and nitrate transport in saturated zone the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the saturated zone of the aquifer was simulated using a mathematical model the governing equations for groundwater flow 5 and solute transport 6 were solved numerically using the finite difference method the three dimensional transient movement of groundwater of constant density through a porous material is described as krešić 2007 3 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where k xx k yy and k zz are the hydraulic conductivities

groundwater flow under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous and anisotropic medium in the steady state model h t in the governing equation 5 is zero and the computed heads and fluxes are

the concentration of the source or sink flux for species k ml 3 a regional three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model spanning 2400 km2 and originally developed in the scope of the research activities focused on groundwater balance in the western and central drava valley was used to assess nitrate concentration evolution in the study area fig 3 the model was set up within the groundwater modelling system platform and simulated using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh et al 2017 horizontal discretisation of the model domain was performed using a grid size of 500 m 500 m a vertical discretisation was obtained based on four layers representing the covering aquitard upper aquifer aquitard and lower aquifer rivers accumulation lakes and drains were implemented into the model as head dependent boundaries whereas distributed aquifer recharge groundwater abstraction at pumping sites no flow boundary across the bottom of the modelling domain and the eastern western and southern boundaries were all modelled as specified flux boundaries model parameters were initially assigned according to the results of pumping tests carried out mostly for the purpose of the pumping site development and were subsequently adjusted during the calibration process table s1 the model was calibrated in a steady state with the observed groundwater heads obtained from the network of observation wells fig 4 for calibration purposes a parameter estimation tool pest was used doherty 2015 in accordance with the parsimony principle hill 2006 the model was kept as simple as possible and complexity was added in the process of calibration when required the goodness of fit between simulated and observed heads was evaluated using mean absolute residual mar root mean squared residual rms and normalised root mean squared residual nrms a three dimensional numerical model of nitrate transport in the saturated zone of the aquifer was established for the western and central parts of the drava river valley where oxic conditions prevail in the aquifer fig 3 downstream the hydrochemical conditions change to anoxic environment as result of sedimentation gradually becoming dominant and leading to denitrification processes which were outside the scope of this study the model was simulated using the mt3d usgs code bedekar et al 2016 which is an upgrade to the groundwater flow solution from the modflow code and has the capability to route solutes through dry cells that may occur in the newton raphson formulation of modflow niswonger et al 2011 applied in groundwater flow simulation the simulation does not consider processes that affect the retardation and decomposition of nitrate but only the advection dispersion transport which is in line with the prevailing hydrochemical conditions of the modelling domain quantification of the three dimensional dispersion effects on solute transport requires the definition of dispersivity which is scale dependent wiedemeier et al 1998 aziz et al 2000 and can be determined using laboratory methods inverse modelling or empirical expressions gjetvaj 1990 investigated the dispersivity in the catchment area of the varaždin pumping site by monitoring the migration of nacl solution in a radial flow toward the well considering the results of that study which fall within the range of dispersivities recorded on such a scale gelhar et al 1992 the longitudinal dispersivity of 100 transverse dispersivity of 10 and vertical dispersivity of 1 were used for nitrate transport modelling nitrate inputs were simulated using the neumann boundary condition for zero inflow rate and the cauchy boundary condition for nitrate fluxes at the boundaries with watercourses and lakes and from agricultural land initial concentrations of nitrate in groundwater in 2006 were derived from national groundwater quality monitoring datasets using linear interpolation method the nitrate concentration values were then interpolated and extrapolated in the areas without information about groundwater quality assessing the accurate fertilisers consumption is a critical point in n balancing and the most sensitive factor in estimating regional i e at municipality county level n surplus ondrašek et al 2021 there are no data on nitrate concentrations in the unsaturated zone of the aquifer in the study area in the neighbouring slovenia urbanc et al 2014 determined the nitrate leaching to groundwater from different agricultural lands uncultivated land and forest non intensive land use extensive land use intensive land use and nitrate on farmland in table 3 in the drava river aquifer system both research areas croatian and slovenian belong to the same river basin and have similar regional hydrogeological characteristics in addition there are no significant differences in the agricultural practices of the neighbouring countries regarding the application of fertilizers and manure hence the results of research in slovenia were used to estimate the nitrate surplus reaching the groundwater from different agricultural lands in the study area according to romić et al 2014 the agricultural land in the modelled area includes the following crops cereals corn sugar beet soybeans oilseeds potatoes vineyards meadows pastures sunflower tobacco vegetables cabbage orchards and mosaics mosaics were used to represent zones where various crops occupy small areas in the study area mosaics occupy around 30 corn 18 cereals 7 vegetables including potatoes and cabbage 3 5 meadows and pastures 8 and all other crops less than 1 of the total area with some of them not present at all for the purpose of this study different crops listed by romić et al 2014 were merged into five agricultural land use classes based on similar amounts of nitrate leaching according to urbanc et al 2014 in total five classes were identified with nitrate leaching ranging from 7 8 to 81 3 mg l no3 fig 5 table 3 a particular class was created to account for the increased application of manure to agricultural land in the vicinity of numerous farms manure accumulated over time in farm premises is subsequently spread on agricultural land and the nearest plots are most often used for this purpose romić et al 2014 the transport simulation was performed for a 15 y period from 2006 to 2021 over which a constant input from the sources of nitrates in groundwater was assumed the simulation results were used to validate the model performance and analyse trends of nitrate concentrations 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical features and groundwater quality groundwater is of the camg hco3 hydrochemical type larva et al 2010 this is the primary water type which is principally derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite that compose the aquifer the ph of the groundwater ranges from 7 to 7 5 the electroconductivity ec varies from 380 to 790 µs cm and depends on the amount of dissolved solids in water higher ec values are recorded in the shallower parts of the aquifer system the average oxygen concentrations in groundwater in the upper and lower aquifer are 3 mg l iron concentrations are 100 µg l and nitrates are 10 mg l because cfcs may be degraded under anoxic conditions it is important that the study of groundwater age using these tracers is conducted in oxic groundwater the primary indicator of poor groundwater quality is the high concentration of nitrate the monitoring of nitrate concentrations has been ongoing for many years and the historically measured data are presented in figs 6 and 7 fig 6a shows the nitrate concentrations from the pumping wells label b capturing the upper aquifer additionally fig 6b shows the nitrate concentrations from the observation wells label p that also monitor the upper aquifer due to high nitrate concentrations groundwater abstraction from the upper aquifer at the varaždin pumping site was terminated in the early 2000s since then the nitrate concentrations have been monitored only in the observation wells pds 5 pds 6 and pds 7 fig 6c in a meantime the lower aquifer was captured and nitrate concentrations were monitored in the pumping well b 11 fig 6d at the bartolovec pumping site nitrate concentrations in groundwater were initially measured only in a composite sample mixture in fig 7a that contained groundwater from wells b 1 and b 2 upper aquifer since 2000 measurements have been carried out for each pumping well separately fig 7a and b the highest concentrations of nitrate in groundwater approximately 140 mg l in the upper aquifer in the area of the varaždin and bartolovec pumping sites were observed in the early 1980s during the construction of the hydroelectric power plant on the drava river grđan et al 1991 associated this rise in nitrate concentrations with the filling of the accumulation lake rise of groundwater levels in the hinterland these anthropogenic activities consequently resulted in the leaching of the unsaturated zone after this period nitrate concentrations at the varaždin pumping site remained relatively high reaching a peak in the mid 1990s fig 6 a b and c however at the bartolovec pumping site nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the upper aquifer gradually decreased fig 7a and subsequently began to rise in the pumping wells b 1 b 2 and b 7 after 2010 however the same was not observed in the observation boreholes p 2g and p 3g fig 7a urumović et al 2002 suggested that the initial decrease in nitrate concentrations visible on the composite sample at the bartolovec pumping site is a consequence of changes in boundary conditions after the construction of the hydroelectric power plant and the filling of the accumulation lake groundwater recharge from the accumulation lake led to a decrease in nitrate concentrations at the bartolovec pumping site water from the drava river and the accumulation lake does not contain increased nitrate concentrations hence the inflow of nitrate free water into the aquifer results in lower nitrate concentrations in the groundwater depending on the trajectories of water particles this impact is very pronounced in some locations shallow 8 m deep observation wells p 2g and p 3g but not in others pumping wells b 1 b 2 b 7 nitrate concentrations in the lower aquifer at the varaždin pumping site have exhibited an increasing trend since initial monitoring in 2002 fig 6d at the bartolovec pumping site the nitrate concentrations in the lower aquifer have been measured since 1993 and are less than 20 mg l fig 7b and 7c in some pumping wells a slight increase in nitrate concentration has been recorded since 2012 fig 7b 4 2 interpretation of the mean residence times mrts using environmental tracers the measured concentrations of cfcs sf6 without correction for excess air 3h and noble gases are given in table 4 the measured values in pmol l range from 0 42 to 4 1 for cfc 12 from 0 8 to 30 for cfc 11 and from 0 04 to 0 46 for cfc 113 samples from boreholes pds 4 pds 5 pds 6 pds 7 and p 3d show concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 above the equilibrium value that is cfc excess these values are shown in bold in tables 4 excess cfc values are usually found in urban areas where there are many pressures on groundwater the piezometers used for analyses are located in relatively urbanized area so cfc excess in the shallow part of the aquifer could have been expected in the case of excess cfcs groundwater dating is not possible the measured sf6 concentrations varied from 1 3 fmol l in the deep part of the aquifer system to 3 3 fmol l in the shallow part of the aquifer system relating the eac values to the cfc and sf6 concentrations in the air in the northern hemisphere https water usgs gov lab software air curve index html the recharge timing was obtained fig s1 the measured 3h concentrations in the groundwater samples ranged from 1 63 to 5 05 tu table 4 the measured concentrations of the noble gases were expressed in ccstp g cubic centimetres at an stp dissolved in 1 g liquid water table s2 the sample from the monitoring well bvp 3d is the only sample that is based on the 3h content 1 63 0 06 tu and according to the classification suggested by clark and fritz 1997 classified as a mix of sub modern and modern waters in other samples 3h content is 4 5 tu which classifies them as modern waters groundwater ages using the 3h 3he method were compared with 3h input data at gnip stations in vienna ljubljana and zagreb fig s2 the gnip station in vienna has the longest set of input data in the period of existence of 3h data at all three stations the set of vienna data fits well with the data of the other two stations given the proximity of all three stations this is not unexpected therefore the input data from the vienna station were used for further analyses the 3h 3he trit values of all analysed samples match well with the input values of the 3h vienna station the groundwater age increases with the sampling depth fig s2 however some of the groundwater samples display discrepancies between groundwater ages estimated by different tracers the groundwater ages of samples pds 5 pds 6 and pds 7 using cfc 113 suggest greater ages compared to that estimated from the sf6 and 3h 3he methods concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 above the equilibrium value were determined on all three samples although the concentration of cfc 113 is not above the equilibrium value it is still significantly high which is why it shows older water than the one that given the hydrogeological conditions of the investigated site can be the groundwater ages obtained for the pds 4 and p 3d samples using cfc 113 and 3h 3he were very similar 30 y for bvp 3p and bvp 3d samples groundwater ages determined using all three cfcs and 3h 3he were similar 24 2 36 y for bvp 3p and 50 62 1 y for bvp 3d respectively comparatively the groundwater ages determined by sf6 are approximately half for the bvp 3d and p 3d samples and 3 5 times less for bvp 3p lower sf6 groundwater ages may result from a slight excess of air that could originate from low levels of contamination busenberg and plummer 2000 zoellmann et al 2001 wilske et al 2020 macdonald et al 2003 found that due to the lower solubility sf6 concentrations were less buffered against changes due to unintentional air entry during sampling accordingly it could be concluded that there was either an unintentional air entry during sampling or that the groundwater sample contained excess sf6 that could have originated from a low level of pollution because the bottles of the samples did not contain bubbles the second option is deemed more likely the consistency of the groundwater ages was verified based on the assumption that the vertical velocity vvert at the water table surface is simply a function of the recharge rate r and the porosity p according to the relation v r p mahlknecht et al 2001 the travel time t for vertical movement from the water table to sampling depth d is t d vvert d p r the travel time for groundwater samples was calculated for the recharge rates from 20 to 30 of the mean annual precipitation and porosity of 0 23 table 5 the resulting groundwater ages generally increase with depth and are quite consistent according to most methods in all cases mixing and dispersion were neglected that is piston flow conditions were assumed the influence of mixing and dispersion on mrt was analysed using lpms figs s3 s5 graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples pds 5 and pds 6 from a shallow part of the aquifer system is displayed in fig s3 the results of the pfm fit well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 all models are consistent with the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 values of the sample the dm is consistent with the sf6 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample pds 5 and a dp of 1 the emm is consistent with the sf6 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample pds 6 the pfm pem and emm are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of both samples for all models the mean groundwater ages of the samples are 10 y graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples p 3d and bvp 3p is presented in fig s4 a deeper part of the upper aquifer was tapped by these observation wells the pem results agree with the measured tracers 3h and 3ho as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 in the sample p 3d it yielded an optimised mean age of 25 y with a pem ratio of 0 1 the emm and dm models are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of the sample the mrt is 20 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample p 3d are the nearest to the pfm model results and the mrt corresponds to 32 y in the groundwater sample bvp 3p the pfm agrees well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the mean groundwater age is estimated to be 25 y the dm models with a dp of 1 are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of this sample however the models yield an optimised mean age of 10 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values do not fit with any of the models the pfm agrees well with the measured tracers cfc 12 and cfc 113 and the estimated mean groundwater age is 35 y graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples pds 4 and bvp 3d is presented in fig s5 these observation wells tap the lower aquifer for the 3h and 3h0 methods as well as for the sf6 and 3he trit the measured tracers of pds 4 are located between the pfm and the pem model the mean groundwater age is 25 y for the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the measured tracer in the sample pds 4 is located closer to the pem than the pfm model with the mrt of 25 y the pfm is consistent with the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample and the mrt corresponds to 30 y the dm yields an optimised mean age of 70 y with dp of 1 for cfc 12 and cfc 113 the pfm results of the groundwater sample bvp 3d agrees well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the mean groundwater age is 70 y the dm with a dp of 1 is consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of this sample and gives the mean groundwater age of 60 y for the cfc 11 and 3h 3h0 methods the measured tracer in the sample bvp 3d is located closer to the pfm model with the mrt of 80 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of this sample do not correlate with any models graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the sample bvp 2d does not return any reliable results a more accurate determination of the mean groundwater age was found using a calculation of the best fit mean age table 6 the best fit mean age is consistent with the applicability of individual models to specific groundwater flow from a recharge area to a measured position in the observation wells observation wells pds 5 and pds 6 tap relatively thin unconfined aquifers of approximately uniform thickness in the recharge area receiving uniform recharge and accordingly the best fit mean ages are given by emm and dm in contrast the samples pds 4 bvp 2d bvp 3p and bvp 3d were collected from greater aquifer depths and their best fit mean ages are therefore given by pem and dm 4 3 vertical age profile vertical profiles of tracer values in an aquifer system are among the most valuable data for understanding the flow system iaea 2013 the resulting cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he ages generally increase with depth ranging from 8 y in the upper aquifer to 50 y in the lower aquifer in the deeper part of the upper aquifer the mrt was estimated to be 29 y mean mrt values for bvp 3p in table 6 a downward vertical groundwater velocity ranges from 0 75 to 2 m year as estimated by dividing the depth of the screen by the 3h 3he ages of the samples ignoring the dispersion table 5 the covering aquitard above the aquifer is made of clay silt and sand and its thickness ranges from 0 to 2 m the thickness of these deposits increases toward the southern boundary of the drava river valley the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the study area ranges from 2 to 6 m according to research conducted in similar hydrogeological conditions upstream of the study area in slovenia it was found that the mean flow velocity through the unsaturated zone approximately ranges from 0 01 to 0 026 m day koroša et al 2020 in accordance with the thickness of the unsaturated zone the total travel time through the unsaturated zone lasts between 0 2 and 1 6 y considering the relatively short duration of the flow through the unsaturated zone it can be concluded that its addition does not significantly increase the groundwater age and is practically within the error of the estimated age of water using a tracer 4 4 groundwater age distributions groundwater age distributions in the selected samples pds 5 the shallowest part upper aquifer bvp 3p deeper part of the upper aquifer and bvp 3d the lower aquifer were analysed and are shown in figs 8 9 and 10 the age distribution displays the fractional contribution of each sub parcel of water that collectively constitute the entire sample jurgens et al 2012 the emm and dm yield similar age distributions in the sample pds 5 and both indicate that water contributing to the well has a distribution of ages from a few to 70 y fig 8a the models indicate that the amount of young water 8 y reaching the well is 80 for the dm and 70 for the emm and only 20 of the water from this well is 10 y fig 8b the pem and dm yield similar age distributions for the sample bvp 3p both models indicate that water samples show a distribution of ages from a few to 43 y for the pem and several times more for the dm fig 9a the amount of water 30 y was 75 for all models and 10 of the water in this sample was 100 y according to the dm fig 9b the pem and dm indicate that water contributing to bvp 3d shows a distribution of ages from a few years for the dm or 20 y for the pem to 500 y for the dm and 150 180 y for the pem fig 10a the amount of water younger than 50 y reaching the well was 60 for the dm and 30 for the pem approximately 20 of the water in this sample was older than 100 y for the dm and 50 for the pem fig 10b 4 5 agricultural n pressures on groundwater and relationship with nitrate concentration trend the significant use of mineral fertilisers in croatia began in the 1960s romić et al 2014 according to petrokemija d d the consumption of mineral fertilizers since 1995 has varied from 400 to 450 thousand tons per year which is significantly less than the consumption before 1990 fig 11 a according to the fao database these amounts are even lower but the trend is reversed this difference is probably due to the fact that petrokemija shows the amount of fertiliser sold while the fao statistics relies on the consumed fertiliser amounts nevertheless the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers in croatia in the period 2012 2015 was decreased by 30 compared to 2008 2011 ec 2018 the fertilizer application curve for the eu is similar to the curve of historical fertiliser application according to petrokemija fig 11a in both curves it is clear that in the late 1980s there was a relatively sharp decline in fertiliser application a similar distribution of fertiliser use has also been observed in denmark hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 van grinsven et al 2015 state that there are several reasons for the reduction in fertiliser application in the eu first after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the transition of a centrally planned system of large collective state farms to a market based system in eastern european countries ceased the subsidies for the purchase of fertilisers second macsharry s 1992 eu reform the common agricultural policy reduced commodity support for cereal production and introduced mandatory land provisions in western european countries which reduced fertiliser demands stouman jensen et al 2011 third the european union imposed strict regulations on n use in agriculture in the 1970 s furthermore during the homeland war in croatia in the 1991 1995 period agriculture like all other industries was neglected which resulted in a sharp decline in fertiliser sales and consumption van grinsven et al 2015 also demonstrated that the time distribution of pressures from mineral fertilisers and manure in the eu countries display a similar trend which suggests that the pressure from manure from the 1990s has been declining the data provided by the fao database indicate similar trends fig 11b there is no historical data on manure consumption in croatia but in accordance with the already described situation the same trend is expected as in the rest of the eu the manure consumption data in croatia collected for the last decade do not indicate any pronounced trend of change fig 11a there are also no long term historical data on the n surplus in croatia these data have been collected since 2010 and indicate that the n surplus averages at 65 of the fertiliser application fig 11a the n surplus generally follows the trend of n input fig 11b according to research conducted from july 2011 to december 2012 in the varaždin area a total n content of 150 700 kg ha was found in the 1 m soil profile indicating excessive fertiliser use bubalo et al 2014 a maximum of 32 leached n suggests that there is a direct agricultural influence on groundwater quality in accordance with aforementioned the assessment of nitrate evolution in groundwater was made on the basis that fertiliser application according to petrokemija reflects the total agricultural pressure in croatia in this study of the dependence of historical nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 6c 6d and 7c on the mean values of groundwater age table 6 agricultural pressure trends were crucial and not their absolute amounts considering the mrt of 8 y in the upper aquifer at the catchment area of the varaždin pumping site a relatively good agreement of the trends is observed for the historical pressure from agricultural activity and nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 12 the trends also coincide in the lower aquifer tapped at the varaždin pumping site for the mean value of groundwater age of 24 y grđan et al 1991 concluded that the abrupt increase in nitrate concentrations in groundwater determined in 1982 could not be related to the application rate of mineral fertiliser applied because the consumption of mineral fertilisers in the varaždin area began to decrease due to poor market opportunities the authors corroborate this with the fact that the application rate of mineral fertilisers applied in the early 1980s was lower than that in the 1970s despite higher consumption then the nitrate concentration in groundwater was 66 mg no3 l and in 1982 was 98 mg no3 l fig 4 however the authors did not consider the mrt given the high consumption of mineral fertilisers recorded in the mid 1970 s and the mrt of 8 y and with the increase in groundwater levels caused by the filling of the accumulation lake an increase in nitrate concentration in the early 1980s is not surprise trends similar to those in fig 11a are also observed on comparing the quantities of applied mineral fertiliser listed in grđan et al 1991 with the corresponding nitrate concentrations in the recharge year fig 13 in the upper aquifer tapped at the bartolovec pumping site for the mean value of groundwater age of 29 y the trends of historical pressure from agricultural activity from early 70 s and nitrate concentrations in groundwater display relatively good agreement fig 14 the high nitrate concentration in groundwater registered in the early 1980s fig 7a cannot be related to the agricultural pressure curve in fig 14 at that time only shallow pumping wells b 1 and b 2 were in operation the sudden increase in groundwater levels is caused by the filling of the accumulation lake shallow water table make nitrate entering groundwater more easily and consequently determined the nitrate loading from vadose zone guo et al 2006 subsequent changes of the boundary conditions and the catchment area of the bartolovec pumping site and the inflow of nitrate free water allowed decreasing of the nitrate concentration however with a dominant groundwater inflow of the mrt of 29 years from more remote primarily western areas of the catchment the nitrate concentration in groundwater began to increase again which corresponds to the considered agricultural pressure fig 14 the results of the assessment of nitrate evolution are supported by the results of the groundwater age distribution of in the aquifer system groundwater in the shallowest part of the system contains approximately 80 of water younger than 8 years fig 8 and the mean annual concentration of nitrate in the water reached 100 mg l fig 12 in the deeper part of the upper aquifer bartolovec pumping site groundwater contains approximately 75 of water younger than 30 years fig 9 and the mean annual concentration of nitrate in the water reached 30 mg l fig 14 in the lower aquifer the groundwater age is determined to be approximately 24 years varaždin pumping site and more than 50 years bartolovec pumping site the aquitard separating the upper and lower aquifers is not continuous in the varaždin area fig 2 and consequently the concentration of nitrate in groundwater reached 60 mg l at the bartolovec pumping site groundwater in the lower aquifer contains up to 60 of water younger than 50 years fig 10 and nitrate concentrations reach 15 mg l fig 7c according to the applied methodology the increase in nitrate concentrations in this aquifer can last for years this study demonstrates a clear relationship between changes in agricultural pressure and change in the nitrate concentrations with the similar temporal pattern and trend reversals these findings are comparable with previous studies conducted in denmark hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 and the netherlands broers and van der grift 2004 visser et al 2009 the nitrate concentrations in the denmark were decreased after recharge year 1980 and in the netherlands as well as in croatia decreasing of the nitrate concentration began approximately 10 years later around 1990 the recharge years were defined on the same way the difference is in the applied agricultural n pressure hansen et al 2012 has applied n surplus which is considered to be the best indicator of the impact of agriculture on the environment in a given period european environmental agency 2005 and which represents the amount of n deposited in the soil that is not used in production system plants do not absorb all fertilizers which is why the environment is endangered dalgaard et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 unfortunately there are no historical data on n surplus in croatia as aforementioned in this study the nitrate concentration trend was compared with the trends of application of mineral fertilizers and manure given that the curve of historical data of the n surplus generally has the same trend as the total agricultural pressure fig 11 this approach can be considered acceptable both in this case study and in all other locations where there is no historical data of the n surplus but there is data on total pressure 4 6 numerical simulation of the nitrate concentrations evolution in the aquifer system the model performance was evaluated using the calibration error statistics fig s6 according to calibration results mar 0 70 m rms 0 83 m nrms 0 90 the model performs reasonably well and forms a solid basis for a solute transport simulation the validation of the solute transport model was performed by comparing the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations the evolution of nitrate concentration in the shallow aquifer in the catchment area of the former varaždin pumping site for the period from 2006 to 2021 is shown in fig 15 this area is characterised by the highest initial nitrate concentrations in the study area the simulated values correspond well with observations especially for the wells pds 5 and pds 6 for the observation well pds 7 the simulated values are altogether overestimated most probably because of the overestimated initial nitrate concentrations in the vicinity of the well however the direction of the simulated curve follows the direction of the observed concentrations reasonably well the simulation curves for all wells indicate a slight declining trend in nitrate concentration towards the end of the simulation which is generally in line with the conclusions drawn from the mean groundwater age estimates and historical agriculture pressure fig 12 the aquifer system is thicker in the catchment area of the bartolovec pumping site compared to the varaždin pumping site consequently vertical stratification in terms of both mean groundwater age and groundwater quality is more pronounced the effects of local influences groundwater abstraction seepage from accumulation lake drains application of fertilisers and manure and the effects of regional flow are also reflected in the distribution of nitrate concentrations in the pumping site and its catchment area as shown in fig 5 thus the observation wells p 2g and p 3g that tap shallow parts of the upper aquifer with relatively young groundwater exhibit low nitrate concentrations in contrast groundwater samples from the pumping wells which are representative of regional groundwater flow have distinctly higher nitrate concentrations even though there are differences in nitrate concentrations between individual wells as a consequence of the geometry of their catchment areas vertical and horizontal discretisation of the regional three dimensional numerical model does not allow for a detailed analysis of the local influences on groundwater flow and nitrate concentration distribution in this regard and in accordance with the aforementioned observed nitrate concentrations from the pumping wells which are representative of regional groundwater flow in the upper and lower aquifers were used to evaluate the model performance fig 16 the simulated curve represents the evolution of nitrate concentrations at the abstraction site and is plotted against nitrate concentrations in individual wells fig 16 it can be seen that the model is unable to reproduce variations in concentrations over simulation time primarily because we assumed steady state conditions for both groundwater flow and nitrate transport model however the simulated values correspond with the general trend in both the upper and lower aquifers both simulation curves indicate a positive trend of nitrate concentrations towards the end of the simulation which is consistent with the trends of observed nitrate concentrations the aim of this study was to improve the understanding of temporal changes in nitrate concentration in groundwater and to investigate the association of nitrate in groundwater with agricultural load in the presented approach the groundwater age dating and historical agricultural pressure data together with the results of nitrate transport modelling were used to interpret the nitrate trends fig 3 this is the first time that an assessment of the groundwater age was made in the study area and the findings were supported by the results of three dimensional numerical model of nitrate transport through the saturated zone of aquifer the results obtained in the study demonstrate that even in the areas lacking detailed temporal data on agricultural pressures the applied methodological approach yields valuable results that help explain the evolution of nitrate in aquifer system groundwater age dating was once again proved to be an important indicator of the groundwater vulnerability and together with the modelling of groundwater flow and solute transport should be an integral part of decision making process in the frame of the sustainable groundwater management the integrated methodological approach applied can help assess the effectiveness of protection measures and the implementation of the eu water framework directive and nitrate directive 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that groundwater age provides valuable information for groundwater management a relationship was observed between fertiliser application in agriculture and nitrate concentrations in groundwater with similar temporal trends spatial groundwater age causes variations in the concentration of nitrates the mrt of groundwater is 10 y in the shallow part of the aquifer 30 y at the monitoring depth of 35 m and 50 y in the monitored part of lower aquifer groundwater age distribution in the groundwater samples indicated that the proportion of young groundwater decreased in the vertical section of the aquifer system approximately 80 of the groundwater at typical monitoring depths of 15 m was younger than 10 y at a monitoring depth of 35 m 75 of the groundwater was younger than 30 y in the monitored part of lower aquifer up to 60 of the groundwater was younger than 50 y the decrease in fertiliser application caused a decrease in the nitrate concentrations in the youngest oxic groundwater however the trend of increasing nitrate concentrations at the deepest monitoring site of the aquifer can last for years the spatiotemporal development of nitrate concentrations in groundwater simulated by a three dimensional numerical model is consistent with the observations the results indicate a negative trend of nitrate concentrations in the shallow aquifer system with young groundwater and the same trend is expected in the future based on the simulation curve this is consistent with the trend of historic values and conclusions inferred from the mean groundwater age assessment and fertiliser application relationship owing to a coarse grid in a complex aquifer system the model was unable to simulate the horizontal and vertical distribution of nitrate concentrations in detail however the simulated curve fits the observations reasonably well and captures the trend of historic values future studies can focus on developing a local numerical model with finer vertical and horizontal discretisation that will provide a comprehensive comparison of groundwater age distributions derived from the groundwater flow model with advective particle tracking and environmental tracer analysis and facilitate the simulation of future evolution of nitrates in the aquifer system this study highlights the importance of understanding groundwater age in water resource management the implementation of the eu wfd and nitrate directive among several other directives often requires various protection measures however for effective evaluation of the implemented measures it is crucial to keep in mind that the time required for the effects of these measures to take place depends on the groundwater age and its

4253,the western part of the drava alluvial aquifer system located in northern croatia contains significant amounts of groundwater which is primarily used for public water supply and irrigation the groundwater of this system contains high concentrations of nitrate which is why aquifer system is classified as a groundwater body of poor chemical status under the water framework directive wfd we investigated the groundwater age in this aquifer system and compared the nitrate concentrations in groundwater and the nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity with respect to the estimated mean groundwater age we used a combination of the environmental tracers chlorofluorocarbons cfcs cfc 12 cfc 11 and cfc 113 sulphur hexafluoride sf6 tritium 3h and noble gases by applying lumped parameter models we determined the groundwater age in aquifers at different depths on comparing the recharge year historical data on nitrate concentrations in groundwater and nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity we found that these elements are closely related our investigation was also supported by the results of numerical simulation of the evolution of nitrate concentration in the saturated zone of the aquifer the decrease in agricultural pressure caused a decrease in the nitrate concentrations in the youngest shallow and oxic groundwater however the trend of increasing nitrate concentrations in the deeper part of the aquifer can last for many years our research supports the thesis that groundwater age is an important criterion for assessing the effectiveness of protection measures taken in groundwater management and implementation of the wfd and nitrate directive keywords porous media groundwater age distribution nitrogen pressure agriculture nitrate concentration trend modelling 1 introduction for sustainable groundwater management it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of the complex and diverse processes of groundwater recharge and the processes that occur during groundwater flow there is a large number of terms and phrases in literature on groundwater which refer to the age and lifetime of a groundwater molecule for instance the groundwater age represents the time taken by a water molecule to reach a specific location for such as an observation well from the moment it was recharged into the subsurface system kazemi et al 2006 the groundwater residence time is another commonly used term and represents the time taken by water particles to travel from the recharge area to an aquifer discharge area such as a river or spring modica et al 1998 suckow 2014 provides basic definitions such as the idealised age as one that corresponds to the results of particle tracking and piston flow model of groundwater flow mean residence time involving an age distribution and apparent age the idealised groundwater age is the time taken by water to travel from groundwater table to the sampling site torgersen et al 2013 suckow 2014 this definition is suitable for groundwater age dating methods based on dissolved gases such as 3h 3he chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 because it is a measure of the time elapsed since the water was last in contact with the atmosphere age is generally determined by matching the measured concentration of dissolved gases in the sample with the corresponding input concentration of the same gases in a given year of recharge in nature the occurrence of various physical and chemical processes affects the concentrations of dissolved substances in the aquifer hence the groundwater age estimated using concentrations of dissolved substance is not necessarily equal to the time of water transport in principle the accuracy of a particular groundwater age depends on how these substances are carried by water the concentrations of all solutes are to some extent influenced by the transport processes their concentrations can be affected by chemical and physical processes during transport such as degradation sorption diffusion and dispersion therefore it is important to understand that the age of groundwater determined from the concentrations of these tracers actually represents the age of the tracers the concept of residence time is independent of the definition of idealised age suckow 2014 in natural groundwater systems the residence time depends on the position of the water molecule in the catchment area for example the residence time in a gravel layer of high hydraulic conductivity will vary from the residence time in a clay layer with low conductivity considering the residence times in an actual aquifer system it is clear that the water samples represent a mixture of idealised ages the mean for a mathematically defined mixture of different idealised ages can be calculated using lumped parameter models lpms each of such models exhibits its own age distribution curve for groundwater management the shape of the age distribution in these models is more significant than the actual mean value suckow 2014 for some tracers or tracer combinations such as 14c and 3h 3he the sample age can be derived using a mathematical formula suckow 2014 suggests using the term apparent tracer age to denote the age derived from this method groundwater age data can help estimate not only the recharge area flow path and amount of groundwater that can be used sustainably but also the lag of groundwater in relation to a pollution event and expected future pollution discharged into groundwater bodies e g visser 2009 groundwater quality generally improves with a time lag from the cessation of pollution input the extent of improvement depends on the type of pollution in the case of groundwater pollution by nitrates that are relatively stable in an oxic environment which is characteristic of the study area the duration of poor groundwater quality primarily depends on the mean age of groundwater from the cessation or reduction of nitrate input considering this groundwater age is becoming an important tool for assessing the effectiveness of protection measures nitrate leaching into groundwater is a major source of pollution caused by intensive agriculture studies conducted in many countries have found that the measured nitrate concentrations are closely related to agricultural practices broers and van der grift 2004 lindsey et al 2003 cambray et al 2005 stockmarr et al 2005 seifert et al 2008 van grinsven et al 2016 furthermore it was reported that the protection measures applied in agricultural production in denmark have affected nitrate concentrations in groundwater hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 the analysis of the effectiveness of protection measures and trends was primarily considered with regard to the impact of agricultural production on increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater this is because increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater are the among the most pressing environmental concerns in many countries a review of the status of the environment and the consequences of the time lag of nitrate concentrations in groundwater in relation to the time of application of measures and the load from agricultural production in europe and north america led to the conclusion that a water protection policy aimed at reducing or preventing nitrate pollution in water must take into account the time lag of groundwater and the transport of solutes through the unsaturated and saturated zone vero et al 2018 this lag must be quantified in order to establish realistic deadlines thresholds and expectations and to plan effective water management practices in this regard it is necessary to determine the groundwater age that is the groundwater residence time of groundwater polluted by nitrates in which the measured nitrate concentrations can be related to the historical input of nitrogen into groundwater thus the reversal trend in agricultural pollution as required by the european union water framework directive wfd can be demonstrated or the effects of implemented protection measures on nitrate reduction in groundwater can be assessed visser 2009 the study area represents intensive agricultural areas a combination of mostly 85 crop production intensive vegetable production and livestock breeding bubalo et al 2014 additionally there are many cattle and chicken farms high value intensively managed crops such as vegetables and other irrigated agricultural crops to which large amounts of nitrogen fertiliser are usually applied can significantly contribute to nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater bubalo et al 2014 the application of organic fertilisers manure additionally contributes to nitrate leaching higher rates of nitrate losses were recorded in manure treatment than in compost and inorganic n treatments basso and ritchie 2005 thomsen 2005 groundwater quality and quantity monitoring in the varaždin area has been conducted on an ongoing basis for several years it has been observed that the groundwater is oxic and has high nitrate concentrations which are associated with agricultural production and intensive application of fertilisers and manure nitrate concentrations have been increasing in groundwater since the 1970s and a trend reversal has been achieved in the last 15 years this paper provides for the first time a comprehensive assessment of the dependence of nitrate concentration in groundwater on agricultural activity in croatia we investigated the groundwater age in this aquifer system and compared the nitrate concentrations in groundwater with the nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity with respect to the groundwater age the atmospheric trace gases cfc 11 cfc 12 cfc 113 and sf6 as well as the radioactive isotope of hydrogen tritium and its product helium 3 were used for the groundwater age estimation the production of cfcs started in early 1940s its concentrations gradually began to decrease after the adoption of the montreal protocol in the second half of the 1980s however the concentration of sf6 is still increasing the high 3h concentrations in the atmosphere were consequences of thermonuclear tests which began in 1952 peak concentrations of 3h in rainfall were recorded in 1963 and 1964 the data over the last 20 years suggest a nearly constant mean annual 3h concentration dulinski et al 2019 krajcar bronić et al 2020 we employed the lpm to determine the groundwater age in aquifers at different depths by comparing the recharge year historical data on nitrate concentrations in groundwater and nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity we found that they are closely related to each other these findings were supported by the results of numerical simulations of the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the saturated zone of the aquifer 2 case study the varaždin area is located in the valley of the drava river at an altitude of 170 200 m above sea level it is bounded to the north by the drava river and to the west and south by mountainous areas the valley is dominated by arable land and meadows the largest settlement in the area is the city of varaždin in the wider study area two hydroelectric power plants are built on the drava river with associated inflow channels accumulation lakes engine rooms and drainage canals fig 1 according to köppen s classification of climate types the varaždin area belongs to the cfb climate type šegota and filipčić 1996 it has a moderately warm humid climate with warm summers the mean annual air temperatures for the periods 1960 1991 and 1971 2000 were 9 9 c and 10 2 c respectively zaninović et al 2008 the average annual rainfall for the same period was 879 2 and 843 1 mm respectively the varaždin area is composed of quaternary sediments within which an alluvial aquifer of intergranular porosity is formed figs 1 2 the lithological composition of the aquifer is dominated by gravel and sand with subordinate silt and clay contents in the westernmost part of the area the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer reaches 300 m day larva 2008 it gradually decreases downstream approximately reaching 170 m day in the area east of the bartolovac pumping site fig 1 the thickness of the aquifer increases from west to east fig 2 the aquifer is covered by a thin occasionally absent layer of semipermeable deposits allowing high amounts of precipitation infiltration but also increasing vulnerability of groundwater to pollution by a high degree the aquifer is unconfined in hydrogeological terms a semipermeable interlayer aquitard divides the aquifer into an upper and a lower aquifers this aquitard of regional importance appears in the vicinity of varaždin and extends further downstream it is composed of silt and clay with a high sand content and a thickness of a few meters however the layer is occasionally absent groundwater recharge in the study area is mainly achieved through rainfall infiltration the recharge rates are relatively high and range from 20 to 30 of annual precipitation depending on the thickness and permeability of the covering layer and type of land use urumović et al 1981 patrčević 1995 the drava river is in direct contact with the aquifer and drains groundwater under natural conditions the construction of the hydroelectric power plants on the drava river altered the natural conditions consequently the aquifer is recharged in the vicinity of the accumulation lakes while the drainage canals intensively drain the groundwater fig 1 3 data and methods in our approach four input variables hydrogeological data historical groundwater quality data historical pressure from agriculture data and environmental tracers were selected and then evaluated and processed the interrelation between individual segments of the research is shown in fig 3 3 1 groundwater sampling for cfcs and sf6 analyses groundwater sampling was conducted during two periods 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 table 1 eight samples were collected from the observation boreholes at three depths table 1 all samples were collected with a submersible pump grundfos mp1 prior to sampling at least three borehole volumes of water were pumped out with a pumping rate of about 0 4 l s after reaching stable conditions for temperature electrical conductivity and ph groundwater samples were collected in a low flow regime with a pumping rate of 1 l min samples for the analyses of cfcs and sf6 were collected following the methods described by oster et al 1996 samples were collected in 500 ml glass bottles stored in containers filled with the same water to prevent contamination groundwater samples were collected in 1 l high density polyethylene bottles for analyses of 3h and in copper tubes with a volume of 40 ml for analyses of noble gases as described by weiss 1968 after purifying the copper tubes with at least 10 volumes of tubing the copper tubes were sealed at both ends with clamps 3 2 groundwater quality data groundwater quality monitoring data were collected from the national monitoring database for which the hrvatske vode a legal entity for water management in croatia is responsible and from the groundwater quality databases in the investigated recharge areas of the pumping sites table 2 3 3 analysis of cfcs and 3h 3he analyses of cfcs and sf6 were performed in spurenstofflabor wachenheim germany using gas chromatography following the methods described by oster et al 1996 tritium and noble gases were analysed in isotoptech zrt debrecen hungary the samples were measured using a helix sft and a vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer and were determined using the method described by palcsu et al 2010 3 4 groundwater age assessment methods groundwater age dating using the atmospheric trace gases is based on henry s law of solubility using this method the historical date at which a parcel of water was recharged to a groundwater system can be calculated a notable assumption is that at this point the water samples were at equilibrium with the gas concentration in the unsaturated zone the procedure applied for converting the measured concentrations in groundwater samples expressed in picomol per liter pmol l or femtomol per liter fmol l to the atmospheric equivalent concentration eac expressed in parts per billion per volume pptv is described in kazemi et al 2006 and iaea 2006 a recharge elevation of 200 m and a recharge temperature of 10c table 2 as well as a groundwater salinity of 500 mg l were used the physical and chemical properties of cfcs were taken from kazemi et al 2006 cook and herczeg 2000 bu and warner 1995 cook and solomon 1995 warner and weiss 1985 and for sf6 from cosgrove and walkley 1981 the obtained eac values were then compared to the graphs of cfc concentrations in the air in the northern hemisphere https water usgs gov lab software air curve index htm and the year when the analysed cfcs infiltrated into the groundwater via precipitation was determined groundwater recharge to perform groundwater dating with the sparingly soluble sf6 tracer excess air must be considered kazemi et al 2006 chambers et al 2019 for the majority of groundwater systems the excess air is in the range of 1 3 cm3 l at standard temperature and pressure stp busemberg and plummer 2000 according to the graph which displays the correction factors for excess air as a function of recharge temperature chambers et al 2019 the excess air correction factor for sf6 was assumed to be 0 8 which corresponds to 2 cm3 l at an stp the cfc concentrations were not corrected the advantages and disadvantages of groundwater dating with cfcs and sf6 are described in kazemi et al 2006 and chambers et al 2019 busenberg and plummer 2000 considered that the sf6 method is useful for dating very young groundwater and recharge in urban environments where cfcs can be elevated owing to local anthropogenic sources in groundwater younger than the mid 1960s the highest concentrations of 3h can no longer be registered due its radioactive decay into 3he however the apparent age of groundwater can be calculated from the 3h 3he ratio in a groundwater sample schlosser et al 1988 1989 solomon et al 1992 1993 tolstikhin and kamenskiy 1969 3h input refers to the 3h concentration which enters the saturated zone at the time of recharge assuming piston flow conditions the output represents the sum of 3h and 3he trit in the sample the historical 3h data for precipitation at the vienna ljubljana and zagreb global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations were analysed as input data for 3h iaea wmo groundwater ages were also calculated using lpms maloszewski and zuber 1996 which are useful for describing groundwater systems with a small number of parameters maloszewski et al 1992 maloszewski et al 2002 lpms are the simplest and most convenient for systems limited to one or two parameters containing young water and concentrations of modern tracers such as seasonally variable 18o 2h 3h 85kr cfcs and sf6 as input variables maloszewski and zuber 1996 in this study cfc and sf6 data inputs were presented as their atmospheric mixing ratios in precipitation for the northern hemisphere atmosphere the historical 3h data for precipitation at the vienna gnip station were used as input data for 3h the lpms are represented mathematically as residence time distribution functions or age distribution functions g t małoszewski and zuber 1982 a water sample is considered to be composed of many parcels with various flow paths leading to the sampling site each parcel represents a relatively discrete groundwater age and tracer concentration mathematically all lpms for steady state flow systems with a time variable tracer input are convolution integrals as follows 1 c out t t c in t g t t e λ t t d t where cout is the output tracer concentration in groundwater well borehole or spring cin is the input tracer concentration in the system t is the sampling date t is the entry time into the system and g t t is the residence time distribution or the age distribution function the term e λ t t d t is related to radioactive decay the terms g t t and e λ t t d t are functions of the idealised age which is the time difference between infiltration and output time the equation for the mean age of the groundwater sample τ is 2 τ s t t t g t t d t in this study tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 was used for the model calculations flow model calculations were conducted using the piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm partial exponential model pem and dispersion model dm maloszewski and zuber 1996 the pfm can be applied to hydrogeologic settings where the flow lines are assumed to have the same residence time and dispersion and diffusion are negligible in the emm approximation the flow lines are assumed to have an exponential distribution with regard to the residence time it is applicable to unconfined aquifers of constant thickness receiving uniform recharge the pem is applicable to the same types of aquifers as for the emm however it is used when only the lower part of the aquifer is sampled the dm includes dispersion and advective flow and can give an approximate description of age distributions in samples from many aquifer types it uses the dispersion parameter dp which is the inverse of the peclet number małoszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 2002 or the ratio of the dispersion coefficient d to the product of velocity v and outlet position x jurgens et al 2012 3 5 agricultural n pressure and comparison with nitrate concentrations in groundwater one of the primary sources of nitrogen and simultaneously an indicator of the intensity of agriculture in croatia is the fertiliser application per unit area romić et al 2014 the production of mineral fertilisers demand and prices of agricultural products and other specific global circumstances influenced the increase in the use of plant nutrients through fertilisation especially after the second world war in croatia as well in some other eu member states e g germany mineral fertiliser sales statistics are available at the national level ondrašek et al 2021 a fertiliser factory petrokemija d d established in 1968 is a major source of historical data on fertiliser application as for manure poultry farms are the primary source in the study area this study uses available historical data on the production and fertiliser application and manure in both europe and croatia the sources of data were expert reports romić et al 2014 published papers van grinsven et al 2015 dalgaard et al 2014 hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 and statistical data available at food and agriculture organization fao http www fao org faostat en data ef and croatian bureau of statistics cbs https www dzs hr hrv system stat databases htm the methodology of comparing nitrate concentrations in groundwater with agricultural n pressures involved several steps firstly collected historical data on nitrate concentrations at each site were reduced to the mean annual concentrations then the sampling year was converted to the groundwater recharge year assuming a constant groundwater age at each groundwater sampling point hansen et al 2017 this means that the recharge year i e the year when nitrates entered groundwater was calculated for each annual nitrate concentration as the difference between the sampling year i e the year with the known nitrate concentration at the considered location and the groundwater age finally the obtained recharge years with the corresponding nitrate concentrations in the groundwater were compared with the historical data of agricultural n pressures 3 6 numerical model of groundwater flow and nitrate transport in saturated zone the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the saturated zone of the aquifer was simulated using a mathematical model the governing equations for groundwater flow 5 and solute transport 6 were solved numerically using the finite difference method the three dimensional transient movement of groundwater of constant density through a porous material is described as krešić 2007 3 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where k xx k yy and k zz are the hydraulic conductivities

activities focused on groundwater balance in the western and central drava valley was used to assess nitrate concentration evolution in the study area fig 3 the model was set up within the groundwater modelling system platform and simulated using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh et al 2017 horizontal discretisation of the model domain was performed using a grid size of 500 m 500 m a vertical discretisation was obtained based on four layers representing the covering aquitard upper aquifer aquitard and lower aquifer rivers accumulation lakes and drains were implemented into the model as head dependent boundaries whereas distributed aquifer recharge groundwater abstraction at pumping sites no flow boundary across the bottom of the modelling domain and the eastern western and southern boundaries were all modelled as specified flux boundaries model parameters were initially assigned according to the results of pumping tests carried out mostly for the purpose of the pumping site development and were subsequently adjusted during the calibration process table s1 the model was calibrated in a steady state with the observed groundwater heads obtained from the network of observation wells fig 4 for calibration purposes a parameter estimation tool pest was used doherty 2015 in accordance with the parsimony principle hill 2006 the model was kept as simple as possible and complexity was added in the process of calibration when required the goodness of fit between simulated and observed heads was evaluated using mean absolute residual mar root mean squared residual rms and normalised root mean squared residual nrms a three dimensional numerical model of nitrate transport in the saturated zone of the aquifer was established for the western and central parts of the drava river valley where oxic conditions prevail in the aquifer fig 3 downstream the hydrochemical conditions change to anoxic environment as result of sedimentation gradually becoming dominant and leading to denitrification processes which were outside the scope of this study the model was simulated using the mt3d usgs code bedekar et al 2016 which is an upgrade to the groundwater flow solution from the modflow code and has the capability to route solutes through dry cells that may occur in the newton raphson formulation of modflow niswonger et al 2011 applied in groundwater flow simulation the simulation does not consider processes that affect the retardation and decomposition of nitrate but only the advection dispersion transport which is in line with the prevailing hydrochemical conditions of the modelling domain quantification of the three dimensional dispersion effects on solute transport requires the definition of dispersivity which is scale dependent wiedemeier et al 1998 aziz et al 2000 and can be determined using laboratory methods inverse modelling or empirical expressions gjetvaj 1990 investigated the dispersivity in the catchment area of the varaždin pumping site by monitoring the migration of nacl solution in a radial flow toward the well considering the results of that study which fall within the range of dispersivities recorded on such a scale gelhar et al 1992 the longitudinal dispersivity of 100 transverse dispersivity of 10 and vertical dispersivity of 1 were used for nitrate transport modelling nitrate inputs were simulated using the neumann boundary condition for zero inflow rate and the cauchy boundary condition for nitrate fluxes at the boundaries with watercourses and lakes and from agricultural land initial concentrations of nitrate in groundwater in 2006 were derived from national groundwater quality monitoring datasets using linear interpolation method the nitrate concentration values were then interpolated and extrapolated in the areas without information about groundwater quality assessing the accurate fertilisers consumption is a critical point in n balancing and the most sensitive factor in estimating regional i e at municipality county level n surplus ondrašek et al 2021 there are no data on nitrate concentrations in the unsaturated zone of the aquifer in the study area in the neighbouring slovenia urbanc et al 2014 determined the nitrate leaching to groundwater from different agricultural lands uncultivated land and forest non intensive land use extensive land use intensive land use and nitrate on farmland in table 3 in the drava river aquifer system both research areas croatian and slovenian belong to the same river basin and have similar regional hydrogeological characteristics in addition there are no significant differences in the agricultural practices of the neighbouring countries regarding the application of fertilizers and manure hence the results of research in slovenia were used to estimate the nitrate surplus reaching the groundwater from different agricultural lands in the study area according to romić et al 2014 the agricultural land in the modelled area includes the following crops cereals corn sugar beet soybeans oilseeds potatoes vineyards meadows pastures sunflower tobacco vegetables cabbage orchards and mosaics mosaics were used to represent zones where various crops occupy small areas in the study area mosaics occupy around 30 corn 18 cereals 7 vegetables including potatoes and cabbage 3 5 meadows and pastures 8 and all other crops less than 1 of the total area with some of them not present at all for the purpose of this study different crops listed by romić et al 2014 were merged into five agricultural land use classes based on similar amounts of nitrate leaching according to urbanc et al 2014 in total five classes were identified with nitrate leaching ranging from 7 8 to 81 3 mg l no3 fig 5 table 3 a particular class was created to account for the increased application of manure to agricultural land in the vicinity of numerous farms manure accumulated over time in farm premises is subsequently spread on agricultural land and the nearest plots are most often used for this purpose romić et al 2014 the transport simulation was performed for a 15 y period from 2006 to 2021 over which a constant input from the sources of nitrates in groundwater was assumed the simulation results were used to validate the model performance and analyse trends of nitrate concentrations 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical features and groundwater quality groundwater is of the camg hco3 hydrochemical type larva et al 2010 this is the primary water type which is principally derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite that compose the aquifer the ph of the groundwater ranges from 7 to 7 5 the electroconductivity ec varies from 380 to 790 µs cm and depends on the amount of dissolved solids in water higher ec values are recorded in the shallower parts of the aquifer system the average oxygen concentrations in groundwater in the upper and lower aquifer are 3 mg l iron concentrations are 100 µg l and nitrates are 10 mg l because cfcs may be degraded under anoxic conditions it is important that the study of groundwater age using these tracers is conducted in oxic groundwater the primary indicator of poor groundwater quality is the high concentration of nitrate the monitoring of nitrate concentrations has been ongoing for many years and the historically measured data are presented in figs 6 and 7 fig 6a shows the nitrate concentrations from the pumping wells label b capturing the upper aquifer additionally fig 6b shows the nitrate concentrations from the observation wells label p that also monitor the upper aquifer due to high nitrate concentrations groundwater abstraction from the upper aquifer at the varaždin pumping site was terminated in the early 2000s since then the nitrate concentrations have been monitored only in the observation wells pds 5 pds 6 and pds 7 fig 6c in a meantime the lower aquifer was captured and nitrate concentrations were monitored in the pumping well b 11 fig 6d at the bartolovec pumping site nitrate concentrations in groundwater were initially measured only in a composite sample mixture in fig 7a that contained groundwater from wells b 1 and b 2 upper aquifer since 2000 measurements have been carried out for each pumping well separately fig 7a and b the highest concentrations of nitrate in groundwater approximately 140 mg l in the upper aquifer in the area of the varaždin and bartolovec pumping sites were observed in the early 1980s during the construction of the hydroelectric power plant on the drava river grđan et al 1991 associated this rise in nitrate concentrations with the filling of the accumulation lake rise of groundwater levels in the hinterland these anthropogenic activities consequently resulted in the leaching of the unsaturated zone after this period nitrate concentrations at the varaždin pumping site remained relatively high reaching a peak in the mid 1990s fig 6 a b and c however at the bartolovec pumping site nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the upper aquifer gradually decreased fig 7a and subsequently began to rise in the pumping wells b 1 b 2 and b 7 after 2010 however the same was not observed in the observation boreholes p 2g and p 3g fig 7a urumović et al 2002 suggested that the initial decrease in nitrate concentrations visible on the composite sample at the bartolovec pumping site is a consequence of changes in boundary conditions after the construction of the hydroelectric power plant and the filling of the accumulation lake groundwater recharge from the accumulation lake led to a decrease in nitrate concentrations at the bartolovec pumping site water from the drava river and the accumulation lake does not contain increased nitrate concentrations hence the inflow of nitrate free water into the aquifer results in lower nitrate concentrations in the groundwater depending on the trajectories of water particles this impact is very pronounced in some locations shallow 8 m deep observation wells p 2g and p 3g but not in others pumping wells b 1 b 2 b 7 nitrate concentrations in the lower aquifer at the varaždin pumping site have exhibited an increasing trend since initial monitoring in 2002 fig 6d at the bartolovec pumping site the nitrate concentrations in the lower aquifer have been measured since 1993 and are less than 20 mg l fig 7b and 7c in some pumping wells a slight increase in nitrate concentration has been recorded since 2012 fig 7b 4 2 interpretation of the mean residence times mrts using environmental tracers the measured concentrations of cfcs sf6 without correction for excess air 3h and noble gases are given in table 4 the measured values in pmol l range from 0 42 to 4 1 for cfc 12 from 0 8 to 30 for cfc 11 and from 0 04 to 0 46 for cfc 113 samples from boreholes pds 4 pds 5 pds 6 pds 7 and p 3d show concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 above the equilibrium value that is cfc excess these values are shown in bold in tables 4 excess cfc values are usually found in urban areas where there are many pressures on groundwater the piezometers used for analyses are located in relatively urbanized area so cfc excess in the shallow part of the aquifer could have been expected in the case of excess cfcs groundwater dating is not possible the measured sf6 concentrations varied from 1 3 fmol l in the deep part of the aquifer system to 3 3 fmol l in the shallow part of the aquifer system relating the eac values to the cfc and sf6 concentrations in the air in the northern hemisphere https water usgs gov lab software air curve index html the recharge timing was obtained fig s1 the measured 3h concentrations in the groundwater samples ranged from 1 63 to 5 05 tu table 4 the measured concentrations of the noble gases were expressed in ccstp g cubic centimetres at an stp dissolved in 1 g liquid water table s2 the sample from the monitoring well bvp 3d is the only sample that is based on the 3h content 1 63 0 06 tu and according to the classification suggested by clark and fritz 1997 classified as a mix of sub modern and modern waters in other samples 3h content is 4 5 tu which classifies them as modern waters groundwater ages using the 3h 3he method were compared with 3h input data at gnip stations in vienna ljubljana and zagreb fig s2 the gnip station in vienna has the longest set of input data in the period of existence of 3h data at all three stations the set of vienna data fits well with the data of the other two stations given the proximity of all three stations this is not unexpected therefore the input data from the vienna station were used for further analyses the 3h 3he trit values of all analysed samples match well with the input values of the 3h vienna station the groundwater age increases with the sampling depth fig s2 however some of the groundwater samples display discrepancies between groundwater ages estimated by different tracers the groundwater ages of samples pds 5 pds 6 and pds 7 using cfc 113 suggest greater ages compared to that estimated from the sf6 and 3h 3he methods concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 above the equilibrium value were determined on all three samples although the concentration of cfc 113 is not above the equilibrium value it is still significantly high which is why it shows older water than the one that given the hydrogeological conditions of the investigated site can be the groundwater ages obtained for the pds 4 and p 3d samples using cfc 113 and 3h 3he were very similar 30 y for bvp 3p and bvp 3d samples groundwater ages determined using all three cfcs and 3h 3he were similar 24 2 36 y for bvp 3p and 50 62 1 y for bvp 3d respectively comparatively the groundwater ages determined by sf6 are approximately half for the bvp 3d and p 3d samples and 3 5 times less for bvp 3p lower sf6 groundwater ages may result from a slight excess of air that could originate from low levels of contamination busenberg and plummer 2000 zoellmann et al 2001 wilske et al 2020 macdonald et al 2003 found that due to the lower solubility sf6 concentrations were less buffered against changes due to unintentional air entry during sampling accordingly it could be concluded that there was either an unintentional air entry during sampling or that the groundwater sample contained excess sf6 that could have originated from a low level of pollution because the bottles of the samples did not contain bubbles the second option is deemed more likely the consistency of the groundwater ages was verified based on the assumption that the vertical velocity vvert at the water table surface is simply a function of the recharge rate r and the porosity p according to the relation v r p mahlknecht et al 2001 the travel time t for vertical movement from the water table to sampling depth d is t d vvert d p r the travel time for groundwater samples was calculated for the recharge rates from 20 to 30 of the mean annual precipitation and porosity of 0 23 table 5 the resulting groundwater ages generally increase with depth and are quite consistent according to most methods in all cases mixing and dispersion were neglected that is piston flow conditions were assumed the influence of mixing and dispersion on mrt was analysed using lpms figs s3 s5 graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples pds 5 and pds 6 from a shallow part of the aquifer system is displayed in fig s3 the results of the pfm fit well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 all models are consistent with the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 values of the sample the dm is consistent with the sf6 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample pds 5 and a dp of 1 the emm is consistent with the sf6 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample pds 6 the pfm pem and emm are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of both samples for all models the mean groundwater ages of the samples are 10 y graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples p 3d and bvp 3p is presented in fig s4 a deeper part of the upper aquifer was tapped by these observation wells the pem results agree with the measured tracers 3h and 3ho as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 in the sample p 3d it yielded an optimised mean age of 25 y with a pem ratio of 0 1 the emm and dm models are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of the sample the mrt is 20 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample p 3d are the nearest to the pfm model results and the mrt corresponds to 32 y in the groundwater sample bvp 3p the pfm agrees well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the mean groundwater age is estimated to be 25 y the dm models with a dp of 1 are consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of this sample however the models yield an optimised mean age of 10 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values do not fit with any of the models the pfm agrees well with the measured tracers cfc 12 and cfc 113 and the estimated mean groundwater age is 35 y graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the samples pds 4 and bvp 3d is presented in fig s5 these observation wells tap the lower aquifer for the 3h and 3h0 methods as well as for the sf6 and 3he trit the measured tracers of pds 4 are located between the pfm and the pem model the mean groundwater age is 25 y for the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the measured tracer in the sample pds 4 is located closer to the pem than the pfm model with the mrt of 25 y the pfm is consistent with the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of the sample and the mrt corresponds to 30 y the dm yields an optimised mean age of 70 y with dp of 1 for cfc 12 and cfc 113 the pfm results of the groundwater sample bvp 3d agrees well with the measured tracers 3h and 3h0 as well as the 3he trit and 3h 3h0 the mean groundwater age is 70 y the dm with a dp of 1 is consistent with the sf6 and 3he trit values of this sample and gives the mean groundwater age of 60 y for the cfc 11 and 3h 3h0 methods the measured tracer in the sample bvp 3d is located closer to the pfm model with the mrt of 80 y the cfc 113 and 3h 3h0 values of this sample do not correlate with any models graphical estimation of the mean groundwater age of the sample bvp 2d does not return any reliable results a more accurate determination of the mean groundwater age was found using a calculation of the best fit mean age table 6 the best fit mean age is consistent with the applicability of individual models to specific groundwater flow from a recharge area to a measured position in the observation wells observation wells pds 5 and pds 6 tap relatively thin unconfined aquifers of approximately uniform thickness in the recharge area receiving uniform recharge and accordingly the best fit mean ages are given by emm and dm in contrast the samples pds 4 bvp 2d bvp 3p and bvp 3d were collected from greater aquifer depths and their best fit mean ages are therefore given by pem and dm 4 3 vertical age profile vertical profiles of tracer values in an aquifer system are among the most valuable data for understanding the flow system iaea 2013 the resulting cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he ages generally increase with depth ranging from 8 y in the upper aquifer to 50 y in the lower aquifer in the deeper part of the upper aquifer the mrt was estimated to be 29 y mean mrt values for bvp 3p in table 6 a downward vertical groundwater velocity ranges from 0 75 to 2 m year as estimated by dividing the depth of the screen by the 3h 3he ages of the samples ignoring the dispersion table 5 the covering aquitard above the aquifer is made of clay silt and sand and its thickness ranges from 0 to 2 m the thickness of these deposits increases toward the southern boundary of the drava river valley the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the study area ranges from 2 to 6 m according to research conducted in similar hydrogeological conditions upstream of the study area in slovenia it was found that the mean flow velocity through the unsaturated zone approximately ranges from 0 01 to 0 026 m day koroša et al 2020 in accordance with the thickness of the unsaturated zone the total travel time through the unsaturated zone lasts between 0 2 and 1 6 y considering the relatively short duration of the flow through the unsaturated zone it can be concluded that its addition does not significantly increase the groundwater age and is practically within the error of the estimated age of water using a tracer 4 4 groundwater age distributions groundwater age distributions in the selected samples pds 5 the shallowest part upper aquifer bvp 3p deeper part of the upper aquifer and bvp 3d the lower aquifer were analysed and are shown in figs 8 9 and 10 the age distribution displays the fractional contribution of each sub parcel of water that collectively constitute the entire sample jurgens et al 2012 the emm and dm yield similar age distributions in the sample pds 5 and both indicate that water contributing to the well has a distribution of ages from a few to 70 y fig 8a the models indicate that the amount of young water 8 y reaching the well is 80 for the dm and 70 for the emm and only 20 of the water from this well is 10 y fig 8b the pem and dm yield similar age distributions for the sample bvp 3p both models indicate that water samples show a distribution of ages from a few to 43 y for the pem and several times more for the dm fig 9a the amount of water 30 y was 75 for all models and 10 of the water in this sample was 100 y according to the dm fig 9b the pem and dm indicate that water contributing to bvp 3d shows a distribution of ages from a few years for the dm or 20 y for the pem to 500 y for the dm and 150 180 y for the pem fig 10a the amount of water younger than 50 y reaching the well was 60 for the dm and 30 for the pem approximately 20 of the water in this sample was older than 100 y for the dm and 50 for the pem fig 10b 4 5 agricultural n pressures on groundwater and relationship with nitrate concentration trend the significant use of mineral fertilisers in croatia began in the 1960s romić et al 2014 according to petrokemija d d the consumption of mineral fertilizers since 1995 has varied from 400 to 450 thousand tons per year which is significantly less than the consumption before 1990 fig 11 a according to the fao database these amounts are even lower but the trend is reversed this difference is probably due to the fact that petrokemija shows the amount of fertiliser sold while the fao statistics relies on the consumed fertiliser amounts nevertheless the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers in croatia in the period 2012 2015 was decreased by 30 compared to 2008 2011 ec 2018 the fertilizer application curve for the eu is similar to the curve of historical fertiliser application according to petrokemija fig 11a in both curves it is clear that in the late 1980s there was a relatively sharp decline in fertiliser application a similar distribution of fertiliser use has also been observed in denmark hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 hansen et al 2017 van grinsven et al 2015 state that there are several reasons for the reduction in fertiliser application in the eu first after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the transition of a centrally planned system of large collective state farms to a market based system in eastern european countries ceased the subsidies for the purchase of fertilisers second macsharry s 1992 eu reform the common agricultural policy reduced commodity support for cereal production and introduced mandatory land provisions in western european countries which reduced fertiliser demands stouman jensen et al 2011 third the european union imposed strict regulations on n use in agriculture in the 1970 s furthermore during the homeland war in croatia in the 1991 1995 period agriculture like all other industries was neglected which resulted in a sharp decline in fertiliser sales and consumption van grinsven et al 2015 also demonstrated that the time distribution of pressures from mineral fertilisers and manure in the eu countries display a similar trend which suggests that the pressure from manure from the 1990s has been declining the data provided by the fao database indicate similar trends fig 11b there is no historical data on manure consumption in croatia but in accordance with the already described situation the same trend is expected as in the rest of the eu the manure consumption data in croatia collected for the last decade do not indicate any pronounced trend of change fig 11a there are also no long term historical data on the n surplus in croatia these data have been collected since 2010 and indicate that the n surplus averages at 65 of the fertiliser application fig 11a the n surplus generally follows the trend of n input fig 11b according to research conducted from july 2011 to december 2012 in the varaždin area a total n content of 150 700 kg ha was found in the 1 m soil profile indicating excessive fertiliser use bubalo et al 2014 a maximum of 32 leached n suggests that there is a direct agricultural influence on groundwater quality in accordance with aforementioned the assessment of nitrate evolution in groundwater was made on the basis that fertiliser application according to petrokemija reflects the total agricultural pressure in croatia in this study of the dependence of historical nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 6c 6d and 7c on the mean values of groundwater age table 6 agricultural pressure trends were crucial and not their absolute amounts considering the mrt of 8 y in the upper aquifer at the catchment area of the varaždin pumping site a relatively good agreement of the trends is observed for the historical pressure from agricultural activity and nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 12 the trends also coincide in the lower aquifer tapped at the varaždin pumping site for the mean value of groundwater age of 24 y grđan et al 1991 concluded that the abrupt increase in nitrate concentrations in groundwater determined in 1982 could not be related to the application rate of mineral fertiliser applied because the consumption of mineral fertilisers in the varaždin area began to decrease due to poor market opportunities the authors corroborate this with the fact that the application rate of mineral fertilisers applied in the early 1980s was lower than that in the 1970s despite higher consumption then the nitrate concentration in groundwater was 66 mg no3 l and in 1982 was 98 mg no3 l fig 4 however the authors did not consider the mrt given the high consumption of mineral fertilisers recorded in the mid 1970 s and the mrt of 8 y and with the increase in groundwater levels caused by the filling of the accumulation lake an increase in nitrate concentration in the early 1980s is not surprise trends similar to those in fig 11a are also observed on comparing the quantities of applied mineral fertiliser listed in grđan et al 1991 with the corresponding nitrate concentrations in the recharge year fig 13 in the upper aquifer tapped at the bartolovec pumping site for the mean value of groundwater age of 29 y the trends of historical pressure from agricultural activity from early 70 s and nitrate concentrations in groundwater display relatively good agreement fig 14 the high nitrate concentration in groundwater registered in the early 1980s fig 7a cannot be related to the agricultural pressure curve in fig 14 at that time only shallow pumping wells b 1 and b 2 were in operation the sudden increase in groundwater levels is caused by the filling of the accumulation lake shallow water table make nitrate entering groundwater more easily and consequently determined the nitrate loading from vadose zone guo et al 2006 subsequent changes of the boundary conditions and the catchment area of the bartolovec pumping site and the inflow of nitrate free water allowed decreasing of the nitrate concentration however with a dominant groundwater inflow of the mrt of 29 years from more remote primarily western areas of the catchment the nitrate concentration in groundwater began to increase again which corresponds to the considered agricultural pressure fig 14 the results of the assessment of nitrate evolution are supported by the results of the groundwater age distribution of in the aquifer system groundwater in the shallowest part of the system contains approximately 80 of water younger than 8 years fig 8 and the mean annual concentration of nitrate in the water reached 100 mg l fig 12 in the deeper part of the upper aquifer bartolovec pumping site groundwater contains approximately 75 of water younger than 30 years fig 9 and the mean annual concentration of nitrate in the water reached 30 mg l fig 14 in the lower aquifer the groundwater age is determined to be approximately 24 years varaždin pumping site and more than 50 years bartolovec pumping site the aquitard separating the upper and lower aquifers is not continuous in the varaždin area fig 2 and consequently the concentration of nitrate in groundwater reached 60 mg l at the bartolovec pumping site groundwater in the lower aquifer contains up to 60 of water younger than 50 years fig 10 and nitrate concentrations reach 15 mg l fig 7c according to the applied methodology the increase in nitrate concentrations in this aquifer can last for years this study demonstrates a clear relationship between changes in agricultural pressure and change in the nitrate concentrations with the similar temporal pattern and trend reversals these findings are comparable with previous studies conducted in denmark hansen et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 and the netherlands broers and van der grift 2004 visser et al 2009 the nitrate concentrations in the denmark were decreased after recharge year 1980 and in the netherlands as well as in croatia decreasing of the nitrate concentration began approximately 10 years later around 1990 the recharge years were defined on the same way the difference is in the applied agricultural n pressure hansen et al 2012 has applied n surplus which is considered to be the best indicator of the impact of agriculture on the environment in a given period european environmental agency 2005 and which represents the amount of n deposited in the soil that is not used in production system plants do not absorb all fertilizers which is why the environment is endangered dalgaard et al 2011 hansen et al 2012 unfortunately there are no historical data on n surplus in croatia as aforementioned in this study the nitrate concentration trend was compared with the trends of application of mineral fertilizers and manure given that the curve of historical data of the n surplus generally has the same trend as the total agricultural pressure fig 11 this approach can be considered acceptable both in this case study and in all other locations where there is no historical data of the n surplus but there is data on total pressure 4 6 numerical simulation of the nitrate concentrations evolution in the aquifer system the model performance was evaluated using the calibration error statistics fig s6 according to calibration results mar 0 70 m rms 0 83 m nrms 0 90 the model performs reasonably well and forms a solid basis for a solute transport simulation the validation of the solute transport model was performed by comparing the simulated and observed nitrate concentrations the evolution of nitrate concentration in the shallow aquifer in the catchment area of the former varaždin pumping site for the period from 2006 to 2021 is shown in fig 15 this area is characterised by the highest initial nitrate concentrations in the study area the simulated values correspond well with observations especially for the wells pds 5 and pds 6 for the observation well pds 7 the simulated values are altogether overestimated most probably because of the overestimated initial nitrate concentrations in the vicinity of the well however the direction of the simulated curve follows the direction of the observed concentrations reasonably well the simulation curves for all wells indicate a slight declining trend in nitrate concentration towards the end of the simulation which is generally in line with the conclusions drawn from the mean groundwater age estimates and historical agriculture pressure fig 12 the aquifer system is thicker in the catchment area of the bartolovec pumping site compared to the varaždin pumping site consequently vertical stratification in terms of both mean groundwater age and groundwater quality is more pronounced the effects of local influences groundwater abstraction seepage from accumulation lake drains application of fertilisers and manure and the effects of regional flow are also reflected in the distribution of nitrate concentrations in the pumping site and its catchment area as shown in fig 5 thus the observation wells p 2g and p 3g that tap shallow parts of the upper aquifer with relatively young groundwater exhibit low nitrate concentrations in contrast groundwater samples from the pumping wells which are representative of regional groundwater flow have distinctly higher nitrate concentrations even though there are differences in nitrate concentrations between individual wells as a consequence of the geometry of their catchment areas vertical and horizontal discretisation of the regional three dimensional numerical model does not allow for a detailed analysis of the local influences on groundwater flow and nitrate concentration distribution in this regard and in accordance with the aforementioned observed nitrate concentrations from the pumping wells which are representative of regional groundwater flow in the upper and lower aquifers were used to evaluate the model performance fig 16 the simulated curve represents the evolution of nitrate concentrations at the abstraction site and is plotted against nitrate concentrations in individual wells fig 16 it can be seen that the model is unable to reproduce variations in concentrations over simulation time primarily because we assumed steady state conditions for both groundwater flow and nitrate transport model however the simulated values correspond with the general trend in both the upper and lower aquifers both simulation curves indicate a positive trend of nitrate concentrations towards the end of the simulation which is consistent with the trends of observed nitrate concentrations the aim of this study was to improve the understanding of temporal changes in nitrate concentration in groundwater and to investigate the association of nitrate in groundwater with agricultural load in the presented approach the groundwater age dating and historical agricultural pressure data together with the results of nitrate transport modelling were used to interpret the nitrate trends fig 3 this is the first time that an assessment of the groundwater age was made in the study area and the findings were supported by the results of three dimensional numerical model of nitrate transport through the saturated zone of aquifer the results obtained in the study demonstrate that even in the areas lacking detailed temporal data on agricultural pressures the applied methodological approach yields valuable results that help explain the evolution of nitrate in aquifer system groundwater age dating was once again proved to be an important indicator of the groundwater vulnerability and together with the modelling of groundwater flow and solute transport should be an integral part of decision making process in the frame of the sustainable groundwater management the integrated methodological approach applied can help assess the effectiveness of protection measures and the implementation of the eu water framework directive and nitrate directive 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that groundwater age provides valuable information for groundwater management a relationship was observed between fertiliser application in agriculture and nitrate concentrations in groundwater with similar temporal trends spatial groundwater age causes variations in the concentration of nitrates the mrt of groundwater is 10 y in the shallow part of the aquifer 30 y at the monitoring depth of 35 m and 50 y in the monitored part of lower aquifer groundwater age distribution in the groundwater samples indicated that the proportion of young groundwater decreased in the vertical section of the aquifer system approximately 80 of the groundwater at typical monitoring depths of 15 m was younger than 10 y at a monitoring depth of 35 m 75 of the groundwater was younger than 30 y in the monitored part of lower aquifer up to 60 of the groundwater was younger than 50 y the decrease in fertiliser application caused a decrease in the nitrate concentrations in the youngest oxic groundwater however the trend of increasing nitrate concentrations at the deepest monitoring site of the aquifer can last for years the spatiotemporal development of nitrate concentrations in groundwater simulated by a three dimensional numerical model is consistent with the observations the results indicate a negative trend of nitrate concentrations in the shallow aquifer system with young groundwater and the same trend is expected in the future based on the simulation curve this is consistent with the trend of historic values and conclusions inferred from the mean groundwater age assessment and fertiliser application relationship owing to a coarse grid in a complex aquifer system the model was unable to simulate the horizontal and vertical distribution of nitrate concentrations in detail however the simulated curve fits the observations reasonably well and captures the trend of historic values future studies can focus on developing a local numerical model with finer vertical and horizontal discretisation that will provide a comprehensive comparison of groundwater age distributions derived from the groundwater flow model with advective particle tracking and environmental tracer analysis and facilitate the simulation of future evolution of nitrates in the aquifer system this study highlights the importance of understanding groundwater age in water resource management the implementation of the eu wfd and nitrate directive among several other directives often requires various protection measures however for effective evaluation of the implemented measures it is crucial to keep in mind that the time required for the effects of these measures to take place depends on the groundwater age and its

finite difference approach with adaptive time stepping and openmp parallelization hwang et al 2014 to solve a coupled set of equations based on the three dimensional richards equation for variably saturated subsurface flow the two dimensional diffusion wave equation for surface flow and the manning s one dimensional open channel flow equation for channel flow exchange of water between the surface and subsurface domains occurs seamlessly in response to pressure gradients that vary in response to weather and hydrologic conditions evapotranspiration processes in hgs take into account

formulation to equate depression storage into an equivalent element based surface water depth which acts as an exceedance threshold required for the initiation of overland flow as the one dimensional channel flow formulation and the elemental rill storage calculation have not yet been reported in the literature for watershed scale modeling with hgs the governing equations employed for this study are subsequently provided 3 1 1 overland flow the two dimensional surface domain is draped directly over the three dimensional subsurface domain and is modelled by the depth integrated saint venant

soil freeze thaw cycle was determined from soil temperature data obtained from merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 3 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is modelled as a combination of plant transpiration and evaporation and affects both the surface and subsurface flow domains transpiration draws water from the root zone of the subsurface which may be above or below the water table the rate of transpiration l t 1 t p is estimated using the following relationship kristensen and jensen 1975 4 t p f 1 l a i c 1 c 2 f 2 θ c 3 r d f t e p e can where f 1 l a i c 1 c 2 is a function of leaf area index and two dimensionless fitting parameters identified as c1 and c2 f 2 θ c 3 is a function of nodal water content and a dimensionless fitting parameter identified as c3 and r d f t is the time varying root density function the function f 1 correlates the transpiration rate with the leaf area index in a linear fashion and the function f 2 correlates the transpiration rate with the moisture state of the roots typically through a nonlinear relationship with θ here e p is the reference evapotranspiration l t 1 and e can is the canopy evaporation l t 1 the model for evaporation assumes that evaporation occurs along with transpiration resulting from energy that penetrates the vegetation cover it is expressed via the following equations 5 e olf α olf e p e can 1 f 1 l a i c 1 c 2 6 e pm α

the surface and subsurface flow domains 3 1 4 channel flow open channel flow along rivers and streams in the surface domain is modelled by manning s empirical formula implemented such that rivers and streams may interact with both the surface domain river banks and the subsurface domain stream beds per the following equation 7 s 1 n s a f r h 2 3 h c s 1 2 γ pm c γ olf c b t h c t where n s is the

rill depressional storage spatially variable depression storage frei and fleckenstein 2014 for each mesh element in the surface domain is defined as a volumetric height derived from the volume between the mesh element plane and the underlying digital elevation model dem represented as a raster grid fig 3 in the following mathematical formulation of the spatially variable depression storage calculation d denotes the region in the x y plane over which the surface mesh s of the model is defined r denotes the rectangular region in the x y plane over which the raster is defined and without loss of generality it is supposed that d r it is further supposed that r is partitioned into non overlapping uniform rectangular grid cells denoted by c ij for the ij th cell with the elevation at the ij th cell denoted by r ij the function r x y is defined to give the raster elevation at each point x y r as follows 10 r x y r ij if there exists i j such that x y c ij otherwise similarly z x y is defined as the function that gives the mesh elevation at each point x y d for each mesh element e s let p e denote the orthogonal projection of e onto the x y plane hence p e d r the volume of the region between mesh element e and the topography defined by the raster is then given by the integral 11 v e p e max z x y r x y 0 d x d y since the integrand is bounded and piecewise continuous on d the integral exists it is noted that in the definition of the integrand any parts of the surface z r x y that lie above the surface z z x y do not contribute to v e the value of v e can be approximated via standard quadrature methods after transformation of p e to the canonical mesh element in r 2 in hgs mesh elements belonging to the surface mesh s may be either triangular or rectangular in shape however the formulation applies in principle to any general element shape the desired depression rill storage height is then obtained as a volumetric height according to 12 h e v e a e where a e is the area of mesh element e we note the computation of depression storage for each surface mesh element is trivially parallelizable and hence can be done efficiently when the number of surface mesh elements is large moreover the computation of depression storage is done only once in a pre processing phase before running the hgs simulation 3 2 finite element mesh a three dimensional irregular finite element mesh fem was designed with 50 m spatial resolution along surface water channels and major roadways and up to 150 m spatial resolution in areas distal to the channels fig 4 in total there are 269 518 elements across the surface domain and 2 695 180 elements across the ten layer subsurface domain 3 3 digital elevation model a lidar based dem with 1 m spatial resolution was provided by assiniboine west watershed district to facilitate data management and manipulation the lidar dem was coarsened to 5 m resolution via bilinear interpolation before implementation to the hgs model the dem was not subjected to a stream burning procedure as all elevation adjustments were made directly to the fem 3 4 surface water network there are 399 km of one dimensional surface water channels resolved in the model fig 5 a the channel geometry was derived from a simplified version of the manitoba land initiative designated drain watercourses manitoba land initiative aggregated into 32 individual polyline segments each with unique geometry for each segment average channel widths were estimated from aerial imagery while depths were estimated from the 1 m dem manning s n for all channels was set to 0 04 down gradient flow was enforced along the channels using elevation controls on fem nodes coincident with channel locations 3 5 landcover spatially distributed landcover was derived from the aafc 2014 annual crop inventory fisette et al 2013 which was simplified to include forests croplands wetlands grasslands open water and urban land uses fig 5b manning s n for each category table 1 was prescribed using literature guidance bunya et al 2010 smith et al 1995 woolhiser 1975 3 6 soil spatially distributed soil information was derived from the agriculture and agri food canada aafc detailed soil survey dss of canada there were 36 different soil polygons according to soil name across the watershed in the model three soil layers were defined for each polygon with their bases at 0 25 0 5 and 1 m depths although each dss soil polygon had different soil properties the specific hydraulic properties estimated for each polygon were considered for computational efficiency uniform across all three soil layers these hydraulic properties were estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer function model using dss polygon sand silt and clay percentages along with bulk density and moisture retention information for 33 kpa and 1500 kpa schaap et al 2001 rosetta in turn produced estimates for residual and saturated water content the van genuchten α and n parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for cases where the dss was missing information requisite details from the dominant local soil polygon with full data was used as proxy data 3 7 hydrostratigraphy underlying the soil are seven layers representing quaternary hydrostratigraphy fig 2 that were derived from 22 two dimensional geological cross section models cross cutting the watershed in regularly spaced 5 km east to west transects matile and keller 2012 within the layering are zones of surficial sand clay sand and gravel upper and lower tills and buried valley aquifer deposits that were treated as sand geometry of the layer surfaces coincides with the interface between contrasting lithologies the bottom surface of the model is defined by the top of bedrock shale which ranges from 8 m to 128 m in depth across the model domain hydraulic conductivity values for the subsurface hydrostratigraphy were derived from existing literature freeze and cherry 1979 grisak and cherry 1975 grisak and jackson 1978 using values of 5 10 5 m s 1 for the sand and gravel units 5 10 6 m s 1 for the sand units 5 10 8 m s 1 for the clay units and 5 10 9m s 1 for the till units as information regarding unsaturated flow and moisture retention characteristics for the quaternary material within the orw is not available van genuchten 1980 parameters reflecting a sand soil textural class were applied to the sand and sand and gravel units and clay soil textural class parameters were applied to the clay and till units the perimeter and the base of the model are considered as no flow boundary conditions 3 8 evapotranspiration for all landcover classes evaporation depth was set to 0 2 m meaning that water in the top 0 2 m of the soil profile would be able to directly evaporate transpiration was configured to be landcover class specific with wetland grassland forest and urban employing static root depth and cropland employing time varying root depth root depth was derived from canadell et al 1996 while lai was derived from modis imagery myneni et al 2015 obtained for the orw region the full set of evapotranspiration parameters are presented in table 2 3 9 climate forcing data daily transient liquid water input was derived from the canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 which has been previously evaluated for suitability to hydrologic analysis in the assiniboine river basin xu et al 2019 and provides 10 km resolution for the orw snow accumulation and melting was accounted for external to capa by using a temperature index method where daily mean air temperature obtained from the merra 2 dataset gelaro et al 2017 was used to determine if precipitation should be considered rain or snow based on a 0 c threshold snow melt was considered when air temperature rises above 0 c and was calculated using a degree day method rango and martinec 1995 sublimation was assumed to consume 10 of snowfall daily pet was estimated based on the fao 56 penman monteith equation zotarelli et al 2010 using the merra 2 fields of surface air temperature dew point temperature wind speed pressure and net radiation 3 10 model spinup initializing the model for the daily transient simulations followed a three step process firstly a long term steady state condition was established by forcing the model with a small 0 05 m y 1 continuous amount of liquid water input until stable water table elevation and stream flow rates were established secondly using steady state as an initial condition monthly normal liquid water input and pet derived from merra 2 were used to establish model conditions that reflect average seasonal variability by simulating the same average annual climate cycle until year over year stability was achieved for annual water table and surface water flow rate cyclicity thus yielding a quasi steady state model thirdly using quasi steady state as an initial condition the 2009 2015 daily transient time interval was simulated for two cycles with the 2010 2015 interval from the second cycle being the model evaluation interval 3 11 model performance evaluation calibration of the orw model was kept to a minimum with the only tuned parameters being the c1 and c2 coefficients and the oxic and anoxic limits for the transpiration formulation table 2 the tuning was conducted manually with the objective of minimizing the bias between simulated and observed surface water flow rates at the wsc 05mg004 hydrometric station fig 4 approximately 30 simulations were conducted during the tuning process model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias root mean square error rmse and visual comparison moriasi et al 2007 for simulated vs observed daily flows at 05mg004 for the 2010 2015 time interval for intervals when ice buildup was reported at the hydrometric station the corresponding data was removed from the calibration assessment groundwater simulation performance was evaluated with a comparison between simulated and observed water levels for 125 active wells fig 4 across the watershed groundwater information network 2021 the groundwater monitoring data represents water levels prior to pumping tests and were collected from 1979 to 2005 although the time frame over which the groundwater monitoring data was collected does not align with the simulation interval the data is useful for demarcating ambient groundwater levels across the orw and the exercise helps ensure the range of simulated groundwater levels aligns with spatial observational trends furthermore the absence of localized extraction influences in the observation data align with groundwater representation in the model where extraction is not considered hydraulic properties for the hydrostratigraphic layers were not perturbed during model calibration and hence the groundwater performance evaluation primarily serves as validation that the groundwater levels are adequately reproduced in the model it should be noted that for structurally complex models such as the orw hgs model an advantage they provide over simpler models is that they incorporate a physics based evaluation of the natural system and hence many of their parameters are physically constrained this makes these models ideal for robust scenario analysis on account of their minimal tuning requirements however for such complex models the simulation run times can be long relative to simpler models for example the hgs model herein required approximately 25 days for completion of continuous daily temporal resolution simulations of the 2009 2015 time interval when using four cores of an intel core i7 8700 processor 3 12 model scenarios following model calibration a series of scenarios for the 2009 2015 time interval were simulated in order to quantify the effect of increases and decreases in soil hydraulic conductivity field surface roughness and depressional storage the scenarios were constructed by perturbing model parameters that emulated the effect of soil permeability via saturated hydraulic conductivity agricultural field surface roughness and vegetation cover via the manning s roughness coefficient and depression storage wetlands potholes via global scaling of rill storage in hgs it is important to note that the magnitudes of parameter perturbation were determined based on physical plausibility with numerous studies suggesting that upwards of 50 of the original pre development wetland depression storage capacity has been lost in the orw region in the northern great plains dahl 1990 johnston 2013 kiel et al 1972 rakowski and chabot 1983 soil hydraulic conductivity in prairie soils subject to intensive agriculture can decrease by a factor of 4x or greater bodhinayake and cheng si 2004 chandrasoma et al 2016 fuentes et al 2004 jiang et al 2007 mudgal et al 2010 wu et al 2016 and surface roughness of agricultural land as reflected by manning s roughness coefficient can vary from less than 0 02 to more than 0 06 smith et al 1995 due to tillage and planting practices martinez agirre et al 2016 and stubble management freebairn and boughton 1985 as such the parameter sensitivity analyses conducted here can be related to indicators of land management practice impacts on flood and drought regulation as a modeled indicator of influence a detailed description of model parameterization changes for each land management focused scenario is provided in table 3 while it is acknowledged that the model scenarios do not test the impact of changes in engineered or physical infrastructure such as roadbeds drainage works and channel modifications the scenario that includes an increase in all three landscape components depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness can be used to provide insight on orw hydrologic behavior if the agricultural lands were in a predevelopment condition in addition to the land management scenarios sensitivity of the orw to climate variability was evaluated via scenarios where climatology was perturbed using global scaling such that a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in both precipitation and pet were considered it should be noted that both precipitation and pet exhibit more than 10 annual variability over the 2010 2015 interval table 4 following parameter perturbation for each scenario two consecutive cycles of the 2009 2010 time interval were simulated with all analysis conducted on the second cycle to ensure the initial conditions for each scenario were stable 4 results 4 1 2009 2015 climatology for the 2009 2015 transient simulation interval total annual precipitation ranged from 387 mm in 2012 to 586 mm in 2014 table 4 annual precipitation was 529 mm in 2011 making it the fourth highest in terms of total precipitation even though the highest peak surface water flow rates in the 2009 2015 interval were observed in 2011 however it should be noted that precipitation in 2011 was weighted towards the first half of the year fig 6 while the second half of the year was comparably dry with the dry conditions extending into the 2012 drought mallya et al 2013 pet tended to follow a trend opposite to that of precipitation and ranged from 695 mm in 2014 to 851 mm in 2012 with the annual hydrologic cycle in the orw dominated by et in the sense that pet is consistently greater than precipitation it was expected that surface runoff groundwater discharge and watershed outflow would be highly dependent on precipitation timing and intensity as evidenced by the genesis of both the 2011 and 2014 floods in the region brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 4 2 model performance as percent bias was the calibration target the strong match between simulated and observed flow at the hydrometric gauging station fig 4 as demonstrated with a percent bias statistic of 0 88 was to be expected fig 7 a as further validation the nse statistic of 0 76 provides a variance based assessment that simulated and observed flow rates closely match the rmse statistic of 1 94 m3 s 1 shows that the residuals are generally small in relation to observed flows and the good visual match between the simulated and observed hydrographs indicates the temporal variability in surface water flow is captured by the model while the aforementioned performance metrics are based on daily flow evaluation over the 2010 to 2015 time interval this study primarily focuses on the two flood years when evaluated for 2011 and 2014 individually the respective nse metrics are 0 73 and 0 69 while the percent bias metrics are 6 18 and 17 93 which demonstrates the model performs well for the years of primary interest in the analysis evaluation of groundwater simulation results demonstrates the model captures the general trend in groundwater levels with the r2 and rmse between simulated and observed groundwater levels being 0 97 and 6 9 m respectively fig 7b the model captures the spatial variability in groundwater levels across the orw quite well considering that there is over 220 m of topographic relief amongst the 125 observation points strong model performance supports the parameterization and calibration approach wherein parameter tuning primarily focused on empirical et parameters hydraulic parameters were left untouched thus letting model structural complexity and not parameter manipulation control simulated surface and subsurface water flow it should also be recognized that the model performance statistics reflect evaluation conditions ranging from drought in 2012 to extreme flooding in 2011 and 2014 and the visual validation of the model s ability to reproduce the annual and inter annual variability further support the model s strong performance 4 3 climate sensitivity the plus and minus 10 scaling of both precipitation and pet identifies the high sensitivity of the orw to changes in climate conditions fig 8 for the precipitation perturbation the induced variability resulted in a difference of 242 106 m3 and 264 106 m3 in total watershed discharge for 2011 and 2014 which amounts to approximately 50 and 60 difference in annual discharge relative to the base case for the respective years for the pet perturbation the induced variability resulted in a change of total discharge only slightly less than that of precipitation with a difference of 206 106 m3 and 223 106 m3 for 2011 and 2014 respectively which amounts to approximately 40 and 50 difference in discharge relative to the base case the higher sensitivity to both precipitation and pet fluctuation in 2014 as compared to 2011 highlights that seasonal aspects of climate variability is also a factor with precipitation in 2011 weighted towards winter and spring whereas in 2014 it was more evenly distributed across the full year 4 4 landscape management sensitivity 4 4 1 surface water flow response of the five landscape sensitivity scenarios the plus 50 change in rill depressional storage combined with an increase in ks and manning s n had the greatest overall impact on discharge characteristics for both 2011 and 2014 with a respective reduction in total annual discharge relative to the calibrated model base case of approximately 16 in both years fig 9j the scenario where only rill storage was increased resulted in a reduction in annual discharge of approximately 11 and 17 for 2011 and 2014 fig 9b increasing ks resulted in a reduction in annual discharge of approximately 2 and 3 for 2011 and 2014 respectively fig 9d in contrast to rill storage and ks where increasing parameter values led to reduced annual discharge increasing manning s n resulted in an increase in annual discharge of 2 and 6 in 2011 and 2014 respectively fig 9f when comparing scenario results it should be noted that increasing manning s n only slows down surface runoff whereas increasing rill storage can stop surface runoff if the spill level is not achieved in the simulations slower surface runoff resulted in increased water retention on the land surface at the end of 2010 and 2013 thus leading to the increase in annual discharge during 2011 and 2014 in the case where both ks and manning s n were increased fig 9h differences in annual discharge were minimal for 2011 and 2014 suggesting that higher soil permeability facilitates higher infiltration under the scenario where surface runoff is slowed because of higher surface friction increasing rill storage ks and manning s n individually and in combination all result in a reduction in peak flow rates during both the 2011 and 2014 floods fig 10 in the case of rill storage the difference in peak flow rate between the 50 and 50 scenario was 46 m3 s 1 and 30 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively for ks the difference in peak flow between the 4x and the 0 25x scenario was 4 m3 s 1 and 8 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively while for manning s n the difference in peak flow between the 50 and 50 scenarios was 16 m3 s 1 for both 2011 and 2014 changing both ks and manning s n together in the same simulation provided an additive response towards their influence on the peak flow rate with a difference of 19 m3 s 1 and 17 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively furthermore when rill storage ks and manning s n were all changed together the result is a difference in peak flow of 61 m3 s 1 and 49 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively in terms of peak flow relative to the base case the increases in rill storage ks manning s n ks manning s n and rill storage ks manning s n yielded a respective reduction of 18 1 5 6 8 and 25 in the 2011 flood peak and 15 4 8 8 5 and 22 in the 2014 flood peak different parameter perturbations also induce different changes in the general shape of the hydrograph leading up to and following the flood peak where an early spring peak in surface flow precedes that of the summer flood in 2014 increasing rill storage ks ks manning s n and rill storage ks manning s n all led to a reduction in the magnitude of both peaks whereas only increasing manning s n led to an increase in the first peak but a reduction in the second fig 10 the higher flow magnitude during the first peak reflects the influence of wet fall conditions in 2013 that created a situation where the higher surface roughness scenario retained more water on the land surface and in the soil profile which then led to increased runoff in spring 2014 furthermore while an increase in both rill storage and ks tend to reduce the overall flood discharge volume increasing manning s n tends to extend the flood hydrograph such that the total discharge volume is similar even though the peak flow is reduced the reduced discharge volume associated with the scenario where both ks and manning s n were increased points to the influence that higher soil permeability can have on reducing overland flow when water ponds on the land surface however it also needs to be recognized that once the subsurface becomes saturated infiltration rates can decline significantly and hence the mitigating effects of ks are diminished in such situations rill storage becomes the dominant mechanism for flow reduction 4 4 2 land surface water storage the total water volume stored in the orw land surface and surface water network is presented in fig 11 the strong influence of rill storage on surface water storage is evident with an average of 70 106 m3 in additional water consistently present in the 50 scenario compared to the 50 scenario fig 11a which equates to an additional 0 035 m of water across the entire watershed surface if it were evenly distributed similarly increasing manning s n also results in consistently more surface water when compared to the scenario where manning s n was decreased fig 11e with an average difference of 9 7 106 m3 in contrast the scenario where ks is increased results in an average of 12 5 106 m3 less water stored in the surface as compared to the scenario where ks is decreased fig 11c in the case where both ks manning s n were increased fig 11g there is on average 7 9 106 m3 less water stored on the surface in comparison to the scenario where ks manning s n were decreased however during both the 2011 and 2014 floods there are points where the relationship shifts and there is temporarily more surface water in the scenario where ks manning s n are increased when rill storage ks manning s n was all increased together fig 11i the dominant effect of rill storage is again observed with there being consistently more water stored in the surface water system relative to the scenario where all three landscape parameters were decreased 4 4 3 groundwater recharge and storage increased water storage on the land surface and surface water network also leads to increased water storage in the subsurface from the top of the bedrock surface to the top of the soil profile fig 11 in the scenario where rill storage was increased fig 11b there is on average 8 2 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where rill storage was decreased with the largest difference observed in mid to late summer during the evapotranspiration driven trough in annual subsurface storage for the scenario where ks was increased fig 11d there is on average 4 7 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where ks was decreased with the largest differences observed during the fall to late winter interval in the case where manning s n was increased fig 11f there is on average 7 4 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface as compared to the case where manning s n was decreased with the seasonal differences less pronounced than the rill storage and ks scenarios in the case where both ks manning s n were increased fig 11h there was on average 7 7 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the case where both ks manning s n were decreased with the seasonal trends similar to that of the ks scenario the largest difference in subsurface water storage is observed when rill storage ks manning s n was perturbed fig 11j with the scenario where the parameters were increased resulting in an average of 14 97 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where parameters were decreased similar to the influences on surface water storage and flood peak flow magnitudes the parameter influences on subsurface water storage suggest that the three parameters evaluated here are additive in their combined ability to increase or decrease subsurface storage 5 discussion and conclusions the fully integrated groundwater surface water model employed in this study was able to reproduce extreme hydrologic behavior over the 2010 to 2015 time interval including flood conditions in 2011 and 2014 as demonstration of the value that structural complexity adds to physically based models for the great plains region the model exhibited skilled performance when simulating surface water flows and groundwater conditions even though the model was subjected to minimal calibration given that the northern great plains is noted to be a challenging region for hydrologic model application muhammad et al 2019 unduche et al 2018 the methodology applied here provides a template for future modeling applications wherein physical realism within the model structure is necessary for capturing the complex hydrological behavior of this landscape out of all the hydrologic sensitivities evaluated with the model the scenarios where precipitation and pet were perturbed by 10 resulted in the largest stream flow response which is consistent with previous analysis of hydrologic behavior in the great plains villarini and strong 2014 with both the 10 precipitation and the 10 pet scenarios leading to notable changes in peak flow rates during the 2011 and 2014 floods the study area s hydrologic susceptibility to climate variability is highlighted from the sensitivity assessments related to land management perturbing depression storage induced a greater hydrologic response than perturbing soil permeability and surface roughness either individually or in combination when considering the influence of combined factors on flow conditions results from the scenarios where depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness were all changed suggest there is an additive effect when multiple factors are incorporated for the sensitivity assessments pertaining to land management parameter perturbations that resulted in reduced peak flow rates also resulted in increased subsurface water storage which highlights that the groundwater system and its role in providing drought resiliency can be an important consideration when evaluating watershed hydrologic behavior in the northern great plains while real world implementation of the model scenarios at the full scale of the orw may not be feasible e g increasing wetland pothole storage by 50 across 2000 km2 is currently an untenable objective the modeling results provide insight on how the watershed in its predevelopment state would have responded to the 2011 and 2014 floods if the model scenario with increased depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness is used to represent predevelopment conditions results suggest that landscape changes associated with development have led to a 22 to 25 increase in flood peak flows in the orw the modeling results also point to how landscape management can be used to promote drought resiliency in the northern great plains with practices that enhance flood regulation being shown to promote groundwater recharge wherein groundwater is an especially important water resource during drought conditions mckay et al 1989 the results from this modeling study have implication for landscape management decisions and provide a means for quantifying the impact of soil permeability field surface roughness and depression storage on flood regulation in the northern great plains as the spatially varying rill storage formulation and inclusion of a 1d channel domain in hgs have not yet been presented in the literature inclusion of this functionality here can help guide future model construction initiatives it is envisioned that the fully integrated hydrologic modeling methodology employed in the study herein will help to optimize watershed management and provide a linkage between groundwater and surface water hydrology and ecosystem goods and services as a next step coupling the model outputs to an economic analysis wherein the value of depression storage soil permeability and land surface roughness are appraised within a monetary context will extend the utility of the modeling towards decision

4254,optimizing hydrologic resiliency in agricultural landscapes is critical for the sustainability of food production and ecosystem services and optimization strategies must include a holistic understanding of the hydrologic cycle including groundwater surface water interactions here a large scale 2056 km2 high resolution 50 150 m structurally complex fully integrated groundwater surface water model was constructed for an agriculturally dominated watershed in the northern great plains the sensitivity of surface water flow and groundwater conditions were examined in the context of wetland depression water storage capacity soil hydraulic conductivity ks field surface roughness manning s n as well as variability in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the model evaluation interval extended from 2010 to 2015 which included both flood and drought conditions results showed that stream flow rates in the watershed exhibit a larger response to 10 changes in either precipitation or pet relative to the response associated with a 50 change in depression storage a 4x change in ks or a 50 change in n thus highlighting the region s susceptibility to weather variability of the landscape parameters examined increasing depression storage provided a greater reduction in peak flood flows than an increase in ks or n however increases in all three landscape parameters contributed to flood peak mitigation as well as groundwater recharge when model configuration approximated predevelopment primarily native prairie landscape conditions simulated flood peaks

rill depressional storage spatially variable depression storage frei and fleckenstein 2014 for each mesh element in the surface domain is defined as a volumetric height derived from the volume between the mesh element plane and the underlying digital elevation model dem represented as a raster grid fig 3 in the following mathematical formulation of the spatially variable depression storage calculation d denotes the region in the x y plane over which the surface mesh s of the model is defined r denotes the rectangular region in the x y plane over which the raster is defined and without loss of generality it is supposed that d r it is further supposed that r is partitioned into non overlapping uniform rectangular grid cells denoted by c ij for the ij th cell with the elevation at the ij th cell denoted by r ij the function r x y is defined to give the raster elevation at each point x y r as follows 10 r x y r ij if there exists i j such that x y c ij otherwise similarly z x y is defined as the function that gives the mesh elevation at each point x y d for each mesh element e s let p e denote the orthogonal projection of e onto the x y plane hence p e d r the volume of the region between mesh element e and the topography defined by the raster is then given by the integral 11 v e p e max z x y r x y 0 d x d y since the integrand is bounded and piecewise continuous on d the integral exists it is noted that in the definition of the integrand any parts of the surface z r x y that lie above the surface z z x y do not contribute to v e the value of v e can be approximated via standard quadrature methods after transformation of p e to the canonical mesh element in r 2 in hgs mesh elements belonging to the surface mesh s may be either triangular or rectangular in shape however the formulation applies in principle to any general element shape the desired depression rill storage height is then obtained as a volumetric height according to 12 h e v e a e where a e is the area of mesh element e we note the computation of depression storage for each surface mesh element is trivially parallelizable and hence can be done efficiently when the number of surface mesh elements is large moreover the computation of depression storage is done only once in a pre processing phase before running the hgs simulation 3 2 finite element mesh a three dimensional irregular finite element mesh fem was designed with 50 m spatial resolution along surface water channels and major roadways and up to 150 m spatial resolution in areas distal to the channels fig 4 in total there are 269 518 elements across the surface domain and 2 695 180 elements across the ten layer subsurface domain 3 3 digital elevation model a lidar based dem with 1 m spatial resolution was provided by assiniboine west watershed district to facilitate data management and manipulation the lidar dem was coarsened to 5 m resolution via bilinear interpolation before implementation to the hgs model the dem was not subjected to a stream burning procedure as all elevation adjustments were made directly to the fem 3 4 surface water network there are 399 km of one dimensional surface water channels resolved in the model fig 5 a the channel geometry was derived from a simplified version of the manitoba land initiative designated drain watercourses manitoba land initiative aggregated into 32 individual polyline segments each with unique geometry for each segment average channel widths were estimated from aerial imagery while depths were estimated from the 1 m dem manning s n for all channels was set to 0 04 down gradient flow was enforced along the channels using elevation controls on fem nodes coincident with channel locations 3 5 landcover spatially distributed landcover was derived from the aafc 2014 annual crop inventory fisette et al 2013 which was simplified to include forests croplands wetlands grasslands open water and urban land uses fig 5b manning s n for each category table 1 was prescribed using literature guidance bunya et al 2010 smith et al 1995 woolhiser 1975 3 6 soil spatially distributed soil information was derived from the agriculture and agri food canada aafc detailed soil survey dss of canada there were 36 different soil polygons according to soil name across the watershed in the model three soil layers were defined for each polygon with their bases at 0 25 0 5 and 1 m depths although each dss soil polygon had different soil properties the specific hydraulic properties estimated for each polygon were considered for computational efficiency uniform across all three soil layers these hydraulic properties were estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer function model using dss polygon sand silt and clay percentages along with bulk density and moisture retention information for 33 kpa and 1500 kpa schaap et al 2001 rosetta in turn produced estimates for residual and saturated water content the van genuchten α and n parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for cases where the dss was missing information requisite details from the dominant local soil polygon with full data was used as proxy data 3 7 hydrostratigraphy underlying the soil are seven layers representing quaternary hydrostratigraphy fig 2 that were derived from 22 two dimensional geological cross section models cross cutting the watershed in regularly spaced 5 km east to west transects matile and keller 2012 within the layering are zones of surficial sand clay sand and gravel upper and lower tills and buried valley aquifer deposits that were treated as sand geometry of the layer surfaces coincides with the interface between contrasting lithologies the bottom surface of the model is defined by the top of bedrock shale which ranges from 8 m to 128 m in depth across the model domain hydraulic conductivity values for the subsurface hydrostratigraphy were derived from existing literature freeze and cherry 1979 grisak and cherry 1975 grisak and jackson 1978 using values of 5 10 5 m s 1 for the sand and gravel units 5 10 6 m s 1 for the sand units 5 10 8 m s 1 for the clay units and 5 10 9m s 1 for the till units as information regarding unsaturated flow and moisture retention characteristics for the quaternary material within the orw is not available van genuchten 1980 parameters reflecting a sand soil textural class were applied to the sand and sand and gravel units and clay soil textural class parameters were applied to the clay and till units the perimeter and the base of the model are considered as no flow boundary conditions 3 8 evapotranspiration for all landcover classes evaporation depth was set to 0 2 m meaning that water in the top 0 2 m of the soil profile would be able to directly evaporate transpiration was configured to be landcover class specific with wetland grassland forest and urban employing static root depth and cropland employing time varying root depth root depth was derived from canadell et al 1996 while lai was derived from modis imagery myneni et al 2015 obtained for the orw region the full set of evapotranspiration parameters are presented in table 2 3 9 climate forcing data daily transient liquid water input was derived from the canadian precipitation analysis capa mahfouf et al 2007 which has been previously evaluated for suitability to hydrologic analysis in the assiniboine river basin xu et al 2019 and provides 10 km resolution for the orw snow accumulation and melting was accounted for external to capa by using a temperature index method where daily mean air temperature obtained from the merra 2 dataset gelaro et al 2017 was used to determine if precipitation should be considered rain or snow based on a 0 c threshold snow melt was considered when air temperature rises above 0 c and was calculated using a degree day method rango and martinec 1995 sublimation was assumed to consume 10 of snowfall daily pet was estimated based on the fao 56 penman monteith equation zotarelli et al 2010 using the merra 2 fields of surface air temperature dew point temperature wind speed pressure and net radiation 3 10 model spinup initializing the model for the daily transient simulations followed a three step process firstly a long term steady state condition was established by forcing the model with a small 0 05 m y 1 continuous amount of liquid water input until stable water table elevation and stream flow rates were established secondly using steady state as an initial condition monthly normal liquid water input and pet derived from merra 2 were used to establish model conditions that reflect average seasonal variability by simulating the same average annual climate cycle until year over year stability was achieved for annual water table and surface water flow rate cyclicity thus yielding a quasi steady state model thirdly using quasi steady state as an initial condition the 2009 2015 daily transient time interval was simulated for two cycles with the 2010 2015 interval from the second cycle being the model evaluation interval 3 11 model performance evaluation calibration of the orw model was kept to a minimum with the only tuned parameters being the c1 and c2 coefficients and the oxic and anoxic limits for the transpiration formulation table 2 the tuning was conducted manually with the objective of minimizing the bias between simulated and observed surface water flow rates at the wsc 05mg004 hydrometric station fig 4 approximately 30 simulations were conducted during the tuning process model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias root mean square error rmse and visual comparison moriasi et al 2007 for simulated vs observed daily flows at 05mg004 for the 2010 2015 time interval for intervals when ice buildup was reported at the hydrometric station the corresponding data was removed from the calibration assessment groundwater simulation performance was evaluated with a comparison between simulated and observed water levels for 125 active wells fig 4 across the watershed groundwater information network 2021 the groundwater monitoring data represents water levels prior to pumping tests and were collected from 1979 to 2005 although the time frame over which the groundwater monitoring data was collected does not align with the simulation interval the data is useful for demarcating ambient groundwater levels across the orw and the exercise helps ensure the range of simulated groundwater levels aligns with spatial observational trends furthermore the absence of localized extraction influences in the observation data align with groundwater representation in the model where extraction is not considered hydraulic properties for the hydrostratigraphic layers were not perturbed during model calibration and hence the groundwater performance evaluation primarily serves as validation that the groundwater levels are adequately reproduced in the model it should be noted that for structurally complex models such as the orw hgs model an advantage they provide over simpler models is that they incorporate a physics based evaluation of the natural system and hence many of their parameters are physically constrained this makes these models ideal for robust scenario analysis on account of their minimal tuning requirements however for such complex models the simulation run times can be long relative to simpler models for example the hgs model herein required approximately 25 days for completion of continuous daily temporal resolution simulations of the 2009 2015 time interval when using four cores of an intel core i7 8700 processor 3 12 model scenarios following model calibration a series of scenarios for the 2009 2015 time interval were simulated in order to quantify the effect of increases and decreases in soil hydraulic conductivity field surface roughness and depressional storage the scenarios were constructed by perturbing model parameters that emulated the effect of soil permeability via saturated hydraulic conductivity agricultural field surface roughness and vegetation cover via the manning s roughness coefficient and depression storage wetlands potholes via global scaling of rill storage in hgs it is important to note that the magnitudes of parameter perturbation were determined based on physical plausibility with numerous studies suggesting that upwards of 50 of the original pre development wetland depression storage capacity has been lost in the orw region in the northern great plains dahl 1990 johnston 2013 kiel et al 1972 rakowski and chabot 1983 soil hydraulic conductivity in prairie soils subject to intensive agriculture can decrease by a factor of 4x or greater bodhinayake and cheng si 2004 chandrasoma et al 2016 fuentes et al 2004 jiang et al 2007 mudgal et al 2010 wu et al 2016 and surface roughness of agricultural land as reflected by manning s roughness coefficient can vary from less than 0 02 to more than 0 06 smith et al 1995 due to tillage and planting practices martinez agirre et al 2016 and stubble management freebairn and boughton 1985 as such the parameter sensitivity analyses conducted here can be related to indicators of land management practice impacts on flood and drought regulation as a modeled indicator of influence a detailed description of model parameterization changes for each land management focused scenario is provided in table 3 while it is acknowledged that the model scenarios do not test the impact of changes in engineered or physical infrastructure such as roadbeds drainage works and channel modifications the scenario that includes an increase in all three landscape components depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness can be used to provide insight on orw hydrologic behavior if the agricultural lands were in a predevelopment condition in addition to the land management scenarios sensitivity of the orw to climate variability was evaluated via scenarios where climatology was perturbed using global scaling such that a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in both precipitation and pet were considered it should be noted that both precipitation and pet exhibit more than 10 annual variability over the 2010 2015 interval table 4 following parameter perturbation for each scenario two consecutive cycles of the 2009 2010 time interval were simulated with all analysis conducted on the second cycle to ensure the initial conditions for each scenario were stable 4 results 4 1 2009 2015 climatology for the 2009 2015 transient simulation interval total annual precipitation ranged from 387 mm in 2012 to 586 mm in 2014 table 4 annual precipitation was 529 mm in 2011 making it the fourth highest in terms of total precipitation even though the highest peak surface water flow rates in the 2009 2015 interval were observed in 2011 however it should be noted that precipitation in 2011 was weighted towards the first half of the year fig 6 while the second half of the year was comparably dry with the dry conditions extending into the 2012 drought mallya et al 2013 pet tended to follow a trend opposite to that of precipitation and ranged from 695 mm in 2014 to 851 mm in 2012 with the annual hydrologic cycle in the orw dominated by et in the sense that pet is consistently greater than precipitation it was expected that surface runoff groundwater discharge and watershed outflow would be highly dependent on precipitation timing and intensity as evidenced by the genesis of both the 2011 and 2014 floods in the region brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 4 2 model performance as percent bias was the calibration target the strong match between simulated and observed flow at the hydrometric gauging station fig 4 as demonstrated with a percent bias statistic of 0 88 was to be expected fig 7 a as further validation the nse statistic of 0 76 provides a variance based assessment that simulated and observed flow rates closely match the rmse statistic of 1 94 m3 s 1 shows that the residuals are generally small in relation to observed flows and the good visual match between the simulated and observed hydrographs indicates the temporal variability in surface water flow is captured by the model while the aforementioned performance metrics are based on daily flow evaluation over the 2010 to 2015 time interval this study primarily focuses on the two flood years when evaluated for 2011 and 2014 individually the respective nse metrics are 0 73 and 0 69 while the percent bias metrics are 6 18 and 17 93 which demonstrates the model performs well for the years of primary interest in the analysis evaluation of groundwater simulation results demonstrates the model captures the general trend in groundwater levels with the r2 and rmse between simulated and observed groundwater levels being 0 97 and 6 9 m respectively fig 7b the model captures the spatial variability in groundwater levels across the orw quite well considering that there is over 220 m of topographic relief amongst the 125 observation points strong model performance supports the parameterization and calibration approach wherein parameter tuning primarily focused on empirical et parameters hydraulic parameters were left untouched thus letting model structural complexity and not parameter manipulation control simulated surface and subsurface water flow it should also be recognized that the model performance statistics reflect evaluation conditions ranging from drought in 2012 to extreme flooding in 2011 and 2014 and the visual validation of the model s ability to reproduce the annual and inter annual variability further support the model s strong performance 4 3 climate sensitivity the plus and minus 10 scaling of both precipitation and pet identifies the high sensitivity of the orw to changes in climate conditions fig 8 for the precipitation perturbation the induced variability resulted in a difference of 242 106 m3 and 264 106 m3 in total watershed discharge for 2011 and 2014 which amounts to approximately 50 and 60 difference in annual discharge relative to the base case for the respective years for the pet perturbation the induced variability resulted in a change of total discharge only slightly less than that of precipitation with a difference of 206 106 m3 and 223 106 m3 for 2011 and 2014 respectively which amounts to approximately 40 and 50 difference in discharge relative to the base case the higher sensitivity to both precipitation and pet fluctuation in 2014 as compared to 2011 highlights that seasonal aspects of climate variability is also a factor with precipitation in 2011 weighted towards winter and spring whereas in 2014 it was more evenly distributed across the full year 4 4 landscape management sensitivity 4 4 1 surface water flow response of the five landscape sensitivity scenarios the plus 50 change in rill depressional storage combined with an increase in ks and manning s n had the greatest overall impact on discharge characteristics for both 2011 and 2014 with a respective reduction in total annual discharge relative to the calibrated model base case of approximately 16 in both years fig 9j the scenario where only rill storage was increased resulted in a reduction in annual discharge of approximately 11 and 17 for 2011 and 2014 fig 9b increasing ks resulted in a reduction in annual discharge of approximately 2 and 3 for 2011 and 2014 respectively fig 9d in contrast to rill storage and ks where increasing parameter values led to reduced annual discharge increasing manning s n resulted in an increase in annual discharge of 2 and 6 in 2011 and 2014 respectively fig 9f when comparing scenario results it should be noted that increasing manning s n only slows down surface runoff whereas increasing rill storage can stop surface runoff if the spill level is not achieved in the simulations slower surface runoff resulted in increased water retention on the land surface at the end of 2010 and 2013 thus leading to the increase in annual discharge during 2011 and 2014 in the case where both ks and manning s n were increased fig 9h differences in annual discharge were minimal for 2011 and 2014 suggesting that higher soil permeability facilitates higher infiltration under the scenario where surface runoff is slowed because of higher surface friction increasing rill storage ks and manning s n individually and in combination all result in a reduction in peak flow rates during both the 2011 and 2014 floods fig 10 in the case of rill storage the difference in peak flow rate between the 50 and 50 scenario was 46 m3 s 1 and 30 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively for ks the difference in peak flow between the 4x and the 0 25x scenario was 4 m3 s 1 and 8 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively while for manning s n the difference in peak flow between the 50 and 50 scenarios was 16 m3 s 1 for both 2011 and 2014 changing both ks and manning s n together in the same simulation provided an additive response towards their influence on the peak flow rate with a difference of 19 m3 s 1 and 17 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively furthermore when rill storage ks and manning s n were all changed together the result is a difference in peak flow of 61 m3 s 1 and 49 m3 s 1 for 2011 and 2014 respectively in terms of peak flow relative to the base case the increases in rill storage ks manning s n ks manning s n and rill storage ks manning s n yielded a respective reduction of 18 1 5 6 8 and 25 in the 2011 flood peak and 15 4 8 8 5 and 22 in the 2014 flood peak different parameter perturbations also induce different changes in the general shape of the hydrograph leading up to and following the flood peak where an early spring peak in surface flow precedes that of the summer flood in 2014 increasing rill storage ks ks manning s n and rill storage ks manning s n all led to a reduction in the magnitude of both peaks whereas only increasing manning s n led to an increase in the first peak but a reduction in the second fig 10 the higher flow magnitude during the first peak reflects the influence of wet fall conditions in 2013 that created a situation where the higher surface roughness scenario retained more water on the land surface and in the soil profile which then led to increased runoff in spring 2014 furthermore while an increase in both rill storage and ks tend to reduce the overall flood discharge volume increasing manning s n tends to extend the flood hydrograph such that the total discharge volume is similar even though the peak flow is reduced the reduced discharge volume associated with the scenario where both ks and manning s n were increased points to the influence that higher soil permeability can have on reducing overland flow when water ponds on the land surface however it also needs to be recognized that once the subsurface becomes saturated infiltration rates can decline significantly and hence the mitigating effects of ks are diminished in such situations rill storage becomes the dominant mechanism for flow reduction 4 4 2 land surface water storage the total water volume stored in the orw land surface and surface water network is presented in fig 11 the strong influence of rill storage on surface water storage is evident with an average of 70 106 m3 in additional water consistently present in the 50 scenario compared to the 50 scenario fig 11a which equates to an additional 0 035 m of water across the entire watershed surface if it were evenly distributed similarly increasing manning s n also results in consistently more surface water when compared to the scenario where manning s n was decreased fig 11e with an average difference of 9 7 106 m3 in contrast the scenario where ks is increased results in an average of 12 5 106 m3 less water stored in the surface as compared to the scenario where ks is decreased fig 11c in the case where both ks manning s n were increased fig 11g there is on average 7 9 106 m3 less water stored on the surface in comparison to the scenario where ks manning s n were decreased however during both the 2011 and 2014 floods there are points where the relationship shifts and there is temporarily more surface water in the scenario where ks manning s n are increased when rill storage ks manning s n was all increased together fig 11i the dominant effect of rill storage is again observed with there being consistently more water stored in the surface water system relative to the scenario where all three landscape parameters were decreased 4 4 3 groundwater recharge and storage increased water storage on the land surface and surface water network also leads to increased water storage in the subsurface from the top of the bedrock surface to the top of the soil profile fig 11 in the scenario where rill storage was increased fig 11b there is on average 8 2 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where rill storage was decreased with the largest difference observed in mid to late summer during the evapotranspiration driven trough in annual subsurface storage for the scenario where ks was increased fig 11d there is on average 4 7 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where ks was decreased with the largest differences observed during the fall to late winter interval in the case where manning s n was increased fig 11f there is on average 7 4 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface as compared to the case where manning s n was decreased with the seasonal differences less pronounced than the rill storage and ks scenarios in the case where both ks manning s n were increased fig 11h there was on average 7 7 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the case where both ks manning s n were decreased with the seasonal trends similar to that of the ks scenario the largest difference in subsurface water storage is observed when rill storage ks manning s n was perturbed fig 11j with the scenario where the parameters were increased resulting in an average of 14 97 106 m3 more water stored in the subsurface in comparison to the scenario where parameters were decreased similar to the influences on surface water storage and flood peak flow magnitudes the parameter influences on subsurface water storage suggest that the three parameters evaluated here are additive in their combined ability to increase or decrease subsurface storage 5 discussion and conclusions the fully integrated groundwater surface water model employed in this study was able to reproduce extreme hydrologic behavior over the 2010 to 2015 time interval including flood conditions in 2011 and 2014 as demonstration of the value that structural complexity adds to physically based models for the great plains region the model exhibited skilled performance when simulating surface water flows and groundwater conditions even though the model was subjected to minimal calibration given that the northern great plains is noted to be a challenging region for hydrologic model application muhammad et al 2019 unduche et al 2018 the methodology applied here provides a template for future modeling applications wherein physical realism within the model structure is necessary for capturing the complex hydrological behavior of this landscape out of all the hydrologic sensitivities evaluated with the model the scenarios where precipitation and pet were perturbed by 10 resulted in the largest stream flow response which is consistent with previous analysis of hydrologic behavior in the great plains villarini and strong 2014 with both the 10 precipitation and the 10 pet scenarios leading to notable changes in peak flow rates during the 2011 and 2014 floods the study area s hydrologic susceptibility to climate variability is highlighted from the sensitivity assessments related to land management perturbing depression storage induced a greater hydrologic response than perturbing soil permeability and surface roughness either individually or in combination when considering the influence of combined factors on flow conditions results from the scenarios where depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness were all changed suggest there is an additive effect when multiple factors are incorporated for the sensitivity assessments pertaining to land management parameter perturbations that resulted in reduced peak flow rates also resulted in increased subsurface water storage which highlights that the groundwater system and its role in providing drought resiliency can be an important consideration when evaluating watershed hydrologic behavior in the northern great plains while real world implementation of the model scenarios at the full scale of the orw may not be feasible e g increasing wetland pothole storage by 50 across 2000 km2 is currently an untenable objective the modeling results provide insight on how the watershed in its predevelopment state would have responded to the 2011 and 2014 floods if the model scenario with increased depression storage soil permeability and surface roughness is used to represent predevelopment conditions results suggest that landscape changes associated with development have led to a 22 to 25 increase in flood peak flows in the orw the modeling results also point to how landscape management can be used to promote drought resiliency in the northern great plains with practices that enhance flood regulation being shown to promote groundwater recharge wherein groundwater is an especially important water resource during drought conditions mckay et al 1989 the results from this modeling study have implication for landscape management decisions and provide a means for quantifying the impact of soil permeability field surface roughness and depression storage on flood regulation in the northern great plains as the spatially varying rill storage formulation and inclusion of a 1d channel domain in hgs have not yet been presented in the literature inclusion of this functionality here can help guide future model construction initiatives it is envisioned that the fully integrated hydrologic modeling methodology employed in the study herein will help to optimize watershed management and provide a linkage between groundwater and surface water hydrology and ecosystem goods and services as a next step coupling the model outputs to an economic analysis wherein the value of depression storage soil permeability and land surface roughness are appraised within a monetary context will extend the utility of the modeling towards decision
