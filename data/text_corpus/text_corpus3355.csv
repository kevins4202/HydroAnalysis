multiple metabolic pathways of a frequently found fq enrofloxacin enr by ryegrass lolium perenne l key metabolic genes for driving the metabolism of enr have been identified using transcriptome profiling of l perenne and gene network analysis toxicity of enr on ryegrass has been evaluated according to the morphological changes lipid peroxidation content and antioxidant enzymatic activities moreover there was 94 33 71 58 57 22 and 55 23 removal of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr respectively which was mainly achieved by biodegradation according to the mass balance a biodegradation pathway has been proposed by incorporating mass spectrums of extracted enr intermediates with their formation dynamics analysis of differentially expressed genes degs and their network unraveled that the genes encoding monooxygenase oxidative carboxylase methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase and peroxidase were the key functional genes these enzymes can induce di hydroxylation decarboxylation methylation and bond and ring cleavage of enr for its effective degradation this study demonstrated that ryegrass can be used for efficient treatment of enr polluted water and extended the understanding of the molecular mechanism of antibiotics biodegradation in plants keywords phytoremediation fluoroquinolone antibiotics degradation pathway metabolic genes ryegrass toxicity 1 introduction fluoroquinolones are widely used in the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in livestock culture and fish farming worldwide however more than 70 of such applied antibiotics are discharged into the environment with feces and urines oberoi et al 2019 lei et al 2019 lu et al 2020 fluoroquinolones fqs are natured of persistence and long half lives 100 days in soil and water resulting their frequent contamination in surface water groundwater wastewater seawater and soil patel et al 2019 residual fqs are of high risks to humans because they can acclimate bacteria and induce antibiotic resistance genes karkman et al 2019 adverse effects of fqs such as inhibited growth of phytoplankton bacteria vegetative plants and invertebrates reduction of microbial diversity and disruption of carbon and nitrogen cycling have been well documented xiong et al 2017b zhu et al 2020a kurade et al 2021 moreover current conventional technologies are inefficient for removal of such trace organic pollutants villar navarro et al 2018 these evidences indicate an urgent need of a comprehensive toxicity evaluation and effective treatment approach toward fqs phytoremediation has been a sustainable green technology due to its high environmental friendliness tenacious vitality and high capacity to remove various organic and inorganic pollutants from water and soil khandare and govindwar 2015 dela paz et al 2019 earlier studies have demonstrated that plants such as typha ipomoea iris lolium and festuca are capable to remove diverse emerging organic contaminants khandare and govindwar 2015 for example typha angustifolia and ipomoea aquatica removed 80 of doxylamine from municipal wastewater xiong et al 2021 the concentration of sulfonamide decreased from 30 mg l 1 to 0 1 mg l 1 achieving 99 7 removal by vallisneria natans lour hara after 13 days of cultivation zhu et al 2020b most previous studies have focused on the reduction of biomass and changes in morphological structure of plants induced by antibiotics as well as their removals bartikova et al 2016 rare investigations have focused on the formation dynamics of antibiotic intermediates and corresponding driven metabolic genes analysis of majority metabolites of organic pollutant and their variations over time can supply more information to predict actual biodegradation pathways moreover although several enzymes have been reported to induce biotransformation of several xenobiotics such as benzotriazoles chlorophenols and dyes kurade et al 2021 khandare and govindwar 2015 the in depth molecular mechanism to identify the key functional enzymes and genes is still unclear and more investigations are essential ryegrass lolium perenne l is a perennial and rooted pasture which is widely introduced and cultivated in grassland worldwide it can be readily exposed to various antibiotics through the feces and urine of livestock ryegrass has acted as a model plant to analyze the toxicity of various in organic contaminants including tetracycline pyrene ionic liquids and heavy metals whilst ryegrass also shows effective removal of imidazolium based ionic liquids 80 and pyrene 90 habibul et al 2020 however there is still limited data to unravel the biodegradation and metabolic fate of antibiotics as well as the driven genes in ryegrass in this study the objectives are to evaluate the effect of a frequently found antibiotic enrofloxacin enr on the physiological and morphologic characteristics of l perenne explore the capacity of ryegrass to remove enr identify the metabolic intermediates and

discussion 3 1 effects of enr on ryegrass growth and biochemical characteristics leaves of ryegrass turned yellow and root elongation was inhibited at 1 mg l 1 enr comparing to the control after 10 days of cultivation fig s1a the biomass of ryegrass was 0 063 0 047 0 036 0 024 and 0 02 g and root length were 12 05 9 70 8 38 5 78 and 4 68 cm respectively at 0 1 10 50 100 mg l 1 enr after 10 days of cultivation the biomass and root length of ryegrass were significantly decreased by 19 33 61 12 and 25 44 68 32 respectively with exposure to 1 100 mg l 1 enr at day 10 fig s1b c earlier studies have shown that antibiotics caused significant morphological alterations on ryegrass for example the antibiotic tetracycline decreased the length and fresh weight of root by 41 46 84 51 and 46 45 63 03 at 1 100 mg l 1 han et al 2019 high concentrations 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 of sulfonamide induced significant toxicity on the plant vallisneria natans lour hara bartikova et al 2016 environmental stresses induce severe toxicological effects on the plant since these factors disrupt the cellular metabolic activities such as photosynthesis and nutrients uptake and cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros it has been demonstrated that ros can oxidize the cellular components and increase the permeability of the cell membrane which ultimately inhibited the growth of plant xiong et al 2018 the ros level of plant can be predicted by malondialdehyde mda which is a metabolic byproduct of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid in plants the mda content of ryegrass significantly increased by 26 2 37 1 40 5 and 44 2 respectively with exposure to 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig 1 a exposed to 1 100 mg l 1 tetracycline also increased the mda content by 0 73 176 han et al 2019 in higher plants there is a complex antioxidant enzymatic system to neutralize ros for protection of oxidative damages whereas the sod and cat act as the first defense line activities of sod were significantly enhanced by 53 2 99 4 62 1 and 21 4 respectively comparing to the control at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr at day 10 fig 1b in contrast there was a decrease in cat activities fig 1c sod is responsible for transformation of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide which was then converted into water by subsequent enzymes such as pod activities of pod were 15 480 18 130 18 990 18 710 and 21 140 u g 1 respectively at same doses of enr fig 1d these results indicated sod and pod played essential roles in protecting plant cells from oxidative damage caused by enr stress 3 2 removal kinetics and mechanism of enr removal kinetics of enr by ryegrass were shown in fig 2 a and there was a gradual decrease of enr during 10 days of cultivation final removal of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr was 94 33 71 58 57 22 and 55 23 respectively after 10 days of cultivation fig 2a removal kinetics of enr have been analyzed by a first order model the values of removal rate constant k and the half lives t1 2 ranged from 0 08 to 0 23 d 1 and 3 04 8 61 days table 1 earlier studies have demonstrated that phytoremediation can act as an effective strategy for treatment of antibiotics from water for example the plants t angustifolia and i aquatica caused 48 80 5 dissipation of doxylamine from secondary wastewater xiong et al 2021 five widely distributed wetland plants ruellia simplex thalia dealbata lythrum salicaria cyperus papyrus and acorus calamus removed 44 5 56 9 of ten sulfonamides at 1 mg l 1 after one month of cultivation in nutrients medium chen et al 2021 a submerged plant vallisneria natans lour hara was able to remove 90 of 10 50 mg l 1 sulfonamide after 13 days of cultivation zhu et al 2020b rhizosphere microbes of phragmites australis achieved 53 removal of 2 mg l 1 enr alexandrino et al 2017 removal of enr by different microbes such as bacteria and microalgae has been reported with treatment efficiencies ranging from 26 to 50 j q xiong et al 2017 santos et al 2019 whilst this study demonstrated ryegrass can be a good candidate for remediation of enr from water the removal mechanisms of enr by ryegrass were elucidated according to the mass balance which was achieved by calculating the contribution percentage of different biological processes biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption and abiotic processes table 1 there was a negligible decrease of enr amount in the abiotic controls bioaccumulated amount of enr in ryegrass root increased with elevated enr doses the final uptake concentrations in roots of ryegrass were 9 93 80 94 528 02 and 910 52 μg g 1 respectively at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig 2b bioconcentration factors bcfs were 115 09 21 81 20 28 and 17 67 which were far higher than 1 mass balance of biological removal has shown the main removal mechanism for enr dissipation was biodegradation the highest biodegradation of enr was 89 01 by ryegrass which was achieved at 1 mg l 1 enr at day 10 there was a gradual decrease of biodegradation percentage with elevation of enr dosage at the same time most of the metabolites of enr were detected in water samples and changed over time within 10 days fig 3 it confirmed that biodegradation is the main process of enr removal in water 3 3 proposed biodegradation pathway of enr by ryegrass identified metabolic byproducts from the degradation of enr can be used to predict its potential transformation mechanisms by ryegrass and formation dynamics of such intermediates can be incorporated with their mass spectrums to propose a more accurate degradation pathway zhang et al 2019 kurade et al 2021 in the current study seven metabolites have been identified using lc ms2 and the obtained mass spectrums were provided in table s1 two potential metabolic pathways of enr were proposed according to the available literature and chemical libraries with fulling evaluation of the fate of these identified intermediates figs 3 table s1 in pathway 1 p1 was produced by the cleavage of cn bond induced by hydroxylation and methylation which was further hydroxylated into p2 the relative peak area of metabolites p1 and p2 also increased at day 4 indicating the potential of route 1 for degradation of enr in route 2 enr was disrupted by ring cleavage hydroxylation and decarboxylation with the generation of p3 which was further hydroxylated to form p4 peak areas of p3 and p4 gradually decreased during 10 days of exposure both compounds p2 and p4 can be dehydroxylated and methylated to produce p5 maximum peak area of p5 was observed at day 6 and remained at a high level ever since combination of the enzymatic reactions and peak area changes we hypothesized p5 has been the main intermediates which can be further hydrogenated and hydroxylated to induce ring cleavage with p6 as a product the final product p7 was formed by di hydroxylation and methylation of p6 and peak areas of compounds p6 and p7 were relatively small during the whole exposure time fig 4 these results showed that main degradation of enr was induced by pathway 1 with generating a dominant product p5 3 4 differentially expressed genes for metabolism of enrofloxacin most of the earlier studies have demonstrated that there is a toxic effect of antibiotics on plants and phytoremediation can achieve effective removal of low concentrations of such emerging organic contaminants however there is limited data to propose the degradation pathway using formation dynamics of metabolic intermediates and unravel the related genes for understanding in depth molecular mechanisms we have analyzed the transcriptome profiling of ryegrass exposed to enr to elucidate such aspects base mass distribution of sample was used to evaluate the sequence quality the error rates of all the base mass values ranged from 0 02 to 0 04 promising the sequencing quality fig s2 total size of 77 73 g of clean data was generated from 12 samples and the effective results of each sample ranged from 5 92 g to 6 96 g table s2 a total number of 93 159 unigenes were spliced with a length of 86 342 174 bp and an average length of 926 83 bp among them 12 869 13 81 genes were annotated into the kegg library the comparison rate of reads on unigene was 85 7 87 93 the correlation coefficient among the three replicates was about 0 98 indicating high reliance of the obtained data fig s3 the ranges of correlation coefficients at different experimental sets 1 mg l 1 vs control 50 mg l 1 vs control and 100 mg l 1 vs control were 0 94 0 97 0 82 0 90 and 0 76 0 82 respectively the pca analysis showed that the gene expression clusters in control and 1 mg l 1 enr treatment were distinguishable from those in 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig s3 which is consistent with the results shown in heatmap fig s4 the difference of gene expression was reflected in the volcano map triangle points with red and green indicate the differently expressed genes with a fold change of 2 and a false discovery rate fdr of 0 05 or 0 01 gray indicates no significant difference in expression fig 5 the number of differentially expressed genes degs were 3077 1128 up and 1949 down regulated 10 782 6977 up and 8227 down regulated and 18 738 9029 up and 9709 down regulated respectively at the different experimental sets 1 mg l 1 vs control 50 mg l 1 vs control 100 mg l 1 vs control fig 5d it can be seen the number of degs at 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr were significantly larger than that of 1 mg l 1 indicating a significant effect on the transcriptome of ryegrass caused by high doses of enr go enrichment analysis showed the upregulated genes monitored go terms biological processes cellular components and molecular functions fig s5 it indicated the biological processes such as glutathione metabolic process detoxification response to xenobiotic stimulus cellular response to drug and drug transmembrane transport in ryegrass have been enhanced under 1 mg l 1 enr whilst the molecular functions including glutathione transferase activity glutathione binding oxidoreductase activities acting on paired donors and diphenols atpase activity transferase activity and monooxygenase activities have been significantly upregulated at the same concentration antibiotics can be biodegraded by the enzymes of phase i and phase ii families goldstein et al 2014 hu et al 2021 in the phase i enzymatic system cytochrome 450 enzymes cyp450 play important roles wang et al 2017 the number of degs encoding cyp450 increased significantly with exposure to enr table 2 kegg pathway analysis showed that most of the changed genes have been involved in glutathione metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways fig s6 3 5 1 changes of genes involved in cyp450 enzyme families the results showed that there were 3 8 and 9 up regulated cytochrome 450 enzymatic families cyp450 genes such as cyp1 cyp7 cyp8 and cyp9 enzyme families cyp450 are auto oxidizable heme proteins and participate in the metabolism of endogenous substances and exogenous substances among them cyp51 and cyp1a1 belong to cyp450 monooxygenase superfamily and can induce methyl to carboxyl conversion on aromatic ring dihydroxylation and cleavage of aromatic ring de hydrogenation di hydroxylation and oxidation reduction zhang et al 2013 he et al 2017 the expression level of cyp1a1 increased by 1 56 1 95 and 3 05 folds at 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr whist expression of cyp51 was increased by 1 24 3 33 and 2 98 times table 2 cyp51 and cyp 1a1 may be involved in the metabolic process of the first stage of enr cyp99a2 3 can act as oxidoreductase and catalyzes oxidations of the c19 methyl group wang et al 2019 upregulated cyp99a2 3 expression in ryegrass by 1 73 3 24 and 1 68 folds at 1 50 and 100 mg enr l 1 has been observed compared to the control higher concentrations of enr have induced more expression of the enzymes including cyp701 cyp84a cyp734a1 cyp73a cyp76a26 which can monitor the enzymatic reactions including di hydroxylation decarboxylation de methylation and oxidation reduction matamoros et al 2012 chen et al 2017a kurade et al 2019 in kegg pathways cyp701 has caused the insertion of a hydroxyl functional group into the methyl group r06291 cyp84a and cyp75a act as the hydroxylase k20623 k09755 k13083 cyp73a has been defined as trans cinnamate 4 monooxygenase which plays an essential role in the degradation of aromatic compounds ko01220 involvement of cyp734a1 in the regulation of plant growth has been reported and overexpression of cyp734a1 can result in dwarfism these results demonstrated that several genes encoding cyp450 enzyme system of ryegrass have been significantly upregulated which may be the key factors to induce the biodegradation of enr 3 5 2 genes related to glutathione metabolism degs are significantly enriched in the glutathione metabolism fig s7a and upregulated degs involved in this pathway have been shown in table 3 genes encode glutathione s transferase gst was expressed 1 20 3 69 and 3 35 times higher with exposure to 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr comparing to the control gsts act on the first phase metabolites formed by the monitoring of cyp450 and participate in the second stage drug metabolism chen et al 2017b liu et al 2021 meanwhile gstp was significantly up regulated by 4 49 and 6 83 times and hpgds for hematopoietic prostaglandin d synthase was significantly up regulated by 3 22 and 5 05 times in the medium and high enr dose groups table 3 other genes in the glutathione metabolism pathway such as ec 2 5 1 16 are highly expressed to promote the synthesis of glutathione zhang et al 2021 the gamma glutamyltranspeptidase encoding genes ggt1 5 and ggt were significantly up regulated by 1 26 and 1 21 times at 50 mg l 1 enr and 1 57 and 1 56 times in 100 mg l 1 enr treatment a gene named pgd encoding 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has greatly expressed at 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr which is 225 3 183 9 and 321 1 higher than that in control this enzyme is an oxidative carboxylase and induces decarboxylation ohara et al 2004 at higher concentrations of enr the oxidative decarboxylation can be induced by isocitrate dehydrogenase since the gene expression encoding this enzyme has been significantly increased by 2 78 and 3 33 folds at 50 and 100 mg l 1 these upregulated expressions of genes can promise enzymatic reactions such as decarboxylation and dehydrogenation table 4 3 5 3 expression changes of genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis e2 1 1 104 can monitor the enzyme of caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase and its expression has been elevated by 2 35 and 2 89 folds with 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr the gene katg encodes catalase peroxidase sarni et al 1984 which has been more expressed by 239 6 and 251 6 with same concentrations of enr the trends of catalase peroxidase encoding gene are also consistent with the peroxidase activities expression of the genes pal cad ref1 encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase cinnamyl alcohol nadp oxidoreductase and coniferyl aldehyde dehydrogenase has been significantly increased by 124 160 and 117 respectively at 50 mg l 1 enr fig s7b these genes encode methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase monooxygenase and peroxidase and have been significantly expressed compared to the control these enzymes promised the reaction of methylation bong and ring cleavage hydrogenation and di hydroxylation with reacting with the chnh and choh groups kuhnl et al 1989 louie et al 2006 singh et al 2007 on the other side phenylpropanoid metabolism is an important pathway of secondary metabolite metabolism in plants which plays an important role in response to environmental pressure liu et al 2021 manganoic acid forms phenylalanine through transamination and then enters phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway through a series of intermediate products it forms flavonoids lignin and other metabolites udp glucose scopoletin glucosyltransferase togt1 4 coumarate coa ligase 4cl and cinnamoyl coa reductase ccr are responsible for the regulation of the key plant defense enzymes in this pathway these enzymes can scavenge toxic free radicals produced in the first and second stages of drug metabolism to improve the antioxidant capacity of plants the changed expression of genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis can act as the key factors for regulating the synthesis of both catalytic and antioxidant enzymes in plants which is critical for their defensive and metabolic mechanisms 3 6 network analysis for identification of key metabolic genes network analysis of the identified metabolic degs was conducted to investigate the key genes in ryegrass to drive the degradation of sfm where co expression correlation analysis of degs involved in cyp450 glutathione metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was curated tables s3 4 the results indicated that genes such as cyp51 cyp92a6 cyp86b1 cyp73a and cyp99a2 3 encoding cyp450 enzyme families and genes e1 11 1 7 e3 2 1 21 ccr 4cl and cad for the enzymes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway have been the key functional genes of ryegrass at 50 mg l 1 enr fig 6 a whilst there are more correlated genes in 100 mg l 1 enr treated group fig 6b where the cyp51 cyp92a6 cyp73a cyp99a2 3 cyp86b1 cyp76a26 and cyp84af5h are key cyp450 genes ggt hpgds and gstp are main functional genes in glutathione metabolism pathway and e1 11 1 7 togt1 cad ccr bg1b are essential genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway this network analysis confirmed the essential role of these genes and helped to identify the key functional genes involved in the protective and metabolic pathways of ryegrass among the degs 4 conclusion ryegrass was tolerant with high concentrations of enr with achievements of its 90 removal through biodegradation seven intermediates have been identified which can be generated from di hydroxylation bond and ring cleavage de methylation and decarboxylation a metabolic pathway has been proposed according to the formation dynamics of the identified intermediates transcriptomics analysis and gene network analysis showed that genes encoding cyp450 enzyme families methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase monooxygenase and peroxidase play essential roles in biodegradation of enr these enzymes can be the key driven factors for the ryegrass mediated metabolism of enr overall this study has provided insights of the mechanisms of toxicity biodegradation and metabolic fate of enr in ryegrass and unraveled the potentially driven genes for the

moreover there was 94 33 71 58 57 22 and 55 23 removal of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr respectively which was mainly achieved by biodegradation according to the mass balance a biodegradation pathway has been proposed by incorporating mass spectrums of extracted enr intermediates with their formation dynamics analysis of differentially expressed genes degs and their network unraveled that the genes encoding monooxygenase oxidative carboxylase methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase and peroxidase were the key functional genes these enzymes can induce di hydroxylation decarboxylation methylation and bond and ring cleavage of enr for its effective degradation this study demonstrated that ryegrass can be used for efficient treatment of enr polluted water and extended the understanding of the molecular mechanism of antibiotics biodegradation in plants keywords phytoremediation fluoroquinolone antibiotics degradation pathway metabolic genes ryegrass toxicity 1 introduction fluoroquinolones are widely used in the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in livestock culture and fish farming worldwide however more than 70 of such applied antibiotics are discharged into the environment with feces and urines oberoi et al 2019 lei et al 2019 lu et al 2020 fluoroquinolones fqs are natured of persistence and long half lives 100 days in soil and water resulting their frequent contamination in surface water groundwater wastewater seawater and soil patel et al 2019 residual fqs are of high risks to humans because they can acclimate bacteria and induce antibiotic resistance genes karkman et al 2019 adverse effects of fqs such as inhibited growth of phytoplankton bacteria vegetative plants and invertebrates reduction of microbial diversity and disruption of carbon and nitrogen cycling have been well documented xiong et al 2017b zhu et al 2020a kurade et al 2021 moreover current conventional technologies are inefficient for removal of such trace organic pollutants villar navarro et al 2018 these evidences indicate an urgent need of a comprehensive toxicity evaluation and effective treatment approach toward fqs phytoremediation has been a sustainable green technology due to its high environmental friendliness tenacious vitality and high capacity to remove various organic and inorganic pollutants from water and soil khandare and govindwar 2015 dela paz et al 2019 earlier studies have demonstrated that plants such as typha ipomoea iris lolium and festuca are capable to remove diverse emerging organic contaminants khandare and govindwar 2015 for example typha angustifolia and ipomoea aquatica removed 80 of doxylamine from municipal wastewater xiong et al 2021 the concentration of sulfonamide decreased from 30 mg l 1 to 0 1

structure of plants induced by antibiotics as well as their removals bartikova et al 2016 rare investigations have focused on the formation dynamics of antibiotic intermediates and corresponding driven metabolic genes analysis of majority metabolites of organic pollutant and their variations over time can supply more information to predict actual biodegradation pathways moreover although several enzymes have been reported to induce biotransformation of several xenobiotics such as benzotriazoles chlorophenols and dyes kurade et al 2021 khandare and govindwar 2015 the in depth molecular mechanism to identify the key functional enzymes and genes is still unclear and more investigations are essential ryegrass lolium perenne l is a perennial and rooted pasture which is widely introduced and cultivated in grassland worldwide it can be readily exposed to various antibiotics through the feces and urine of livestock ryegrass has acted as a model plant to analyze the toxicity of various

discussion 3 1 effects of enr on ryegrass growth and biochemical characteristics leaves of ryegrass turned yellow and root elongation was inhibited at 1 mg l 1 enr comparing to the control after 10 days of cultivation fig s1a the biomass of ryegrass was 0 063 0 047 0 036 0 024 and 0 02 g and root length were 12 05 9 70 8 38 5 78 and 4 68 cm respectively at 0 1 10 50 100 mg l 1 enr after 10 days of cultivation the biomass and root length of ryegrass were significantly decreased by 19 33 61 12 and 25 44 68 32 respectively with exposure to 1 100 mg l 1 enr at day 10 fig s1b c earlier studies have shown that antibiotics caused significant morphological alterations on ryegrass for example the antibiotic tetracycline decreased the length and fresh weight of root by 41 46 84 51 and 46 45 63 03 at 1 100 mg l 1 han et al 2019 high concentrations 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 of sulfonamide induced significant toxicity on the plant vallisneria natans lour hara bartikova et al 2016 environmental stresses induce severe toxicological effects on the plant since these factors disrupt the cellular metabolic activities such as photosynthesis and nutrients uptake and cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros it has been demonstrated that ros can oxidize the cellular components and increase the permeability of the cell membrane which ultimately inhibited the growth of plant xiong et al 2018 the ros level of plant can be predicted by malondialdehyde mda which is a metabolic byproduct of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid in plants the mda content of ryegrass significantly increased by 26 2 37 1 40 5 and 44 2 respectively with exposure to 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig 1 a exposed to 1 100 mg l 1 tetracycline also increased the mda content by 0 73 176 han et al 2019 in higher plants there is a complex antioxidant enzymatic system to neutralize ros for protection of oxidative damages whereas the sod and cat act as the first defense line activities of sod were significantly enhanced by 53 2 99 4 62 1 and 21 4 respectively comparing to the control at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr at day 10 fig 1b in contrast there was a decrease in cat activities fig 1c sod is responsible for transformation of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide which was then converted into water by subsequent enzymes such as pod activities of pod were 15 480 18 130 18 990 18 710 and 21 140 u g

mechanism of enr removal kinetics of enr by ryegrass were shown in fig 2 a and there was a gradual decrease of enr during 10 days of cultivation final removal of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr was 94 33 71 58 57 22 and 55 23 respectively after 10 days of cultivation fig 2a removal kinetics of enr have been analyzed by a first order model the values of removal rate constant k and the half lives t1 2 ranged from 0 08 to 0 23 d 1 and 3 04 8 61 days table 1 earlier studies have demonstrated that phytoremediation can act as an effective strategy for treatment of antibiotics from water for example the plants t angustifolia and i aquatica caused 48 80 5 dissipation of doxylamine from secondary wastewater xiong et al 2021 five widely distributed wetland plants ruellia simplex thalia dealbata lythrum salicaria cyperus papyrus and acorus calamus removed 44 5 56 9 of ten sulfonamides at 1 mg l 1 after one month of cultivation in nutrients medium chen et al 2021 a submerged plant vallisneria natans lour hara was able to remove 90 of 10 50 mg l 1 sulfonamide after 13 days of cultivation zhu et al 2020b rhizosphere microbes of phragmites australis achieved 53 removal of 2 mg l 1 enr alexandrino et al 2017 removal of enr by different microbes such as bacteria and microalgae has been reported with treatment efficiencies ranging from 26 to 50 j q xiong et al 2017 santos et al 2019 whilst this study demonstrated ryegrass can be a good candidate for remediation of enr from water the removal mechanisms of enr by ryegrass were elucidated according to the mass balance which was achieved by calculating the contribution percentage of different biological processes biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption and abiotic processes table 1 there was a negligible decrease of enr amount in the abiotic controls bioaccumulated amount of enr in ryegrass root increased with elevated enr doses the final uptake concentrations in roots of ryegrass were 9 93 80 94 528 02 and 910 52 μg g 1 respectively at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig 2b bioconcentration factors bcfs were 115 09 21 81 20 28 and 17 67 which were far higher than 1 mass balance of biological removal has shown the main removal mechanism for enr dissipation was biodegradation the highest biodegradation of enr was 89 01 by ryegrass which was achieved at 1 mg l 1 enr at day 10 there was a gradual decrease of biodegradation percentage with elevation of enr dosage at the same time most of the metabolites of enr were detected in water samples and changed over time within 10 days fig 3 it confirmed that biodegradation is the main process of enr removal in water 3 3 proposed biodegradation pathway of enr by ryegrass identified metabolic byproducts from the degradation of enr can be used to predict its potential transformation mechanisms by ryegrass and formation dynamics of such intermediates can be incorporated with their mass spectrums to propose a more accurate degradation pathway zhang et al 2019 kurade et al 2021 in the current study seven metabolites have been identified using lc ms2 and the obtained mass spectrums were provided in table s1 two potential metabolic pathways of enr were proposed according to the available literature and chemical libraries with fulling evaluation of the fate of these identified intermediates figs 3 table s1 in pathway 1 p1 was produced by the cleavage of cn bond induced by hydroxylation and methylation which was further hydroxylated into p2 the relative peak area of metabolites p1 and p2 also increased at day 4 indicating the potential of route 1 for degradation of enr in route 2 enr was disrupted by ring cleavage hydroxylation and decarboxylation with the generation of p3 which was further hydroxylated to form p4 peak areas of p3 and p4 gradually decreased during 10 days of exposure both compounds p2 and p4 can be dehydroxylated and methylated to produce p5 maximum peak area of p5 was observed at day 6 and remained at a high level ever since combination of the enzymatic reactions and peak area changes we hypothesized p5 has been the main intermediates which can be further hydrogenated and hydroxylated to induce ring cleavage with p6 as a product the final product p7 was formed by di hydroxylation and methylation of p6 and peak areas of compounds p6 and p7 were relatively small during the whole exposure time fig 4 these results showed that main degradation of enr was induced by pathway 1 with generating a dominant product p5 3 4 differentially expressed genes for metabolism of enrofloxacin most of the earlier studies have demonstrated that there is a toxic effect of antibiotics on plants and phytoremediation can achieve effective removal of low concentrations of such emerging organic contaminants however there is limited data to propose the degradation pathway using formation dynamics of metabolic intermediates and unravel the related genes for understanding in depth molecular mechanisms we have analyzed the transcriptome profiling of ryegrass exposed to enr to elucidate such aspects base mass distribution of sample was used to evaluate the sequence quality the error rates of all the base mass values ranged from 0 02 to 0 04 promising the sequencing quality fig s2 total size of 77 73 g of clean data was generated from 12 samples and the effective results of each sample ranged from 5 92 g to 6 96 g table s2 a total number of 93 159 unigenes were spliced with a length of 86 342 174 bp and an average length of 926 83 bp among them 12 869 13 81 genes were annotated into the kegg library the comparison rate of reads on unigene was 85 7 87 93 the correlation coefficient among the three replicates was about 0 98 indicating high reliance of the obtained data fig s3 the ranges of correlation coefficients at different experimental sets 1 mg l 1 vs control 50 mg l 1 vs control and 100 mg l 1 vs control were 0 94 0 97 0 82 0 90 and 0 76 0 82 respectively the pca analysis showed that the gene expression clusters in control and 1 mg l 1 enr treatment were distinguishable from those in 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr fig s3 which is consistent with the results shown in heatmap fig s4 the difference of gene expression was reflected in the volcano map triangle points with red and green indicate the differently expressed genes with a fold change of 2 and a false discovery rate fdr of 0 05 or 0 01 gray indicates no significant difference in expression fig 5 the number of differentially expressed genes degs were 3077 1128 up and 1949 down regulated 10 782 6977 up and 8227 down regulated and 18 738 9029 up and 9709 down regulated respectively at the different experimental sets 1 mg l 1 vs control 50 mg l 1 vs control 100 mg l 1 vs control fig 5d it can be seen the number of degs at 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr were significantly larger than that of 1 mg l 1 indicating a significant effect on the transcriptome of ryegrass caused by high doses of enr go enrichment analysis showed the upregulated genes monitored go terms biological processes cellular components and molecular functions fig s5 it indicated the biological processes such as glutathione metabolic process detoxification response to xenobiotic stimulus cellular response to drug and drug transmembrane transport in ryegrass have been enhanced under 1 mg l 1 enr whilst the molecular functions including glutathione transferase activity glutathione binding oxidoreductase activities acting on paired donors and diphenols atpase activity transferase activity and monooxygenase activities have been significantly upregulated at the same concentration antibiotics can be biodegraded by the enzymes of phase i and phase ii families goldstein et al 2014 hu et al 2021 in the phase i enzymatic system cytochrome 450 enzymes cyp450 play important roles wang et al 2017 the number of degs encoding cyp450 increased significantly with exposure to enr table 2 kegg pathway analysis showed that most of the changed genes have been involved in glutathione metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways fig s6 3 5 1 changes of genes involved in cyp450 enzyme families the results showed that there were 3 8 and 9 up regulated cytochrome 450 enzymatic families cyp450 genes such as cyp1 cyp7 cyp8 and cyp9 enzyme families cyp450 are auto oxidizable heme proteins and participate in the metabolism of endogenous substances and exogenous substances among them cyp51 and cyp1a1 belong to cyp450 monooxygenase superfamily and can induce methyl to carboxyl conversion on aromatic ring dihydroxylation and cleavage of aromatic ring de hydrogenation di hydroxylation and oxidation reduction zhang et al 2013 he et al 2017 the expression level of cyp1a1 increased by 1 56 1 95 and 3 05 folds at 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr whist expression of cyp51 was increased by 1 24 3 33 and 2 98 times table 2 cyp51 and cyp 1a1 may be involved in the metabolic process of the first stage of enr cyp99a2 3 can act as oxidoreductase and catalyzes oxidations of the c19 methyl group wang et al 2019 upregulated cyp99a2 3 expression in ryegrass by 1 73 3 24 and 1 68 folds at 1 50 and 100 mg enr l 1 has been observed compared to the control higher concentrations of enr have induced more expression of the enzymes including cyp701 cyp84a cyp734a1 cyp73a cyp76a26 which can monitor the enzymatic reactions including di hydroxylation decarboxylation de methylation and oxidation reduction matamoros et al 2012 chen et al 2017a kurade et al 2019 in kegg pathways cyp701 has caused the insertion of a hydroxyl functional group into the methyl group r06291 cyp84a and cyp75a act as the hydroxylase k20623 k09755 k13083 cyp73a has been defined as trans cinnamate 4 monooxygenase which plays an essential role in the degradation of aromatic compounds ko01220 involvement of cyp734a1 in the regulation of plant growth has been reported and overexpression of cyp734a1 can result in dwarfism these results demonstrated that several genes encoding cyp450 enzyme system of ryegrass have been significantly upregulated which may be the key factors to induce the biodegradation of enr 3 5 2 genes related to glutathione metabolism degs are significantly enriched in the glutathione metabolism fig s7a and upregulated degs involved in this pathway have been shown in table 3 genes encode glutathione s transferase gst was expressed 1 20 3 69 and 3 35 times higher with exposure to 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr comparing to the control gsts act on the first phase metabolites formed by the monitoring of cyp450 and participate in the second stage drug metabolism chen et al 2017b liu et al 2021 meanwhile gstp was significantly up regulated by 4 49 and 6 83 times and hpgds for hematopoietic prostaglandin d synthase was significantly up regulated by 3 22 and 5 05 times in the medium and high enr dose groups table 3 other genes in the glutathione metabolism pathway such as ec 2 5 1 16 are highly expressed to promote the synthesis of glutathione zhang et al 2021 the gamma glutamyltranspeptidase encoding genes ggt1 5 and ggt were significantly up regulated by 1 26 and 1 21 times at 50 mg l 1 enr and 1 57 and 1 56 times in 100 mg l 1 enr treatment a gene named pgd encoding 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has greatly expressed at 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr which is 225 3 183 9 and 321 1 higher than that in control this enzyme is an oxidative carboxylase and induces decarboxylation ohara et al 2004 at higher concentrations of enr the oxidative decarboxylation can be induced by isocitrate dehydrogenase since the gene expression encoding this enzyme has been significantly increased by 2 78 and 3 33 folds at 50 and 100 mg l 1 these upregulated expressions of genes can promise enzymatic reactions such as decarboxylation and dehydrogenation table 4 3 5 3 expression changes of genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis e2 1 1 104 can monitor the enzyme of caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase and its expression has been elevated by 2 35 and 2 89 folds with 50 and 100 mg l 1 enr the gene katg encodes catalase peroxidase sarni et al 1984 which has been more expressed by 239 6 and 251 6 with same concentrations of enr the trends of catalase peroxidase encoding gene are also consistent with the peroxidase activities expression of the genes pal cad ref1 encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase cinnamyl alcohol nadp oxidoreductase and coniferyl aldehyde dehydrogenase has been significantly increased by 124 160 and 117 respectively at 50 mg l 1 enr fig s7b these genes encode methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase monooxygenase and peroxidase and have been significantly expressed compared to the control these enzymes promised the reaction of methylation bong and ring cleavage hydrogenation and di hydroxylation with reacting with the chnh and choh groups kuhnl et al 1989 louie et al 2006 singh et al 2007 on the other side phenylpropanoid metabolism is an important pathway of secondary metabolite metabolism in plants which plays an important role in response to environmental pressure liu et al 2021 manganoic acid forms phenylalanine through transamination and then enters phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway through a series of intermediate products it forms flavonoids lignin and other metabolites udp glucose scopoletin glucosyltransferase togt1 4 coumarate coa ligase 4cl and cinnamoyl coa reductase ccr are responsible for the regulation of the key plant defense enzymes in this pathway these enzymes can scavenge toxic free radicals produced in the first and second stages of drug metabolism to improve the antioxidant capacity of plants the changed expression of genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis can act as the key factors for regulating the synthesis of both catalytic and antioxidant enzymes in plants which is critical for their defensive and metabolic mechanisms 3 6 network analysis for identification of key metabolic genes network analysis of the identified metabolic degs was conducted to investigate the key genes in ryegrass to drive the degradation of sfm where co expression correlation analysis of degs involved in cyp450 glutathione metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was curated tables s3 4 the results indicated that genes such as cyp51 cyp92a6 cyp86b1 cyp73a and cyp99a2 3 encoding cyp450 enzyme families and genes e1 11 1 7 e3 2 1 21 ccr 4cl and cad for the enzymes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway have been the key functional genes of ryegrass at 50 mg l 1 enr fig 6 a whilst there are more correlated genes in 100 mg l 1 enr treated group fig 6b where the cyp51 cyp92a6 cyp73a cyp99a2 3 cyp86b1 cyp76a26 and cyp84af5h are key cyp450 genes ggt hpgds and gstp are main functional genes in glutathione metabolism pathway and e1 11 1 7 togt1 cad ccr bg1b are essential genes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway this network analysis confirmed the essential role of these genes and helped to identify the key functional genes involved in the protective and metabolic pathways of ryegrass among the degs 4 conclusion ryegrass was tolerant with high concentrations of enr with achievements of its 90 removal through biodegradation seven intermediates have been identified which can be generated from di hydroxylation bond and ring cleavage de methylation and decarboxylation a metabolic pathway has been proposed according to the formation dynamics of the identified intermediates transcriptomics analysis and gene network analysis showed that genes encoding cyp450 enzyme families methyltransferase lyase hydroxylase dehydrogenase monooxygenase and peroxidase play essential roles in biodegradation of enr these enzymes can be the key driven factors for the ryegrass mediated

reduction of co2 efflux ebullition represented between 40 and 99 of the total ch4 efflux and up to 95 of the integrated ghg release during wastewater treatment in co2 equivalents hydrodynamic conditions diurnal variability and ebullition need to be accounted for reliable assessments of ghg emissions from wsps our study is an important step towards gaining a deeper understanding in the functioning of these hot spots of carbon processing the contribution of wsps to atmospheric ghg budget is likely to increase with population growth unless their performance is improved in this regard graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste stabilization ponds greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane ebullition flux wastewater treatment global warming potential 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps are simple low cost and efficient systems for the treatment of wastewater and the most widely used treatment technology in the world in australia wsps are the dominant treatment technology used in 60 of wastewater treatment plants coggins et al 2019 treatment in these systems is provided by natural biological physical and chemical processes where the performance is influenced by hydrodynamics and microbial communities passos et al 2016 coggins et al 2017 dias et al 2017 coggins et al 2020 throughout the treatment process carbon and nutrients are consumed and transformed which results in the release of carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o as such it is expected that wsps could be responsible for large greenhouse gas ghg emissions directly related to their high organic matter loads dynamic mixing regime and shallow water column holgerson and raymond 2016 however despite their importance in providing wastewater treatment worldwide and their possible large contribution to ghg emissions to date there have been few studies exploring the direct controls of emissions from wsps in relation to their functioning i e silva et al 2012 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 silva et al 2015 glaz et al 2016 ho et al 2021 wsps can emit large quantities of ghgs to the atmosphere silva et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 pan et al 2016 both co2 and ch4 are generated during the microbial processing of organic matter but as ch4 is a potent ghg it is important to accurately quantify its evasion el fadel and massoud 2001 guisasola et al 2008 including release through diffusion and ebullition ebullition and diffusive fluxes are the dominant pathways for release of ghg from shallow inland waters including wsps coggins et al 2019 and the ratio of co2 to ch4 efflux is controlled by the interactions between biological and physicochemical conditions ghg saturations in wsps can show significant temporal and spatial variability which makes the assessment of their contribution to integrated emissions challenging factors effecting this variability include the magnitude of the wastewater flow and the temperature gradients in the water column as well as environmental biotic and abiotic variables coggins et al 2019 for example intense mixing facilitates oxygenation and rapid ch4 oxidation to co2 while conversely strong stratification results in enhanced oxygen consumption at depth and accumulation of biomass at the surface the latter effect may lead to co2 depletion at the surface and ch4 accumulation at depth as seen in shallow eutrophic lakes bartosiewicz et al 2021 being open environmental systems wsp processes can be compared to those in shallow natural ponds where the interactions between co2 and ch4 production consumption and evasion will control the cumulative global warming potential of their gaseous emissions diffusion and ebullition are the main evasion pathways of ghg from wsps but their controls differ for instance in oxygenated waters ch4 diffusing from the sediments is largely oxidized to co2 blees et al 2014 thus its evasion is limited however when ch4 rich bottom waters are mixed up to the surface or when ch4 is released through ebullition large quantities of this potent ghg evade directly to the atmosphere delsontro et al 2011 delsontro et al 2015 numerous observations show that vertical transport produces periods of intensive ch4 emission during lake overturn walter et al 2006 fernandez et al 2014 in addition localized ebullition events can dominate total ch4 emissions from lakes mattson and likens 1990 reservoirs delsontro et al 2010 or permafrost ponds walter et al 2006 however in conventional wastewater systems the contribution of processes and pathways to gas evasion has been largely unaccounted for detweiler et al 2014 and more so in wsps accuracy in ghg diffusive flux estimations at the air water interface is highly dependent on the sampling method and gas exchange model chosen raymond and cole 2001 bartosiewicz et al 2015 both floating chambers and modelling approaches are useful with models able to provide high resolution estimates over diel cycles however these computations are still in the development stage and while recent work shows good agreement between different approaches i e macintyre et al 2020 model selection still requires validation using floating chambers jansen et al 2020 diffusive fluxes are estimated as the product of concentration gradients and modelled gas exchange coefficients k cole and caraco 1998 this coefficient depends on the turbulence at the water atmosphere interface driven by wind and buoyancy flux macintyre and melack 1995 tedford et al 2014 accuracy is improved when the turbulence is obtained via the surface renewal model heiskanen et al 2014 mammarella et al 2015 czikowsky et al 2018 even though cooling can cause near surface turbulence in small ponds there is generally some residual shear to drive the turbulence macintyre et al 2020 the turbulence can also be increased under heating as shear intensifies for a given wind speed but at some point stratification damps the turbulence monin and obukhov 1954 macintyre et al 2010 macintyre et al 2020 moreover under low turbulence co2 might bypass molecular diffusion through chemical reactions in the boundary layer this chemical effect controls co2 exchange rates in alkaline and productive systems wanninkhof and knox 1996 such as wsps improvements in quantifying fluxes from wastewaters is expected when both the physical and biological drivers of emissions are considered the overarching objective of this study is to estimate ghg emissions from wsps by quantifying various processes involved specifically the aims are to quantify 1 the diurnal stratification mixing patterns and variability in subsurface concentrations of co2 and ch4 in response to changing weather conditions 2 the effect of heat loss and heat gain to surface turbulence and 3 the contribution of ebullition to integrated ghg emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites local climate and sampling scheme sampling was conducted at four wastewater treatment plants wwtps with varying pond layouts and load all located in the southwest region of western australia each site has various configurations of facultative ponds and maturation ponds as well as different inlet and outlet configurations e g fig 1 a and 1b for the purpose of this study only primary faculatative ponds were chosen for ghg sampling all of these wwtps experience mild wet

in table 1 table s1 presents the sampling scheme and data included for pin and bdt sites the scheme for the 2013 campaign is described in glaz et al 2016 a single primary facultative pond per wwtp was sampled at the outlet at cra and wag in 2013 while two parallel primary facultative ponds were sampled at pin and bdt hereafter numbered 1 and 2 with sampling conducted at the inlet and outlet of each pond the two ponds at pin were sampled more intensively between november and december 2014 this detailed study was repeated at bdt between february to march 2015 table s1 the intensive sampling during this period also included a detailed assessment of the thermal structure in situ meteorology and surface ghg concentrations along with direct flux measurements obtained using floating chambers and submerged funnels the ghg saturation data collected from cra and wag were previously presented for flux calculations in glaz et al 2016 but in the present study we further explore the data collected on pond hydrodynamics in these two wwtps including a comparison of gas transfer velocities computed through modelling and floating chamber which adds to measurements obtained from pin and bdt 2 2

the phytoplankton biomass was evaluated as chlorophyll a concentration chl a estimated with a fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke germany according to manufacturer calibration 2 3 dissolved ghg concentrations at cra and wag discrete sampling of dissolved co2 and ch4 were taken at the surface of the pond outlet between march april 2013 and the data was used to convert chamber flux assessments into gas exchange velocities complete ghg dataset presented in glaz et al 2016 at pin discrete samples of dissolved co2 and ch4 were collected at the surface of the pond inlets and outlets between november and december 2014 and at bdt between february and march 2015 briefly during ghg sampling 2 l of pond water were pumped directly into the gas exchange bottle with an in line pump at a slow flow rate to minimize gas loss the water was immediately equilibrated into 20 ml of ambient air for 3 min with the headspace sampled in 5 9 ml exetainer vials labco limited previously evacuated and helium purged the vials were stored at 4 c until analysed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector varian 3800 with a combipal system cp poraplot q 25 m 0 53 mm column dissolved gas concentrations

values of atmospheric partial pressures ipcc 2013 were used to determine c eq direct measurements of co2 flux were also taken at all four wwtps using a floating chamber made of plastic covered with aluminium foil with sidewalls extending 2 3 cm into the water pin and bdt area of 0 12 m2 headspace volume of 15 4 l cra and wag 0 15 m2 9 1 l for pin and bdt the chamber was connected to a vaisala

a graduated 120 ml polypropylene syringe equipped with a one way stopcock for gas collection was used to estimate ch4 and co2 ebullition rates from pin and bdt ponds inverted funnels were deployed for 3 4 hours at the inlet and outlet of pin1 and at the outlet of bdt1 in both the morning and afternoon the volume of the gas accumulated in the syringe was recorded and three replicate samples were taken for quantification by gas chromatography ebullition flux f e was calculated as 11 f e c v g v m a 1 where c is the concentration of the gas released from pond and collected in the syringe v g is

from wsps in co2 equivalents co2 eq defined as the sum of co2 and ch4 released through diffusion and ebullition were calculated assuming ch4 is 33 times more potent than co2 on a gram to gram basis over 100 years etminan et al 2016 this is referred to as the global warming potential gwp of wsp emissions to integrate the release of ghg to the atmosphere by wsps the diffusive fluxes were estimated with the surface renewal model only turbulence caused by wind under heating conditions was considered as all discrete ghg measurements were taken between 1000 1500 hrs and any contribution from heat loss to kinetic energy dissipation was considered negligible during these periods the chemical enhancement factor acting on co2 fluxes was considered when significant that is when winds were low 2 m s

temperatures and stronger winds on average 22 3 c and 2 2 m s 1 compared to cra 14 7 c and 1 m s 1 table 2 fig 2 wastewater in wag was thus on average warmer but with a weaker temperature gradient 21

at night during cooling and mixing heating periods were associated with increasing buoyancy frequencies n indicating strong stratification at the surface of both cra and wag ponds maximum values of n being 186 and 118 cph respectively at the time of sampling the pond at wag was on average shallower fig 1f where average pond depth affected sampling depths than that at cra fig 1e however coupled with wag having a larger length to width ratio than cra 3 7 1 at wag vs 1 5 1 at cra wag was generally more strongly stratified than cra fig 2a and 2f windy periods during the day fig 2c and 2h led to shear velocities raising up to 0 21 cm s 1 in cra and 0 27 cm s 1 in wag fig s1a and s1b black while nocturnal cooling yielded higher convective velocities ranging between 0 0041 cm s 1 in cra and 0 0036 cm s 1 in wag fig s1a and s1b orange nocturnal cooling was characterized by maximum heat losses of 200 w m 2 fig 2b and 2g in orange with wind speeds of 2 3 m s 1 fig 2c and 2h over the studied periods the kinetic energy dissipation rates ε epsilon were similarly variable 10 10 to 10 6 m2 s 3 fig 2e and 2j black in both cra and wag ponds indicating that strong stratification was interrupted by moderately turbulent conditions enhanced dissipation was observed during windy mornings and afternoons while turbulence i e epsilon ε at the water atmosphere interface was generally controlled by wind convection contributed on average 53 to epsilon in wag and 75 in cra when ponds were cooling following equation 3 as the difference between total kinetic energy dissipation rates and those associated to wind shear during the 2014 15 campaign ponds in bdt were exposed to higher air temperature 22 6 c on average compared to pin 18 9 c fig 3 b and 3g but to respectively lower winds table 2 fig 3c and 3h ponds thus warmed and stratified more strongly at bdt fig 3f temperature gradient 13 c than at pin fig 3a temperature gradient 7 9 c daytime heating resulted in strong stratification at the pond surface in both pin maximum n 160 cph fig 3d and bdt maximum n 233 cph fig 3i strong stratification co occurred with dense phytoplankton biomass accumulating at the surface particularly in bdt table 1 temperatures were largely homogenised during nocturnal mixing in both ponds nocturnal heat losses were highest 400 w m 2 fig 3b and 3g orange when wind speeds exceeded 2 5 m s 1 both ponds fig 3c and 3h windy periods led to shear velocities reaching 0 34 cm s 1 in pin fig s1c black and 0 29 cm s 1 in bdt fig s1d black nocturnal cooling resulted in convective velocities of up to 0 006 cm s 1 fig s1c and s1d orange the kinetic energy dissipation rates 10 10 to 10 5 m2 s 3 fig 3e and 3j black indicate that strong stratification was interrupted by more turbulent events in pin and bdt the contribution of convection to turbulence during nocturnal cooling averaged 40 and 51 in bdt and pin respectively 3 2 phytoplankton biomass and relationship to ghg concentrations during the study period the chl a concentration in bdt ranged between 114 and 1936 µg l 1 with higher values generally observed in early afternoon 1020 µg l 1 1300 1500 hrs than in the morning 795 µg l 1 900 1200 hrs by comparison the chl a concentrations ranged between 24 and 960 µg l 1 in pin and the difference between morning and afternoon observations was less pronounced 298 µg l 1 in the morning compared to 419 µg l 1 in the afternoon over the sampling period the phytoplankton community in bdt1 was dominated by green algae 20 80 of total biomass while cyanobacteria bloomed in bdt2 80 90 in both ponds at pin green algae consistently dominated the phytoplankton 50 all ponds had a ph above neutral with values for all sites ranging from 7 9 to 9 0 consistent with that expected in wsps the highest ph values were recorded in bdt ponds up to 10 7 recorded in bdt2 coinciding with the highest concentrations of chl a table 1 the ghg concentration expressed as departure from saturation ranged between 8 and 913 µmol co2 l 1 and between 1 4 and 76 4 µmol ch4 l 1 in pin while ranges in bdt ponds were 3 2 331 µmol co2 l 1 and 0 1 34 µmol ch4 l 1 departure from saturation of both co2 and ch4 were inversely related to chl a in bdt ponds r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 4 d and 4e in contrast phytoplankton biomass was positively related to co2 in pin ponds fig 4a r2 0 29 p 0 05 while there was no relationship between chl a and ch4 in pin fig 4b there was a positive relationship between the two ghg ch4 vs co2 at bdt fig 4f r2 0 41 p 0 05 while the trend in pin is positive but not significant fig 4c 3 3 high frequency changes in ghg saturation and hydrodynamics the two ponds sampled at high frequency at pin experienced mixing periods of variable length and strength that were mainly associated to changing wind conditions fig 5 bottom waters periodically upwelled to the surface during the day in pin2 between 1400 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 75 fig 5a and 5g respectively when shear velocities exceeded 0 15 cm s 1 fig s1e and s1f in black these patterns of mixing and stratification apparently moderated the diurnal variations of dissolved co2 and ch4 levels co2 decreased during stratified periods for example down to 500 ppmv in pin2 between 1100 1400 hrs on 24 november doy 328 5 fig 5l in black when buoyancy frequency was high and increased rapidly to the upper detection limit dl of the sensor 6 000 ppmv when the water column mixed i e between 1400 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 75 fig 5l methane concentrations also varied concurrently with daily mixing patterns for example in pin1 ch4 dropped rapidly during the morning 0600 1200 hrs on 28 november doy 332 25 fig 5f in orange from the upper dl 20 000 ppmv down to 7 000 ppmv during a period of reduced mixing and oscillated between 8 000 12 000 ppmv afterward and over the following night during a period of strong convection fig s1e orange this behaviour continued until it dropped to 4 000 ppmv around sunrise on the next day 0400 0500 hrs doy 333 25 fig 5f in orange when the pond re stratified the subsurface ch4 levels were much lower in pin2 than in pin1 varying between 1 500 3 000 ppmv fig 5f and 5l in orange although increasing ch4 sometimes coincided with changes in co2 e g in pin2 between 1500 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 6 fig 5l this was not persistently concurrent in fact when both co2 and ch4 were within the detection range of the sensor the ratio of dissolved co2 to ch4 ranged between 0 16 1 4 in pin1 and between 0 3 3 5 in pin2 3 4 comparison of modelled and measured co2 transfer coefficients when data from all ponds sampled both in 2013 and 2014 2015 cra wag bdt and pin were grouped together to explore the relationship between flux estimation methods models versus chamber measurements we found a strong and significant correlation between gas transfer velocities estimated with the surface renewal model and chamber measurements fig 6 r2 0 98 p 0 0001 while direct chamber measurements had slightly higher k 600 averages 9 3 6 0 cm h 1 compared to the surface renewal model 8 5 5 2 cm h 1 most 90 measurements included in this analysis lay within the 95 prediction bands of the regression line which is very close to the 1 1 relationship fig 6 the gas transfer coefficient calculated with an alternative model i e grachev et al 2013 where turbulence is controlled by near surface shear only without any influence of heating or cooling showed much weaker correspondence to the direct measurements fig 6 blue hence the surface renewal model was selected to estimate all of the diffusive ghgs fluxes in this study despite good correspondence between modelled and measured values some apparent outliers were recorded where chamber values were up to five times higher than those from model estimates these values are also shown fig 6 red but were not included in the regression analysis 3 5 ghg diffusive fluxes the co2 diffusive fluxes were significantly higher from ponds in pin fig 7 a and 7b 317 mmol m 2 d 1 n 48 data pooled from both ponds for inlet and outlet sites than in bdt fig 7c and 7d 28 mmol m 2 d 1 n 36 anova results presented in table 3 this difference in co2 release at these two wwtps appears to be influenced by the time of the day it was higher in the morning 1000 1200 hrs in pin 490 320 mmol m 2 d 1 than in bdt 6 2 6 8 mmol m 2 d 1 but in the afternoon 1300 1500 hrs fluxes decreased in pin 159 218 mmol m 2 d 1 while increasing in bdt 53 140 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 7 the difference in bdt resulted mostly from an exceptionally high co2 efflux observed on 25 february in bdt1 fig 7c doy 56 365 160 mmol m 2 d 1 when each wwtp was analysed separately co2 fluxes were significantly different among individual ponds and between the morning and afternoon two way anova table s2 the ch4 diffusive fluxes were also significantly higher for ponds in pin 36 28 mmol m 2 d 1 than in bdt 11 13 mmol m 2 d 1 table 3 these emissions differed between individual ponds and were affected by the time of the day with higher morning fluxes in pin 52 26 mmol m 2 d 1 but lower in bdt 6 6 5 2 mmol m 2 d 1 as compared to afternoon fluxes 20 18 and 15 16 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively estimated ch4 efflux from pin1 was lower compared to pin2 35 and 40 mmol m 2 d 1 and lower in bdt2 compared to bdt1 1 7 and 20 mmol m 2 d 1 3 6 ebullition and integrated carbon release ebullition and diffusive fluxes were assessed simultaneously for a total of 37 measurements from pin1 n 18 and bdt1 n 19 allowing the analysis of both types of emission pathways and assessment of the total carbon evasion from wastewaters the co2 ebullition flux was higher in pin 13 11 mmol m 2 d 1 values converted to g of co2 equivalent in fig 8 than in bdt 2 6 4 3 mmol m 2 d 1 but this emission pathway contributed only about 1 to total release on average fig 8 table 4 on the other hand ebullition contributed between 50 and 99 to total ch4 efflux in pin ponds 65 40 mmol m 2 d 1 and between 40 99 in bdt ponds where flux was significantly lower 24 23 mmol m 2 d 1 in fact ebullition represented on average 65 of total emissions from wsps when converted into co2 equivalent units overall the cumulative gwp of carbon based ghg emitted to the atmosphere by wsps was higher in pin 64 g co2 eq m 2 d 1 fig 8a than bdt 17 g co2 eq m 2 d 1 fig 8b table 4 4 discussion accurate gas flux estimations during wastewater processing is required to evaluate its contribution to local and global ghg budgets in this study specifically assessing fluxes from wsps an abundant ecosystem increasing in importance across the planet we highlight processes needed to be accounted for to improve ghg budgeting firstly nocturnal heat exchange may contribute between 40 75 of the turbulence at the surface of wsps limiting field measurements to normal working hours can thus generate an underestimation of ghg emissions as it was also shown in the amazon floodplains amaral et al 2020 secondly upwelling events bring ghgs accumulated in bottom waters to the surface also leading to greater efflux linked to changeable meteorological conditions moreover we show that dissolved ghg concentrations are extremely variable spatially between and within ponds highlighting the need for spatially resolved gas sampling approaches most importantly ebullition needs to be closely considered as it contributed 65 of the integrated ghg release from wsps overall these effects if unaccounted for can lead to large underestimations of ghg emissions from wastewaters stabilisation ponds 4 1 controls on ghg diffusion from wsps there was an excellent agreement between modelled and measured gas transfer velocities in wsps fig 6 thus the surface renewal model allows for robust diffusive flux estimations in these systems while modelled values were slightly lower than values measured with the floating chambers this difference was not significant comparison of residuals breusch pagan test p 0 05 it is important to underline here that the model does not account for any turbulence potentially resulting from wastewater inflow and outflow currents in addition placing the chamber on the water surface might have artificially enhanced the turbulence an effect particularly observed under calm conditions vachon et al 2010 these two factors could explain the observed discrepancy moreover the outliers shown on figure 6 correspond to measurements when co2 was depleted where uptake measured with the chamber was higher than predicted by the model this effect was pronounced when ph in ponds was high and winds were low and may indicate that there is even stronger chemical effect on co2 uptake that was considered in this study as such further research is required to investigate more precisely the role of chemical processes in co2 fluxes at the surface of wsps the water column in wsps stratified for short periods of time leading to co2 depletion at the surface through photosynthesis and efflux and decreased emissions enhanced stratification was also associated to an accumulation of ghgs at the bottom accumulated gases were often transported upwards during mixing and generated hot emission moments while we did not directly measure ghgs in bottom waters we did observe rising saturation levels at the surface during mixing fig 5 effects of diurnal patterns in mixing and stratification on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems are well known from tropical and subtropical inland waters macintyre et al 2002 for example a study of small and shallow north lake also located in western australia revealed cycles consisting of stratified periods followed by mixing upon the onset of breeze macintyre 1998 the study of north lake also showed that periods of mixing can generate intense transport macintyre and melack 1995 for example phytoplankton cells circulated in the upper wind mixed layer of this lake on time scales of minutes macintyre 1993 in the present study diurnal stratification and mixing were clearly observable in bdt and cra ponds the stratification periods were often associated with the accumulation of buoyant phytoplankton at the surface early in the day which then later dispersed throughout the water column changes in the phytoplankton concentration and distribution within the water column can produce strong gradients in co2 saturation levels and variable co2 fluxes this effect was particularly important in bdt ponds where high phytoplankton biomass strongly influenced co2 saturation during daily stratification fig 4 also at night no photosynthetic uptake co2 levels increased rapidly but this could also be linked to the upwelling of co2 enriched waters some recent work indicates that nocturnal mixing enhances ghg emissions from shallow wetlands poindexter et al 2016 a mechanism also suggested to operate in shallow thermokarst lakes and flooded forests walter anthony and macintyre 2016 we observed an increase in both co2 and ch4 in pin ponds upon nocturnal and morning mixing fig 5 enhanced downward energy flux associated to efficient mixing are also known to control gas bubbling rates wik et al 2014 and thus may have influenced the ebullition in wsps however the temporal resolution of ebullition measurements in our study is not adequate for the assessment of such fine temporal effects 4 2 the integrated carbon emission budget in wsps ebullition generally contributes a large fraction of ch4 emissions from global lakes and ponds mcginnis et al 2006 and more so in shallow systems where rising gas bubbles do not lose much of their initial ch4 to the surrounding waters before they are released to the atmosphere delwiche and hemond 2017 bartosiewicz et al 2021 for a great majority of observations in the studied wsps ebullition was indeed the dominant ch4 emission pathway 40 to 99 fig 8 the contribution of ebullition to total ghg release in co2 eq was in fact significantly higher than that from diffusion on average 65 of the integrated ghg release this large contribution was partly linked to the high proportion of ch4 in bubbles escaping from wsps 20 48 compared to 1 of co2 the estimation of integrated ghg emissions from an ecosystem expressed as gwp is becoming a common approach to appreciate their impact on climate chang et al 2017 su et al 2019 we suggest that the gwp of ghg released from wsps is controlled by an interactive effect of daily stratification and mixing along with phytoplankton driven co2 uptake and ch4 ebullition we also show that even in shallow systems such as wsps which are stratifying only for relatively short periods of time gas concentrations changed by up to an order of magnitude within a few hours this effect most likely related to upwelling of ghg enriched bottom waters can result in large and rapid efflux 4 3 functional traits of wsps in organic matter processing the relationship between ch4 and co2 in wsps figs 4 5 7 implies that the overall ghg efflux depends on the completeness of organic matter decomposition czepiel et al 1993 and that production and consumption of carbon based ghgs is closely coupled in wsps it may also indicate that at least a fraction of surface co2 derives from large amounts of biogas diffusing from the bottom when ch4 is partially oxidized at the oxic anoxic interface in the water column i e within the accumulation of photosynthesizing phytoplankton milucka et al 2015 calculated from the high resolution sampling fig 5 the co2 ch4 ratio varied between 0 16 and 3 5 average 0 77 while in natural lakes this ratio ranges between 10 and 100 for small 0 001 km2 and larger 1 10 km2 water bodies respectively holgerson and raymond 2016 therefore wsps present a range shifted towards the prevalence of organic matter processing to ch4 however in contrast to some classic work in wastewaters where the co2 ch4 ratio was controlled by temperature and organic matter quality i e toprak 1995 the rapid and large changes observed here timescale of minutes to hours strongly imply that hydrodynamics mixing and related redox conditions are also important controls more in depth analyses of this trait i e ghg ratios and associated gwp with isotope tracing are needed to quantify the importance of oxidation and to explore engineering approaches e g controlling wind exposition or sludge distribution for reducing the carbon footprint of wsps recent evidence implies that aerobically decomposable sterols can be used as indicators of the wastewater treatment efficiency liu et al 2014 reichwaldt et al 2017 here we additionally suggest that the co2 ch4 ratio and overall gwp could be used as proxies of treatment efficiency and to trace the consequences of the growing demand for wastewater treatment on the global ghg budget 4 4 factoring wsps into the ghg budget of inland waters mounting evidence suggests that urban waters small lakes and ponds are releasing large quantites of ghgs peacock et al 2019 we compared the data collected for western australian wsps to the available global datasets fig 9 and found that wsps filled in a functional gap in these global datasets but differ from both urban ponds and very small natural ponds and lakes overall the co2 concentrations recorded in wsps are lower than those in natural lakes but higher than those recorded in urban ponds in contrast we found that ch4 concentrations were higher in wsps than in lakes but lower than in urban ponds this difference could be attributed to the effects of mixing on rates of ghg production and consumption especially in wsps and urban ponds urban and very small natural ponds will be more persistently stratified than wsps and under such stable conditions will provide more opportunity for methanogenesis in contrast wsps will mix more frequently and therefore accumulate less ch4 in their bottom waters despite high organic loading overall wsps represent a more dynamic environments relative to small natural ponds and lakes therefore considering that most of their integrated gwp comes from ch4 ebullition that is likely triggered by frequent deep mixing events assessment of this evasion pathway becomes fundamental such global calculations are currently still being developed but these differences highlight the need for more thorough comparisons among inland waters in order to gain a better appreciation of the contribution of wsps to the global ghg budget when applying the average daytime diffusive fluxes to the total wsp area of 1 6 106 m2 in western australia glaz et al 2016 they appear to be responsible for the release of 8 4 106 kg of co2 eq during an entire year this number could be upscaled to 10 3 106 kg co2 eq when considering the effect of night time heat loss on turbulence for an average increase by 55 of diffusion during the night i e 10 24hr and further to approximately 27 6 106 kg co2 eq when we assume that nocturnal ghg saturation levels are increased by a factor of 10 10 24hr due to mixing when a tentative estimate of ebullition is factored in i e 2 5 for 65 of the total ghg released this way on average table 4 this number climbs to 69 1 106 kg co2 eq emitted annually considering the large spatiotemporal variability in ghg concentrations and fluxes associated to changes in hydrodynamic conditions phytoplankton activity as well as the potential effects of sludge bathymetry for wsps in southwest western australia coggins et al 2017 these back of the envelope calculations should be taken as indicative trends only a sampling design allowing for more accurate estimations of these processes should include high resolution automated monitoring of hydrodynamics water column gas concentrations and ebullition rates rather than reliance on discrete gas measurements alone the controls of emission pathways need to be investigated further including the relative importance and interaction between rates of primary production and methanotrophy organic matter composition and hydrodynamics improved estimates of the spatiotemporal variability in ghg concentrations and fluxes related to physical chemical and biological processes in wastewaters will allow us to design better systems and employ solutions to reduce their effects on climate furthermore a deeper understanding of the microbial communities that contribute to ghg emissions in both the water column and sludge is required and could lead to improved wastewater treatment discharge and sludge management outcomes coggins et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study we showed that ebullition was the dominant pathway for ghg emission in wsps in comparison to other systems wsps can make a particularly significant contribution to ghg emissions however emissions are controlled by different factors compared to natural lakes this study identified that a more detailed understanding of nocturnal cooling is needed which cannot be achieved via discrete sampling methods continuous measurements will help to relate the large variations observed in ghg emissions from wsps to the hydrodynamic context of these ecosystems overall the contribution of wsps to the global ghg budget can be large

16776,accurate estimations of gaseous emissions and carbon sequestration in wastewater processing are essential for the design operation and planning of treatment infrastructure particularly considering greenhouse gas reduction targets in this study we look at the interplay between biological productivity hydrodynamics and evasion of carbon based greenhouse gases ghg through diffusion and ebullition in order to provide direction for more accurate assessments of their emissions from waste stabilization ponds wsps the ponds stratified in the day and mixed at night buoyancy flux contributed between 40 and 75 to turbulence in the water column during nocturnal cooling events and the associated mixing lead to increasing carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 concentrations by up to an order of magnitude in the surface the onset of stratification and phytoplankton surface blooms associated with high ph as well as low and variable co2 partial pressure resulted in an overall reduction of co2 efflux ebullition represented between 40 and 99 of the total ch4 efflux and up to 95 of the integrated ghg release during wastewater treatment in co2 equivalents hydrodynamic conditions diurnal variability and ebullition need to be accounted for reliable assessments of ghg emissions from wsps our study is an important step towards gaining a deeper understanding in the functioning of these hot spots of carbon processing the contribution of wsps to atmospheric ghg budget is likely to increase with population growth unless their performance is improved in this regard graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste stabilization ponds greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane ebullition flux wastewater treatment global warming potential 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps are simple low cost and efficient systems for the treatment of wastewater and the most widely used treatment technology in the world in australia wsps are the dominant treatment technology used in 60 of wastewater treatment plants coggins et al 2019 treatment in these systems is provided by natural biological physical and chemical processes where the performance is influenced by hydrodynamics and microbial communities passos et al 2016 coggins et al 2017 dias et al 2017 coggins et al 2020 throughout the treatment process carbon and nutrients are consumed and transformed which results in the release of carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o as such it is expected that wsps could be responsible for large greenhouse gas ghg emissions directly related to their high organic matter loads dynamic mixing regime and shallow water column holgerson and raymond 2016 however despite their importance in providing wastewater treatment worldwide and their possible large contribution to ghg emissions to date there have been few studies exploring the direct controls of emissions from wsps in relation to their functioning i e silva et al 2012 hernandez paniagua et al 2014 silva et al 2015 glaz et al 2016 ho et al 2021 wsps can emit large quantities of ghgs to the atmosphere silva et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 pan et al 2016 both co2 and ch4 are generated during the microbial processing of organic matter but as ch4 is a potent ghg it is important to accurately quantify its evasion el fadel and massoud 2001 guisasola et al 2008 including release through diffusion and ebullition ebullition and diffusive fluxes are the dominant pathways for release of ghg from shallow inland waters including wsps coggins et al 2019 and the ratio of co2 to ch4 efflux is controlled by the interactions between biological and physicochemical conditions ghg saturations in wsps can show significant temporal and spatial variability which makes the assessment of their contribution to integrated emissions challenging factors effecting this variability include the magnitude of the wastewater flow and the temperature gradients in the water column as well as environmental biotic and abiotic variables coggins et al 2019 for example intense mixing facilitates oxygenation and rapid ch4 oxidation to co2 while conversely strong stratification results in enhanced oxygen consumption at depth and accumulation of biomass at the surface the latter effect may lead to co2 depletion at the surface and ch4 accumulation at depth as seen in shallow eutrophic lakes bartosiewicz et al 2021 being open environmental systems wsp processes can be compared to those in shallow natural ponds where the interactions between co2 and ch4 production consumption and evasion will control the cumulative global warming potential of their gaseous emissions diffusion and ebullition are the main evasion pathways of ghg from wsps but their controls differ for instance in oxygenated waters ch4 diffusing from the sediments is largely oxidized to co2 blees et al 2014 thus its evasion is limited however when ch4 rich bottom waters are mixed up to the surface or when ch4 is released through ebullition large quantities of this potent ghg evade directly to the atmosphere delsontro et al 2011 delsontro et al 2015 numerous observations show that vertical transport produces periods of intensive ch4 emission during lake overturn walter et al 2006 fernandez et al 2014 in addition localized ebullition events can dominate total ch4 emissions from lakes mattson and likens 1990 reservoirs delsontro et al 2010 or permafrost ponds walter et al 2006 however in conventional wastewater systems the contribution of processes and pathways to gas evasion has been largely unaccounted for detweiler et al 2014 and more so in wsps accuracy in ghg diffusive flux estimations at the air water interface is highly dependent on the sampling method and gas exchange model chosen raymond and cole 2001 bartosiewicz et al 2015 both floating chambers and modelling approaches are useful with models able to provide high resolution estimates over diel cycles however these computations are still in the development stage and while recent work shows good agreement between different approaches i e macintyre et al 2020 model selection still requires validation using floating chambers jansen et al 2020 diffusive fluxes are estimated as the product of concentration gradients and modelled gas exchange coefficients k cole and caraco 1998 this coefficient depends on the turbulence at the water atmosphere interface driven by wind and buoyancy flux macintyre and melack 1995 tedford et al 2014 accuracy is improved when the turbulence is obtained via the surface renewal model heiskanen et al 2014 mammarella et al 2015 czikowsky et al 2018 even though cooling can cause near surface turbulence in small ponds there is generally some residual shear to drive the turbulence macintyre et al 2020 the turbulence can also be increased under heating as shear intensifies for a given wind speed but at some point stratification damps the turbulence monin and obukhov 1954 macintyre et al 2010 macintyre et al 2020 moreover under low turbulence co2 might bypass molecular diffusion through chemical reactions in the boundary layer this chemical effect controls co2 exchange rates in alkaline and productive systems wanninkhof and knox 1996 such as wsps improvements in quantifying fluxes from wastewaters is expected when both the physical and biological drivers of emissions are considered the overarching objective of this study is to estimate ghg emissions from wsps by quantifying various processes involved specifically the aims are to quantify 1 the diurnal stratification mixing patterns and variability in subsurface concentrations of co2 and ch4 in response to changing weather conditions 2 the effect of heat loss and heat gain to surface turbulence and 3 the contribution of ebullition to integrated ghg emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites local climate and sampling scheme sampling was conducted at four wastewater treatment plants wwtps with varying pond layouts and load all located in the southwest region of western australia each site has various configurations of facultative ponds and maturation ponds as well as different inlet and outlet configurations e g fig 1 a and 1b for the purpose of this study only primary faculatative ponds were chosen for ghg sampling all of these wwtps experience mild wet winters june september average air temperature of 13 5 c and precipitation of 132 5 mm and hot dry summers december march 24 7 c and 11 4 mm two of the sites cra and wag were studied between march and april 2013 while the other two pin and bdt were studied between november 2014 and march 2015 bathymetries of four of the six ponds studied are shown in figure 1 and pond characteristics are presented in table 1 table s1 presents the sampling scheme and data included for pin and bdt sites the scheme for the 2013 campaign is described in glaz et al 2016 a single primary facultative pond per wwtp was sampled at the outlet at cra and wag in 2013 while two parallel primary facultative ponds were sampled at pin and bdt hereafter numbered 1 and 2 with sampling conducted at the inlet and outlet of each pond the two ponds at pin were sampled more intensively between november and december 2014 this detailed study was repeated at bdt between february to march 2015 table s1 the intensive sampling during this period also included a detailed assessment of the thermal structure in situ meteorology and surface ghg concentrations along with direct flux measurements obtained using floating chambers and submerged funnels the ghg saturation data collected from cra and wag were previously presented for flux calculations in glaz et al 2016 but in the present study we further explore the data collected on pond hydrodynamics in these two wwtps including a comparison of gas transfer velocities computed through modelling and floating chamber which adds to measurements obtained from pin and bdt 2 2 meteorology physical and chemical conditions and productivity in 2013 a kestrel 4500 meteorological station was installed at cra and wag to measure relative humidity wind speed m s 1 atmospheric

the phytoplankton biomass was evaluated as chlorophyll a concentration chl a estimated with a fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke germany according to manufacturer calibration 2 3 dissolved ghg concentrations at cra and wag discrete sampling of dissolved co2 and ch4 were taken at the surface of the pond outlet between march april 2013 and the data was used to convert chamber flux assessments into gas exchange velocities complete ghg dataset presented in glaz et al 2016 at pin discrete samples of dissolved co2 and ch4 were collected at the surface of the pond inlets and outlets between november and december 2014 and at bdt between february and march 2015 briefly during ghg sampling 2 l of pond water were pumped directly into the gas exchange bottle with an in line pump at a slow flow rate to minimize gas loss the water was immediately equilibrated into 20 ml of ambient air for 3 min with the headspace sampled in 5 9 ml exetainer vials labco limited previously evacuated and helium purged the vials were stored at 4 c until analysed by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector varian 3800 with a combipal system cp poraplot q 25 m 0 53 mm column dissolved gas concentrations were calculated according to henry s law using the average water temperature before and after gas equilibration to complement the discrete dissolved gas measurements in the pin ponds a pro oceanus bridgewater canada dual sensor co2 and ch4 was deployed at 0 2 to 0 3 m depth in the two studied ponds for 40 48 hours to record short term hourly temporal variations in dissolved ghgs 28 30 november

values of atmospheric partial pressures ipcc 2013 were used to determine c eq direct measurements of co2 flux were also taken at all four wwtps using a floating chamber made of plastic covered with aluminium foil with sidewalls extending 2 3 cm into the water pin and bdt area of 0 12 m2 headspace volume of 15 4 l cra and wag 0 15 m2 9 1 l for pin and bdt the chamber was connected to a vaisala

a graduated 120 ml polypropylene syringe equipped with a one way stopcock for gas collection was used to estimate ch4 and co2 ebullition rates from pin and bdt ponds inverted funnels were deployed for 3 4 hours at the inlet and outlet of pin1 and at the outlet of bdt1 in both the morning and afternoon the volume of the gas accumulated in the syringe was recorded and three replicate samples were taken for quantification by gas chromatography ebullition flux f e was calculated as 11 f e c v g v m a 1 where c is the concentration of the gas released from pond and collected in the syringe v g is the total volume of the gas in the funnel v m is the gas molar volume at ambient temperature and a is the area of the funnel covered pond area of 0 4 m2 2 6 integrated carbon emissions total emissions from wsps in co2 equivalents co2 eq defined as the sum of co2 and ch4 released through diffusion and ebullition were calculated assuming ch4 is 33 times more potent than co2 on a gram to gram basis over 100 years etminan et al 2016 this is referred to as the global warming potential gwp of wsp emissions to integrate the release of ghg to the atmosphere by wsps the diffusive fluxes were estimated with the surface renewal model only turbulence caused by wind under heating conditions was considered as all discrete ghg measurements were taken between 1000 1500 hrs and any contribution from heat loss to kinetic energy dissipation was considered negligible during these periods the chemical enhancement factor acting on co2 fluxes was considered when significant that is when winds were low 2 m s

temperatures and stronger winds on average 22 3 c and 2 2 m s 1 compared to cra 14 7 c and 1 m s 1 table 2 fig 2 wastewater in wag was thus on average warmer but with a weaker temperature gradient 21

being 186 and 118 cph respectively at the time of sampling the pond at wag was on average shallower fig 1f where average pond depth affected sampling depths than that at cra fig 1e however coupled with wag having a larger length to width ratio than cra 3 7 1 at wag vs 1 5 1 at cra wag was generally more strongly stratified than cra fig 2a and 2f windy periods during the day fig 2c and 2h led to shear velocities raising up to 0 21 cm s 1 in cra and 0 27 cm s 1 in wag fig s1a and s1b black while nocturnal cooling yielded higher convective velocities ranging between 0 0041 cm s 1 in cra and 0 0036 cm s 1 in wag fig s1a and s1b orange nocturnal cooling was characterized by maximum heat losses of 200 w m 2 fig 2b and 2g in orange with wind speeds of 2 3 m s 1 fig 2c and 2h over the studied periods the kinetic energy dissipation rates ε epsilon were similarly variable 10 10 to 10 6 m2 s 3 fig 2e and 2j black in both cra and wag ponds indicating that strong stratification was interrupted by moderately turbulent conditions enhanced dissipation was observed during windy mornings and afternoons while turbulence i e epsilon ε at the water atmosphere interface was generally controlled by wind convection contributed on average 53 to epsilon in wag and 75 in cra when ponds were cooling following equation 3 as the difference between total kinetic energy dissipation rates and those associated to wind shear during the 2014 15 campaign ponds in bdt were exposed to higher air temperature 22 6 c on average compared to pin 18 9 c fig 3 b and 3g but to respectively lower winds table 2

contribution of convection to turbulence during nocturnal cooling averaged 40 and 51 in bdt and pin respectively 3 2 phytoplankton biomass and relationship to ghg concentrations during the study period the chl a concentration in bdt ranged between 114 and 1936 µg l 1 with higher values generally observed in early afternoon 1020 µg l 1 1300 1500 hrs than in the morning 795 µg l 1 900 1200 hrs by comparison the chl a concentrations ranged between 24 and 960 µg l 1 in pin and the difference between morning and afternoon observations was less pronounced 298 µg l 1 in the morning compared to 419 µg l 1 in the afternoon over the sampling period the phytoplankton community in bdt1 was dominated by green algae 20 80 of total biomass while cyanobacteria bloomed in bdt2 80 90 in both ponds at pin green algae consistently dominated the phytoplankton 50 all ponds had a ph above neutral with values for all sites ranging from 7 9 to 9 0 consistent with that expected in wsps the highest ph values were recorded in bdt ponds up to 10 7 recorded in bdt2 coinciding with the highest concentrations of chl a table 1 the ghg concentration expressed as departure from saturation ranged between 8 and 913 µmol co2 l 1 and between 1 4 and 76 4 µmol ch4 l 1 in pin while ranges in bdt ponds were 3 2 331 µmol co2 l 1 and 0 1 34 µmol ch4 l 1 departure from saturation of both co2 and ch4 were inversely related to chl a in bdt ponds r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 4 d and 4e in contrast phytoplankton biomass was positively related to co2 in pin ponds fig 4a r2 0 29 p 0 05 while there was no relationship between chl a and ch4 in pin fig 4b there was a positive relationship between the two ghg ch4 vs co2 at bdt fig 4f r2 0 41 p 0 05 while the trend in pin is positive but not significant fig 4c 3 3 high frequency changes in ghg saturation and hydrodynamics the two ponds sampled at high frequency at pin experienced mixing periods of variable length and strength that were mainly associated to changing wind conditions fig 5 bottom waters periodically upwelled to the surface during the day in pin2 between 1400 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 75 fig 5a and 5g respectively when shear velocities exceeded 0 15 cm s 1 fig s1e and s1f in black these patterns of mixing and stratification apparently moderated the diurnal variations of dissolved co2 and ch4 levels co2 decreased during stratified periods for example down to 500 ppmv in pin2 between 1100 1400 hrs on 24 november doy 328 5 fig 5l in black when buoyancy frequency was high and increased rapidly to the upper detection limit dl of the sensor 6 000 ppmv when the water column mixed i e between 1400 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 75 fig 5l methane concentrations also varied concurrently with daily mixing patterns for example in pin1 ch4 dropped rapidly during the morning 0600 1200 hrs on 28 november doy 332 25 fig 5f in orange from the upper dl 20 000 ppmv down to 7 000 ppmv during a period of reduced mixing and oscillated between 8 000 12 000 ppmv afterward and over the following night during a period of strong convection fig s1e orange this behaviour continued until it dropped to 4 000 ppmv around sunrise on the next day 0400 0500 hrs doy 333 25 fig 5f in orange when the pond re stratified the subsurface ch4 levels were much lower in pin2 than in pin1 varying between 1 500 3 000 ppmv fig 5f and 5l in orange although increasing ch4 sometimes coincided with changes in co2 e g in pin2 between 1500 1800 hrs on 24 november doy 328 6 fig 5l this was not persistently concurrent in fact when both co2 and ch4 were within the detection range of the sensor the ratio of dissolved co2 to ch4 ranged between 0 16 1 4 in pin1 and between 0 3 3 5 in pin2 3 4 comparison of modelled and measured co2 transfer coefficients when data from all ponds sampled both in 2013 and 2014 2015 cra wag bdt and pin were grouped together to explore the relationship between flux estimation methods models versus chamber measurements we found a strong and significant correlation between gas transfer velocities estimated with the surface renewal model and chamber measurements fig 6 r2 0 98 p 0 0001 while direct chamber measurements had slightly higher k 600 averages 9 3 6 0 cm h 1 compared to the surface renewal model 8 5 5 2 cm h 1 most 90 measurements included in this analysis lay within the 95 prediction bands of the regression line which is very close to the 1 1 relationship fig 6 the gas transfer coefficient calculated with an alternative model i e grachev et al 2013 where turbulence is controlled by near surface shear only without any influence of heating or cooling showed much weaker correspondence to the direct measurements fig 6 blue hence the surface renewal model was selected to estimate all of the diffusive ghgs fluxes in this study despite good correspondence between modelled and measured values some apparent outliers were recorded where chamber values were up to five times higher than those from model estimates these values are also shown fig 6 red but were not included in the regression analysis 3 5 ghg diffusive fluxes the co2 diffusive fluxes were significantly higher from ponds in pin fig 7 a and 7b 317 mmol m 2 d 1 n 48 data pooled from both ponds for inlet and outlet sites than in bdt fig 7c and 7d 28 mmol m 2 d 1 n 36 anova results presented in table 3 this difference in co2 release at these two wwtps appears to be influenced by the time of the day it was higher in the morning 1000 1200 hrs in pin 490 320 mmol m 2 d 1 than in bdt 6 2 6 8 mmol m 2 d 1 but in the afternoon 1300 1500 hrs fluxes decreased in pin 159 218 mmol m 2 d 1 while increasing in bdt 53 140 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 7 the difference in bdt resulted mostly from an exceptionally high co2 efflux observed on 25 february in bdt1 fig 7c doy 56 365 160 mmol m 2 d 1 when each wwtp was analysed separately co2 fluxes were significantly different among individual ponds and between the morning and afternoon two way anova table s2 the ch4 diffusive fluxes were also significantly higher for ponds in pin 36 28 mmol m 2 d 1 than in bdt 11 13 mmol m 2 d 1 table 3 these emissions differed between individual ponds and were affected by the time of the day with higher morning fluxes in pin 52 26 mmol m 2 d 1 but lower in bdt 6 6 5 2 mmol m 2 d 1 as compared to afternoon fluxes 20 18 and 15 16 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively estimated ch4 efflux from pin1 was lower compared to pin2 35 and 40 mmol m 2 d 1 and lower in bdt2 compared to bdt1 1 7 and 20 mmol m 2 d 1 3 6 ebullition and integrated carbon release ebullition and diffusive fluxes were assessed simultaneously for a total of 37 measurements from pin1 n 18 and bdt1 n 19 allowing the analysis of both types of emission pathways and assessment of the total carbon evasion from wastewaters the co2 ebullition flux was higher in pin 13 11 mmol m 2 d 1 values converted to g of co2 equivalent in fig 8 than in bdt 2 6 4 3 mmol m 2 d 1 but this emission pathway contributed only about 1 to total release on average fig 8 table 4 on the other hand ebullition contributed between 50 and 99 to total ch4 efflux in pin ponds 65 40 mmol m 2 d 1 and between 40 99 in bdt ponds where flux was significantly lower 24 23 mmol m 2 d 1 in fact ebullition represented on average 65 of total emissions from wsps when converted into co2 equivalent units overall the cumulative gwp of carbon based ghg emitted to the atmosphere by wsps was higher in pin 64 g co2 eq m 2 d 1 fig 8a than bdt 17 g co2 eq m 2 d 1 fig 8b table 4 4 discussion accurate gas flux estimations during wastewater processing is required to evaluate its contribution to local and global ghg budgets in this study specifically assessing fluxes from wsps an abundant ecosystem increasing in importance across the planet we highlight processes needed to be accounted for to improve ghg budgeting firstly nocturnal heat exchange may contribute between 40 75 of the turbulence at the surface of wsps limiting field measurements to normal working hours can thus generate an underestimation of ghg emissions as it was also shown in the amazon floodplains amaral et al 2020 secondly upwelling events bring ghgs accumulated in bottom waters to the surface also leading to greater efflux linked to changeable meteorological conditions moreover we show that dissolved ghg concentrations are extremely variable spatially between and within ponds highlighting the need for spatially resolved gas sampling approaches most importantly ebullition needs to be closely considered as it contributed 65 of the integrated ghg release from wsps overall these effects if unaccounted for can lead to large underestimations of ghg emissions from wastewaters stabilisation ponds 4 1 controls on ghg diffusion from wsps there was an excellent agreement between modelled and measured gas transfer velocities in wsps fig 6 thus the surface renewal model allows for robust diffusive flux estimations in these systems while modelled values were slightly lower than values measured with the floating chambers this difference was not significant comparison of residuals breusch pagan test p 0 05 it is important to underline here that the model does not account for any turbulence potentially resulting from wastewater inflow and outflow currents in addition placing the chamber on the water surface might have artificially enhanced the turbulence an effect particularly observed under calm conditions vachon et al 2010 these two factors could explain the observed discrepancy moreover the outliers shown on figure 6 correspond to measurements when co2 was depleted where uptake measured with the chamber was higher than predicted by the model this effect was pronounced when ph in ponds was high and winds were low and may indicate that there is even stronger chemical effect on co2 uptake that was considered in this study as such further research is required to investigate more precisely the role of chemical processes in co2 fluxes at the surface of wsps the water column in wsps stratified for short periods of time leading to co2 depletion at the surface through photosynthesis and efflux and decreased emissions enhanced stratification was also associated to an accumulation of ghgs at the bottom accumulated gases were often transported upwards during mixing and generated hot emission moments while we did not directly measure ghgs in bottom waters we did observe rising saturation levels at the surface during mixing fig 5 effects of diurnal patterns in mixing and stratification on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems are well known from tropical and subtropical inland waters macintyre et al 2002 for example a study of small and shallow north lake also located in western australia revealed cycles consisting of stratified periods followed by mixing upon the onset of breeze macintyre 1998 the study of north lake also showed that periods of mixing can generate intense transport macintyre and melack 1995 for example phytoplankton cells circulated in the upper wind mixed layer of this lake on time scales of minutes macintyre 1993 in the present study diurnal stratification and mixing were clearly observable in bdt and cra ponds the stratification periods were often associated with the accumulation of buoyant phytoplankton at the surface early in the day which then later dispersed throughout the water column changes in the phytoplankton concentration and distribution within the water column can produce strong gradients in co2 saturation levels and variable co2 fluxes this effect was particularly important in bdt ponds where high phytoplankton biomass strongly influenced co2 saturation during daily stratification fig 4 also at night no photosynthetic uptake co2 levels increased rapidly but this could also be linked to the upwelling of co2 enriched waters some recent work indicates that nocturnal mixing enhances ghg emissions from shallow wetlands poindexter et al 2016 a mechanism also suggested to operate in shallow thermokarst lakes and flooded forests walter anthony and macintyre 2016 we observed an increase in both co2 and ch4 in pin ponds upon nocturnal and morning mixing fig 5 enhanced downward energy flux associated to efficient mixing are also known to control gas bubbling rates wik et al 2014 and thus may have influenced the ebullition in wsps however the temporal resolution of ebullition measurements in our study is not adequate for the assessment of such fine temporal effects 4 2 the integrated carbon emission budget in wsps ebullition generally contributes a large fraction of ch4 emissions from global lakes and ponds mcginnis et al 2006 and more so in shallow systems where rising gas bubbles do not lose much of their initial ch4 to the surrounding waters before they are released to the atmosphere delwiche and hemond 2017 bartosiewicz et al 2021 for a great majority of observations in the studied wsps ebullition was indeed the dominant ch4 emission pathway 40 to 99 fig 8 the contribution of ebullition to total ghg release in co2 eq was in fact significantly higher than that from diffusion on average 65 of the integrated ghg release this large contribution was partly linked to the high proportion of ch4 in bubbles escaping from wsps 20 48 compared to 1 of co2 the estimation of integrated ghg emissions from an ecosystem expressed as gwp is becoming a common approach to appreciate their impact on climate chang et al 2017 su et al 2019 we suggest that the gwp of ghg released from wsps is controlled by an interactive effect of daily stratification and mixing along with phytoplankton driven co2 uptake and ch4 ebullition we also show that even in shallow systems such as wsps which are stratifying only for relatively short periods of time gas concentrations changed by up to an order of magnitude within a few hours this effect most likely related to upwelling of ghg enriched bottom waters can result in large and rapid efflux 4 3 functional traits of wsps in organic matter processing the relationship between ch4 and co2 in wsps figs 4 5 7 implies that the overall ghg efflux depends on the completeness of organic matter decomposition czepiel et al 1993 and that production and consumption of carbon based ghgs is closely coupled in wsps it may also indicate that at least a fraction of surface co2 derives from large amounts of biogas diffusing from the bottom when ch4 is partially oxidized at the oxic anoxic interface in the water column i e within the accumulation of photosynthesizing phytoplankton milucka et al 2015 calculated from the high resolution sampling fig 5 the co2 ch4 ratio varied between 0 16 and 3 5 average 0 77 while in natural lakes this ratio ranges between 10 and 100 for small 0 001 km2 and larger 1 10 km2 water bodies respectively holgerson and raymond 2016 therefore wsps present a range shifted towards the prevalence of organic matter processing to ch4 however in contrast to some classic work in wastewaters where the co2 ch4 ratio was controlled by temperature and organic matter quality i e toprak 1995 the rapid and large changes observed here timescale of minutes to hours strongly imply that hydrodynamics mixing and related redox conditions are also important controls more in depth analyses of this trait i e ghg ratios and associated gwp with isotope tracing are needed to quantify the importance of oxidation and to explore engineering approaches e g controlling wind exposition or sludge distribution for reducing the carbon footprint of wsps recent evidence implies that aerobically decomposable sterols can be used as indicators of the wastewater treatment efficiency liu et al 2014 reichwaldt et al 2017 here we additionally suggest that the co2 ch4 ratio and overall gwp could be used as proxies of treatment efficiency and to trace the consequences of the growing demand for wastewater treatment on the global ghg budget 4 4 factoring wsps into the ghg budget of inland waters mounting evidence suggests that urban waters small lakes and ponds are releasing large quantites of ghgs peacock et al 2019 we compared the data collected for western australian wsps to the available global datasets fig 9 and found that wsps filled in a functional gap in these global datasets but differ from both urban ponds and very small natural ponds and lakes overall the co2 concentrations recorded in wsps are lower than those in natural lakes but higher than those recorded in urban ponds in contrast we found that ch4 concentrations were higher in wsps than in lakes but lower than in urban ponds this difference could be attributed to the effects of mixing on rates of ghg production and consumption especially in wsps and urban ponds urban and very small natural ponds will be more persistently stratified than wsps and under such stable conditions will provide more opportunity for methanogenesis in contrast wsps will mix more frequently and therefore accumulate less ch4 in their bottom waters despite high organic loading overall wsps represent a more dynamic environments relative to small natural ponds and lakes therefore considering that most of their integrated gwp comes from ch4 ebullition that is likely triggered by frequent deep mixing events assessment of this evasion pathway becomes fundamental such global calculations are currently still being developed but these differences highlight the need for more thorough comparisons among inland waters in order to gain a better appreciation of the contribution of wsps to the global ghg budget when applying the average daytime diffusive fluxes to the total wsp area of 1 6 106 m2 in western australia glaz et al 2016 they appear to be responsible for the release of 8 4 106 kg of co2 eq during an entire year this number could be upscaled to 10 3 106 kg co2 eq when considering the effect of night time heat loss on turbulence for an average increase by 55 of diffusion during the night i e 10 24hr and further to approximately 27 6 106 kg co2 eq when we assume that nocturnal ghg saturation levels are increased by a factor of 10 10 24hr due to mixing when a tentative estimate of ebullition is factored in i e 2 5 for 65 of the total ghg released this way on average table 4 this number climbs to 69 1 106 kg co2 eq emitted annually considering the large spatiotemporal variability in ghg concentrations and fluxes associated to changes in hydrodynamic conditions phytoplankton activity as well as the potential effects of sludge bathymetry for wsps in southwest western australia coggins et al 2017 these back of the envelope calculations should be taken as indicative trends only a sampling design allowing for more accurate estimations of these processes should include high resolution automated monitoring of hydrodynamics water column gas concentrations and ebullition rates rather than reliance on discrete gas measurements alone the controls of emission pathways need to be investigated further including the relative importance and interaction between rates of primary production and methanotrophy organic matter composition and hydrodynamics improved estimates of the spatiotemporal variability in ghg concentrations and fluxes related to physical chemical and biological processes in wastewaters will allow us to design better systems and employ solutions to reduce their effects on climate furthermore a deeper understanding of the microbial communities that contribute to ghg emissions in both the water column and sludge is required and could lead to improved wastewater treatment discharge and sludge management outcomes coggins et al 2019 5 conclusion in this study we showed that ebullition was the dominant pathway for ghg emission in wsps in comparison to other systems wsps can make a particularly significant contribution to ghg emissions however emissions are controlled by different factors compared to natural lakes this study identified that a more detailed understanding of nocturnal cooling is needed which cannot be achieved via discrete sampling methods continuous measurements will help to relate the large variations observed in ghg emissions from wsps to the hydrodynamic context of these ecosystems overall the contribution of wsps to the global ghg budget can be large

16777,wastewater based disease surveillance is a promising approach for monitoring community outbreaks here we describe a nationwide campaign to monitor sars cov 2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 u s states covering 13 of the u s population from february 18 to june 2 2020 out of 1 751 total samples analyzed 846 samples were positive for sars cov 2 rna with overall viral concentrations declining from april to may wastewater viral titers were consistent with and appeared to precede clinical covid 19 surveillance indicators including daily new cases wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate 80 of sars cov 2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100 000 people detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size to our knowledge this work represents the largest scale wastewater based sars cov 2 monitoring campaign to date encompassing a wide diversity of wastewater treatment facilities and geographic locations our findings demonstrate that a national wastewater based approach to disease surveillance may be feasible and effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater surveillance sars cov 2 united states detection rate spatiotemporal dynamics 1 introduction covid 19 was first reported in the united states on january 20 2020 and spread to all 50 states and the district of columbia by mid march holshue et al 2020 johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering 2020 as of february 1 2021 over 26 million confirmed cases and over 440 000 deaths have been reported in the u s johns hopkins coronavirus resource center 2021 establishing a national covid 19 surveillance system like those for viral hepatitis division of viral hepatitis cdc 2021 and influenza u s influenza surveillance system 2020 would be helpful for long term monitoring of sars cov 2 allowing healthcare officials to recognize and respond to new outbreaks efficiently however covid 19 poses specific challenges to clinical surveillance systems with its long infectious incubation time up to 14 days median 4 5 days greatly increasing the risk of viral transmission and infection among the population before clinical reporting contact tracing and containment can occur cdc 2020a lauer et al 2020 test and trace systems were rapidly overwhelmed in many countries early in the pandemic and

wastewater data could be used as an early warning of impending outbreaks to define public health and hospital planning wu et al 2020b the potential value of wastewater surveillance is gaining recognition with the centers for disease control and prevention and several state and local health agencies initiating wastewater based monitoring programs to supplement their covid 19 responses cdc 2020b in this study a nationwide covid 19 surveillance campaign was implemented to measure viral concentrations of sars cov 2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 u s states from february to june 2020 we investigated the detection rate and accuracy of wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 by comparing wastewater data to clinically reported case counts from state and local health agencies our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing wastewater surveillance as a supplement to national sars cov 2 clinical reporting data to understand important past current and future trends in viral dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and viral inactivation we initiated a national call for wastewater samples to quantify sars cov 2 viral load in wastewater catchment areas from mid february to early june 2020 eligible sites included public works and wastewater authorities across the continental united states with catchment areas spanning 65 people to 5 3 million people with a median size of 31 745 people average daily influent flow rates at these sites ranged from 0 005 300 million gallons per day samples were collected by each wastewater treatment facility on a

measured as an internal reference for wastewater samples each sample had two technical replicates and the mean ct values were converted to relative concentrations of viral particles based on the standard curve wu et al 2020a and sample s dilution factor 2 3 clinical data collection county level clinical data including cumulative covid 19 cases and deaths were downloaded from usafacts the largest source for standardized publicly available us government data https usafacts org visualizations coronavirus covid 19 spread map daily new cases or deaths were generated through using the cumulative data on one day to subtract the data before that day wastewater viral titers were compared to clinical data reported for the day on which the sample was obtained the 7 day moving average of new clinical cases current day 6 preceding days 7 was also used for the detection accuracy analysis in fig s5c d hospitalizations and positive rates of testing for each state were downloaded from the covid tracking project https covidtracking com which collects cross checks and publishes covid 19 testing hospitalization and patient outcome data from public health authorities in 56 us states and territories 2 4 detection rate analysis incidence rate of daily new cases was calculated using reported daily new cases in the county divided by the county population size in fig 2a we computed the detection rates percentage of positive wastewater samples for a constant interval 0 2 cases per 100 000 people of daily incidence starting from 0 to 149 6 cases per 100 000 people maximum daily incidence the results were fitted using an exponential decay function with formula y k 1 v max k 2 exp x τ starting from vmax 10 τ 1 and k 1 0 2 k 2 1 15 to estimate the distribution of daily incidence for all the positive samples wastewater viral titers were aggregated for each county since clinical cases were reported at the county level positive samples were then selected and plotted the histogram and kernel density estimation for the distribution of daily incidence fig 2b fig 2c showed the relationship between detection rate of positive wastewater samples and the catchment population size samples were first separated based on four different daily incidences 0 0 2 2 10 and 10 150 per 100 000 people in the county where the sample was obtained for each daily incidence detection rate were computed within a constant interval of population size i e the maximum minus minimum of population size and divided by the number of bins n 200 all the analysis was done with r 3 5

locations that authorized the disclosure of their metadata individual samples represented catchments serving population sizes ranging from 65 to 5 3 million sewered individuals with a median size of 31 745 people fig s1a in total these wastewater samples covered 42 5 million people approximately 13 of the u s population samples were processed as they were received in the lab and quantified by real time quantitative pcr see methods 830 samples 49 1 were positive for sars cov 2 gene fragments 3 1 temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 titers in wastewater samples from 159 counties in 40 states for the month of march there were 86 wastewater samples from 25 counties 42 individual catchments in 10 states we observed significant heterogeneity in results at the county level 44 of the 86 samples 51 from 12 counties in 8 states were positive for sars cov 2 in california only 3 positive samples were found from the 14 sampling locations 21 in the 7 counties sampled in march on the other hand sars cov 2 was consistently detected in a massachusetts wastewater treatment plant wwtp starting on march 3 93 of samples with viral titers increasing throughout the month fig 1a positive samples were also found in more than two counties in colorado oregon and texas in april viral titers stopped increasing and became relatively stable for most sampling locations fig 1a and fig s1 of the samples tested in april 52 9 255 of 482 were sars cov 2 positive 173 samples from 44 counties had viral titers between 10 100 copies per ml of wastewater 78 samples from 24 counties had viral titers higher than 100 copies per ml fig 1a 1092 samples from 154 counties were processed in may of these 69 5 358 515 had positive sars cov 2 titers of 10 100 copies per ml of wastewater and 18 8 97 515 had titers of 100 copies per ml fig 1a analysis of april and may samples also showed the heterogeneity in viral titers at the county and catchment levels fig s2 different dynamics in viral titers were observed at the state level fig 1a viral titers in new jersey nj were high in march samples but started to decrease after april 8 similar temporal dynamics were also observed in michigan mi but with a smaller magnitude comparatively viral titers in indiana in and north carolina nc varied little over the sampling period april and may nine states virginia delaware michigan minnesota massachusetts oregon new york nebraska and new jersey had titers higher than 100 copies per ml of wastewater in april fig 1b this number dropped to two states maryland and minnesota in may fig 1c averaged across all states the mean viral concentration was significantly higher in april than in may fig s1b together these data highlight that wastewater surveillance can be implemented to explore viral transmission at different geographic and temporal scales 3 2 wastewater viral dynamics are consistent with clinical covid 19 surveillance indicators next we compared the wastewater viral titers with clinical surveillance data of covid 19 across the u s aggregating the positive wastewater data and daily new covid 19 cases and new deaths by date the mean viral titers increased from early march and became relatively stable between late march to late april followed by a small downward trend until june 2 fig 1d this temporal profile mirrors the trends of clinical new cases and deaths at the national level and precedes clinical data wastewater viral titers also reflected and seemed to precede the rise and fall of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions fig s3 we also investigated the relationship between wastewater viral titers and daily covid 19 incidence rates viral concentration in the wastewater is determined by the number of new infections shedding rates from infected individuals as well as total influent flow at the wastewater treatment plant wu et al 2020b which is linearly correlated with catchment population size fig s4 a weak positive correlation was found between the incidence of daily new cases at the county level and the wastewater viral titers at the catchment wastewater treatment plant level fig 1e we then compared total daily viral load for each catchment viral concentrations detected at wastewater treatment plant multiplied by the plant s daily influent flow rate and the estimated number of new cases in that catchment county level incidence rates multiplied by the catchment population a linear relationship was observed between the total viral load and catchment size normalized daily new cases fig 1f consistent with the hypothesis that

wastewater titers to new clinical cases on the sampling day material and methods using the reported daily incidence covid 19 cases i e daily new cases divided by the county population size we calculated the percentage of positive wastewater samples for different incidence rates wastewater based detections increased exponentially with the clinical incidence rate reaching an 80 rate of detection at a clinical incidence of 13 cases per 100 000 people fig 2 a for all positive wastewater samples at the county level the associated incidence rates of daily new cases ranged from 0 149 6 cases per 100 000 people median 3 7 cases per 100 000 people fig 2b in other words wastewater based surveillance was capable of detecting sars cov 2 for one new reported case out of 27 000 people however this new case rate does not consider unreported infections in the population which would lower the estimated detection limit to evaluate whether catchment size influences the probability of sars cov 2 detection in wastewater samples we analyzed the detection rate of positive samples from counties with equal daily incidence as shown in fig 2c detection rate is positively associated with the population size of wastewater treatment plant catchments for the majority of samples 100 detection rates were disproportionately represented among samples with high incidence 10 cases per 100 000 people and large population sizes 100 000 people this result is consistent with our previous model simulations that the probability of sars cov 2 detection in the wastewater increases with population size in communities with equal incidence wu et al 2020b to evaluate the detection accuracy of wastewater surveillance wastewater results were compared with the reported daily new clinical cases for all 1687 samples for which we had access to metadata 1057 62 7 exhibited results consistent with the geographically associated clinical data meaning that sars cov 2 was detected in the wastewater in

was not detected in the wastewater w0 c1 of these 67 4 were from counties with incidence rates below the median of all wastewater samples 3 7 cases per 100 000 we also measured the concentration of pmmov a stable and persistent indicator of fecal concentration in wastewater kitajima et al 2018 wu et al 2020a and found that pmmov copies in the w0 c1 samples were slightly but significantly lower than in other samples fig s5a suggesting that sample dilution and low incidence rates may have contributed to wastewater non detections finally there were 71 samples w1 c0 for which sars cov 2 was detected but there were no new clinical cases reported fig 2d most of these samples viral titers ranged from 10 to 272 copies ml fig s5b comparison of the wastewater data against the 7 day averages of

16777,wastewater based disease surveillance is a promising approach for monitoring community outbreaks here we describe a nationwide campaign to monitor sars cov 2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 u s states covering 13 of the u s population from february 18 to june 2 2020 out of 1 751 total samples analyzed 846 samples were positive for sars cov 2 rna with overall viral concentrations declining from april to may wastewater viral titers were consistent with and appeared to precede clinical covid 19 surveillance indicators including daily new cases wastewater surveillance had a high detection rate 80 of sars cov 2 when the daily incidence exceeded 13 per 100 000 people detection rates were positively associated with wastewater treatment plant catchment size to our knowledge this work represents the largest scale wastewater based sars cov 2 monitoring campaign to date encompassing a wide diversity of wastewater treatment facilities and geographic locations our findings demonstrate that a national wastewater based approach to disease surveillance may be feasible and effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater surveillance sars cov 2 united states detection rate spatiotemporal dynamics 1 introduction covid 19 was first reported in the united states on january 20 2020 and spread to all 50 states and the district of columbia by mid march holshue et al 2020 johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering 2020 as of february 1 2021 over 26 million confirmed cases and over 440 000 deaths have been reported in the u s johns hopkins coronavirus resource center 2021 establishing a national covid 19 surveillance system like those for viral hepatitis division of viral hepatitis cdc 2021 and influenza u s influenza surveillance system 2020 would be helpful for long term monitoring of sars cov 2 allowing healthcare officials to recognize and respond to new outbreaks efficiently however covid 19 poses specific challenges to clinical surveillance systems with its long infectious incubation time up to 14 days median 4 5 days greatly increasing the risk of viral transmission and infection among the population before clinical reporting contact tracing and containment can occur cdc 2020a lauer et al 2020 test and trace systems were rapidly overwhelmed in many countries early in the pandemic and are often ineffective once a disease reaches exponential community spread contreras et al 2021 kretzschmar et al 2020 the emergence of more infectious variants may exacerbate this problem galloway 2021 grubaugh et al 2021 as a complementary approach to clinical disease surveillance wastewater monitoring can help detect the presence of pathogens like the coronavirus sars cov 2 across municipalities and estimate disease incidence independent of individual testing orive et al 2020 wu et al 2020a 2020b wastewater surveillance is less resource intensive than large scale clinical testing making it an optimal tool for unobtrusive long term monitoring as well as early identification of viral circulation in the population thompson et al 2020 our recent findings wu et al 2020a 2020b along with work from other groups have described reliable detection of sars cov 2 gene fragments in wastewater samples across the world including australia ahmed et al 2020a brazil prado et al

2020a furthermore longitudinal wastewater viral titers correlate with clinically diagnosed new covid 19 cases and trends in wastewater precede those in clinical reports by 4 10 days suggesting that wastewater data could be used as an early warning of impending outbreaks to define public health and hospital planning wu et al 2020b the potential value of wastewater surveillance is gaining recognition with the centers for disease control and prevention and several state and local health agencies initiating wastewater based monitoring programs to supplement their covid 19 responses cdc 2020b in this study a nationwide covid 19 surveillance campaign was implemented to measure viral concentrations of sars cov 2 in the wastewater of 159 counties in 40 u s states from february to june 2020 we investigated the detection rate and accuracy of wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 by comparing wastewater data to clinically reported case counts from state and local health agencies our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing wastewater surveillance as a supplement to national sars cov 2 clinical reporting data to understand important past current and future trends in viral dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and viral inactivation we initiated a national call for wastewater samples to quantify sars cov 2 viral load in wastewater catchment areas from mid february to early june 2020 eligible sites included public works and wastewater authorities across the continental united states with catchment areas spanning 65 people to 5 3 million people with a median size of 31 745 people average daily influent flow rates at these sites ranged from 0 005 300 million gallons per day samples were collected by each wastewater treatment facility on a voluntary basis generally on a weekly basis for more detailed sampling frequency see supplemental table s1 raw wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater treatment plants or catchments in 40 u s states and stored at 4 c before being mailed overnight to the laboratory for analysis samples were processed within 1 3 days of receipt using the method as previously described wu et al 2020a 2020b briefly uv light was used to sterilize the exterior of the sample s container 20 min before handling and pasteurization heat treatment in a 60 c water bath for 90 min was used to inactivate the pathogens in sewage pasteurized samples were vacuum filtered with a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membrane to remove cell debris and solid materials supernatant was used to concentrate the viral particles as described below and the rest was stored in 4 c 2 2 viral precipitation rna extraction reverse transcription and quantitative pcr rt qpcr samples were processed starting from viral enrichment to quantitative pcr using two comparable methods as previously described wu et al 2020b we processed 60 samples from deer island wastewater treatment plant with both two methods and no significant difference between viral titers was observed wu et al 2020b briefly viral particles in 40 ml filtrate were precipitated with polyethylene glycol 8000 10 w v millipore sigma and nacl 0 3m millipore sigma in method i viral pellet was resuspended in 1 5 ml trizol reagent cat 15596026 thermo fisher scientific and mixed thoroughly with 300 μl chloroform cat c2432 sigma aldrich for 1 min the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature before centrifugation for 15 min at 16 000 g at 4 c aqueous phase 600 μl containing the rna was transferred to a new 1 5 ml tube and 600 μl isopropanol cat 470157 450 vwr was added into the aqueous phase after 10 min incubation at room temperature samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16 000 g at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and pellet was washed twice with 75 ethanol followed by air dry for 5 10 min 30 µl of depc water was used to resuspend the rna for cdna synthesis cdna was synthesized by reverse transcription rt based on the manufacturer s protocol m0368 new england biosciences followed by real time pcr with the taqman fast advanced master mix and u s cdc n1 n2 primer probes the qpcr reaction was carried out for 48 cycles using bio rad cfx96 real time pcr detection system with following program polymerase activation 95 c for 2 min pcr 48 cycles denature at 95 c for 1 s and anneal extend at 55 c for 30 s 15 ml of filtrate in method ii were first concentrated with 10 kda amicon ultra centrifugal filter sigma cat ufc9010 to 150 200 μl which is further lysed with 600 μl avl buffer qiagen cat 19073 for rna extraction qiagen rneasy kit cat 74182 the eluted rna was used for one step rt pcr with taqman fast virus 1 step master mix thermofisher cat 4444436 based on the following protocol 50 c 10 min for reverse transcription 95 c 20 s for rt inactivation and initial denaturation and 48 cycles of denature 95 c 1 s and anneal extend 55 c 30 s in total 1023 samples were processed with method i and 729 samples were processed with method ii evaluation of the viral concentration in methods i and ii using murine hepatitis virus a widely used sars cov 2 surrogate indicated recoveries of 58 09 20 21 and 31 42 2 59 respectively which agree well with other published studies ahmed et al 2020b dumke et al 2021 jafferali et al 2021 la rosa et al 2021 torii et al 2021 ye et al 2016 table s2 briefly mhv mhv atcc vr 764 was spiked into the wastewater and then concentrated by peg8000 and amicon filter in method i and method ii respectively in parallel the same amount of virus was directly lysed using trizol reagent or avl buffer in method i and method ii after that viral rna extraction rt and qpcr were performed by following the steps as described above in each method except using mhv specific primers and probe ahmed et al 2020b ct values for n1 or n2 primer sets were first converted to viral gene copies in the cdna sample copies per μl of cdna based on the standard curves established with the positive control plasmid method i or twist sars cov 2 rna method ii wu et al 2020b the concentration was further converted to viral gene copies per microliter of the wastewater sample by multiplying the dilution factor for method i the dilution factor is the volume of total cdna the total volume of rna the volume of rna used for reverse transcription the starting volume of filtered wastewater sample for method ii the dilution factor is the total volume of rna the starting volume of filtered wastewater sample two or three replicates were performed for each primer set averaged within each primer set and then across primers to derive the concentration values pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a stable and persistent indicator of fecal concentration in wastewater kitajima et al 2018 2014 wu et al 2020a was also measured as an internal reference for wastewater samples each sample had two technical replicates and the mean ct values were converted to relative concentrations of viral particles based on the standard curve wu et al 2020a and sample s dilution factor 2 3 clinical data collection county level clinical data including cumulative covid 19 cases and deaths were downloaded from usafacts the largest source for standardized publicly available us government data https usafacts org visualizations coronavirus covid 19 spread map daily new cases or deaths were generated through using the cumulative data on one day to subtract the data before that day wastewater viral titers were compared to clinical data reported for the day on which the sample was obtained the 7 day moving average of new clinical cases current day 6 preceding days 7 was also used for the detection accuracy analysis in fig s5c d hospitalizations and positive rates of testing for each state were downloaded from the covid tracking project https covidtracking com which collects cross checks and publishes covid 19 testing hospitalization and patient outcome data from public health authorities in 56 us states and territories 2 4 detection rate analysis incidence rate of daily new cases was calculated using reported daily new cases in the county divided by the county population size in fig 2a we computed the detection rates percentage of positive wastewater samples for a constant interval 0 2 cases per 100 000 people of daily incidence starting from 0 to 149 6 cases per 100 000 people maximum daily incidence the results were fitted using an exponential decay function with formula y k 1 v max k 2 exp x τ starting from vmax 10 τ 1 and k 1 0 2 k 2 1 15 to estimate the distribution of daily incidence for all the positive samples wastewater viral titers were aggregated for each county since clinical cases were reported at the county level positive samples were then selected and plotted the histogram and kernel density estimation for the distribution of daily incidence fig 2b fig 2c showed the relationship between detection rate of positive wastewater samples and the catchment population size samples were first separated based on four different daily incidences 0 0 2 2 10 and 10 150 per 100 000 people in the county where the sample was obtained for each daily incidence detection rate were computed within a constant interval of population size i e the maximum minus minimum of population size and divided by the number of bins n 200 all the analysis was done with r 3 5 0 3 results we collected and processed 1751 wastewater samples from 353 unique locations in 159 counties in 40 u s states from february 18 to june 2 2020 fig 1 a of these samples 1687 were from locations that authorized the disclosure of their metadata individual samples represented catchments serving population sizes ranging from 65 to 5 3 million sewered individuals with a median size of 31 745 people fig s1a in total these wastewater samples covered 42 5 million people approximately 13 of the u s population samples were processed as they were received in the lab and quantified by real time quantitative pcr see methods 830 samples 49 1 were positive for sars cov 2 gene fragments 3 1 temporal dynamics of sars cov 2 titers in wastewater samples from 159 counties in 40 states for the month of march there were 86 wastewater samples from 25 counties 42 individual catchments in 10 states we observed significant heterogeneity in results at the county level 44 of the 86 samples 51 from 12 counties in 8 states were positive for sars cov 2 in california only 3 positive samples were found from the 14 sampling locations 21 in the 7 counties sampled in march on the other hand sars cov 2 was consistently detected in a massachusetts wastewater treatment plant wwtp starting on march 3 93 of samples with viral titers increasing throughout the month fig 1a positive samples were also found in more than two counties in colorado oregon and texas in april viral titers stopped increasing and became relatively stable for most sampling locations fig 1a and fig s1 of the samples tested in april 52 9 255 of 482 were sars cov 2 positive 173 samples from 44 counties had viral titers between 10 100 copies per ml of wastewater 78 samples from 24 counties had viral titers higher than 100 copies per ml fig 1a 1092 samples from 154 counties were processed in may of these 69 5 358 515 had positive sars cov 2 titers of 10 100 copies per ml of wastewater and 18 8 97 515 had titers of 100 copies per ml fig 1a analysis of april and may samples also showed the heterogeneity in viral titers at the county and catchment levels fig s2 different dynamics in viral titers were observed at the state level fig 1a viral titers in new jersey nj were high in march samples but started to decrease after april 8 similar temporal dynamics were also observed in michigan mi but with a smaller magnitude comparatively viral titers in indiana in and north carolina nc varied little over the sampling period april and may nine states virginia delaware michigan minnesota massachusetts oregon new york nebraska and new jersey had titers higher than 100 copies per ml of wastewater in april fig 1b this number dropped to two states maryland and minnesota in may fig 1c averaged across all states the mean viral concentration was significantly higher in april than in may fig s1b together these data highlight that wastewater surveillance can be implemented to explore viral transmission at different geographic and temporal scales 3 2 wastewater viral dynamics are consistent with clinical covid 19 surveillance indicators next we compared the wastewater viral titers with clinical surveillance data of covid 19 across the u s aggregating the positive wastewater data and daily new covid 19 cases and new deaths by date the mean viral titers increased from early march and became relatively stable between late march to late april followed by a small downward trend until june 2 fig 1d this temporal profile mirrors the trends of clinical new cases and deaths at the national level and precedes clinical data wastewater viral titers also reflected and seemed to precede the rise and fall of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions fig s3 we also investigated the relationship between wastewater viral titers and daily covid 19 incidence rates viral concentration in the wastewater is determined by the number of new infections shedding rates from infected individuals as well as total influent flow at the wastewater treatment plant wu et al 2020b which is linearly correlated with catchment population size fig s4 a weak positive correlation was found between the incidence of daily new cases at the county level and the wastewater viral titers at the catchment wastewater treatment plant level fig 1e we then compared total daily viral load for each catchment viral concentrations detected at wastewater treatment plant multiplied by the plant s daily influent flow rate and the estimated number of new cases in that catchment county level incidence rates multiplied by the catchment population a linear relationship was observed between the total viral load and catchment size normalized daily new cases fig 1f consistent with the hypothesis that average shedding rates are similar across catchments 3 3 estimation of detection rate and accuracy of wastewater surveillance detection rate of wastewater surveillance were also examined by comparing wastewater titers to new clinical cases on the sampling day material and methods using the reported daily incidence covid 19 cases i e daily new cases divided by the county population size we calculated the percentage of positive wastewater samples for different incidence rates wastewater based detections increased exponentially with the clinical incidence rate reaching an 80 rate of detection at a clinical incidence of 13 cases per 100 000 people fig 2 a for all positive wastewater samples at the county level the associated incidence rates of daily new cases ranged from 0 149 6 cases per 100 000 people median 3 7 cases per 100 000 people fig 2b in other words wastewater based surveillance was capable of detecting sars cov 2 for one new reported case out of 27 000 people however this new case rate does not consider unreported infections in the population which would lower the estimated detection limit to evaluate whether catchment size influences the probability of sars cov 2 detection in wastewater samples we analyzed the detection rate of positive samples from counties with equal daily incidence as shown in fig 2c detection rate is positively associated with the population size of wastewater treatment plant catchments for the majority of samples 100 detection rates were disproportionately represented among samples with high incidence 10 cases per 100 000 people and large population sizes 100 000 people this result is consistent with our previous model simulations that the probability of sars cov 2 detection in the wastewater increases with population

pmmov a stable and persistent indicator of fecal concentration in wastewater kitajima et al 2018 wu et al 2020a and found that pmmov copies in the w0 c1 samples were slightly but significantly lower than in other samples fig s5a suggesting that sample dilution and low incidence rates may have contributed to wastewater non detections finally there were 71 samples w1 c0 for which sars cov 2 was

16778,the presence of antibiotic resistance in wastewater sparked a great interest in investigating the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by disinfecting agents in this study the inactivation kinetics of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by an emerging environmentally friendly disinfectant peracetic acid paa in wastewater and phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 were characterized it was demonstrated that the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria was governed by their exposure to paa i e integral of the paa concentration over time integral ct or ict both regimes of the paa inactivation of bacteria i e initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation were described well by an ict based chick watson inactivation kinetic model in wastewater at ph 7 5 the model predicted ict requirements showed that the multidrug resistant enterococci were less susceptible to paa than e coli e g to achieve a 3 log reduction an ict of 32 7 mg min l and 23 4 mg min l was needed respectively no regrowth of the studied bacteria was observed after 72 h from paa disinfection at 25 1 c soluble constituents of wastewater decreased the paa inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria i e higher inactivation was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater at the same ph of 7 5 in phosphate buffer a lower ph of 6 5 resulted in higher inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli compared with ph 7 5 but it did not affect the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci a comparison with the most commonly used chemical disinfectant chlorine showed higher inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by chlorine and higher chlorine decay than paa the results of the present study may have implications in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at controlling antibiotic resistance in terms of selecting a suitable fecal indicator and optimizing disinfectant dosing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid chlorine antibiotic resistance bacteria wastewater disinfection 1 introduction the struggle against human infectious diseases was and is a societal challenge worldwide despite the short lived relief with the discovery of antibiotics the emergence of new diseases and recurrence of diseases previously controlled pose a threat to the public health care system antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the principal human and animal health problems of the 21st century that threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections caused by bacteria protozoa viruses and fungi which are no longer susceptible to the common medicines used to treat them berendonk et al 2015 fatta kassinos et al 2020 prestinaci et al 2015 the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance is driven by a complex and multifaceted network which links the consumption and release of antimicrobial drugs with their exposure to bacteria durão et al 2018 karaolia et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps often bridge the anthropogenic activities and the environment for this reason wwtps are considered as one of the main routes for resistance dissemination caucci et al 2016 for example e coli exhibiting resistance to antibiotics were found in influents of wwtps worldwide at concentrations of 104 107 cfu 100 ml aslan et al 2018 hernández et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 zanotto et al 2016 insufficient or no disinfection of wastewater in wwtps may result in the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the effluents of wwtps łuczkiewicz et al 2010 watkinson et al 2007 for example the occurrence of antibiotic resistant e coli in effluents of wwtps at concentrations of 102 105 cfu 100 ml was reported korzeniewska et al 2013 korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 another fecal indicator enterococci exhibiting resistance to antibiotics was also detected in influents and effluents of wwtps at concentrations ranging from 102 to 104 cfu 100 ml and 102 103 cfu 100 ml respectively varela et al 2013 considering that the effluents of wwtps are either discharged to surface waters or reused for example in crop irrigation it is of utmost importance to inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater this study deals with disinfection of wastewater to address antibiotic resistance challenges chlorine is the most commonly used disinfecting agent in wwtps globally this is because of its low cost and its efficacy in inactivating bacteria e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci haas and engelbrecht 1980 hassaballah et al 2020 tyrrell et al 1995 and viruses e g norovirus adenovirus and enteroviruses cromeans et al 2010 lim et al 2010 page et al 2009 rachmadi et al 2020 in water and wastewater it is already known that chlorine can inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria effectively destiani and templeton 2019 huang et al 2011 phattarapattamawong et al 2021 yuan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 despite chlorine s advantages its limitations related to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts such as haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes led to an enormous interest in alternative to chlorine physical and chemical disinfection processes dong et al 2019 korshin et al 2002 liu et al 2020 that being said the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by ultraviolet uv irradiation guo et al 2013 mckinney and

investigated in this study the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by an emerging chemical disinfectant peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh was studied in the last decades paa received great attention as an environmentally friendly wastewater disinfectant due to its negligible aquatic toxicity i e minimal formation of disinfection byproducts during paa disinfection of water and wastewater dell erba et al 2007 domínguez henao et al 2018 rossi et al 2007 santoro et al 2007 the unique disinfection properties of paa were shown for the inactivation of a wide range of bacteria and viruses including fecal indicators e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 antonelli et al 2006 dunkin et al 2017 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2019 recently the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater by paa was also studied campo et al 2020 rizzo et al 2019 however previous studies either did not interpret the disinfection data based on the exposure to paa or focused on a single bacterial species e g e coli that were resistant to a single drug and no comparison with other antibiotic resistant fecal indicators in the domain of exposure was carried out to learn which multidrug resistant fecal bacteria are a suitable indicator for paa disinfection although e coli is one of the most commonly studied and well understood organism globally due to its adaptability ubiquity and ease of cultivation blount 2015 other fecal indicators such as enterococci which are frequent commensal members of the gut ecosystem of mammals and birds are opportunistic pathogens that cause millions of infections per annum byappanahalli et al 2012 for example enterococci may help predict human health risks from exposure to polluted recreational waters and hence can be used as a surrogate for waterborne pathogens byappanahalli et al 2012 significantly both the european union bathing water directive 2006 7 ec and the united states environmental protection agency ambient water quality criteria for bacteria epa440 5 84 002 recommended the monitoring of both e coli and enterococci for recreational waters due to the relationship between swimming related illnesses and the concentrations of e coli and enterococci in water mansilha et al 2009 importantly both e coli and enterococci have been suggested as potential indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment berendonk et al 2015 thus it is important to investigate the comparative exposure based inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci and e coli by paa in wastewater moreover the exposure based kinetics allow the elucidation of the effect of ph and water matrix on the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa as well as the direct comparison with conventional chlorine disinfection which have not been investigated previously according to the best of authors knowledge these are critical in understanding the potential of paa as a chemical disinfectant of water and wastewater this study characterizes the inactivation kinetics of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in phosphate buffer and urban wastewater at different ph conditions and compares paa with chlorine disinfection of wastewater under identical conditions the objectives of the present study were to i determine the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci as a function of paa concentration and exposure time in urban wastewater ii develop an exposure based chick watson inactivation model to describe and predict the reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci iii evaluate the effect of water matrix and ph on the exposure response curves for paa inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and iv compare paa with chlorine by performing experiments under identical conditions and calculating model predicted exposure requirements for 1 4 log reductions of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria by both disinfectants the simultaneous inactivation of the two multidrug resistant bacteria coupled with the exposure based microbial inactivation kinetic modeling may be useful in selecting a suitable fecal indicator for paa disinfection this may have practical implications in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at inactivating multidrug resistant bacteria 2 materials and methods 2

culture media and inoculum are given in text s2 2 3 water matrices urban wastewater final effluent was grab sampled from a membrane bioreactor mbr based wwtp located in nicosia cyprus the quality characteristics of the urban wastewater used in this study are presented in table s1 the use of the mbr effluent as the wastewater matrix for the experiments provided the advantage of a clarified wastewater with no indigenous multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 1 cfu 100 ml this allowed the spiking of wastewater with the desired concentration of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 4 5 log and hence provided real world wastewater conditions that were ideal for inactivation kinetics characterization moreover the absence of total suspended solids allowed the investigation of a possible effect of soluble constituents of wastewater on the inactivation of the studied bacteria table s1 the 0 01 m phosphate buffer was prepared by adding potassium dihydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate to ultrapure water to achieve the desired ph i e 6 5 or 7 5 to evaluate the effect of water matrix phosphate buffer was prepared at ph 7 5 which is the same ph with the wastewater used in this study table s1 to evaluate the effect of ph phosphate buffer was prepared at ph 6 5 which is included in the water treatment relevant ph range of 6 9 lee et al 2009 2 4 isolation and preparation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci inocula the e coli and enterococci bacteria were isolated from the influent collected at wwtp through the inoculation of 100 μl of sample on chromocult coliform agar cca and slanetz and bartley agar sba respectively which were spiked with the three antibiotics of interest i e ampicillin ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim at the concentrations mentioned in text s2 for their selective isolation followed by incubation at 44 c for 24 h for e coli and 37 c for 48 h for enterococci bacterial stocks of the cultivated multidrug resistant bacteria to the abovementioned antibiotics were recultivated on cca and preserved at 4 c until use further details are given in text s3 the initial concentration of 104 105 cfu 100 ml was selected to be relevant to the concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewaters pepper et al 2018 2 5 inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chemical disinfectants experiments were conducted in 500 ml beaker under constant stirring at room temperature 25 1 c both bacterial inocula i e multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci were spiked in 300 ml of wastewater or 0 01 m phosphate buffer at a concentration of 104 105 cfu 100 ml and were allowed to mix for 10 min then a sample was taken and considered as the t 0 initial the experiments were initiated by adding the appropriate amount of disinfectant two samples were withdrawn at different exposure times i e 1 3 5 7 and 10 min for paa and 1 2 3 4 and 5 min for chlorine one sample was analysed for disinfectant concentration and the second sample was immediately quenched by 0 1 mm sodium thiosulfate and then analysed for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci to evaluate possible regrowth of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria selected paa disinfected samples were also analysed after their storage for 72 h in the absence of light at 25 1 c control experiments were performed using a mixture of h2o2 and acetic acid i e constituents of the paa solution as disinfectant in the absence of paa the concentrations of h2o2 and acetic acid were chosen to be relevant to their concentrations in the paa solution i e 13 8 mg l h2o2 and 6 0 mg l acetic acid for 3 0 mg l paa experiments were carried out in either duplicate or triplicate and the mean values with error bars are presented in figs 1 6 and figs s1 s7 the error bars illustrate the uncertainty of experimental replicates i e either the standard error of mean duplicates or the standard deviation triplicates confidence and prediction intervals of the models in figs 2 and 6 and figs s4 and s7 were calculated by sigmaplot software 2 6 analytical methods the colorimetric dipropyl p phenylenediamine dpd method was used to measure paa and chlorine campo et al 2020 manoli et al 2019 using the usepa approved supelco spectroquant chlorine test and a merck spectroquant pharo 100 spectrophotometer the membrane filtration method was used for the enumeration of the cultivable multidrug resistant bacteria novo and manaia 2010 details on bacteria enumeration and analytical methods followed for the characterization of the wastewater used in this study are given in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in wastewater initially the effect of paa concentration and exposure time on the simultaneous inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in wastewater at ph 7 5 was investigated to do this experiments were performed at different concentrations of paa i e 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l and the concentration of multidrug resistant bacteria was measured with time results are presented in fig 1 the higher concentration of paa resulted in higher inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria studied for example in 7 0 min the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli was 0 2 1 2 and 4 0 for paa concentration of 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l respectively fig 1a the same observation of increasing inactivation at an increased paa concentration was made in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci e g 0 8 1 2 and 3 5 log reduction for 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l paa respectively in 10 min of exposure time fig 1b for all cases the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria increased with increasing exposure time figs 1a and 1b it is noted that a possible role of the constituents of paa solution i e h2o2 and acetic acid in inactivating the multidrug resistant bacteria was explored by contacting additional experiments using both h2o2 and acetic acid in the absence of paa figs s1a and s1b show no inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by h2o2 acetic acid at the studied conditions the results of these experiments ruled out the role of h2o2 acetic acid indicating that the observed inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria is due to paa the concentration of paa was also measured with time during the disinfection experiments the decay of paa at different initial paa concentrations is shown in fig 1c for all the concentrations studied paa underwent an initial demand followed by first order kinetics the decay of paa was described by eq 1 haas and joffe 1994 manoli et al 2019 santoro et al 2015 1 c c 0 d e k 1 t where c0 and c are the concentrations of paa initially and at time t respectively mg l d is the initial demand mg l and k1 is a first order rate constant 1 min for each paa concentration the model parameters d and k eq 1 were fitted simultaneously using excel solver with the aim to minimize the difference between observed and predicted paa decay data the determined parameters are presented in table s2 significantly the model predicted well the concentration of paa at different exposure times r2 0 95 the good fit of the model to the data is important for the calculation of the multidrug resistant bacteria exposure to the disinfectant i e integral of the time dependent disinfectant concentration over time integral ct or ict in mg min l gujer and von gunten 2003 that being said the integral of eq 1 results in eq 2 santoro et al 2015 2 exposure ict c dt c 0 d e k 1 t dt c 0 d k 1 1 e k 1 t where exposure ict is a function of the initial concentration of chemical disinfectant c0 the initial demand d and the first order rate constant k1 to learn which parameter governs the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa results were interpreted using the concept of ict the ict was calculated by eq 2 using the data of table s2 corresponding to the area under the paa decay curves shown in fig 1c the data of log inactivation presented in figs 1a and 1b were plotted versus ict fig 2 interestingly the 3 different time based multidrug resistant e coli inactivation curves at 3 different concentrations of paa fig 1a were represented by a single inactivation curve in the ict domain fig 2a this phenomenon was consistent with the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci figs 1b and 2b this finding suggests that the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa is governed by ict the ict dependency observed herein was also seen for the inactivation of total and single drug resistant e coli by paa in water and wastewater campo et al 2020 this observation was also reported for other chemical disinfectants and microorganisms e g inactivation of murine norovirus and fecal coliforms by performic acid or ferrate maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 and enteric viruses by ozone or chlorine rachmadi et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 fig 2 shows that the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by paa had 2 regimes i e an initial resistance to paa followed by a faster inactivation for example no paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was observed at ict of 10 0 mg min l while an ict of 25 0 mg min l achieved 4 log reduction similar behavior was seen in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci i e no reduction at ict of 15 0 mg min l and 2 5 log reduction at ict of 25 0 mg min l fig 2b this phenomenon was also reported for the inactivation of total e coli enterococci and fecal coliforms by paa while no initial resistance of murine norovirus to paa was seen campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the case of another peracid disinfectant performic acid initial resistance was observed for total enterococci but not for total fecal coliforms and murine norovirus maffettone et al 2020 the aforementioned initial lag phase before disinfection occurs was also reported for the inactivation of microorganisms by ozone czekalski et al 2016 gujer and von gunten 2003 on the other hand no initial resistance to ferrate was reported during inactivation of murine norovirus and fecal coliforms in wastewater manoli et al 2020 to describe the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa a chick watson model in the ict domain was applied the ict based chick watson model was modified by the addition of a parameter m to describe initial resistance shoulder effects m 1 or tailing off effects m 1 at low ict values haas and joffe 1994 the microbial inactivation kinetic model used herein is given by eq 3 3 n n 0 e k ict m e k c 0 d k 1 1 e k 1 t m where n0 and n are the initial and at time t concentrations of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci cfu 100 ml and k is the ict based inactivation kinetic rate constant l mg min the inactivation model parameters k and m were fitted simultaneously by excel solver aiming at the minimization of the sum of standard error sse of the differences between observed experimental and model predicted inactivation data the determined k and m are given in table s3 importantly the inactivation kinetic model eq 3 coupled with eq 2 could predict reasonably well the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria r2 0 95 significantly the model used herein describes both regimes of inactivation i e initial resistance to paa which is indicated by an m higher than one shoulder effects followed by a fast inactivation interestingly the determined m was higher than one i e 3 988 and 2 402 for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively which is consistent with the observed initial resistance of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria to paa figs 2a and 2b and table s3 the good prediction of the microbial inactivation kinetic model allowed the calculation of model predicted ict requirements for 1 4 log reductions of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria in wastewater at ph 7 5 table 1 the results show clearly that the multidrug resistant e coli gram negative were more susceptible to paa than enterococci gram positive which is in agreement with the literature on the comparative ict based inactivation of total fecal coliforms gram negative and total enterococci by paa performic acid or ferrate maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 possibly due to the structural differences between gram positive and gram negative bacteria e g thick versus thin peptidoglycan layer and absence versus presence of an outer lipid membrane respectively for example to achieve a 3 log reduction ict of 23 4 mg min l and 32 7 mg min l is required by multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively this finding indicates that for example if a wwtp would operate at a paa ict of 24 0 mg min l to achieve a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli this would not guarantee the same reduction for multidrug resistant enterococci interestingly if an ict of 33 0 mg min l would be practiced for achieving a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci then a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli would also be achieved table 1 considering that disinfection is usually the last process in a wwtp and that the effluent of wwtp is discharged in surface waters that are possibly used for recreational activities e g swimming or is reused in agriculture e g crop irrigation the results of the present study may have practical implications in selecting a suitable multidrug resistant fecal indicator for paa disinfection to ensure environmental and public health protection it is worth noting that additional to cultivation methods other non cultured based methods are needed to understand the risk for antibiotic resistance in a more holistic way as most bacteria are unculturable because of physiological and metabolic factors or because are transiently injured by the disinfection process and because extracellular resistance genes and other mobile genetic elements may have an important role in the spread of resistance as well it is important to use methods like qpcr flow cytometry metagenetics and metagenomics to achieve a better evaluation of the disinfection processes di cesare et al 2020 turolla et al 2017 3 2 effect of water matrix to evaluate the effect of water matrix on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci experiments were also carried out in phosphate buffer at the same ph of wastewater 7 5 the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria with time and the paa decay in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater at paa concentration of 2 0 mg l and 3 0 mg l are presented in figs s2 and s3 respectively generally in the time domain higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater figs s2a s2b s3a and s3b however this might be attributed to the higher decay of paa in wastewater compared to phosphate buffer figs s2c and s3c e g at an initial paa concentration of 3 0 mg l the d and k1 in wastewater were determined as 0 261 mg l and 0 006 1 min respectively versus a d of 0 103 mg l and a k1 of 0 001 1 min in phosphate buffer table s2 to account for the decay of paa results were interpreted by the concept of ict the ict values were calculated using eq 2 interestingly for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the 2 different inactivation curves at 2 different concentrations of paa could be represented by a single ict based inactivation curve fig s4 this observation in phosphate buffer is consistent with what was observed in wastewater i e the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was governed by ict considering this and to account for the decay of paa the effect of water matrix was assessed in the ict domain the ict response curves in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci are presented in figs 3 a and 3b respectively the microbial inactivation kinetic model eq 3 predicted well the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria in phosphate buffer at ph 7 5 fig 3 and tables s3 interestingly similar initial resistance of multidrug resistant e coli to paa was observed in both phosphate buffer and wastewater i e almost no inactivation at ict of up to 10 0 mg min l fig 3a this was consistent with the initial resistance of multidrug resistant enterococci to paa which was similar in the 2 water matrices ict 15 0 mg min l fig 3b in both cases these shoulder effects or initial resistance were indicated by a determined m higher than unity table s3 the results suggest that the initial resistance of the examined multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci to paa is independent of the water matrix the fact that multidrug resistant enterococci exhibited higher initial resistance than e coli indicates that the shoulder effects depend on the physical and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial species interestingly the results obtained herein are in line with the literature where higher initial resistance to paa of total enterococci than fecal coliforms was reported maffettone et al 2020 in both water matrices the initial resistance was followed by a faster inactivation in the case of multidrug resistant e coli higher inactivation was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater for example at ict of 20 0 mg min l the log reduction of e coli increased from 1 6 in wastewater to 3 4 in phosphate buffer higher inactivation in phosphate buffer than wastewater was also observed in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci e g at ict of 30 0 mg min l the enterococci log reduction increased from 2 4 to 5 6 the higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater may be related to constituents of wastewater for example bacteria may be protected by suspended solids and or organic matter present in wastewater dunkin et al 2017 maffettone et al 2020 interestingly the wastewater used herein had very low concentration of total suspended solids i e 1 mg l table s1 considering this the lower inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria observed in wastewater compared to phosphate buffer seems to be due to the soluble constituents of wastewater although the effect of suspended solids on the inactivation of microbes by disinfectants in wastewater azimi et al 2012 gehr et al 2003 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 santoro et al 2015 and the influence of dissolved compounds on the decay of paa were reported earlier henao et al 2018 to the best of authors knowledge the present study is one of the first to report on the effect of soluble constituents of wastewater on the ict based inactivation of bacteria by paa in wastewater thus the results obtained by the present study may be useful to better understand the effect of water matrix on paa disinfection 3 3 effect of ph taking into account the increased interested in paa as a chemical disinfectant it is important to study its efficiency in a ph range relevant to wastewater treatment conditions to evaluate the effect of ph on the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria experiments were performed in 0 01 phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and the results were compared with phosphate buffer at ph 7 5 the decay of paa and the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa with time at ph 6 5 compared with ph 7 5 are presented in fig s5 for 2 0 mg l paa and fig s6 for 3 0 mg l paa significantly the ict dependency of the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 fig s7 is consistent with results obtained in wastewater figs 1 and 2 and phosphate buffer fig s4 at ph 7 5 the ict response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli by paa at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 are presented in fig 4 higher inactivation was observed at ph 6 5 than ph 7 5 for example to achieve a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli a paa ict of 16 0 mg min l and 19 0 mg min l was required for ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 respectively considering the rapid inactivation after the initial resistance to paa this may be significant if a wwtp would operate at a specific ict e g at ict of 20 0 mg min l the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli increased from 3 4 to 5 0 by decreasing the ph from 7 5 to 6 5 respectively this observation is in agreement with the redox potential e0 of paa which is higher at lower ph i e e0 acidic conditions 1 75 v versus standard hydrogen electrode she and e0 basic conditions 1 01 v versus she zhang et al 2018 using these two values the e0 of paa at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 was calculated as 1 41 v versus she and 1 35 v versus she respectively this difference in e0 may explain the difference in the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli at the studied ph interestingly no effect of the ph on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci was observed fig 4b the results indicate that the redox potential could not entirely explain the effect of ph on the paa disinfection efficiency considering the observations of this study other parameters such as the physical and biochemical characteristics of bacteria are also important in terms of paa inactivation efficiency at different ph conditions the effect of ph on the ict response curve for the inactivation of microorganisms by paa only rarely has been investigated interestingly the inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 by paa was reported to be similar at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 while higher paa inactivation of murine norovirus was seen at ph 6 5 compared with ph 7 5 dunkin et al 2019 3 4 comparison with chlorine to compare paa with the most commonly used chemical disinfectant experiments were also performed using chlorine under identical conditions to paa in wastewater at ph 7 5 and 2 0 mg l disinfectant the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and decay of chlorine with time in comparison with paa are presented in fig 5 the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by chlorine was faster than paa for example in 4 min over 4 log reduction of both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chlorine was observed compared to almost no inactivation in the case of paa figs 5a and 5b this was not due to the lower decay of chlorine than paa that would result in higher ict values interestingly chlorine decay was significantly higher than paa i e d of 1 506 mg l versus 0 157 mg l and k1 of 0 060 1 min versus 0 013 1 min for chlorine and paa respectively fig 5c and table s2 significantly the disinfectant decay model used herein eq 1 which includes an initial demand and first order kinetics could predict well the decay of chlorine fig 5c the higher decay of chlorine resulted in lower ict values than paa figs 2 and 6 the ict response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chlorine in wastewater are presented in figs 6a and 6b respectively the model predicted ict values to achieve 1 4 log reduction of the studied bacteria by the two chemical disinfectants are given in table 1 chlorine required around 20 times and 35 times lower ict values than paa for 4 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively table 1 the high efficiency of chlorine observed herein is in line with a log reduction 3 log of microorganisms such as antibiotic resistant e coli bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus at chlorine ict 1 0 mg min l which was reported in the literature destiani and templeton 2019 lim et al 2010 yoon et al 2017 on the other hand the high decay of chlorine implies reactions with wastewater constituents and hence a high potential for the formation of disinfection byproducts paa was more stable than chlorine in wastewater suggesting lower interaction with the wastewater matrix ragazzo et al 2020 this may be a driver for moving to environmentally friendly chemical disinfectants such as paa it is noted that in the cases where quenching of the disinfectant is required before discharging treated wastewater to surface waters to avoid violation of regulatory chemical residual limits and possible effects on the microbial community paa would be quenched to nontoxic decay products e g water oxygen and acetic acid however concerns related to the organic residuals of paa e g acetic acid and their possible role in microbial regrowth were discussed maffettone et al 2020 to address this the regrowth of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 72 h after paa disinfection was investigated importantly no regrowth of studied multidrug resistant bacteria after paa disinfection was observed table s4 this is particularly important for wastewater reuse applications where the effluent of wwtp which is the effluent of the disinfection reactor is either stored for few days or directly used in agriculture it should be noted that for regrowth studies additional analytical methods such as microscopic imaging or pcr technology may give interesting information regarding the possible presence of viable but not cultivable state where bacteria are viable but not cultivable after paa disinfection 4 conclusions this study made several interesting findings it was demonstrated that the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in wastewater and phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 is governed by ict the ict based inactivation kinetic model predicted well the reduction of both multidrug resistant bacteria by paa the model predicted ict requirements to achieve 1 4 log reduction of multidrug resistant bacteria showed that multidrug resistant enterococci requires higher paa ict than multidrug resistant e coli for the same log reduction this suggests that multidrug resistant enterococci may be a better indicator than multidrug resistant e coli to address antibiotic resistance by paa in wastewater soluble constituents of wastewater decreased the inactivation of both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci i e higher ict values were needed to achieve the same log reduction of bacteria in wastewater than phosphate buffer this may be related to a possible protection of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria by dissolved compounds in wastewater e g dissolved organic matter a lower ph of 6 5 enhanced the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli compared with ph 7 5 the high redox potential of paa at low ph is in line with this observation on the other hand no effect of the ph on the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci was seen suggesting that the redox potential of the disinfectant may not entirely explain the efficiency of the disinfection process chlorine exhibited higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and higher disinfectant decay than paa despite the higher efficiency of chlorine compared with paa the high decay of chlorine suggests the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts paa was significantly more stable than chlorine in the studied wastewater this may be the main driver for moving from chlorine to an alternative to chlorine disinfectant such as paa significantly no regrowth of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was observed after 72 h of paa disinfection the experimental results on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria at different water matrices and ph conditions along with the ict based inactivation kinetic modeling of the present study may be useful in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at inactivating multidrug resistant bacteria as well as in guiding current paa wastewater applications in terms of dosing and selecting a suitable antibiotic resistant fecal indicator it is worth noting that additional to antibiotic resistant bacteria that are measured by cultivation methods other biological contaminants such as non cultivable bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes and other mobile genetic elements may be investigated using dna based molecular

16778,the presence of antibiotic resistance in wastewater sparked a great interest in investigating the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by disinfecting agents in this study the inactivation kinetics of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by an emerging environmentally friendly disinfectant peracetic acid paa in wastewater and phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 were characterized it was demonstrated that the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria was governed by their exposure to paa i e integral of the paa concentration over time integral ct or ict both regimes of the paa inactivation of bacteria i e initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation were described well by an ict based chick watson inactivation kinetic model in wastewater at ph 7 5 the model predicted ict requirements showed that the multidrug resistant enterococci were less susceptible to paa than e coli e g to achieve a 3 log reduction an ict of 32 7 mg min l and 23 4 mg min l was needed respectively no regrowth of the studied bacteria was observed after 72 h from paa disinfection at 25 1 c soluble constituents of wastewater decreased the paa inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria i e higher inactivation was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater at the same ph of 7 5 in phosphate buffer a lower ph of 6 5 resulted in higher inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli compared with ph 7 5 but it did not affect the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci a comparison with the most commonly used chemical disinfectant chlorine showed higher inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by chlorine and higher chlorine decay than paa the results of the present study may have implications in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at controlling antibiotic resistance in terms of selecting a suitable fecal indicator and optimizing disinfectant dosing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid chlorine antibiotic resistance bacteria wastewater disinfection 1 introduction the struggle against human infectious diseases was and is a societal challenge worldwide despite the short lived relief with the discovery of antibiotics the emergence of new diseases and recurrence of diseases previously controlled pose a threat to the public health care system antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the principal human and animal health problems of the 21st century that threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections caused by bacteria protozoa viruses and fungi which are no longer susceptible to the common medicines used to treat them berendonk et al 2015 fatta kassinos et al 2020 prestinaci et al 2015 the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance is driven by a complex and multifaceted network which links the consumption and release of antimicrobial drugs with their exposure to bacteria durão et al 2018 karaolia et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps often bridge the anthropogenic activities and the environment for this reason wwtps are considered as one of the main routes for resistance dissemination caucci et al 2016 for example e coli exhibiting resistance to antibiotics were found in influents of wwtps worldwide at concentrations of 104 107 cfu 100 ml aslan et al 2018 hernández et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 zanotto et al 2016 insufficient or no disinfection of wastewater in wwtps may result in the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the effluents of wwtps łuczkiewicz et al 2010 watkinson et al 2007 for example the occurrence of antibiotic resistant e coli in effluents of wwtps at concentrations of 102 105 cfu 100 ml was reported korzeniewska et al 2013 korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 another fecal indicator enterococci exhibiting resistance to antibiotics was also detected in influents and effluents of wwtps at concentrations ranging from 102 to 104 cfu 100 ml and 102 103 cfu 100 ml respectively varela et al 2013 considering that the effluents of wwtps are either discharged to surface waters or reused for example in crop irrigation it is of utmost importance to inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater this study deals with disinfection of wastewater to address antibiotic resistance challenges chlorine is the most commonly used disinfecting agent in wwtps globally this is because of its low cost and its efficacy in inactivating bacteria e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci haas and engelbrecht 1980 hassaballah et al 2020 tyrrell et al 1995 and viruses e g norovirus adenovirus and enteroviruses cromeans et al 2010 lim et al 2010 page et al 2009 rachmadi et al 2020 in water and wastewater it is already known that chlorine can inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria effectively destiani and templeton 2019 huang et al 2011 phattarapattamawong et al 2021 yuan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 despite chlorine s advantages its limitations related to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts such as haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes led to an enormous interest in alternative to chlorine physical and chemical disinfection processes dong et al 2019 korshin et al 2002 liu et al 2020 that being said the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by ultraviolet uv irradiation guo et al 2013 mckinney and

investigated in this study the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria by an emerging chemical disinfectant peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh was studied in the last decades paa received great attention as an environmentally friendly wastewater disinfectant due to its negligible aquatic toxicity i e minimal formation of disinfection byproducts during paa disinfection of water and wastewater dell erba et al 2007 domínguez henao et al 2018 rossi et al 2007 santoro et al 2007 the unique disinfection properties of paa were shown for the inactivation of a wide range of bacteria and viruses including fecal indicators e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 antonelli et al 2006 dunkin et al 2017 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2019 recently the inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater by paa was also studied campo et al 2020 rizzo et al 2019 however previous studies either did not interpret the disinfection data based on the exposure to paa or focused on a single bacterial species e g e coli that were resistant to a single drug and no comparison with other antibiotic resistant fecal indicators in the domain of exposure was carried out to learn which multidrug resistant fecal bacteria are a suitable indicator for paa disinfection although e coli is one of the most commonly studied and well understood organism globally due to its adaptability ubiquity and ease of cultivation blount 2015 other fecal indicators such as enterococci which are frequent commensal members of the gut ecosystem of mammals and birds are opportunistic pathogens that cause millions of infections per annum byappanahalli et al 2012 for example enterococci may help predict human health risks from exposure to polluted recreational waters and hence can be used as a surrogate for waterborne pathogens byappanahalli et al 2012 significantly both the european union bathing water directive 2006 7 ec and the united states environmental protection agency ambient water quality criteria for bacteria epa440 5 84 002 recommended the monitoring of both e coli and enterococci for recreational waters due to the relationship between swimming related illnesses and the concentrations of e coli and enterococci in water mansilha et al 2009 importantly both e coli and enterococci have been suggested as potential indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment berendonk et al 2015 thus it is important to investigate the comparative exposure based inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci and e coli by paa in wastewater moreover the exposure based kinetics allow the elucidation of the effect of ph and water matrix on the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa as well as the direct comparison with conventional chlorine disinfection which have not been investigated previously according to the best of authors knowledge these are critical in understanding the potential of paa as a chemical disinfectant of water and wastewater this study characterizes the inactivation kinetics of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in phosphate buffer and urban wastewater at different ph conditions and compares paa with chlorine disinfection of wastewater under identical conditions the objectives of the present study were to i determine the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci as a function of paa concentration and exposure time in urban wastewater ii develop an exposure based chick watson inactivation model to describe and predict the reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci iii evaluate the effect of water matrix and ph on the exposure response curves for paa inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and iv compare paa with chlorine by performing experiments under identical conditions and calculating model predicted exposure requirements for 1 4 log reductions of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria by both disinfectants the simultaneous inactivation of the two multidrug resistant bacteria coupled with the exposure based microbial inactivation kinetic modeling may be useful in selecting a suitable fecal indicator for paa disinfection this may have practical implications in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at inactivating multidrug resistant bacteria 2 materials and methods 2

culture media and inoculum are given in text s2 2 3 water matrices urban wastewater final effluent was grab sampled from a membrane bioreactor mbr based wwtp located in nicosia cyprus the quality characteristics of the urban wastewater used in this study are presented in table s1 the use of the mbr effluent as the wastewater matrix for the experiments provided the advantage of a clarified wastewater with no indigenous multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 1 cfu 100 ml this allowed the spiking of wastewater with the desired concentration of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 4 5 log and hence provided real world wastewater conditions that were ideal for inactivation kinetics characterization moreover the absence of total suspended solids allowed the investigation of a possible effect of soluble constituents of wastewater on the inactivation of the studied bacteria table s1 the 0 01 m phosphate buffer was prepared by adding potassium dihydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate to ultrapure water to achieve the desired ph i e 6 5 or 7 5 to evaluate the effect of water matrix phosphate buffer was prepared at ph 7 5 which is the same ph with the wastewater used in this study table s1 to evaluate the effect of ph phosphate buffer was prepared at ph 6 5 which is included in the water treatment relevant ph range of 6 9 lee et al 2009 2 4 isolation and preparation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci inocula the e coli and enterococci bacteria were isolated from the influent collected at wwtp through the inoculation of 100 μl of sample on chromocult coliform agar cca and slanetz and bartley agar sba respectively which were spiked with the three antibiotics of interest i e ampicillin ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim at the concentrations mentioned in text s2 for their selective isolation followed by incubation at 44 c for 24 h for e coli and 37 c for 48 h for enterococci bacterial stocks of the cultivated multidrug resistant bacteria to the abovementioned antibiotics were recultivated on cca and preserved at 4 c until use further details are given in text s3 the initial concentration of 104 105 cfu 100 ml was selected to be relevant to the concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewaters pepper et al 2018 2 5 inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chemical disinfectants experiments were conducted in 500 ml beaker under constant stirring at room temperature 25 1 c both bacterial inocula i e multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci were spiked in 300 ml of wastewater or 0 01 m phosphate buffer at a concentration of 104 105 cfu 100 ml and were allowed to mix for 10 min then a sample was taken and considered as the t 0 initial the experiments were initiated by adding the appropriate amount of disinfectant two samples were withdrawn at different exposure times i e 1 3 5 7 and 10 min for paa and 1 2 3 4 and 5 min for chlorine one sample was analysed for disinfectant concentration and the second sample was immediately quenched by 0 1 mm sodium thiosulfate and then analysed for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci to evaluate possible regrowth of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria selected paa disinfected samples were also analysed after their storage for 72 h in the absence of light at 25 1 c control experiments were performed using a mixture of h2o2 and acetic acid i e constituents of the paa solution as disinfectant in the absence of paa the concentrations of h2o2 and acetic acid were chosen to be relevant to their concentrations in the paa solution i e 13 8 mg l h2o2 and 6 0 mg l acetic acid for 3 0 mg l paa experiments were carried out in either duplicate or triplicate and the mean values with error bars are presented in figs 1 6 and figs s1 s7 the error bars illustrate the uncertainty of experimental replicates i e either the standard error of mean duplicates or the standard deviation triplicates confidence and prediction intervals of the models in figs 2 and 6 and figs s4 and s7 were calculated by sigmaplot software 2 6 analytical methods the colorimetric dipropyl p phenylenediamine dpd method was used to measure paa and chlorine campo et al 2020 manoli et al 2019 using the usepa approved supelco spectroquant chlorine test and a merck spectroquant pharo 100 spectrophotometer the membrane filtration method was used for the enumeration of the cultivable multidrug resistant bacteria novo and manaia 2010 details on bacteria enumeration and analytical methods followed for the characterization of the wastewater used in this study are given in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in wastewater initially the effect of paa concentration and exposure time on the simultaneous inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in wastewater at ph 7 5 was investigated to do this experiments were performed at different concentrations of paa i e 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l and the concentration of multidrug resistant bacteria was measured with time results are presented in fig 1 the higher concentration of paa resulted in higher inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria studied for example in 7 0 min the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli was 0 2 1 2 and 4 0 for paa concentration of 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l respectively fig 1a the same observation of increasing inactivation at an increased paa concentration was made in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci e g 0 8 1 2 and 3 5 log reduction for 2 0 mg l 3 0 mg l and 4 0 mg l paa respectively in 10 min of exposure time fig 1b for all cases the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria increased with increasing exposure time figs 1a and 1b it is noted that a possible role of the constituents of paa solution i e h2o2 and acetic acid in inactivating the multidrug resistant bacteria was explored by contacting additional experiments using both h2o2 and acetic acid in the absence of paa figs s1a and s1b show no inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by h2o2 acetic acid at the studied conditions the results of these experiments ruled out the role of h2o2 acetic acid indicating that the observed inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria is due to paa the concentration of paa was also measured with time during the disinfection experiments the decay of paa at different initial paa concentrations is shown in fig 1c for all the concentrations studied paa underwent an initial demand followed by first order kinetics the decay of paa was described by eq 1 haas and joffe 1994 manoli et al 2019 santoro et al 2015 1 c c 0 d e k 1 t where c0 and c are the concentrations of paa initially and at time t respectively mg l d is the initial demand mg l and k1 is a first order rate constant 1 min for each paa concentration the model parameters d and k eq 1 were fitted simultaneously using excel solver with the aim to minimize the difference between observed and predicted paa decay data the determined parameters are presented in table s2 significantly the model predicted well the concentration of paa at different exposure times r2 0 95 the good fit of the model to the data is important for the calculation of the multidrug resistant bacteria exposure to the disinfectant i e integral of the time dependent disinfectant concentration over time integral ct or ict in mg min l gujer and von gunten 2003 that being said the integral of eq 1 results in eq 2 santoro et al 2015 2 exposure ict c dt c 0 d e k 1 t dt c 0 d k 1 1 e k 1 t where exposure ict is a function of the initial concentration of chemical disinfectant c0 the initial demand d and the first order rate constant k1 to learn which parameter governs the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa results were interpreted using the concept of ict the ict was calculated by eq 2 using the data of table s2 corresponding to the area under the paa decay curves shown in fig 1c the data of log inactivation presented in figs 1a and 1b were plotted versus ict fig 2 interestingly the 3 different time based multidrug resistant e coli inactivation curves at 3 different concentrations of paa fig 1a were represented by a single inactivation curve in the ict domain fig 2a this phenomenon was consistent with the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci figs 1b and 2b this finding suggests that the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa is governed by ict the ict dependency observed herein was also seen for the inactivation of total and single drug resistant e coli by paa in water and wastewater campo et al 2020 this observation was also reported for other chemical disinfectants and microorganisms e g inactivation of murine norovirus and fecal coliforms by performic acid or ferrate maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 and enteric viruses by ozone or chlorine rachmadi et al 2020 wolf et al 2018 fig 2 shows that the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by paa had 2 regimes i e an initial resistance to paa followed by a faster inactivation for example no paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was observed at ict of 10 0 mg min l while an ict of 25 0 mg min l achieved 4 log reduction similar behavior was seen in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci i e no reduction at ict of 15 0 mg min l and 2 5 log reduction at ict of 25 0 mg min l fig 2b this phenomenon was also reported for the inactivation of total e coli enterococci and fecal coliforms by paa while no initial resistance of murine norovirus to paa was seen campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in the case of another peracid disinfectant performic acid initial resistance was observed for total enterococci but not for total fecal coliforms and murine norovirus maffettone et al 2020 the aforementioned initial lag phase before disinfection occurs was also reported for the inactivation of microorganisms by ozone czekalski et al 2016 gujer and von gunten 2003 on the other hand no initial resistance to ferrate was reported during inactivation of murine norovirus and fecal coliforms in wastewater manoli et al 2020 to describe the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria by paa a chick watson model in the ict domain was applied the ict based chick watson model was modified by the addition of a parameter m to describe initial resistance shoulder effects m 1 or tailing off effects m 1 at low ict values haas and joffe 1994 the microbial inactivation kinetic model used herein is given by eq 3 3 n n 0 e k ict m e k c 0 d k 1 1 e k 1 t m where n0 and n are the initial and at time t concentrations of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci cfu 100 ml and k is the ict based inactivation kinetic rate constant l mg min the inactivation model parameters k and m were fitted simultaneously by excel solver aiming at the minimization of the sum of standard error sse of the differences between observed experimental and model predicted inactivation data the determined k and m are given in table s3 importantly the inactivation kinetic model eq 3 coupled with eq 2 could predict reasonably well the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria r2 0 95 significantly the model used herein describes both regimes of inactivation i e initial resistance to paa which is indicated by an m higher than one shoulder effects followed by a fast inactivation interestingly the determined m was higher than one i e 3 988 and 2 402 for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively which is consistent with the observed initial resistance of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria to paa figs 2a and 2b and table s3 the good prediction of the microbial inactivation kinetic model allowed the calculation of model predicted ict requirements for 1 4 log reductions of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria in wastewater at ph 7 5 table 1 the results show clearly that the multidrug resistant e coli gram negative were more susceptible to paa than enterococci gram positive which is in agreement with the literature on the comparative ict based inactivation of total fecal coliforms gram negative and total enterococci by paa performic acid or ferrate maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 possibly due to the structural differences between gram positive and gram negative bacteria e g thick versus thin peptidoglycan layer and absence versus presence of an outer lipid membrane respectively for example to achieve a 3 log reduction ict of 23 4 mg min l and 32 7 mg min l is required by multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively this finding indicates that for example if a wwtp would operate at a paa ict of 24 0 mg min l to achieve a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli this would not guarantee the same reduction for multidrug resistant enterococci interestingly if an ict of 33 0 mg min l would be practiced for achieving a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci then a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli would also be achieved table 1 considering that disinfection is usually the last process in a wwtp and that the effluent of wwtp is discharged in surface waters that are possibly used for recreational activities e g swimming or is reused in agriculture e g crop irrigation the results of the present study may have practical implications in selecting a suitable multidrug resistant fecal indicator for paa disinfection to ensure environmental and public health protection it is worth noting that additional to cultivation methods other non cultured based methods are needed to understand the risk for antibiotic resistance in a more holistic way as most bacteria are unculturable because of physiological and metabolic factors or because are transiently injured by the disinfection process and because extracellular resistance genes and other mobile genetic elements may have an important role in the spread of resistance as well it is important to use methods like qpcr flow cytometry metagenetics and metagenomics to achieve a better evaluation of the disinfection processes di cesare et al 2020 turolla et al 2017 3 2 effect of water matrix to evaluate the effect of water matrix on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci experiments were also carried out in phosphate buffer at the same ph of wastewater 7 5 the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria with time and the paa decay in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater at paa concentration of 2 0 mg l and 3 0 mg l are presented in figs s2 and s3 respectively generally in the time domain higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater figs s2a s2b s3a and s3b however this might be attributed to the higher decay of paa in wastewater compared to phosphate buffer figs s2c and s3c e g at an initial paa concentration of 3 0 mg l the d and k1 in wastewater were determined as 0 261 mg l and 0 006 1 min respectively versus a d of 0 103 mg l and a k1 of 0 001 1 min in phosphate buffer table s2 to account for the decay of paa results were interpreted by the concept of ict the ict values were calculated using eq 2 interestingly for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the 2 different inactivation curves at 2 different concentrations of paa could be represented by a single ict based inactivation curve fig s4 this observation in phosphate buffer is consistent with what was observed in wastewater i e the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was governed by ict considering this and to account for the decay of paa the effect of water matrix was assessed in the ict domain the ict response curves in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci are presented in figs 3 a and 3b respectively the microbial inactivation kinetic model eq 3 predicted well the inactivation of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria in phosphate buffer at ph 7 5 fig 3 and tables s3 interestingly similar initial resistance of multidrug resistant e coli to paa was observed in both phosphate buffer and wastewater i e almost no inactivation at ict of up to 10 0 mg min l fig 3a this was consistent with the initial resistance of multidrug resistant enterococci to paa which was similar in the 2 water matrices ict 15 0 mg min l fig 3b in both cases these shoulder effects or initial resistance were indicated by a determined m higher than unity table s3 the results suggest that the initial resistance of the examined multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci to paa is independent of the water matrix the fact that multidrug resistant enterococci exhibited higher initial resistance than e coli indicates that the shoulder effects depend on the physical and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial species interestingly the results obtained herein are in line with the literature where higher initial resistance to paa of total enterococci than fecal coliforms was reported maffettone et al 2020 in both water matrices the initial resistance was followed by a faster inactivation in the case of multidrug resistant e coli higher inactivation was observed in phosphate buffer than wastewater for example at ict of 20 0 mg min l the log reduction of e coli increased from 1 6 in wastewater to 3 4 in phosphate buffer higher inactivation in phosphate buffer than wastewater was also observed in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci e g at ict of 30 0 mg min l the enterococci log reduction increased from 2 4 to 5 6 the higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria in phosphate buffer compared to wastewater may be related to constituents of wastewater for example bacteria may be protected by suspended solids and or organic matter present in wastewater dunkin et al 2017 maffettone et al 2020 interestingly the wastewater used herein had very low concentration of total suspended solids i e 1 mg l table s1 considering this the lower inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria observed in wastewater compared to phosphate buffer seems to be due to the soluble constituents of wastewater although the effect of suspended solids on the inactivation of microbes by disinfectants in wastewater azimi et al 2012 gehr et al 2003 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 santoro et al 2015 and the influence of dissolved compounds on the decay of paa were reported earlier henao et al 2018 to the best of authors knowledge the present study is one of the first to report on the effect of soluble constituents of wastewater on the ict based inactivation of bacteria by paa in wastewater thus the results obtained by the present study may be useful to better understand the effect of water matrix on paa disinfection 3 3 effect of ph taking into account the increased interested in paa as a chemical disinfectant it is important to study its efficiency in a ph range relevant to wastewater treatment conditions to evaluate the effect of ph on the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria experiments were performed in 0 01 phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and the results were compared with phosphate buffer at ph 7 5 the decay of paa and the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa with time at ph 6 5 compared with ph 7 5 are presented in fig s5 for 2 0 mg l paa and fig s6 for 3 0 mg l paa significantly the ict dependency of the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 fig s7 is consistent with results obtained in wastewater figs 1 and 2 and phosphate buffer fig s4 at ph 7 5 the ict response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli by paa at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 are presented in fig 4 higher inactivation was observed at ph 6 5 than ph 7 5 for example to achieve a 3 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli a paa ict of 16 0 mg min l and 19 0 mg min l was required for ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 respectively considering the rapid inactivation after the initial resistance to paa this may be significant if a wwtp would operate at a specific ict e g at ict of 20 0 mg min l the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli increased from 3 4 to 5 0 by decreasing the ph from 7 5 to 6 5 respectively this observation is in agreement with the redox potential e0 of paa which is higher at lower ph i e e0 acidic conditions 1 75 v versus standard hydrogen electrode she and e0 basic conditions 1 01 v versus she zhang et al 2018 using these two values the e0 of paa at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 was calculated as 1 41 v versus she and 1 35 v versus she respectively this difference in e0 may explain the difference in the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli at the studied ph interestingly no effect of the ph on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci was observed fig 4b the results indicate that the redox potential could not entirely explain the effect of ph on the paa disinfection efficiency considering the observations of this study other parameters such as the physical and biochemical characteristics of bacteria are also important in terms of paa inactivation efficiency at different ph conditions the effect of ph on the ict response curve for the inactivation of microorganisms by paa only rarely has been investigated interestingly the inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 by paa was reported to be similar at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 while higher paa inactivation of murine norovirus was seen at ph 6 5 compared with ph 7 5 dunkin et al 2019 3 4 comparison with chlorine to compare paa with the most commonly used chemical disinfectant experiments were also performed using chlorine under identical conditions to paa in wastewater at ph 7 5 and 2 0 mg l disinfectant the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and decay of chlorine with time in comparison with paa are presented in fig 5 the inactivation of both multidrug resistant bacteria by chlorine was faster than paa for example in 4 min over 4 log reduction of both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chlorine was observed compared to almost no inactivation in the case of paa figs 5a and 5b this was not due to the lower decay of chlorine than paa that would result in higher ict values interestingly chlorine decay was significantly higher than paa i e d of 1 506 mg l versus 0 157 mg l and k1 of 0 060 1 min versus 0 013 1 min for chlorine and paa respectively fig 5c and table s2 significantly the disinfectant decay model used herein eq 1 which includes an initial demand and first order kinetics could predict well the decay of chlorine fig 5c the higher decay of chlorine resulted in lower ict values than paa figs 2 and 6 the ict response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by chlorine in wastewater are presented in figs 6a and 6b respectively the model predicted ict values to achieve 1 4 log reduction of the studied bacteria by the two chemical disinfectants are given in table 1 chlorine required around 20 times and 35 times lower ict values than paa for 4 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively table 1 the high efficiency of chlorine observed herein is in line with a log reduction 3 log of microorganisms such as antibiotic resistant e coli bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus at chlorine ict 1 0 mg min l which was reported in the literature destiani and templeton 2019 lim et al 2010 yoon et al 2017 on the other hand the high decay of chlorine implies reactions with wastewater constituents and hence a high potential for the formation of disinfection byproducts paa was more stable than chlorine in wastewater suggesting lower interaction with the wastewater matrix ragazzo et al 2020 this may be a driver for moving to environmentally friendly chemical disinfectants such as paa it is noted that in the cases where quenching of the disinfectant is required before discharging treated wastewater to surface waters to avoid violation of regulatory chemical residual limits and possible effects on the microbial community paa would be quenched to nontoxic decay products e g water oxygen and acetic acid however concerns related to the organic residuals of paa e g acetic acid and their possible role in microbial regrowth were discussed maffettone et al 2020 to address this the regrowth of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci 72 h after paa disinfection was investigated importantly no regrowth of studied multidrug resistant bacteria after paa disinfection was observed table s4 this is particularly important for wastewater reuse applications where the effluent of wwtp which is the effluent of the disinfection reactor is either stored for few days or directly used in agriculture it should be noted that for regrowth studies additional analytical methods such as microscopic imaging or pcr technology may give interesting information regarding the possible presence of viable but not cultivable state where bacteria are viable but not cultivable after paa disinfection 4 conclusions this study made several interesting findings it was demonstrated that the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci by paa in wastewater and phosphate buffer at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 is governed by ict the ict based inactivation kinetic model predicted well the reduction of both multidrug resistant bacteria by paa the model predicted ict requirements to achieve 1 4 log reduction of multidrug resistant bacteria showed that multidrug resistant enterococci requires higher paa ict than multidrug resistant e coli for the same log reduction this suggests that multidrug resistant enterococci may be a better indicator than multidrug resistant e coli to address antibiotic resistance by paa in wastewater soluble constituents of wastewater decreased the inactivation of both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci i e higher ict values were needed to achieve the same log reduction of bacteria in wastewater than phosphate buffer this may be related to a possible protection of the studied multidrug resistant bacteria by dissolved compounds in wastewater e g dissolved organic matter a lower ph of 6 5 enhanced the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli compared with ph 7 5 the high redox potential of paa at low ph is in line with this observation on the other hand no effect of the ph on the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci was seen suggesting that the redox potential of the disinfectant may not entirely explain the efficiency of the disinfection process chlorine exhibited higher inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and higher disinfectant decay than paa despite the higher efficiency of chlorine compared with paa the high decay of chlorine suggests the formation of potentially toxic disinfection byproducts paa was significantly more stable than chlorine in the studied wastewater this may be the main driver for moving from chlorine to an alternative to chlorine disinfectant such as paa significantly no regrowth of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was observed after 72 h of paa disinfection the experimental results on the paa inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria at different water matrices and ph conditions along with the ict based inactivation kinetic modeling of the present study may be useful in designing a paa disinfection process aiming at inactivating multidrug resistant bacteria as well as in guiding current paa wastewater applications in terms of dosing and selecting a suitable antibiotic resistant fecal indicator it is worth noting that additional to antibiotic resistant bacteria that are measured by cultivation methods other biological contaminants such as non cultivable bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes and other mobile genetic elements may be investigated using dna based molecular

16779,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas adsorb at air water interfaces during transport in unsaturated porous media this can cause surfactant induced flow and enhanced retention that is a function of concentration which complicates characterization and modeling of pfas transport under unsaturated conditions the influence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption awia on pfas transport was investigated with a series of miscible displacement transport experiments conducted with a several log range in input concentrations perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx were used as model pfas the results were interpreted in terms of critical reference concentrations associated with pfas surface activities and their relationship to the relevancy of transport processes such as surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia for concentration ranges of interest analysis of the measured transport behavior of pfas under unsaturated flow conditions demonstrated that awia was linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration this includes the absence of significant arrival front self sharpening and extended elution tailing of the breakthrough curves as well as the similarity of retardation factors measured for a wide range of input concentrations independently predicted simulations produced with a comprehensive flow and transport model that accounts for transient variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited awia provided excellent predictions of the measured transport a series of simulations was conducted with the model to test the specific impact of various processes potentially influencing pfos transport the simulation results showed that surfactant induced flow was negligible and that awia was effectively linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration pfas retention associated with awia can be considered to be ideal in such cases thereby supporting the use of simplified mathematical models conversely apparent nonideal transport behavior was observed for experiments conducted with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfos pfoa transport adsorption per and polyfluoroalkyl substances 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas have been identified as emerging contaminants of critical concern due to their ubiquitous presence recalcitrance and potential ecological and human health impacts it is now clearly established that soil serves as a long term source for many sites contaminated by per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas this has been demonstrated by field sampling surveys and mathematical modeling studies e g washington et al 2010 shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 rankin et al 2016 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 washington et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a guo et al 2020 hence there is great interest in the transport behavior of pfas in the vadose zone which can be considerably more complex than in groundwater one primary source of complexity is that flow and transport occur under water unsaturated conditions this condition introduces two important processes that can impact the transport of pfas in the vadose zone both processes are associated with the accumulation or adsorption of pfas at air water interfaces created under unsaturated conditions first adsorption of surfactants and other matter at the air water interface can alter surface tensions which can affect capillary pressure and in turn impact water flow i e surfactant induced flow depending upon extant conditions concomitantly the changes in water flow will impact the advective dispersive transport of solute in addition the change in the local water saturation caused by surfactant induced flow causes a change in the magnitude of air water interfacial area which will impact the magnitude of solute retained by adsorption at the air water interface thus surfactant induced flow can have multiple impacts on the retention and transport of surfactants this has been demonstrated through laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling for both hydrocarbon surfactants e g mingorance et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2012 karagunduz et al 2015 costanza robinson and henry 2017 el ouni et al 2021 and pfas e g brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 second adsorption at the air water interface provides a source of retention that can significantly impact pfas transport depending on a number of factors the impact of air water interfacial adsorption on pfas transport in unsaturated porous media has been demonstrated in several studies employing miscible displacement experiments lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a 2020b brusseau 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 li et al 2021 the potential importance of air water interfacial adsorption for pfas transport has also been indicated in a number of theoretical brusseau 2018 brusseau 2019a constanza et al 2019 silva et al 2019 and mathematical modeling brusseau et al 2019b brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 studies the transport of pfas undergoing air water interfacial adsorption awia is complicated by the nonlinearity of the process wherein the effective awia coefficient is a function of aqueous concentration a key aspect with regard to characterizing and simulating the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media is the extent to which surfactant induced flow and the nonlinearity of awia impact transport under relevant conditions and for concentration ranges of interest the question of the nonlinearity of pfas awia has been the focus of recent research and discussion brusseau 2018 2019b 2021 lyu et al 2018 schaefer et al 2019 2020 arshadi et al 2020 for example brusseau and colleagues have investigated the concentration dependency of awia coefficients kia using both transport measured and directly measured adsorption data lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2021 another example relates to discussions of the representativeness of langmuir versus freundlich isotherms for characterizing awia of pfas schaefer et al 2019 2020 arshadi et al 2020 the impact of surfactant induced flow on pfas transport has just begun to receive attention brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 the occurrence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia have significant consequences for pfas transport both for characterizing magnitudes of retention and for the complexity of mathematical models required for simulating transport therefore it is a critical question to address this study is the first to systematically examine the issue with a combination of transport experiments and mathematical modeling the objective of this research is to investigate the influence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia on pfas transport miscible displacement transport experiments are conducted at different input concentrations to provide direct experimental observations of pfos and pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions the input concentrations span several orders of magnitude representing the largest range of concentrations employed to date in a transport study a comprehensive flow and transport model guo et al 2020 that accounts for nonsteady flow surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited awia is used to produce independently predicted simulations of the measured data a second mathematical model brusseau 2020 that does not consider surfactant induced flow and for which simulations are conducted with awia treated as linear and instantaneous is used to test the robustness of a simplified modeling approach the results are interpreted in terms of critical reference concentrations associated with pfas surface activities and their relationship to the relevancy of transport processes such as nonlinear awia and surfactant induced flow for concentration ranges of interest 2 materials and methods surface tensions were measured to characterize surface activities and to determine critical reference concentrations of the pfas measurement and data analysis methods are presented in the supporting information si file miscible displacement transport experiments were conducted with pfos and pfoa the same input concentrations were used for the pfos and pfoa experiments 0 1 1 and 10 mg l additional experiments were conducted with pfoa using two lower concentrations of 1 and 10 μg l the experiments were conducted using a 0 35 mm diameter natural quartz sand an electrolyte solution comprised of 0 01 m nacl was used for all experiments the sand and electrolyte were selected to be consistent with materials used in prior pfas transport experiments numerous measurements of air water interfacial area have been reported for this medium araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2015 el ouni et al 2021 brusseau 2021 nonreactive tracer tests were conducted to characterize the hydrodynamic conditions of the packed columns transport experiments were conducted under saturated flow conditions to characterize solid phase sorption experiments were then conducted under steady unsaturated flow conditions to characterize the impact of awia on retention and transport all experiments except one were conducted with a water saturation of 0 68 the methods used for the miscible displacement experiments are the same as those used in our prior pfas transport studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a yan et al 2020 additional information about the experiment methods is provided in the si effluent samples were collected continuously for the miscible displacement experiments using a fraction collector the samples were weighed to quantify effluent solution discharge and then subject to chemical analysis to determine concentrations the pfas samples were analyzed by two methods samples for all experiments except those for pfos with input concentration of 10 mg l were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry the samples for pfos experiments conducted with an input concentration of 10 mg l were analyzed by methylene blue active substances assay details of the chemical analysis methods are provided in the si file breakthrough curves were measured for each miscible displacement experiment the effluent volumetric discharge was divided by the resident water volume of the packed column to obtain pore volumes nondimensional time the effluent concentrations were divided by the input concentration to obtain relative concentrations measured retardation factors were determined for each breakthrough curve by the standard methods of calculating the area above the breakthrough curve frontal analysis and temporal moment analysis these methods have been demonstrated to be robust for pfas applications brusseau et al 2019b van glubt et al 2021 the measured data generated in the present study for pfoa transport are combined with the results of our prior studies lyu et al 2018 lyu and brusseau 2020 a data set for genx transport reported in yan et al 2020 is also used for comparison the same sand and experiment methods were used for all studies data have been measured for pfos pfoa and genx sorption by the sand in our prior studies yan et al 2020 van glubt et al 2021 in addition a data set for pfoa transport in a similar sand reported recently by other researchers is used for comparison li et al 2021 the li et al study examined pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions water saturation of 0 64 for two sets of ionic compositions nacl and cacl2 with three ionic strengths for each 0 0015 0 01 and 0 03 m the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of

were employed for this study the first is a one dimensional numerical model that couples transient variably saturated flow and advective and dispersive transport guo et al 2020 the model accounts for surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption the second model does not incorporate transient or surfactant induced flow but does account for nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption brusseau 2020 the equations and solutions used for both models are reported in the respective citations both models are used in a predictive mode with values for all input variables determined independently the sources of the input values are discussed in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface tensions and critical reference concentrations the surface tensions of pfos pfoa and genx as a function of aqueous concentration are presented in figure si 1 the surface activities are a function of chain length as expected and as demonstrated in numerous prior studies good replication is obtained for pfos with a 95 measurement uncertainty of 14 for kia these data are used to determine γ c and kia functions for use in the mathematical modeling for comparison maximum kia values of 0 027 0 0037 and 0 001 cm are calculated for pfos pfoa and genx respectively the differences in the magnitudes of the values reflect the differences in surface activity the concept of critical reference concentrations and how they can be used to evaluate the potential for specific processes to influence pfas transport was recently introduced brusseau 2019b 2021 brusseau and van glubt 2021 in terms of surface tension data the critical reference concentration is determined from the inflection point of the surface tension curves the respective concentrations are approximately 1 10 and 30 mg l for pfos pfoa and genx based on the concentrations at which the surface tensions are reduced by 2 5 brusseau and van glubt 2021 kia values determined from surface tension data would represent essentially maximum values for target concentrations below these critical reference concentrations brusseau 2019b 2021 as such awia is anticipated to be effectively linear for pfas transport at such concentrations the nonlinearity of awia under transport conditions will be investigated in the following sections by examining the measured and simulated pfas transport behavior observed for the miscible displacement experiments 3 2 measured transport data the transport of the nonreactive tracer under unsaturated flow conditions was observed to be relatively ideal data not shown consistent with our prior studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a yan et al 2020 representative breakthrough curves measured for transport of pfoa pfos and genx in columns packed with unsaturated sand are presented in fig s 1 4 and si 3 5 the magnitude of retention is greater under unsaturated flow conditions compared to saturated conditions data not shown due to the impact of awia the effluent recoveries for the experiments averaged 99 4 4 3 95 confidence interval the kia values determined from the retardation factors measured by moment analysis of the breakthrough curves are similar to the values determined from the surface tension data this is consistent with our prior studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2021 3 3 validation of independently determined input parameters it is well established that conducting independent predictions is the most robust means by which to employ mathematical modeling to analyze measured transport data and characterize relevant processes this approach is used in the present study the first step in this procedure is to obtain values for all relevant input parameters inspection of equation 1 reveals that several retention related parameters need to be determined a priori to produce independently predicted simulations of transport two critical parameters for pfas retention under unsaturated flow conditions are the air water interfacial area and the awia coefficient a priori parameterization of these two variables is likely to pose the greatest difficulty for most modeling analyses of pfas retention and transport under unsaturated flow conditions the validity of the values used for these two critical parameters in the mathematical modeling will be examined in this subsection an independently predicted simulation produced with the guo et al 2020 model will be compared to measured transport data for a pfoa transport experiment conducted at sufficiently low input concentration such that transport is ideal hence the evaluation of parameter value validity will not be conflated by potential impacts of nonideal factors such as surfactant induced flow the transport data sets presented in this study were all obtained for experiments conducted with a 0 35 mm diameter commercial natural quartz sand it is quite possible that more interfacial area measurements have been reported for this medium than for any other brusseau 2021 aggregated the published measurements and showed that there was good consistency of measured values obtained by different research groups with various interfacial tracer methods our previously reported measured aia data sets araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2015 2020b were consolidated and used to develop an aia sw function that can be employed to determine aia for any given sw for the sand jiang et al 2020 guo et al 2020 brusseau 2021 determined a measurement uncertainty of 10 for the data this function was used to determine aia values for the simulations presented herein an et al 1996 used neutron reflectometry to directly measure the adsorption of pfoa at the air water interface in 0 01 m nacl solution neutron reflectometry is an advanced high resolution method for characterizing and quantifying soft matter interfaces hence it represents a robust means by which to directly measure surfactant adsorption at interfaces the directly measured adsorption data reported by an et al were used by brusseau 2021 to determine corresponding directly measured kia values for pfoa notably a maximum value of 0 0032 cm was measured these data provide a robust source of kia values for pfoa that is independent of the standard approach of using surface tension data and will be used for the following independent prediction the measured breakthrough curve for pfoa transport in the sand under unsaturated conditions is presented in fig 1 air water interfacial adsorption is responsible for the majority 81 of pfoa retention these data were obtained with an input concentration of 10 μg l this concentration is three orders of magnitude below the critical reference concentration of pfoa accompanying simulations demonstrated the absence of surfactant induced flow for this experiment which is consistent with the small change in surface tension measured for pfoa in this concentration range figure si 1 it is observed that the independently predicted simulation produced with the model of guo et al 2020 provides an excellent match to the measured data the fact that the independent prediction accurately simulates the measured data indicates that the model appropriately captures the relevant transport processes it also demonstrates that the input parameter values employed are robust and representative of the transport system this includes the values used for aia and kia in particular given that the kia was obtained from a high resolution direct measurement these results validate the robustness of the measured values used for aia 3 4 pfas transport for input concentrations below the critical reference concentration with the parameterization of kia and aia values determined to be robust the influence of input concentration on pfas transport can be investigated via comparison of measured and simulated data sets the measured breakthrough curves for pfos transport under unsaturated flow conditions with an input concentration of 0 1 mg l are presented in fig 2 note that this concentration is one order of magnitude lower than the critical reference concentration of 1 mg l good correspondence is observed for the two measured data sets the full breakthrough curve is observed to be relatively symmetrical pfos transport experiences a relatively large magnitude of retention with an equivalent retardation factor of 10 5 air water interfacial adsorption is responsible for the majority 83 of pfos retention the independently predicted simulation produced with the comprehensive model of guo et al 2020 provides an excellent match to the measured data fig 2 it is important to note again that this simulation was produced without calibration or fitting to the measured data wherein all input parameters were obtained independently this demonstrates that the model accurately represents the relevant processes influencing pfos transport as well as indicating that the parameter values used were robust a series of simulations was conducted to test the specific impact of the various processes potentially influencing pfos transport simulations produced with and without surfactant induced flow are essentially identical indicating negligible impact for this system figs 2 and si 2 inspection of figure si 1 shows that the surface tension for pfos changes minimally for concentrations below 0 1 mg l the input concentration employed for the experiment this explains the absence of surfactant induced flow for this experiment this result is consistent with prior simulations of pfas transport brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 sorption of pfos by the sand is nonlinear and rate limited as demonstrated in our prior experiments conducted under saturated flow conditions van glubt et al 2021 however the simulations demonstrate that nonlinear sorption has a negligible impact and that rate limited sorption has minimal impact for pfos transport under unsaturated conditions figure si 2 this is because solid phase sorption provides a relatively small contribution 17 to total retention simulations treating awia as rate limited versus instantaneous are coincident indicating that mass transfer to and from the air water interface is rapid with respect to the residence time for the miscible displacement experiments this is consistent with the results of a prior study brusseau 2020 the simulation produced with awia treated as linear a fixed kia is essentially identical to the simulation accounting for nonlinearity fig 2 this indicates that awia is effectively linear for the conditions of the experiment this is consistent with the measured and simulated breakthrough curves not exhibiting appreciable self sharpening of the arrival front or extended concentration tailing for the elution front both of which are hallmarks of transport influenced by nonlinear adsorption as discussed above the critical reference concentration for pfos is 1 mg l below which the surface tension measured kia is essentially constant hence the observed behavior of the measured transport data the results of the mathematical modeling and the characterization of surface activity via the surface tension data are all consistent similar series of simulations were conducted for pfoa and genx transport in the sand results not shown this includes the transport of pfoa for an input concentration of 1 mg l which is ten times below pfoa s critical reference concentration and the transport of genx for an input concentration of 10 mg l that is 3 times lower than its critical reference concentration surfactant induced flow was negligible and awia exhibited minimal nonlinearity for both cases this is consistent with the prior simulations of pfos transport in total these results demonstrate that surfactant induced flow is not relevant and that awia can be treated as effectively linear for pfas transport when concentrations are approximately a factor of 3 10 below the critical reference concentration 3 5 simulating pfas transport with a simplified mathematical model the independently predicted simulation produced with the multi process mass transfer model of brusseau 2020 is observed to provide an excellent match to the measured pfos transport data fig 2 notably this model does not incorporate surfactant induced flow in addition awia is treated as linear and instantaneous for the simulation the performance of the model was further tested by applying it to multiple additional data sets the first is a data set for pfoa transport in the sand with an input concentration of 1 mg l note that this concentration is 10 times higher than the concentration used for the prior pfos experiment but is 10 times below the pfoa critical reference concentration the measured and simulated breakthrough curves are presented in figure si 3 the model produces a good prediction of the measured data with no representation of surfactant induced flow and with awia treated as linear and instantaneous independent predictions produced with the model also provided excellent simulations of measured pfoa transport data for experiments conducted with lower input concentrations of 1 10 and 100 μg l figs 3 4 and si 4 respectively another data set is for genx transport in the sand with an input concentration of 10 mg l this is three times lower than the critical reference concentration of 30 mg l similar to the pfos and pfoa data sets the simplified model provides a very good prediction of the measured data without accounting for surfactant induced flow or nonlinear rate limited awia figure si 3 in total the simplified model was used successfully to independently predict pfas transport for six experiments comprising three pfas and a range of input concentrations the ability of the model to accurately predict the measured data indicates that simpler mathematical models can be employed to simulate pfos transport under appropriate conditions specifically surfactant induced flow can be ignored and awia can be treated as linear when the relevant concentration range is sufficiently below the critical reference concentration 3 6 linearity of air water interfacial adsorption the results of the several individual transport experiments and simulations presented in the preceding sections demonstrate that awia is effectively linear for concentrations sufficiently below the critical reference concentration the linearity of awia can also be investigated directly by comparing the magnitudes of measured retardation factors as a function of the respective input concentrations used for the combined set of transport experiments inspection of equation 1 shows that when awia is linear i e constant kia retardation factors incorporating only awia should be constant for experiments conducted at different input concentrations when the same porous medium and water contents are used i e aia is constant in the present case the retardation factor is anticipated to increase slightly for lower concentrations due to the impact of nonlinear solid phase sorption a plot of retardation factors versus the input concentrations used for the pfoa experiments is presented in fig 5 the comparison of r values as a function of concentration requires no specification of individual parameter values such as kia or aia and thus is not subject to any sort of parameter determination uncertainty thus it represents a direct and definitive assessment of the nonlinearity of awia under transport conditions the magnitudes of the measured retardation factors increase minimally over the four order of magnitude range in concentrations the small increase is due to the impact of nonlinear solid phase sorption the essentially constant retardation factors measured for pfoa over a several log change in concentration is another confirmation of the linearity of awia below the critical reference concentration 3 7 relevancy of kia measurement methods given that the values used for aia have been validated for the present system the representativeness of other sources of kia values can be investigated the standard means by which to determine kia values is by application of the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data brusseau 2021 analyzed the results of 10 individual sets of surface tension measurements for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl solution and determined a mean kia of 0 0032 cm for a concentration of 10 μg l the kia of 0 0037 cm determined from the pfoa surface tension data presented in figure si 1 is very similar to this mean value in addition the mean value is identical to the directly measured value hence the predicted simulation obtained with the surface tension determined kia is identical to the simulation employing the directly measured value thereby producing an excellent match to the measured data fig 4 this consistency is observed for all of the other pfoa data sets see figs 3 si 4 and si 5 in addition excellent matches are also obtained using surface tension kia values for predicted simulations of pfos fig 2 and genx figure si 3 these results demonstrate that kia values determined from surface tension data are appropriate for representing pfas awia during transport in unsaturated media this is consistent with the results of prior comparisons of transport measured and surface tension determined values lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2021 as noted in the introduction the freundlich isotherm has been proposed as an alternative method to estimate kia values for pfas adsorption at air water interfaces with this approach kia does not attain an upper limiting value at lower concentrations rather the magnitude of kia increases continuously as concentration decreases for example application of the freundlich isotherm estimation produces a kia value for pfoa that is 34 times larger than the values determined from neutron reflectometry and surface tension for an input concentration of 1 μg l as a result the simulated breakthrough curve for pfoa transport with the freundlich isotherm kia exhibits much greater retardation than the measured data fig 3 with respective freundlich and measured r values of 41 and 3 9 similar results are obtained for pfoa transport at the input concentrations of 10 μg l fig 4 100 μg l figure si 4 and 1 mg l figure si 5 in order for the freundlich predicted retardation to match the retardation of the measured breakthrough curve for the input concentration of 1 μg l the aia must be reduced to a value of 3 cm 1 this interfacial area is 20 times lower than the measured interfacial area and represents a physically unrealistic value for the porous medium and system conditions in addition a different greatly reduced aia value is required to match the measured retardation for each of the input concentrations which also is not physically realistic the freundlich predicted retardation factors increase exponentially and exhibit increasingly greater deviations from the measured values as concentrations decrease fig 5 this is not consistent with the linearity of awia demonstrated by the absence of self sharpening and extended elution tailing for the measured breakthrough curves the results of the mathematical modeling simulations and the constancy of measured retardation factors for different input concentrations conversely the retardation factors predicted using the kia values determined from the surface tension data are consistent with the measured data fig 5 3 8 pfas transport for input concentrations at or above the critical reference concentration transport experiments were also conducted using input concentration near or above the critical reference concentration the breakthrough curve for pfos transport with an input concentration of 10 mg l ten times larger than the critical reference concentration is presented in fig 6 the breakthrough curve exhibits a sharp arrival front and extended elution concentration tailing the effective kia determined from the breakthrough curve is similar to that determined from the surface tension data the predicted simulation produced with the guo et al 2020 model could not match the measured data measurement uncertainty for input parameter values should be considered when comparing predicted and measured transport data another simulation was conducted using the lower ranges of the measured aia and kia values noted above this predicted simulation was also not able to match the early arrival and extended elution tailing exhibited by the measured breakthrough curve fig 6 similar results are obtained for two additional pfos transport experiments conducted with input concentrations of 10 mg l and similar water saturations data not shown an experiment was also conducted with the same input concentration but a higher water saturation figure si 6 in this case the arrival front was adequately simulated but not the extended elution tailing this may indicate a lesser degree of nonideal transport at the higher water saturation additional investigation is required to confirm such behavior the predicted simulations presented in figs 6 and si 6 include surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia the simulations without surfactant induced flow deviate only slightly from the original simulations indicting relatively minor impact the simulations with linear awia deviate measurably from the original simulations this illustrates that awia is nonlinear for these cases this is consistent with the observation of self sharpening arrival fronts and extended elution tailing for the breakthrough curves experiments were also conducted for pfos transport with an input concentration of 1 mg l and pfoa transport with an input concentration of 10 mg l fig 7 these concentrations are identical to the respective critical reference concentrations of pfos and pfoa the effective kia values determined from the breakthrough curves are similar to those determined from the surface tension data similar magnitudes of early arrival and extended elution tailing are observed for both experiments along with concentration disruptions observed for the arrival fronts starting at relative concentrations of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively while the predicted simulations could not fully match the early arrival and extended tailing the degree of deviation is not as great as observed for the pfos experiments conducted at 10 mg l input concentration fig 6 the preceding results indicate that pfos and pfoa experience nonideal transport for conditions with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration the disparity observed between the simulated and measured transport suggests the existence of a process or interaction that is not represented in the model as discussed above the modelling indicated that surfactant induced flow was of relatively minor importance for these experiments as represented in the model surfactant induced flow impacts water flow the local water saturation and the magnitude of air water interface which concomitantly impacts pfas retention and transport it appears that there may be some additional manifestation of surfactant induced flow that is not represented in the model the early arrival exhibited by the measured breakthrough curves may indicate an impact of preferential transport with some initial bypassing of a portion of the air water interfacial area the extended elution tailing may indicate a degree of constrained access to some portion of the air water interfacial area however the observation that the kia values determined from moment analysis of the breakthrough curves are similar to those determined from the surface tension data indicates that all interfacial area is accessed eventually these phenomena are the focus of on going research 4 conclusions this study presents the first systematic investigation of the impact of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia on pfas transport with a combination of miscible displacement experiments and mathematical modeling analysis of measured transport behavior of pfas under unsaturated flow conditions demonstrated that awia was linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration this includes the absence of significant shelf sharpening and extended elution tailing of breakthrough curves as well as the similarity of retardation factors measured for a several log range of input concentrations the results of surface activity characterization via surface tension measurements and those from mathematical modeling investigations supported this observation these results indicate that kia attains a limiting maximum value under transport conditions the results also demonstrate that kia values determined from surface tension data are appropriate for representing awia of pfas during transport in unsaturated media the concept of critical reference concentrations was shown to be an effective approach for evaluating the potential for specific processes to influence pfas transport the results of the transport experiments and mathematical modeling demonstrated that surfactant induced flow can be ignored and awia can be treated as linear when the relevant concentration range is 3 10 times below the critical reference concentration in addition this and prior research brusseau 2020 has indicated that awia can be reasonably treated as effectively instantaneous for transport hence pfas retention associated with awia can be considered to be ideal under the appropriate conditions this has significant implications for characterizing retention processes and for simulating pfas transport specifically the results demonstrate that simplified mathematical models that exclude surfactant induced flow and treat awia as linear and instantaneous can be employed in some cases to simulate pfas transport this not only reduces the complexity required for process representation thus simplifying the model required but it also reduces the level of information needed for input data parameterization conversely apparent nonideal transport behavior was observed for experiments conducted with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration this phenomenon requires further investigation based on studies reported to date e g washington et al 2010 anderson et al 2016 rankin et al 2016 dauchy et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a the soil concentrations for pfas at a great majority of sites are likely to be below the respective critical reference concentrations for many pfas of interest especially for short and medium chain pfas this is anticipated to be true for secondary source sites such as landfills and locations receiving land application of treated wastewater or biosolids and for some legacy afff and pfas manufacturing sites however this may not be true for sites with recent or new afff applications or spills in these latter cases the relatively high concentrations present may lead to nonideal awia behavior that cannot be adequately represented with simplified models in addition it is important to note that other factors may contribute to the complexity of pfas transport in the vadose zone these include nonsteady flow conditions physical heterogeneity and potential preferential flow phenomenon which may directly impact air water interfacial adsorption and transport other potentially important factors include soil geochemical heterogeneity and complex nonlinear rate limited multi process solid phase sorption e g barzen hanson et al 2017 campos pereira et al 2018

16779,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas adsorb at air water interfaces during transport in unsaturated porous media this can cause surfactant induced flow and enhanced retention that is a function of concentration which complicates characterization and modeling of pfas transport under unsaturated conditions the influence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption awia on pfas transport was investigated with a series of miscible displacement transport experiments conducted with a several log range in input concentrations perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and ammonium perfluoro 2 methyl 3 oxahexanoate genx were used as model pfas the results were interpreted in terms of critical reference concentrations associated with pfas surface activities and their relationship to the relevancy of transport processes such as surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia for concentration ranges of interest analysis of the measured transport behavior of pfas under unsaturated flow conditions demonstrated that awia was linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration this includes the absence of significant arrival front self sharpening and extended elution tailing of the breakthrough curves as well as the similarity of retardation factors measured for a wide range of input concentrations independently predicted simulations produced with a comprehensive flow and transport model that accounts for transient variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited awia provided excellent predictions of the measured transport a series of simulations was conducted with the model to test the specific impact of various processes potentially influencing pfos transport the simulation results showed that surfactant induced flow was negligible and that awia was effectively linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration pfas retention associated with awia can be considered to be ideal in such cases thereby supporting the use of simplified mathematical models conversely apparent nonideal transport behavior was observed for experiments conducted with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfos pfoa transport adsorption per and polyfluoroalkyl substances 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas have been identified as emerging contaminants of critical concern due to their ubiquitous presence recalcitrance and potential ecological and human health impacts it is now clearly established that soil serves as a long term source for many sites contaminated by per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas this has been demonstrated by field sampling surveys and mathematical modeling studies e g washington et al 2010 shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 rankin et al 2016 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 washington et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a guo et al 2020 hence there is great interest in the transport behavior of pfas in the vadose zone which can be considerably more complex than in groundwater one primary source of complexity is that flow and transport occur under water unsaturated conditions this condition introduces two important processes that can impact the transport of pfas in the vadose zone both processes are associated with the accumulation or adsorption of pfas at air water interfaces created under unsaturated conditions first adsorption of surfactants and other matter at the air water interface can alter surface tensions which can affect capillary pressure and in turn impact water flow i e surfactant induced flow depending upon extant conditions concomitantly the changes in water flow will impact the advective dispersive transport of solute in addition the change in the local water saturation caused by surfactant induced flow causes a change in the magnitude of air water interfacial area which will impact the magnitude of solute retained by adsorption at the air water interface thus surfactant induced flow can have multiple impacts on the retention and transport of surfactants this has been demonstrated through laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling for both hydrocarbon surfactants e g mingorance et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2012 karagunduz et al 2015 costanza robinson and henry 2017 el ouni et al 2021 and pfas e g brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 second adsorption at the air water interface provides a source of retention that can significantly impact pfas transport depending on a number of factors the impact of air water interfacial adsorption on pfas transport in unsaturated porous media has been demonstrated in several studies employing miscible displacement experiments lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a 2020b brusseau 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 li et al 2021 the potential importance of air water interfacial adsorption for pfas transport has also been indicated in a number of theoretical brusseau 2018 brusseau 2019a constanza et al 2019 silva et al 2019 and mathematical modeling brusseau et al 2019b brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 studies the transport of pfas undergoing air water interfacial adsorption awia is complicated by the nonlinearity of the process wherein the effective awia coefficient is a function of aqueous concentration a key aspect with regard to characterizing and simulating the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media is the extent to which surfactant induced flow and the nonlinearity of awia impact transport under relevant conditions and for concentration ranges of interest the question of the nonlinearity of pfas awia has been the focus of recent research and discussion brusseau 2018 2019b 2021 lyu et al 2018 schaefer et al 2019 2020 arshadi et al 2020 for example brusseau and colleagues have investigated the concentration dependency of awia coefficients kia using both transport measured and directly measured adsorption data lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2021 another example relates to discussions of the representativeness of langmuir versus freundlich isotherms for characterizing awia of pfas schaefer et al 2019 2020 arshadi et al 2020 the impact of surfactant induced flow on pfas transport has just begun to receive attention brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 the occurrence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia have significant consequences for pfas transport both for characterizing magnitudes of retention and for the complexity of mathematical models required for simulating transport therefore it is a critical question to address this study is the first to systematically examine the issue with a combination of transport experiments and mathematical modeling the objective of this research is to investigate the influence of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia on pfas transport miscible displacement transport experiments are conducted at different input concentrations to provide direct experimental observations of pfos and pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions the input concentrations span several orders of magnitude representing the largest range of concentrations employed to date in a transport study a comprehensive flow and transport model guo et al 2020 that accounts for nonsteady flow surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited awia is used to produce independently predicted simulations of the measured data a second mathematical model brusseau 2020 that does not consider surfactant induced flow and for which simulations are conducted with awia treated as linear and instantaneous is used to test the robustness of a simplified modeling approach the results are interpreted in terms of critical reference concentrations associated with pfas surface activities and their relationship to the relevancy of transport processes such as nonlinear awia and surfactant induced flow for concentration ranges of interest 2 materials and methods surface tensions were measured to characterize surface activities and to determine critical reference concentrations of the pfas measurement and data analysis methods are presented in the supporting information si file miscible displacement transport experiments were conducted with pfos and pfoa the same input concentrations were used for the pfos and pfoa experiments 0 1 1 and 10 mg l additional experiments were conducted with pfoa using two lower concentrations of 1 and 10 μg l the experiments were conducted using a 0 35 mm diameter natural quartz sand an electrolyte solution comprised of 0 01 m nacl was used for all experiments the sand and electrolyte were selected to be consistent with materials used in prior pfas transport experiments numerous measurements of air water interfacial area have been reported for this medium araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2015 el ouni et al 2021 brusseau 2021 nonreactive tracer tests were conducted to characterize the hydrodynamic conditions of the packed columns transport experiments were conducted under saturated flow conditions to characterize solid phase sorption experiments were then conducted under steady unsaturated flow conditions to characterize the impact of awia on retention and transport all experiments except one were conducted with a water saturation of 0 68 the methods used for the miscible displacement experiments are the same as those used in our prior pfas transport studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a yan et al 2020 additional information about the experiment methods is provided in the si effluent samples were collected continuously for the miscible displacement experiments using a fraction collector the samples were weighed to quantify effluent solution discharge and then subject to chemical analysis to determine concentrations the pfas samples were analyzed by two methods samples for all experiments except those for pfos with input concentration of 10 mg l were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry the samples for pfos experiments conducted with an input concentration of 10 mg l were analyzed by methylene blue active substances assay details of the chemical analysis methods are provided in the si file breakthrough curves were measured for each miscible displacement experiment the effluent volumetric discharge was divided by the resident water volume of the packed column to obtain pore volumes nondimensional time the effluent concentrations were divided by the input concentration to obtain relative concentrations measured retardation factors were determined for each breakthrough curve by the standard methods of calculating the area above the breakthrough curve frontal analysis and temporal moment analysis these methods have been demonstrated to be robust for pfas applications brusseau et al 2019b van glubt et al 2021 the measured data generated in the present study for pfoa transport are combined with the results of our prior studies lyu et al 2018 lyu and brusseau 2020 a data set for genx transport reported in yan et al 2020 is also used for comparison the same sand and experiment methods were used for all studies data have been measured for pfos pfoa and genx sorption by the sand in our prior studies yan et al 2020 van glubt et al 2021 in addition a data set for pfoa transport in a similar sand reported recently by other researchers is used for comparison li et al 2021 the li et al study examined pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions water saturation of 0 64 for two sets of ionic compositions nacl and cacl2 with three ionic strengths for each 0 0015 0 01 and 0 03 m the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of

were employed for this study the first is a one dimensional numerical model that couples transient variably saturated flow and advective and dispersive transport guo et al 2020 the model accounts for surfactant induced flow nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption the second model does not incorporate transient or surfactant induced flow but does account for nonlinear rate limited solid phase sorption and nonlinear rate limited air water interfacial adsorption brusseau 2020 the equations and solutions used for both models are reported in the respective citations both models are used in a predictive mode with values for all input variables determined independently the sources of the input values are discussed in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface tensions and critical reference concentrations the surface tensions of pfos pfoa and genx as a function of aqueous concentration are presented in figure si 1 the surface activities are a function of chain length as expected and as demonstrated in numerous prior studies good replication is obtained for pfos with a 95 measurement uncertainty of 14 for kia these data are used to determine γ c and kia functions for use in the mathematical modeling for comparison maximum kia values of 0 027 0 0037 and 0 001 cm are calculated for pfos pfoa and genx respectively the differences in the magnitudes of the values reflect the differences in surface activity the concept of critical reference concentrations and how they can be used to evaluate the potential for specific processes to influence pfas transport was recently introduced brusseau 2019b 2021 brusseau and van glubt 2021 in terms of surface tension data the critical reference concentration is determined from the inflection point of the surface tension curves the respective concentrations are approximately 1 10 and 30 mg l for pfos pfoa and genx based on the concentrations at which the surface tensions are reduced by 2 5 brusseau and van glubt 2021 kia values determined from surface tension data would represent essentially maximum values for target concentrations below these critical reference concentrations brusseau 2019b 2021 as such awia is anticipated to be effectively linear for pfas transport at such concentrations the nonlinearity of awia under transport conditions will be investigated in the following sections by examining the measured and simulated pfas transport behavior observed for the miscible displacement experiments 3 2 measured transport data the transport of the nonreactive tracer under unsaturated flow conditions was observed to be relatively ideal data not shown consistent with our prior studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a yan et al 2020 representative breakthrough curves measured for transport of pfoa pfos and genx in columns packed with unsaturated sand are presented in fig s 1 4 and si 3 5 the magnitude of retention is greater under unsaturated flow conditions compared to saturated conditions data not shown due to the impact of awia the effluent recoveries for the experiments averaged 99 4 4 3 95 confidence interval the kia values determined from the retardation factors measured by moment analysis of the breakthrough curves are similar to the values determined from the surface tension data this is consistent with our prior studies lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2021 3 3 validation of independently determined input parameters it is well established that conducting independent predictions is the most robust means by which to employ mathematical modeling to analyze measured transport data and characterize relevant processes this approach is used in the present study the first step in this procedure is to obtain values for all relevant input parameters inspection of equation 1 reveals that several retention related parameters need to be determined a priori to produce independently predicted simulations of transport two critical parameters for pfas retention under unsaturated flow conditions are the air water interfacial area and the awia coefficient a priori parameterization of these two variables is likely to pose the greatest difficulty for most modeling analyses of pfas retention and transport under unsaturated flow conditions the validity of the values used for these two critical parameters in the mathematical modeling will be examined in this subsection an independently predicted simulation produced with the guo et al 2020 model will be compared to measured transport data for a pfoa transport experiment conducted at sufficiently low input concentration such that transport is ideal hence the evaluation of parameter value validity will not be conflated by potential impacts of nonideal factors such as surfactant induced flow the transport data sets presented in this study were all obtained for experiments conducted with a 0 35 mm diameter commercial natural quartz sand it is quite possible that more interfacial area measurements have been reported for this medium than for any other brusseau 2021 aggregated the published measurements and showed that there was good consistency of measured values obtained by different research groups with various interfacial tracer methods our previously reported measured aia data sets araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2015 2020b were consolidated and used to develop an aia sw function that can be employed to determine aia for any given sw for the sand jiang et al 2020 guo et al 2020 brusseau 2021 determined a measurement uncertainty of 10 for the data this function was used to determine aia values for the simulations presented herein an et al 1996 used neutron reflectometry to directly measure the adsorption of pfoa at the air water interface in 0 01 m nacl solution neutron reflectometry is an advanced high resolution method for characterizing and quantifying soft matter interfaces hence it represents a robust means by which to directly measure surfactant adsorption at interfaces the directly measured adsorption data reported by an et al were used by brusseau 2021 to determine corresponding directly measured kia values for pfoa notably a maximum value of 0 0032 cm was measured these data provide a robust source of kia values for pfoa that is independent of the standard approach of using surface tension data and will be used for the following independent prediction the measured breakthrough curve for pfoa transport in the sand under unsaturated conditions is presented in fig 1 air water interfacial adsorption is responsible for the majority 81 of pfoa retention these data were obtained with an input concentration of 10 μg l this concentration is three orders of magnitude below the critical reference concentration of pfoa accompanying simulations demonstrated the absence of surfactant induced flow for this experiment which is consistent with the small change in surface tension measured for pfoa in this concentration range figure si 1 it is observed that the independently predicted simulation produced with the model of guo et al 2020 provides an excellent match to the measured data the fact that the independent prediction accurately simulates the measured data indicates that the model appropriately captures the relevant transport processes it also demonstrates that the input parameter values employed are robust and representative of the transport system this includes the values used for aia and kia in particular given that the kia was obtained from a high resolution direct measurement these results validate the robustness of the measured values used for aia 3 4 pfas transport for input concentrations below the critical reference concentration with the parameterization of kia and aia values determined to be robust the influence of input concentration on pfas transport can be investigated via comparison of measured and simulated data sets the measured breakthrough curves for pfos transport under unsaturated flow conditions with an input concentration of 0 1 mg l are presented in fig 2 note that this concentration is one order of magnitude lower than the critical reference concentration of 1 mg l good correspondence is observed for the two measured data sets the full breakthrough curve is observed to be relatively symmetrical pfos transport experiences a relatively large magnitude of retention with an equivalent retardation factor of 10 5 air water interfacial adsorption is responsible for the majority 83 of pfos retention the independently predicted simulation produced with the comprehensive model of guo et al 2020 provides an excellent match to the measured data fig 2 it is important to note again that this simulation was produced without calibration or fitting to the measured data wherein all input parameters were obtained independently this demonstrates that the model accurately represents the relevant processes influencing pfos transport as well as indicating that the parameter values used were robust a series of simulations was conducted to test the specific impact of the various processes potentially influencing pfos transport simulations produced with and without surfactant induced flow are essentially identical indicating negligible impact for this system figs 2 and si 2 inspection of figure si 1 shows that the surface tension for pfos changes minimally for concentrations below 0 1 mg l the input concentration employed for the experiment this explains the absence of surfactant induced flow for this experiment this result is consistent with prior simulations of pfas transport brusseau et al 2020b guo et al 2020 sorption of pfos by the sand is nonlinear and rate limited as demonstrated in our prior experiments conducted under saturated flow conditions van glubt et al 2021 however the simulations demonstrate that nonlinear sorption has a negligible impact and that rate limited sorption has minimal impact for pfos transport under unsaturated conditions figure si 2 this is because solid phase sorption provides a relatively small contribution 17 to total retention simulations treating awia as rate limited versus instantaneous are coincident indicating that mass transfer to and from the air water interface is rapid with respect to the residence time for the miscible displacement experiments this is consistent with the results of a prior study brusseau 2020 the simulation produced with awia treated as linear a fixed kia is essentially identical to the simulation accounting for nonlinearity fig 2 this indicates that awia is effectively linear for the conditions of the experiment this is consistent with the measured and simulated breakthrough curves not exhibiting appreciable self sharpening of the arrival front or extended concentration tailing for the elution front both of which are hallmarks of transport influenced by nonlinear adsorption as discussed above the critical reference concentration for pfos is 1 mg l below which the surface tension measured kia is essentially constant hence the observed behavior of the measured transport data the results of the mathematical modeling and the characterization of surface activity via the surface tension data are all consistent similar series of simulations were conducted for pfoa and genx transport in the sand results not shown this includes the transport of pfoa for an input concentration of 1 mg l which is ten times below pfoa s critical reference concentration and the transport of genx for an input concentration of 10 mg l that is 3 times lower than its critical reference concentration surfactant induced flow was negligible and awia exhibited minimal nonlinearity for both cases this is consistent with the prior simulations of pfos transport in total these results demonstrate that surfactant induced flow is not relevant and that awia can be treated as effectively linear for pfas transport when concentrations are approximately a factor of 3 10 below the critical reference concentration 3 5 simulating pfas transport with a simplified mathematical model the independently predicted simulation produced with the multi process mass transfer model of brusseau 2020 is observed to provide an excellent match to the measured pfos transport data fig 2 notably this model does not incorporate surfactant induced flow in addition awia is treated as linear and instantaneous for the simulation the performance of the model was further tested by applying it to multiple additional data sets the first is a data set for pfoa transport in the sand with an input concentration of 1 mg l note that this concentration is 10 times higher than the concentration used for the prior pfos experiment but is 10 times below the pfoa critical reference concentration the measured and simulated breakthrough curves are presented in figure si 3 the model produces a good prediction of the measured data with no representation of surfactant induced flow and with awia treated as linear and instantaneous independent predictions produced with the model also provided excellent simulations of measured pfoa transport data for experiments conducted with lower input concentrations of 1 10 and 100 μg l figs 3 4 and si 4 respectively another data set is for genx transport in the sand with an input concentration of 10 mg l this is three times lower than the critical reference concentration of 30 mg l similar to the pfos and pfoa data sets the simplified model provides a very good prediction of the measured data without accounting for surfactant induced flow or nonlinear rate limited awia figure si 3 in total the simplified model was used successfully to independently predict pfas transport for six experiments comprising three pfas and a range of input concentrations the ability of the model to accurately predict the measured data indicates that simpler mathematical models can be employed to simulate pfos transport under appropriate conditions specifically surfactant induced flow can be ignored and awia can be treated as linear when the relevant concentration range is sufficiently below the critical reference concentration 3 6 linearity of air water interfacial adsorption the results of the several individual transport experiments and simulations presented in the preceding sections demonstrate that awia is effectively linear for concentrations sufficiently below the critical reference concentration the linearity of awia can also be investigated directly by comparing the magnitudes of measured retardation factors as a function of the respective input concentrations used for the combined set of transport experiments inspection of equation 1 shows that when awia is linear i e constant kia retardation factors incorporating only awia should be constant for experiments conducted at different input concentrations when the same porous medium and water contents are used i e aia is constant in the present case the retardation factor is anticipated to increase slightly for lower concentrations due to the impact of nonlinear solid phase sorption a plot of retardation factors versus the input concentrations used for the pfoa experiments is presented in fig 5 the comparison of r values as a function of concentration requires no specification of individual parameter values such as kia or aia and thus is not subject to any sort of parameter determination uncertainty thus it represents a direct and definitive assessment of the nonlinearity of awia under transport conditions the magnitudes of the measured retardation factors increase minimally over the four order of magnitude range in concentrations the small increase is due to the impact of nonlinear solid phase sorption the essentially constant retardation factors measured for pfoa over a several log change in concentration is another confirmation of the linearity of awia below the critical reference concentration 3 7 relevancy of kia measurement methods given that the values used for aia have been validated for the present system the representativeness of other sources of kia values can be investigated the standard means by which to determine kia values is by application of the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data brusseau 2021 analyzed the results of 10 individual sets of surface tension measurements for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl solution and determined a mean kia of 0 0032 cm for a concentration of 10 μg l the kia of 0 0037 cm determined from the pfoa surface tension data presented in figure si 1 is very similar to this mean value in addition the mean value is identical to the directly measured value hence the predicted simulation obtained with the surface tension determined kia is identical to the simulation employing the directly measured value thereby producing an excellent match to the measured data fig 4 this consistency is observed for all of the other pfoa data sets see figs 3 si 4 and si 5 in addition excellent matches are also obtained using surface tension kia values for predicted simulations of pfos fig 2 and genx figure si 3 these results demonstrate that kia values determined from surface tension data are appropriate for representing pfas awia during transport in unsaturated media this is consistent with the results of prior comparisons of transport measured and surface tension determined values lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2021 as noted in the introduction the freundlich isotherm has been proposed as an alternative method to estimate kia values for pfas adsorption at air water interfaces with this approach kia does not attain an upper limiting value at lower concentrations rather the magnitude of kia increases continuously as concentration decreases for example application of the freundlich isotherm estimation produces a kia value for pfoa that is 34 times larger than the values determined from neutron reflectometry and surface tension for an input concentration of 1 μg l as a result the simulated breakthrough curve for pfoa transport with the freundlich isotherm kia exhibits much greater retardation than the measured data fig 3 with respective freundlich and measured r values of 41 and 3 9 similar results are obtained for pfoa transport at the input concentrations of 10 μg l fig 4 100 μg l figure si 4 and 1 mg l figure si 5 in order for the freundlich predicted retardation to match the retardation of the measured breakthrough curve for the input concentration of 1 μg l the aia must be reduced to a value of 3 cm 1 this interfacial area is 20 times lower than the measured interfacial area and represents a physically unrealistic value for the porous medium and system conditions in addition a different greatly reduced aia value is required to match the measured retardation for each of the input concentrations which also is not physically realistic the freundlich predicted retardation factors increase exponentially and exhibit increasingly greater deviations from the measured values as concentrations decrease fig 5 this is not consistent with the linearity of awia demonstrated by the absence of self sharpening and extended elution tailing for the measured breakthrough curves the results of the mathematical modeling simulations and the constancy of measured retardation factors for different input concentrations conversely the retardation factors predicted using the kia values determined from the surface tension data are consistent with the measured data fig 5 3 8 pfas transport for input concentrations at or above the critical reference concentration transport experiments were also conducted using input concentration near or above the critical reference concentration the breakthrough curve for pfos transport with an input concentration of 10 mg l ten times larger than the critical reference concentration is presented in fig 6 the breakthrough curve exhibits a sharp arrival front and extended elution concentration tailing the effective kia determined from the breakthrough curve is similar to that determined from the surface tension data the predicted simulation produced with the guo et al 2020 model could not match the measured data measurement uncertainty for input parameter values should be considered when comparing predicted and measured transport data another simulation was conducted using the lower ranges of the measured aia and kia values noted above this predicted simulation was also not able to match the early arrival and extended elution tailing exhibited by the measured breakthrough curve fig 6 similar results are obtained for two additional pfos transport experiments conducted with input concentrations of 10 mg l and similar water saturations data not shown an experiment was also conducted with the same input concentration but a higher water saturation figure si 6 in this case the arrival front was adequately simulated but not the extended elution tailing this may indicate a lesser degree of nonideal transport at the higher water saturation additional investigation is required to confirm such behavior the predicted simulations presented in figs 6 and si 6 include surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia the simulations without surfactant induced flow deviate only slightly from the original simulations indicting relatively minor impact the simulations with linear awia deviate measurably from the original simulations this illustrates that awia is nonlinear for these cases this is consistent with the observation of self sharpening arrival fronts and extended elution tailing for the breakthrough curves experiments were also conducted for pfos transport with an input concentration of 1 mg l and pfoa transport with an input concentration of 10 mg l fig 7 these concentrations are identical to the respective critical reference concentrations of pfos and pfoa the effective kia values determined from the breakthrough curves are similar to those determined from the surface tension data similar magnitudes of early arrival and extended elution tailing are observed for both experiments along with concentration disruptions observed for the arrival fronts starting at relative concentrations of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively while the predicted simulations could not fully match the early arrival and extended tailing the degree of deviation is not as great as observed for the pfos experiments conducted at 10 mg l input concentration fig 6 the preceding results indicate that pfos and pfoa experience nonideal transport for conditions with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration the disparity observed between the simulated and measured transport suggests the existence of a process or interaction that is not represented in the model as discussed above the modelling indicated that surfactant induced flow was of relatively minor importance for these experiments as represented in the model surfactant induced flow impacts water flow the local water saturation and the magnitude of air water interface which concomitantly impacts pfas retention and transport it appears that there may be some additional manifestation of surfactant induced flow that is not represented in the model the early arrival exhibited by the measured breakthrough curves may indicate an impact of preferential transport with some initial bypassing of a portion of the air water interfacial area the extended elution tailing may indicate a degree of constrained access to some portion of the air water interfacial area however the observation that the kia values determined from moment analysis of the breakthrough curves are similar to those determined from the surface tension data indicates that all interfacial area is accessed eventually these phenomena are the focus of on going research 4 conclusions this study presents the first systematic investigation of the impact of surfactant induced flow and nonlinear awia on pfas transport with a combination of miscible displacement experiments and mathematical modeling analysis of measured transport behavior of pfas under unsaturated flow conditions demonstrated that awia was linear when the input concentration was sufficiently below the critical reference concentration this includes the absence of significant shelf sharpening and extended elution tailing of breakthrough curves as well as the similarity of retardation factors measured for a several log range of input concentrations the results of surface activity characterization via surface tension measurements and those from mathematical modeling investigations supported this observation these results indicate that kia attains a limiting maximum value under transport conditions the results also demonstrate that kia values determined from surface tension data are appropriate for representing awia of pfas during transport in unsaturated media the concept of critical reference concentrations was shown to be an effective approach for evaluating the potential for specific processes to influence pfas transport the results of the transport experiments and mathematical modeling demonstrated that surfactant induced flow can be ignored and awia can be treated as linear when the relevant concentration range is 3 10 times below the critical reference concentration in addition this and prior research brusseau 2020 has indicated that awia can be reasonably treated as effectively instantaneous for transport hence pfas retention associated with awia can be considered to be ideal under the appropriate conditions this has significant implications for characterizing retention processes and for simulating pfas transport specifically the results demonstrate that simplified mathematical models that exclude surfactant induced flow and treat awia as linear and instantaneous can be employed in some cases to simulate pfas transport this not only reduces the complexity required for process representation thus simplifying the model required but it also reduces the level of information needed for input data parameterization conversely apparent nonideal transport behavior was observed for experiments conducted with input concentrations similar to or greater than the critical reference concentration this phenomenon requires further investigation based on studies reported to date e g washington et al 2010 anderson et al 2016 rankin et al 2016 dauchy et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a the soil concentrations for pfas at a great majority of sites are likely to be below the respective critical reference concentrations for many pfas of interest especially for short and medium chain pfas this is anticipated to be true for secondary source sites such as landfills and locations receiving land application of treated wastewater or biosolids and for some legacy afff and pfas manufacturing sites however this may not be true for sites with recent or new afff applications or spills in these latter cases the relatively high concentrations present may lead to nonideal awia behavior that cannot be adequately represented with simplified models in addition it is important to note that other factors may contribute to the complexity of pfas transport in the vadose zone these include nonsteady flow conditions physical heterogeneity and potential preferential flow phenomenon which may directly impact air water interfacial adsorption and transport other potentially important factors include soil geochemical heterogeneity and complex nonlinear rate limited multi process solid phase sorption e g barzen hanson et al 2017 campos pereira et al 2018
