20230,power performance of floating wave energy converters is typically performed under regular wave conditions or using standard ocean spectrum models with one peak we explore the effect of device geometry of a self reacting point absorber srpa for real wave spectrum having multiple peaks different float and torus designs are evaluated to alter the cut off frequency of the srpa to extract more power in operating wave periods representative of two real ocean sites a float with a damping plate was more suitable for higher wave periods while a slender body float was preferred for lower wave periods increasing the torus outer diameter increased the absorbed power by 20 for low wave period while the absorbed power was reduced by 5 for a high wave period site the modified srpa with slender body float showed a four fold increase in annual energy production when compared to regular wave conditions for the low wave period site for the high wave period sea site a modified srpa with a damping plate showed a 6 increase in annual energy production the study shows that while the geometry of the srpa determines the operating period the pto damping can be varied to determine the operating bandwidth keywords wave energy self reacting point absorber wave spectrum regular and real wave 1 introduction floating point absorbers are a type of wave energy converters wec that is conceptually simple due to the absence of complex moving parts that reduce operations and maintenance costs amir et al 2014 wang et al 2011 ahn et al 2012 pecher and kofoed 2017 to the wec designer the main challenges in moving the technology from research to commercial stage are related to optimizing the device hydrodynamics power take off pto system and developing optimal control protocols to maximize the performance of the wec for varying sea states while ensuring self alignment for varying wave directions and survivability during storm surges and extreme waves drew et al 2009 falnes 2007 osorio et al 2016 antonio 2010 al shami et al 2019 the parameters above are interdependent i e the sea state condition determines the geometry and sizing of the wec that affects the hydrodynamic erselcan and kükner 2020 performance which affects the pto coefficients followed by the control algorithm al shami et al 2019 for near shore h λ ½ application a single body point absorber is employed and it consists of a floating buoy attached to a ground based direct drive generator pastor and liu 2014a several engineering solutions have been proposed to improve the power performance of single body point absorbers several studies gao et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 have focused on improving the power take off system for increased power capturing performance the natural frequency of the system was altered by changing the spring constant of the linear pto which increases the energy capture bandwidth of the point absorber with the proper choice of mass ratio binh et al 2016 experimentally evaluated the power performance of single body wec with a mechanical pto system under regular wave conditions erselcan et al erselcan and kükner 2020 carried a parametric study to enhance the power capture performance of the single body floating point absorber among the different float designs analyzed the power capture performance of the semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid performed better than circular cylinder float rodrigues et al rodríguez et al 2020 improved the power capture performance of sloped single body point absorber using the generate and test method with the exhaustive search method the modified device showed two time increase in wave energy absorption esmaeilzadeh et al esmaeilzadeh and alam 2019 carried out a shape parametric study on submerged heaving plate to increase the power capture performance of single body wec under different wave directionality the wec performance is improved by elongating the shape of the wec in the wave direction goggins et al goggins and finnegan 2014 performed a parametric shape study on vertically heaving single body point absorber for a test site off the west coast of ireland the power performance was calculated for various buoy shapes that include a truncated cylinder whose design was subsequently modified to add a hemispherical and a chamfered base it was found that the power captured by the cylinder with a hemispherical base was superior to the other designs pastor et al pastor and liu 2014b compared the performance in the frequency domain of two floating buoys of hemispherical and conical cross section it was found that the conical buoy absorbs 10 more power than the hemispherical buoy shadman et al 2018 developed a methodology based on a series of frequency domain and statistical analysis and optimized the diameter and draft length of the single floating buoy based on the sea state of the coast of brazil the peak absorbed power of the wec was found to increase with increasing buoy diameter while the resonant period of the wec increased with an increase in draft length liang et al 2017 compared the power performance of single body floating wec with two different pto systems mechanical motion rectifier and linear system the experimental study revealed that the mechanical motion rectifier system produced more power than the linear pto system since the energy density of the ocean waves decreases as the surface waves approach the shore the placement of the point absorbers in the deep sea h λ ½ allows for the possibility of an increase in power production alamian et al 2017 performed experiments to enhance the performance of point absorbers at various ocean depths and investigated heave pitch and surge motions it was observed that the heave and pitch motions increased with an increase in depth of still water the surge motion decreased under similar conditions the performance of the point absorber was improved in heave motion only with the device is operating in deep water since the placement of a ground based generator is not feasible in the deep sea a self reacting point absorber srpa is typically considered a viable alternative with several developers working on the concept of a floating two body srpa similar to the wavebob dick 2011 developed in the late 1990s the device consists of two concentric axisymmetric bodies a submerged body that acts as a reference to the system and is called the float and a floating body called the torus and floats on the surface of the ocean martin et al 2020 experimentally evaluated the power performance of 1 30 scaled one and two body wecs it was observed that the power captured by the two body system increased by 50 shami et al al shami et al 2019 carried out a parametric study on srpa and modified the system based on the taguchi method it was found that the shape of the float has the largest effect on the srpa a spherical float was observed to have less added mass and radiating capabilities and captures more power compared to a float which was cylindrical in shape in addition the pto stiffness of the system showed a significant effect on the bandwidth of the operating frequency whereas pto damping had a large effect on the captured power of the system muliawan et al jaya muliawan et al 2013 performed a numerical analysis on the srpa wavebob under regular and irregular wave conditions and observed that increasing the damping coefficient increases the peak power and narrows down the operating bandwidth in addition the peak power period could be moved to higher wave periods by increasing the pto stiffness the effects of mooring configurations on the performance of the device were also investigated and it was determined that the srpa with mooring produced 5 less power compared to srpa without mooring beatty et al 2015 compared the power capture performance of the srpa with two different floating reference bodies the first design was slender and similar to wavebob while the second design is similar to the ocean power technologies wec design and has a damping plate mounted on the float draper 2006 it was reported that the slender floating body showed peak power capture performance in higher wave frequency while the float with a damping plate showed peak performance in lower wave frequency beatty et al 2019 extended the performance comparison of srpas under an irregular wave spectrum the authors implemented the pierson moskovitz spectrum to replicate the irregular wave conditions of vancouver island in canada for the selected sea site the srpa with damping plate produced 41 more mean annual energy compared to the slender srpa based on a detailed literature review by the authors shown in table 1 most studies that involve srpas evaluate the power performance and capture width ratio based on idealized regular wave conditions babarit et al 2011 2012 liang and zuo 2017 sheng and lewis 2016 chao et al 2018 kalidoss and banerjee 2019 miquel et al 2020 yetkin et al 2021 the power generated by floating wecs is dependent on the ability of the device to attain resonance in response to the prevailing wave conditions the power performance of wec is like a low pass filter in terms of energy in the frequency domain for the wave frequencies above the resonant frequency the power captured by the wec drops sharply a single design of wec does not fit all the ocean conditions thus the geometric parameters should be modified based on the selected sea sites coe et al 2021 a smaller set of studies select a wave spectrum based on real sea sites however the wave spectrum in those studies was simplified using standard ocean spectrum models jonswap representing the real spectrum with one peak in real wave conditions the wave spectrum has multiple peaks in this paper we numerically evaluate the power capture performance of an srpa for various float and torus designs for two different sea sites with distinct operating wave periods the srpa designs were modified in the present study to alter the cut off frequency of the srpa to extract more power in those operating wave periods representative of the two sea sites the present work provides an insight into the extent of influence of geometric characteristics of srpa s under realistic operating conditions a feature that cannot be captured using regular waves to facilitate the validation of our numerical simulation the results are compared with experimental data available for a scaled 1 25 two body srpa in literature beatty et al 2015 2019 fig 1 shows the schematic of the reference srpa selected for analysis the float and torus are wave following devices and oscillate at different frequencies with the wave the relative motion between the two in the heave vertical direction is used for energy conversion for the current analysis the mass of the floating bodies float and torus is considered as the mass of srpa the mass of the pto system and the mooring lines that are used to counteract the drift forces are neglected babarit et al 2011 a direct drive linear generator that is modeled using a spring damper system is used as the pto unit for this study three different float and three different torus shapes are analyzed in addition the effect of variation in the outer diameter of the torus on the power capture performance of the srpa is analyzed the current design improvement study under real wave conditions would provide added guidance to wec developers to enhance the efficiency of srpa and thereby enhancing its commercial readiness rather than pursuing an approach where the device geometry is optimized based on a specific sea state we choose an approach where we study different float and torus shapes to provide alternate designs for the end user who can then mix and match components to match their sea states such flexibility in approach is crucial for supply chain consideration as wave energy technologies become more matured and it would not be cost effective for the developer to optimize and manufacture designs for specific sea sites 2 wave energy sites the mean energy content of the ocean wave varies from site to site and so it is important to consider the wave resource when performing design iterations to increase the absorbed power of the device in this study wave statistics of two sea sites are chosen on each along the east and west coasts of the united states with proximity to the city of new york and philadelphia on the east coast and the city of los angeles on the west coast see fig 2 a and b the wave statistics for the chosen sites are taken from national data buoy center 2017 and shown in fig 2c and d the combined probability distribution of wave conditions is different for the two sites for the east coast noaa 44066 the wave conditions are distributed between the wave periods 6 10s whereas for the west coast noaa 46069 the wave conditions are distributed over the wave periods of 11 16s the annual mean energy content of chosen sea sites is shown in table 2 the mean annual energy content of the west coast is twice the mean annual energy content of the east coast the water depth of the west coast is 12 times higher than the water depth of east coast which attributes to the high energy content in the waves the hourly spectral data of the two sea sites is estimated for wec performance evaluation in this work the hourly spectrum for one year 2016 was separated into different bins based on their significant wave height m and dominant wave period s the separated spectrums for each bin are averaged to have a representative spectrum for that bin using this representative averaged spectrum for a bin the power matrix of srpa is computed the seasonal variations of significant wave height and wave energy content are shown in fig 2f and g fig 2e shows the highest energy content spectrum for both sea sites for noaa 44066 highest energy content spectrum occurs at a significant wave height of 8 m and a wave period of 11s for noaa 46069 the highest energy content occurs at a significant wave height of 6 m and a wave period of 19s both the sea sites showed high wave energy content during the winter months with the wave energy content dropping by 75 during the summer months the annual sea state matrix of the sea sites is split into monthly sea state matrices and the monthly mean energy production by srpas is evaluated see fig 2g 3 methods 3 1 geometries of float and torus the srpa design analyzed in muliawan et al 2011 is chosen as the reference design for the present study experiments on 1 25 scaled srpa model under regular wave conditions with two different floating reference bodies showed that the float with a slender body has higher performance in lower wave periods whereas the float with damping plate has higher performance in higher wave periods beatty et al 2015 to understand the effect of float on the srpa three different float designs are chosen for analysis this included a reference geometry frg a float geometry with a damping plate fdp and a float without a damping plate that is shaped like a cylinder fcylinder the schematic of the various float designs are shown in fig 3 a c parametric studies on power performance found in the literature pastor and liu 2014a shadman et al 2018 on single body point absorbers improved the wec performance by changing the buoy shape diameter and draft length under regular wave conditions similarly to analyze the effect of variations in the design of a torus we chose three different torus designs this includes the reference torus trg shown in fig 4 a the cross section of reference torus is cylinder with a chamfered base as a first iteration the cross section of the torus is modified to a cylinder with a wedge base and is referred to as tw see fig 4b the wedge height l w is varied and two designs are considered a 2 m case tw1 and 3 m case tw2 furthermore to study the effect of torus diameter on power performance the inner diameter is kept constant while the outer diameter d o for the wedged torus tw1 is varied as seen in fig 4c two torus designs tod1 and tod2 that have outer diameters of 18 m and 22 m respectively are considered the critical dimensions of all torus designs are listed in table 3 3 2 governing equations the equation of motion of a wave energy converter in the time domain can be written as babarit et al 2012 nolte and ertekin 2014 1 m x f e x f r a d f h f p t o where m is the mass and x is the acceleration of the device the forces considered for the current analysis include the hydrostatic force f h the wave excitation force f ex and the power take off force f pto the radiation force f rad acting on the wec system is written as 2 f r a d μ x 0 t ζ t τ x τ d τ 3 ζ t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where μ is the added mass at infinite frequency x is the velocity of the device τ is the dummy variable for integration and ζ is the radiation impulse response function and b is the radiation damping since the steepness ratio defined as wave height h to wavelength ratio λ the current analysis is small 0 0025 0 02 a linear wave theory based bem can be used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients pecher and kofoed 2017 from bem analysis it is observed that the added mass of the system is constant and the radiation damping coefficient is a function of time the past motions of the body generated waves keep propagating long after the motions are completed the convolution integral term in eq 2 accounts for the memory effect the power take off force is written as 4 f p t o b p t o x k p t o x where b pto and k pto are damping coefficient and spring constant in a direct drive linear pto system the hydrostatic force is written as 5 f h ρ g s w x where ρ and g are the density of water and acceleration due to gravity and s w is the cross sectional area of the wec at the water plane the oscillating amplitude x of the wec with the wave is very small compared to the wavelength λ therefore the cross sectional area of the wec at the water air interface is constant the wave excitation force acting on the device is written as 6 f e x r n 2 s f n δ f f e x f n e j 2 π f n t φ n where j 1 where r denotes the real part s f n is the spectral density of the wave in frequency f e x is the wave excitation force per unit wave amplitude δ f is the adequate frequency step f n is the wave frequency and φ n is the random phase seed the form drag force acting on the wec is neglected sawaragi 1997 since the wec body is a bluff body the viscous force acting on the wec is dominated by form drag force pecher and kofoed 2017 the form drag forces on the wec are mainly generated from the vortex shedding due to boundary layer separation when water flows past the wec with the drag force originating due to loss of kinetic energy the viscous forces become dominated for small bodies whose characteristic dimension d is smaller than the wave height h typically d h 0 1 sawaragi 1997 in the current analysis the range of d h varies in 2 5 20 which implies that drag forces are negligible and the wec system is dominated by inertial forces the keulegan carpenter number kc provides a ratio of drag force to the inertia force on the system sawaragi 1997 the kc number range for the present analysis is 0 0056 0 885 wave force regimes in terms of kc number and d h ratio can be found in literature sawaragi 1997 with the viscous forces due to flow separation being important for higher kc numbers on the contrary for a higher d h ratio diffraction forces become dominant for our system the kc number is low 0 084 and the d h ratio is high 2 5 20 and thus an inviscid flow assumption is valid 3 3 numerical modeling boundary element method for the time domain analysis of the two body srpa hydrodynamic parameters such as added mass damping coefficient and excitation force are calculated using the potential flow solver wamit lee and newman 2013 both the boundary conditions on the wec as well as the free surface are linearized and a harmonic time dependence is adopted a cartesian coordinate system is fixed to the undisturbed free surface of water with a sign convention such that z axis positive upwards in the potential flow assumption the gradient of velocity potential φ satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ 0 in the fluid domain in harmonic time dependence the complex velocity potential ϕ is related to φ by 7 φ r ϕ e j ω t where ω is the frequency of the incident wave and t is time for boundary value problems the linearized form of the free surface condition is given as 8 ϕ z k ϕ 0 for z 0 where k ω 2 g is the infinite depth wavenumber g is the acceleration due to gravity and ϕ z is the velocity potential at the free water surface the velocity potential of the incident wave is defined as 9 ϕ 0 j g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e j k x cos β j k y sin β where the wavenumber k is the real root of the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tan k h β is the incident wave direction with respect to the positive x axis h is the water depth and a is the wave amplitude the complex velocity potential ϕ is decomposed into radiation ϕ r and diffraction components ϕ d as 10 ϕ ϕ r ϕ d where ϕ r j ω i 1 6 ξ i ϕ i and ϕ d ϕ 0 ϕ s in eq 9 ξ i the complex amplitudes of the oscillating body ϕ i corresponds to the unit amplitude radiation potential ϕ 0 incident wave potential and ϕ s represents the scattered disturbance of the incident wave by the body fixed at its undisturbed position at the undisturbed position the radiation and diffraction potential conditions are 11 ϕ i n n i ϕ d n 0 the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated from the radiation and diffraction velocity potentials the output parameters that include the added mass coefficient a i k and damping coefficient b i k are related as 12 a i k j ω b i k ρ s b n i ϕ k d s these coefficients can also be written in non dimensional form for both added mass a i k and damping coefficient b i k as newman 1977 13 a i k a i k ρ l a b i k b i k ρ l a ω where l and ρ are the characteristic length of the body and density of the water respectively the value of a is given by a 3 for i k 1 2 3 a 4 for i 1 2 3 and k 4 5 6 a 5 for i k 4 5 6 with i k specifying the mode of the device and takes values between 1 and 3 for translation motion in all three axes and values of 4 6 for angular motion about all the three axes the excitation force x i is calculated in wamit using the haskind relation lee and newman 2013 for the incident wave potential ϕ 0 as 14 x i j ω ρ s b n i ϕ 0 ϕ i ϕ 0 n d s the non dimensional excitation force coefficient x i is obtained by dividing eq 13 by the hydrodynamic pressure ρ g a l m acting on the system for a given mode with m being dependent on the mode of the device i e m 2 for i k 1 2 3 m 2 for i 1 2 3 and k 4 5 6 m 3 for i k 4 5 6 3 3 1 wec sim modeling a wec involves a mathematical representation of the complex interaction between the incident waves device motion and the power take off for the present analysis an open source code wec sim wec sim user manual 2016 developed by national renewable energy laboratory usa is used to simulate the dynamic motion of the wec for different wave conditions the power output from the wec is calculated using the radiation and diffraction method fig 5 shows the workflow used in wec sim the implementation involves a three step process that involves a pre processing b time domain simulation and c post processing the pre processing step consists of the creation of geometry calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients and post processing hydrodynamic coefficients the wetted surface of the srpa is created and surface panels are meshed to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients the grid convergence study for the srpa is carried out with three panel sizes the maximum sizes of the panels are limited to 10 5 and 2 5 mm the response amplitude operator rao of the srpa is compared for different panel sizes and difference was negligible therefore the maximum panel size of 5 mm is chosen for surface meshing the two bodies of the srpa are surface meshed separately the float and torus consist of 63 106 and 9 106 surface panels respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated in the frequency domain in wamit and post processed into a wec sim readable format bemio see fig 5 the hydrodynamic coefficients generated by the wamit are non dimensionalized with density and characteristic length in the pre processing step bemio creates the absolute values for hydrodynamic coefficients the second block shows the steps involving the time domain simulations the multi body dynamic system of the wec i e the hydrodynamic body float and torus in our case constraint pto system and the reference frame are modeled in simulink and the physical properties such as body mass moment of inertia and the initial position of the system are defined in the present analysis the srpa is constrained with one degree of freedom and srpa can oscillate only in heave direction see fig 1 a direct drive linear pto system is used for all simulations the instantaneous motion forces on the srpa and pto power are calculated in the time domain and the computed forces and pto power are time averaged to remove the initial transients in the numerical solution the first 15 wave periods of data are removed similar to studies reported in the literature muliawan et al 2011 3 3 2 validation verification to validate and verify our numerical results we compare our simulations with experimental data for a 1 25 scaled model available in the literature beatty et al 2015 2019 the experiments were performed in regular and irregular pierson moskowitz spectrum wave conditions the pto damping coefficient for the model is calculated analytically using eq 15 15 b p t o b 33 2 ω m μ 33 c 33 ω 2 1 2 where b 33 is the hydrodynamic damping coefficient in heave direction m mass of the system μ 33 is the added mass in heave direction and c 33 is the hydrostatic stiffness the hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass radiation damping and wave excitation forces for the scaled model are calculated using the potential flow solver wamit with the calculated hydrodynamic coefficients in the heave direction for each wave frequency the pto damping coefficient of the scaled model is calculated analytically using eq 15 the range of pto damping coefficient for the scaled model is 20 1950 n m as shown in fig 6 a the added mass of the srpa remains constant with a change in wave frequency a similar trend was observed in the experiment the offset between the two datasets is attributed to the absence of viscous forces in our potential flow solutions using wamit however the wave excitation force from the simulations is in good agreement with the experimental results beatty et al 2015 and decreases with an increase in wave frequency see fig 6b the excitation force reaches a minimum value near 3 rad s a sharp change in the excitation phase of the srpa is observed our simulation results capture this sharp change in the excitation phase at the same wave frequency as in the experiments see inset plot in fig 6b to further expand the validation envelope the comparison is extended to additional parameters that include the response amplitude operator rao and normalized power in the experiments the srpa exhibits the maximum response at its natural frequency of 2 rad s the simulations were able to predict this maximum response see fig 6c however the peak response obtained from simulations over predicts that of the experiments probably due to the inviscid flow solution that results in a negligible hydrodynamic damping coefficient the numerical results show good agreement with experiments for wave frequencies smaller and larger than the natural frequency the captured power of the device under both regular and irregular waves was estimated and is in good agreement when the wec operates at frequencies other than the natural frequency the overshoot in response amplitude and added mass is once again due to the assumption that the viscous effect is negligible 4 results and discussion the dynamic behavior and power performance of srpa are simulated for varying float and torus designs the effect of geometrical modifications on srpa under regular and real wave conditions is discussed below 4 1 effect of float design on srpa performance the natural frequency of the srpa is heavily affected by the geometry of the float body al shami et al 2019 the dynamic response of reference srpa is analyzed by changing the float geometry adding a damper plate to the reference float increases the added mass of float ten times higher than the added mass of the reference float designs the damping plate design has a larger surface area which displaces more water for each srpa oscillation since the diameter of the float at the water surface is low the radiation damping of the float is negligible the increase in the added mass of the damper plate float affects the dynamic behavior and power capture performance of the srpa 4 1 1 regular waves the performance of the srpa is analyzed under the regular and real wave conditions for the float designs as shown in fig 3 a torus with reference geometry trg is considered for all three cases the natural period of the srpa with reference float frg is 10s for the chosen sea sites the energetic wave power conditions are distributed over different wave periods for sea site 44066 the high energy period occurs at 5 9s whereas for sea site 46069 the high energy period occurs at 10 17s in fig 7 a the relative displacement between float and torus is plotted under regular wave conditions the reference geometry and the cylinder designs show peak relative displacement near a wave period of 10s whereas for the damping plate design a peak relative displacement is not observed as the response curve keeps increasing up to wave periods of 15s for lower wave periods 13s the reference geometry and cylindrical designs produce more relative displacement than the srpa with the damping plate for higher wave periods 13s the damping plate design produces more relative displacement comparing reference geometry and cylindrical float designs the difference in relative displacement is negligible for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s fcylinder design shows an 18 increase in relative displacement all the srpas with different float designs have the same reference torus geometry trg with the same heave rao the heave response of the torus increases linearly and reaches a maximum at a wave period of 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the heave response of the torus saturates since the surface area of the torus on the water air interface is high the torus body generates radiation damping the radiation damping of the torus dampens the oscillatory motion of the torus for wave periods higher than 10s the surface area of float designs at the water air interface is negligible which creates negligible radiation damping the slender design of reference and cylinder floats increases the heave response linearly and reaches a maximum at wave period of 12s the heave response of the torus is three times higher than the heave response of the reference and the cylindrical float designs for wave periods less than 10s this leads to an increase in relative heave displacement the heave response of torus saturates for wave periods higher than 10s and the heave response of reference and cylinder floats are in same magnitude as the torus which leads to decreased relative motion increased added mass of the damping plate float design reduces the heave response of float by three times lower than the torus heave response although the heave response of torus saturates after a wave period of 10s the heave response magnitude is two times higher than the damping plate float design therefore the relative displacement of damping plate float increases linearly with the wave period under regular wave conditions the frg design has the highest peak power compared to other designs see fig 7d the damping plate design shows a near 50 reduction in peak absorbed power the peak absorbed power of the frg and fcylinder designs is observed to occur at the same wave period 10s natural period the fdp design moves the natural period of the srpa to a higher wave period 12s although fcylinder design has the same natural period as frg the fcylinder design shows a 5 reduction in peak absorbed power for the wave periods lower than 13s the power absorbed by the srpa with fdp design is lower than the other two designs for higher wave periods 13s the fdp design captures ten times more power than other designs the damping plate design of the float requires to displace large amounts of water for each oscillation which reduces the relative velocity between the float and torus in slender body design the relative velocity of the srpa is high compared to the damping plate design which increases the captured power of slender float designs comparing the frg and fcylinder design the frg design captures more power for wave periods less than the natural period 10s and fcylinder captures 5 more power for wave periods higher than the natural period 10s 4 1 2 real waves under real wave conditions the srpa exhibits a non linear trend in relative displacement see fig 7b and c for sea site 44066 the relative displacement observed between the float designs shows a small difference for lower wave periods 10s for higher wave periods 10s the cylinder float design shows a 20 reduction in relative displacement and the damping plate design shows a higher relative displacement similarly for sea site 46069 the relative displacement of damping plate design is 20 higher than the other two float designs for higher wave periods 12s for lower wave periods 12s the difference in relative displacement observed is very small the power captured by srpa with different floats under real wave condition is shown in fig 7e f the power capture performance of different float designs shows a minor 5 difference for the sea site 44066 the frg and fcylinder designs show a negligible difference in captured power for wave periods less than 10s although the power captured by the damping plate design is lower than other designs for lower wave periods 10s for sea site 46069 the damping plate design shows 20 increase in captured power compared to other float designs for higher wave periods 12s increased added mass of the damping plate float design dampens the float motion for low wave periods sea site noaa 44066 however for sea site 46069 the more energetic waves are occurring for wave periods between 10 and 17s where the response of the slender body float and torus reaches in phase motion whereas the damper plate float and torus motions are out of phase the damping plate design has ten times higher added mass compared to the slender configurations and requires nearly ten times higher pto damping coefficient beatty et al 2015 showed that the peak power absorbed period of the float with a damper is higher than the slender float design however the slender float design showed better power performance compared with float with a damper plate for lower wave periods for sea site 44066 the reference float design shows the best performance among the three float designs investigated in this work although the power captured by reference float and cylindrical is similar the reference float configuration shows superior power performance for higher wave periods 12s based on our findings the damping plate float design exhibits performance at higher wave periods and is thus chosen for the sea site 46069 4 2 effect of torus design on srpa performance optimization of floating buoys has a considerable effect on the power capture performance of the wec system comparing the performance of truncated cylinder hemispherical and conical buoys it was observed that a conical buoy absorbs 10 more power goggins and finnegan 2014 pastor and liu 2014b the effect of torus geometry on the srpa is evaluated for three torus designs shown in fig 4 changing the torus cross section from truncated cylinder to wedge shape increases the added mass by 7 while increasing the wedge height of the torus the added mass becomes same as the reference torus since the diameter of all torus designs is the same at the water air interface the radiation damping generated is the same 4 2 1 regular waves the performance of srpa with different torus shapes is first analyzed under regular wave conditions with reference float geometry the relative displacement produced by the reference geometry trg and the wedge torus tw with a wedge height lw of 3 m is similar see fig 8 a shortening the wedge height lw 2 m results in a 14 increase in peak relative displacement compared with the other two torus designs the relative displacement of the srpa reduces by 30 for the shorter wedge height tw1 design compared to the reference geometry for wave periods lower than 10s however for higher wave periods 10s the relative displacement increases by 16 the peak period of relative displacement for torus tw1 moves to 12s since the reference float design is used for all torus designs the reduction in heave response of the shorter wedge torus tw1 reduces the relative displacement of the srpa for lower wave periods the added mass of tw1 which is higher than the other two torus designs reduces the heave response for lower wave periods however the shorter wedge torus has a higher heave response for higher wave periods which attributes to the increased relative displacement of the srpa the power captured by the srpa with different torus designs under regular wave conditions is shown in fig 8d torus tw1 design shows a 4 increase in peak absorbed power compared to the reference torus both torus trg and tw2 designs have a natural period at 10s whereas torus tw1 increases the natural period to 11s although torus tw1 shows the highest peak power a 40 reduction in absorbed power for wave periods lower than 10s is observed for higher wave periods 10s the same torus tw1 design shows a 25 increase in captured power since the radiation damping of all torus designs is the same the relative motion between float and torus is affected by the added mass increased added mass of tw1 reduces the dynamic motion of the torus which in turn reduces the relative velocity of the system however for higher wave periods tw1 shows higher relative velocity compared to other torus designs 4 2 2 real waves in real wave conditions reference float frg is used for sea site 44066 and damper plate float fdp for sea site 46069 for sea site 44066 the relative displacement of short wedge height torus tw1 is 10 higher than the other torus designs for lower wave periods 10s as shown in fig 8b for wave periods higher than 10s the reference torus shows higher relative displacement for sea site 46069 the difference in relative displacement between the torus designs is negligible as shown in fig 8c however the reference torus design shows the highest relative displacement among the torus designs the reference torus and longer wedge torus show similar heave response while the shorter wedge torus shows a 30 reduction in heave response for lower wave periods 10s and a 12 increase in heave response for higher wave periods 10s compared to other torus designs for the lower wave period sea site noaa 44066 increased added mass of tw1 design leads to increased inertia whereas the added mass of the slender body float is lower than the torus body the difference in dynamic motion of float and tw1 is higher than other torus designs which leads to increased relative displacement for sea site 46069 the added mass of tw1 and fdp are higher and both exhibit reduced motion which attributes to reduced relative displacement similar to observations for relative displacement both trg and tw2 torus designs show a negligible difference in absorbed power until a wave period of 9s for sea site 44066 see fig 8e the power absorbed by the srpa with a torus tw1 design captured 10 more power for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the difference in absorbed power between the torus designs shows a negligible difference for sea site 46069 the absorbed power of the srpa with different torus designs shows a negligible difference for wave periods similar to the relative displacement the relative displacement between the slender float body and the shorter wedge torus is higher the tw1 design which is required to displace more water reduces its motion whereas frg oscillates freely the combination of increased inertia of torus and free oscillation of float increases the power performance of the srpa on sea site 44066 the oscillation of fdp is dampened by increased added mass and differences in added mass between the torus designs are small 7 leads to a negligible difference in power performance 4 3 effect of changing the wedged torus diameter the diameter of the floating buoy changes the power absorbing performance of the wec system increasing the diameter of the floating buoy increases the peak absorbed power shadman et al 2018 the added mass of the torus is directly proportional to the cross sectional area of the torus on the water plane the radiation damping is however directly proportional to the outer diameter of the torus decreasing the outer diameter of torus tod1 by 2 m reduces the added mass of the torus by 50 similarly increasing the torus diameter tod2 by 2 m increases the added mass of the torus by 50 4 3 1 regular waves the effect of the outer diameter on the performance of the torus is evaluated by using two torus designs tod1 and tod2 whose outer diameters do are 18 m and 22 m respectively see fig 4c the results are compared to tw1 which has the same shape with an outer diameter of 20 m the relative displacement of the srpa for the three cases is shown in fig 9 a it is observed that changing the outer diameter reduces the peak relative displacement in the srpa a 12 reduction is observed for tod1 while a 6 reduction is observed for tod2 in addition tod2 moves the peak relative displacement to a lower wave period for wave periods lower than 9s both modified torus designs show increased relative displacement tod2 shows a 40 increase while tod1 shows a 14 increase in relative displacement than the tw1 design for wave periods higher than 9s the relative displacement of tod2 drops by 23 whereas tod1 shows a negligible difference in the relative displacement compared with tw1 increasing the outer diameter of the torus increases the added mass which increases the inertia of the body increased added mass reduces the heave response of the torus whereas the slender float heave response higher for lower wave periods and increases the relative motion between the bodies decreasing the diameter reduces the inertial effect of the torus and reduces the relative motion between the float and torus the power performance of the srpa for different torus diameters under regular wave conditions is plotted in fig 9d shadman et al 2018 reported a floating buoy with an increase in the absorbed power without changing the natural frequency as its diameter was changed by 1 m both tw1 and tod2 designs show the same peak absorbed power with torus tod1 shows a 15 reduction in the same parameter the srpa with torus tw1 or tod1 designs has a natural period of 10s however tod2 which has a larger outer diameter has a lower natural period of 9s for wave periods lower than 10s both tod1 and tod2 designs capture more power compared to tw1 the tod1 design shows two times increase in absorbed power whereas tod2 design shows three times increase in absorbed power however for wave periods higher than 10s the tod2 design shows a 30 reduction in absorbed power and tod1 shows a negligible difference in absorbed power since tod2 is required to displace a larger volume of water for each oscillation period compared to torus tw1 the natural period of the srpa with tod2 is expected to move to a lower period which subsequently reduces the absorbed power for higher wave periods however tod1 displaces lesser volume of water when compared to tw1 as a result of which the natural frequency and absorbed power for higher wave periods of the srpa show a negligible difference 4 3 2 real waves similar to the torus design study slender float frg is used for sea site 44066 and damper plate float fdp is used for sea site 46069 for sea site 44066 until the wave period of 10s the relative displacement produced with tod2 is higher than other designs see fig 9b for wave periods higher than 11s tod2 is observed to produce lower relative displacement in addition tod1 design shows a 30 reduction in relative displacement compared to tw1 design for sea site 46069 tod1 design shows a 30 higher relative displacement compared with other torus designs for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the relative displacement of tod1 reduces by 33 compared to other torus designs for wave periods lower than 10s tod2 design shows a 15 higher heave response compared to other torus designs whereas for wave periods higher than 10s the heave response of tod2 design reduces by 20 similarly for sea site 44066 tod2 design shows a higher heave response for lower wave periods 10s and reduced heave response for higher wave periods 10s however for sea site 46069 the heave response of tod1 design is 30 higher than other torus designs for wave periods lower than 10s and a 25 reduction in heave response for wave periods higher than 10s for the lower wave period site noaa 44066 the added mass and radiation damping of tod2 is highest among the torus designs which attributes to the increased inertia of the torus whereas the added mass and radiation damping of the slender float is low compared to the torus the difference is the inertia of the bodies tod2 and frg are higher which develops increased relative displacement on the contrary for sea site 46069 the added mass of fdp is higher and exhibits reduced motion whereas tod1 has the lowest added mass and inertia therefore the combination of tod1 and fdp shows higher relative displacement for lower wave periods however the oscillatory motion of fdp increases for higher wave periods but the oscillatory motion of trg and tod2 is lower than tod1 therefore the combination of fdp and tod2 shows higher relative displacement for higher wave periods for sea site 44066 tod2 absorbs more power for all wave periods see fig 9e the tod1 design shows nearly a 20 reduction in absorbed power than tw1 and tod2 design shows a 20 increase in absorbed power compared to tw1 design for wave periods higher than 10s the difference in captured power between tw1 and tod2 designs reduces for sea site 46069 the power captured by tod1 design is two times in magnitude compared to other torus designs for wave periods lower than 11s for higher wave periods 11s the power captured by tod1 design is 7 lower than the other designs although the difference in captured power between tw1 and tod2 is small tw1 design captures 5 more power than tod2 the dynamic motion between the frg and tod2 combination is higher compared to other torus designs the increased inertia due to increased added mass of the tod2 design is higher for all wave periods whereas the slender float frg shows increased oscillation for lower wave periods the lower oscillation of tod2 and higher oscillation of frg develops higher relative velocity the combination of tod1 and frg creates the lowest relative velocity for sea site 46069 the oscillatory motion of fdp is very low due to the higher added mass whereas the oscillatory motion of tod1 is highest among the torus designs this combination of tod1 and fdp develops increased relative velocity however for higher wave periods the increased oscillatory motion of fdp reduces the relative motion between the bodies 4 4 resistive control on srpa based on the environmental conditions of the selected sea sites the design of torus and float is chosen for the srpa system it is observed that the modified srpas produce more power at the wave periods with higher probability distribution followed by the design selection of the srpas the pto parameters are varied to improve the power performance of system a resistive control system where the pto damping coefficient is varied was chosen for analysis increasing the pto damping coefficient of a wec system increases the peak absorbed power jaya muliawan et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 increasing the pto damping coefficient above 8 mns m showed a narrower operating bandwidth jaya muliawan et al 2013 for the real wave spectrum in the present study the srpa will exhibit peak performance over a range of operating wave conditions that are specific for each site for the east coast site noaa 44066 the operating wave period is between 3 and 16 s while for the west coast site noaa 46069 the operating wave period is between 4 and 21 s an operating wave period range of 3 21 s is chosen to account for the operating range for both sites the operating wave frequency range of the selected wave period range is 0 3 2 1 rad s the optimal pto damping range is found by matching system impedance over the operating frequency range using eq 15 the optimal pto damping coefficient range for all the srpas is shown in table 4 based on this analysis the pto damping coefficient range is determined for each geometry and a parametric study is conducted over a range of 2 8 mns m fig 10 shows the power capture performance of the srpa systems with different pto damping coefficients for the east coast site the pto damping coefficient of 2 mns m shows the lowest peak absorbed power whereas 8 mns m shows the highest peak absorbed power for reference srpa for modified srpa1 the peak absorbed power with pto damping coefficients 4 mns m and 8 mns m are the same however the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m shows better performance than 8 mns m for a wide range of operating wave periods for the west coast site the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m shows better performance for wave periods less than 12s whereas the pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m shows better power performance for wave periods higher than 12s for modified srpa2 similar to reference srpa the pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m shows increased performance for wave periods above 12s for wave periods less than 10s the srpa with pto damping coefficient 8 mns m shows the least performance on both the sea sites the decreased performance of the srpa with pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m reduces the operating bandwidth which reduces the overall energy production of the srpa therefore the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m is selected for the performance comparison of the srpas the annual energy produced by the srpas with different pto damping coefficients is shown in table 5 the operating bandwidth of the pto coefficient plays a significant role in the annual power performance of the srpa 4 5 annual energy production since the wave statistics of the sea site vary from site to site a different combination of float and torus is required to extract maximum power the present design parametric study provides the guideline for wec developers to select individual components on site specific wave conditions the site specific design of srpa enhances the modularity in design which reduces the cost by improving the supply chain for wec developers to extract wave energy on east coast the modified srpa1 which is a combination of reference float frg and shorter wedge torus with an outer diameter of 22 m tod2 is chosen see fig 11 b for the west coast the modified srpa2 which is a combination of damping plate float fdp and shorter wedge torus tw1 is chosen see fig 11c the annual mean energy produced by the srpas on each sea site is evaluated by computing the product of the sea state matrix and power matrix of the srpa under regular wave conditions the power matrix of the srpa shows the natural period of the system the power matrices of modified srpas are shown in fig 12 b c the reference srpa shows maximum absorbed power for the wave periods around 10s see fig 12a whereas modifiedsrpas show maximum absorbed power at wave periods between 9s and 12s for modified srpa1 the floating body remains the same as the reference srpa whereas changing the torus to tod2 moves the natural period to a lower wave period since the modified srpa1 is operating in a low wave period site the natural period of the srpa is moved to a lower wave period the natural period of reference srpa is 10s and tuning the torus body design reduces the natural period of the system for modified srpa2 the floating body of the system is changed from slender float to damper plate float to increase the natural period the modified srpa2 requires a drastic increase in the natural period of the system adding a damper plate to the float body increases the natural period of the srpa however under real wave conditions srpas show maximum absorbed power for wave periods higher than the natural period of the system see fig 13 a b for the east coast site the maximum energy period occurs between wave periods 11 13s while for the west coast site the maximum energy period occurs between wave periods 12 15s therefore the absorbed power of modified srpas is higher for wave periods higher than the predominant peak periods of the sea sites under regular wave conditions comparing the annual energy production with srpa1 and srpa2 shows 10 and 26 increments compared to reference srpa see table 6 for sea site 44066 annual energy produced by modified srpa1 is 19 higher than reference srpa for sea site 46069 annual energy produced by modified srpa2 is 6 higher than reference srpa 4 5 1 monthly variation in produced power the wave energy content of the sea varies from month to month the monthly wave statistics for selected sea sites are generated and the monthly average captured power is evaluated and shown in fig 14 the power captured by the srpas is normalized with the total wetted outer surface area of the device shown in table 6 the normalized captured power can be used to scale the power performance of similar srpa devices with different dimensions under regular wave conditions the power captured by modified srpa1 is 2 7 higher than power captured by reference srpa for all months the wave conditions for the east coast site are always distributed for lower wave periods 5 9s therefore the selected combination of srpa1 always generates more power for all seasons during the winter months oct apr modified srpa2 captures two times more power compared to reference srpa however reference srpa captures more power during the summer months for the west coast site the wave conditions are distributed over lower wave periods 4 9s for the summer months the power capture performance of slender body float is higher in lower wave periods which increases the power production of reference srpa under real wave conditions power captured by srpas reduces by 57 compared to regular wave conditions similar to regular wave conditions modified srpa1 captures 12 more power than reference srpa for all months for sea site 46069 the difference in absorbed power between the reference srpa and modified srpa2 drops during winter months modified srpa2 captures 13 more power compared to the reference srpa whereas during summer months reference srpa captures 8 more power compared to modified srpa2 although the energy captured by modified srpa2 drops by 8 the overall annual energy produced by modified srpa2 is 6 higher than the reference srpa the added mass of the damper plate float is higher compared to slender body float which increases the overall hydrodynamic damping of srpa by matching the pto damping with hydrodynamic damping of srpa2 annual energy production can be greatly improved 5 conclusion the present study models the srpa for site specific wave conditions the performance of different float and torus designs is analyzed under real wave conditions observed on the east and west coast of the united states the performance of the modified srpas is studied under real wave conditions the performance study on geometries of the srpa is used to identify the best combination of srpa for selected sea sites the following major conclusions can be made for sea sites with higher wave periods 12s the float with a damping plate was the best design as adding the damping plate moves the peak operating period to higher wave periods 12s and increases the added mass of the float for lower wave period 10s sea sites the float with a slender body design is found to be the best choice the torus design with shorter wedge length was found to perform well under both regular and real wave conditions for lower wave period 10s sea sites increasing the outer diameter increased the power performance of the srpa however for higher wave period 12s sea sites increasing the outer diameter of the torus results in reduced power performance for higher wave heights dynamic motion of damper plate float and torus are in phase which reduces the relative velocity between the bodies based on the design modifications a combination of float and torus shapes may be used for different sea sites for low period site east coast srpa1 consists of slender body float and shorter wedge torus with increased outer diameter is selected for the high period site west coast srpa2 consists of damper plate float and shorter wedge torus is used the power captured by modified srpas are 10 and 26 higher than the reference srpa under regular wave conditions for low wave period sites east coast srpa1 resulted in a 19 increase in captured power compared to the reference srpa for high wave period sites west coast srpa2 captured 6 more power than reference srpa a resistive control system is used with the pto damping coefficient varied between 2 and 8 mns m a damping coefficient of 4 mns m showed the best performance for all both the modified srpa designs at their respective ocean sites when compared to the reference srpa although a further increase in the pto damping coefficient to 8 mn m increased the power performance of the reference srpas it reduces the operating bandwidth of the device such that the power performance fell sharply for wave periods less than 10s this is particularly significant for the west coast site where the peak wave period is larger than 10s this implies that the srpa geometry determines the natural period of the system while the pto control system determines the operating bandwidth and peak power annual variation of the modified designs is also estimated the modified srpa1 captured 2 7 more power compared to reference srpa for all months whereas modified srpa2 captured 13 more power during winter months and 8 reduced power during summer months compared to reference power the annual energy produced by the modified srpas under real wave conditions demonstrates the feasibility to enhance the efficiency of srpa by proper design selection of components for a specific wave site such approaches of choosing float and torus to match site specific wave conditions allow for modularity in design and cost reduction as wave energy technologies mature and the supply chain for a wec developer needs to be established credit authorship

20230,power performance of floating wave energy converters is typically performed under regular wave conditions or using standard ocean spectrum models with one peak we explore the effect of device geometry of a self reacting point absorber srpa for real wave spectrum having multiple peaks different float and torus designs are evaluated to alter the cut off frequency of the srpa to extract more power in operating wave periods representative of two real ocean sites a float with a damping plate was more suitable for higher wave periods while a slender body float was preferred for lower wave periods increasing the torus outer diameter increased the absorbed power by 20 for low wave period while the absorbed power was reduced by 5 for a high wave period site the modified srpa with slender body float showed a four fold increase in annual energy production when compared to regular wave conditions for the low wave period site for the high wave period sea site a modified srpa with a damping plate showed a 6 increase in annual energy production the study shows that while the geometry of the srpa determines the operating period the pto damping can be varied to determine the operating bandwidth keywords wave energy self reacting point absorber wave spectrum regular and real wave 1 introduction floating point absorbers are a type of wave energy converters wec that is conceptually simple due to the absence of complex moving parts that reduce operations and maintenance costs amir et al 2014 wang et al 2011 ahn et al 2012 pecher and kofoed 2017 to the wec designer the main challenges in moving the technology from research to commercial stage are related to optimizing the device hydrodynamics power take off pto system and developing optimal control protocols to maximize the performance of the wec for varying sea states while ensuring self alignment for varying wave directions and survivability during storm surges and extreme waves drew et al 2009 falnes 2007 osorio et al 2016 antonio 2010 al shami et al 2019 the parameters above are interdependent i e the sea state condition determines the geometry and sizing of the wec that affects the hydrodynamic erselcan and kükner 2020 performance which affects the pto coefficients followed by the control algorithm al shami et al 2019 for near shore h λ ½ application a single body point absorber is employed and it consists of a floating buoy attached to a ground based direct drive generator pastor and liu 2014a several engineering solutions have been proposed to improve the power performance of single body point absorbers several studies gao et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 have focused on improving the power take off system for increased power capturing performance the natural frequency of the system was altered by changing the spring constant of the linear pto which increases the energy capture bandwidth of the point absorber with the proper choice of mass ratio binh et al 2016 experimentally evaluated the power performance of single body wec with a mechanical pto system under regular wave conditions erselcan et al erselcan and kükner 2020 carried a parametric study to enhance the power capture performance of the single body floating point absorber among the different float designs analyzed the power capture performance of the semi ellipsoid and semi elliptic paraboloid performed better than circular cylinder float rodrigues et al rodríguez et al 2020 improved the power capture performance of sloped single body point absorber using the generate and test method with the exhaustive search method the modified device showed two time increase in wave energy absorption esmaeilzadeh et al esmaeilzadeh and alam 2019 carried out a shape parametric study on submerged heaving plate to increase the power capture performance of single body wec under different wave directionality the wec performance is improved by elongating the shape of the wec in the wave direction goggins et al goggins and finnegan 2014 performed a parametric shape study on vertically heaving single body point absorber for a test site off the west coast of ireland the power performance was calculated for various buoy shapes that include a truncated cylinder whose design was subsequently modified to add a hemispherical and a chamfered base it was found that the power captured by the cylinder with a hemispherical base was superior to the other designs pastor et al pastor and liu 2014b compared the performance in the frequency domain of two floating buoys of hemispherical and conical cross section it was found that the conical buoy absorbs 10 more power than the hemispherical buoy shadman et al 2018 developed a methodology based on a series of frequency domain and statistical analysis and optimized the diameter and draft length of the single floating buoy based on the sea state of the coast of brazil the peak absorbed power of the wec was found to increase with increasing buoy diameter while the resonant period of the wec increased with an increase in draft length liang et al 2017 compared the power performance of single body floating wec with two different pto systems mechanical motion rectifier and linear system the experimental study revealed that the mechanical motion rectifier system produced more power than the linear pto system since the energy density of the ocean waves decreases as the surface waves approach the shore the placement of the point absorbers in the deep sea h λ ½ allows for the possibility of an increase in power production alamian et al 2017 performed experiments to enhance the performance of point absorbers at various ocean depths and investigated heave pitch and surge motions it was observed that the heave and pitch motions increased with an increase in depth of still water the surge motion decreased under similar conditions the performance of the point absorber was improved in heave motion only with the device is operating in deep water since the placement of a ground based generator is not feasible in the deep sea a self reacting point absorber srpa is typically considered a viable alternative with several developers working on the concept of a floating two body srpa similar to the wavebob dick 2011 developed in the late 1990s the device consists of two concentric axisymmetric bodies a submerged body that acts as a reference to the system and is called the float and a floating body called the torus and floats on the surface of the ocean martin et al 2020 experimentally evaluated the power performance of 1 30 scaled one and two body wecs it was observed that the power captured by the two body system increased by 50 shami et al al shami et al 2019 carried out a parametric study on srpa and modified the system based on the taguchi method it was found that the shape of the float has the largest effect on the srpa a spherical float was observed to have less added mass and radiating capabilities and captures more power compared to a float which was cylindrical in shape in addition the pto stiffness of the system showed a significant effect on the bandwidth of the operating frequency whereas pto damping had a large effect on the captured power of the system muliawan et al jaya muliawan et al 2013 performed a numerical analysis on the srpa wavebob under regular and irregular wave conditions and observed that increasing the damping coefficient increases the peak power and narrows down the operating bandwidth in addition the peak power period could be moved to higher wave periods by increasing the pto stiffness the effects of mooring configurations on the performance of the device were also investigated and it was determined that the srpa with mooring produced 5 less power compared to srpa without mooring beatty et al 2015 compared the power capture performance of the srpa with two different floating reference bodies the first design was slender and similar to wavebob while the second design is similar to the ocean power technologies wec design and has a damping plate mounted on the float draper 2006 it was reported that the slender floating body showed peak power capture performance in higher wave frequency while the float with a damping plate showed peak performance in lower wave frequency beatty et al 2019 extended the performance comparison of srpas under an irregular wave spectrum the authors implemented the pierson moskovitz spectrum to replicate the irregular wave conditions of vancouver island in canada for the selected sea site the srpa with damping plate produced 41 more mean annual energy compared to the slender srpa based on a detailed literature review by the authors shown in table 1 most studies that involve srpas evaluate the power performance and capture width ratio based on idealized regular wave conditions babarit et al 2011 2012 liang and zuo 2017 sheng and lewis 2016 chao et al 2018 kalidoss and banerjee 2019 miquel et al 2020 yetkin et al 2021 the power generated by floating wecs is dependent on the ability of the device to attain resonance in response to the prevailing wave conditions the power performance of wec is like a low pass filter in terms of energy in the frequency domain for the wave frequencies above the resonant frequency the power captured by the wec drops sharply a single design of wec does not fit all the ocean conditions thus the geometric parameters should be modified based on the selected sea sites coe et al 2021 a smaller set of studies select a wave spectrum based on real sea sites however the wave spectrum in those studies was simplified using standard ocean spectrum models jonswap representing the real spectrum with one peak in real wave conditions the wave spectrum has multiple peaks in this paper we numerically evaluate the power capture performance of an srpa for various float and torus designs for two different sea sites with distinct operating wave periods the srpa designs were modified in the present study to alter the cut off frequency of the srpa to extract more power in those operating wave periods representative of the two sea sites the present work provides an insight into the extent of influence of geometric characteristics of srpa s under realistic operating conditions a feature that cannot be captured using regular waves to facilitate the validation of our numerical simulation the results are compared with experimental data available for a scaled 1 25 two body srpa in literature beatty et al 2015 2019 fig 1 shows the schematic of the reference srpa selected for analysis the float and torus are wave following devices and oscillate at different frequencies with the wave the relative motion between the two in the heave vertical direction is used for energy conversion for the current analysis the mass of the floating bodies float and torus is considered as the mass of srpa the mass of the pto system and the mooring lines that are used to counteract the drift forces are neglected babarit et al 2011 a direct drive linear generator that is modeled using a spring damper system is used as the pto unit for this study three different float and three different torus shapes are analyzed in addition the effect of variation in the outer diameter of the torus on the power capture performance of the srpa is analyzed the current design improvement study under real wave conditions would provide added guidance to wec developers to enhance the efficiency of srpa and thereby enhancing its commercial readiness rather than pursuing an approach where the device geometry is optimized based on a specific sea state we choose an approach where we study different float and torus shapes to provide alternate designs for the end user who can then mix and match components to match their sea states such flexibility in approach is crucial for supply chain consideration as wave energy technologies become more matured and it would not be cost effective for the developer to optimize and manufacture designs for specific sea sites 2 wave energy sites the mean energy content of the ocean wave varies from site to site and so it is important to consider the wave resource when performing design iterations to increase the absorbed power of the device in this study wave statistics of two sea sites are chosen on each along the east and west coasts of the united states with proximity to the city of new york and philadelphia on the east coast and the city of los angeles on the west coast see fig 2 a and b the wave statistics for the chosen sites are taken from national data buoy center 2017 and shown in fig 2c and d the combined probability distribution of wave conditions is different for the two sites for the east coast noaa 44066 the wave conditions are distributed between the wave periods 6 10s whereas for the west coast noaa 46069 the wave conditions are distributed over the wave periods of 11 16s the annual mean energy content of chosen sea sites is shown in table 2 the mean annual energy content of the west coast is twice the mean annual energy content of the east coast the water depth of the west coast is 12 times higher than the water depth of east coast which attributes to the high energy content in the waves the hourly spectral data of the two sea sites is estimated for wec performance evaluation in this work the hourly spectrum for one year 2016 was separated into different bins based on their significant wave height m and dominant wave period s the separated spectrums for each bin are averaged to have a representative spectrum for that bin using this representative averaged spectrum for a bin the power matrix of srpa is computed the seasonal variations of significant wave height and wave energy content are shown in fig 2f and g fig 2e shows the highest energy content spectrum for both sea sites for noaa 44066 highest energy content spectrum occurs at a significant wave height of 8 m and a wave period of 11s for noaa 46069 the highest energy content occurs at a significant wave height of 6 m and a wave period of 19s both the sea sites showed high wave energy content during the winter months with the wave energy content dropping by 75 during the summer months the annual sea state matrix of the sea sites is split into monthly sea state matrices and the monthly mean energy production by srpas is evaluated see fig 2g 3 methods 3 1 geometries of float and torus the srpa design analyzed in muliawan et al 2011 is chosen as the reference design for the present study experiments on 1 25 scaled srpa model under regular wave conditions with two different floating reference bodies showed that the float with a slender body has higher performance in lower wave periods whereas the float with damping plate has higher performance in higher wave periods beatty et al 2015 to understand the effect of float on the srpa three different float designs are chosen for analysis this included a reference geometry frg a float geometry with a damping plate fdp and a float without a damping plate that is shaped like a cylinder fcylinder the schematic of the various float designs are shown in fig 3 a c parametric studies on power performance found in the literature pastor and liu 2014a shadman et al 2018 on single body point absorbers improved the wec performance by changing the buoy shape diameter and draft length under regular wave conditions similarly to analyze the effect of variations in the design of a torus we chose three different torus designs this includes the reference torus trg shown in fig 4 a the cross section of reference torus is cylinder with a chamfered base as a first iteration the cross section of the torus is modified to a cylinder with a wedge base and is referred to as tw see fig 4b the wedge height l w is varied and two designs are considered a 2 m case tw1 and 3 m case tw2 furthermore to study the effect of torus diameter on power performance the inner diameter is kept constant while the outer diameter d o for the wedged torus tw1 is varied as seen in fig 4c two torus designs tod1 and tod2 that have outer diameters of 18 m and 22 m respectively are considered the critical dimensions of all torus designs are listed in table 3 3 2 governing equations the equation of motion of a wave energy converter in the time domain can be written as babarit et al 2012 nolte and ertekin 2014 1 m x f e x f r a d f h f p t o where m is the mass and x is the acceleration of the device the forces considered for the current analysis include the hydrostatic force f h the wave excitation force f ex and the power take off force f pto the radiation force f rad acting on the wec system is written as 2 f r a d μ x 0 t ζ t τ x τ d τ 3 ζ t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where μ is the added mass at infinite frequency x is the velocity of the device τ is the dummy variable for integration and ζ is the radiation impulse response function and b is the radiation damping since the steepness ratio defined as wave height h to wavelength ratio λ the current analysis is small 0 0025 0 02 a linear wave theory based bem can be used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients pecher and kofoed 2017 from bem analysis it is observed that the added mass of the system is constant and the radiation damping coefficient is a function of time the past motions of the body generated waves keep propagating long after the motions are completed the convolution integral term in eq 2 accounts for the memory effect the power take off force is written as 4 f p t o b p t o x k p t o x where b pto and k pto are damping coefficient and spring constant in a direct drive linear pto system the hydrostatic force is written as 5 f h ρ g s w x where ρ and g are the density of water and acceleration due to gravity and s w is the cross sectional area of the wec at the water plane the oscillating amplitude x of the wec with the wave is very small compared to the wavelength λ therefore the cross sectional area of the wec at the water air interface is constant the wave excitation force acting on the device is written as 6 f e x r n 2 s f n δ f f e x f n e j 2 π f n t φ n where j 1 where r denotes the real part s f n is the spectral density of the wave in frequency f e x is the wave excitation force per unit wave amplitude δ f is the adequate frequency step f n is the wave frequency and φ n is the random phase seed the form drag force acting on the wec is neglected sawaragi 1997 since the wec body is a bluff body the viscous force acting on the wec is dominated by form drag force pecher and kofoed 2017 the form drag forces on the wec are mainly generated from the vortex shedding due to boundary layer separation when water flows past the wec with the drag force originating due to loss of kinetic energy the viscous forces become dominated for small bodies whose characteristic dimension d is smaller than the wave height h typically d h 0 1 sawaragi 1997 in the current analysis the range of d h varies in 2 5 20 which implies that drag forces are negligible and the wec system is dominated by inertial forces the keulegan carpenter number kc provides a ratio of drag force to the inertia force on the system sawaragi 1997 the kc number range for the present analysis is 0 0056 0 885 wave force regimes in terms of kc number and d h ratio can be found in literature sawaragi 1997 with the viscous forces due to flow separation being important for higher kc numbers on the contrary for a higher d h ratio diffraction forces become dominant for our system the kc number is low 0 084 and the d h ratio is high 2 5 20 and thus an inviscid flow assumption is valid 3 3 numerical modeling boundary element method for the time domain analysis of the two body srpa hydrodynamic parameters such as added mass damping coefficient and excitation force are calculated using the potential flow solver wamit lee and newman 2013 both the boundary conditions on the wec as well as the free surface are linearized and a harmonic time dependence is adopted a cartesian coordinate system is fixed to the undisturbed free surface of water with a sign convention such that z axis positive upwards in the potential flow assumption the gradient of velocity potential φ satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ 0 in the fluid domain in harmonic time dependence the complex velocity potential ϕ is related to φ by 7 φ r ϕ e j ω t where ω is the frequency of the incident wave and t is time for boundary value problems the linearized form of the free surface condition is given as 8 ϕ z k ϕ 0 for z 0 where k ω 2 g is the infinite depth wavenumber g is the acceleration due to gravity and ϕ z is the velocity potential at the free water surface the velocity potential of the incident wave is defined as 9 ϕ 0 j g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e j k x cos β j k y sin β where the wavenumber k is the real root of the dispersion relation ω 2 g k tan k h β is the incident wave direction with respect to the positive x axis h is the water depth and a is the wave amplitude the complex velocity potential ϕ is decomposed into radiation ϕ r and diffraction components ϕ d as 10 ϕ ϕ r ϕ d where ϕ r j ω i 1 6 ξ i ϕ i and ϕ d ϕ 0 ϕ s in eq 9 ξ i the complex amplitudes of the oscillating body ϕ i corresponds to the unit amplitude radiation potential ϕ 0 incident wave potential and ϕ s represents the scattered disturbance of the incident wave by the body fixed at its undisturbed position at the undisturbed position the radiation and diffraction potential conditions are 11 ϕ i n n i ϕ d n 0 the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated from the radiation and diffraction velocity potentials the output parameters that include the added mass coefficient a i k and damping coefficient b i k are related as 12 a i k j ω b i k ρ s b n i ϕ k d s these coefficients can also be written in non dimensional form for both added mass a i k and damping coefficient b i k as newman 1977 13 a i k a i k ρ l a b i k b i k ρ l a ω where l and ρ are the characteristic length of the body and density of the water respectively the value of a is given by a 3 for i k 1 2 3 a 4 for i 1 2 3 and k 4 5 6 a 5 for i k 4 5 6 with i k specifying the mode of the device and takes values between 1 and 3 for translation motion in all three axes and values of 4 6 for angular motion about all the three axes the excitation force x i is calculated in wamit using the haskind relation lee and newman 2013 for the incident wave potential ϕ 0 as 14 x i j ω ρ s b n i ϕ 0 ϕ i ϕ 0 n d s the non dimensional excitation force coefficient x i is obtained by dividing eq 13 by the hydrodynamic pressure ρ g a l m acting on the system for a given mode with m being dependent on the mode of the device i e m 2 for i k 1 2 3 m 2 for i 1 2 3 and k 4 5 6 m 3 for i k 4 5 6 3 3 1 wec sim modeling a wec involves a mathematical representation of the complex interaction between the incident waves device motion and the power take off for the present analysis an open source code wec sim wec sim user manual 2016 developed by national renewable energy laboratory usa is used to simulate the dynamic motion of the wec for different wave conditions the power output from the wec is calculated using the radiation and diffraction method fig 5 shows the workflow used in wec sim the implementation involves a three step process that involves a pre processing b time domain simulation and c post processing the pre processing step consists of the creation of geometry calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients and post processing hydrodynamic coefficients the wetted surface of the srpa is created and surface panels are meshed to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients the grid convergence study for the srpa is carried out with three panel sizes the maximum sizes of the panels are limited to 10 5 and 2 5 mm the response amplitude operator rao of the srpa is compared for different panel sizes and difference was negligible therefore the maximum panel size of 5 mm is chosen for surface meshing the two bodies of the srpa are surface meshed separately the float and torus consist of 63 106 and 9 106 surface panels respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated in the frequency domain in wamit and post processed into a wec sim readable format bemio see fig 5 the hydrodynamic coefficients generated by the wamit are non dimensionalized with density and characteristic length in the pre processing step bemio creates the absolute values for hydrodynamic coefficients the second block shows the steps involving the time domain simulations the multi body dynamic system of the wec i e the hydrodynamic body float and torus in our case constraint pto system and the reference frame are modeled in simulink and the physical properties such as body mass moment of inertia and the initial position of the system are defined in the present analysis the srpa is constrained with one degree of freedom and srpa can oscillate only in heave direction see fig 1 a direct drive linear pto system is used for all simulations the instantaneous motion forces on the srpa and pto power are calculated in the time domain and the computed forces and pto power are time averaged to remove the initial transients in the numerical solution the first 15 wave periods of data are removed similar to studies reported in the literature muliawan et al 2011 3 3 2 validation verification to validate and verify our numerical results we compare our simulations with experimental data for a 1 25 scaled model available in the literature beatty et al 2015 2019 the experiments were performed in regular and irregular pierson moskowitz spectrum wave conditions the pto damping coefficient for the model is calculated analytically using eq 15 15 b p t o b 33 2 ω m μ 33 c 33 ω 2 1 2 where b 33 is the hydrodynamic damping coefficient in heave direction m mass of the system μ 33 is the added mass in heave direction and c 33 is the hydrostatic stiffness the hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass radiation damping and wave excitation forces for the scaled model are calculated using the potential flow solver wamit with the calculated hydrodynamic coefficients in the heave direction for each wave frequency the pto damping coefficient of the scaled model is calculated analytically using eq 15 the range of pto damping coefficient for the scaled model is 20 1950 n m as shown in fig 6 a the added mass of the srpa remains constant with a change in wave frequency a similar trend was observed in the experiment the offset between the two datasets is attributed to the absence of viscous forces in our potential flow solutions using wamit however the wave excitation force from the simulations is in good agreement with the experimental results beatty et al 2015 and decreases with an increase in wave frequency see fig 6b the excitation force reaches a minimum value near 3 rad s a sharp change in the excitation phase of the srpa is observed our simulation results capture this sharp change in the excitation phase at the same wave frequency as in the experiments see inset plot in fig 6b to further expand the validation envelope the comparison is extended to additional parameters that include the response amplitude operator rao and normalized power in the experiments the srpa exhibits the maximum response at its natural frequency of 2 rad s the simulations were able to predict this maximum response see fig 6c however the peak response obtained from simulations over predicts that of the experiments probably due to the inviscid flow solution that results in a negligible hydrodynamic damping coefficient the numerical results show good agreement with experiments for wave frequencies smaller and larger than the natural frequency the captured power of the device under both regular and irregular waves was estimated and is in good agreement when the wec operates at frequencies other than the natural frequency the overshoot in response amplitude and added mass is once again due to the assumption that the viscous effect is negligible 4 results and discussion the dynamic behavior and power performance of srpa are simulated for varying float and torus designs the effect of geometrical modifications on srpa under regular and real wave conditions is discussed below 4 1 effect of float design on srpa performance the natural frequency of the srpa is heavily affected by the geometry of the float body al shami et al 2019 the dynamic response of reference srpa is analyzed by changing the float geometry adding a damper plate to the reference float increases the added mass of float ten times higher than the added mass of the reference float designs the damping plate design has a larger surface area which displaces more water for each srpa oscillation since the diameter of the float at the water surface is low the radiation damping of the float is negligible the increase in the added mass of the damper plate float affects the dynamic behavior and power capture performance of the srpa 4 1 1 regular waves the performance of the srpa is analyzed under the regular and real wave conditions for the float designs as shown in fig 3 a torus with reference geometry trg is considered for all three cases the natural period of the srpa with reference float frg is 10s for the chosen sea sites the energetic wave power conditions are distributed over different wave periods for sea site 44066 the high energy period occurs at 5 9s whereas for sea site 46069 the high energy period occurs at 10 17s in fig 7 a the relative displacement between float and torus is plotted under regular wave conditions the reference geometry and the cylinder designs show peak relative displacement near a wave period of 10s whereas for the damping plate design a peak relative displacement is not observed as the response curve keeps increasing up to wave periods of 15s for lower wave periods 13s the reference geometry and cylindrical designs produce more relative displacement than the srpa with the damping plate for higher wave periods 13s the damping plate design produces more relative displacement comparing reference geometry and cylindrical float designs the difference in relative displacement is negligible for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s fcylinder design shows an 18 increase in relative displacement all the srpas with different float designs have the same reference torus geometry trg with the same heave rao the heave response of the torus increases linearly and reaches a maximum at a wave period of 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the heave response of the torus saturates since the surface area of the torus on the water air interface is high the torus body generates radiation damping the radiation damping of the torus dampens the oscillatory motion of the torus for wave periods higher than 10s the surface area of float designs at the water air interface is negligible which creates negligible radiation damping the slender design of reference and cylinder floats increases the heave response linearly and reaches a maximum at wave period of 12s the heave response of the torus is three times higher than the heave response of the reference and the cylindrical float designs for wave periods less than 10s this leads to an increase in relative heave displacement the heave response of torus saturates for wave periods higher than 10s and the heave response of reference and cylinder floats are in same magnitude as the torus which leads to decreased relative motion increased added mass of the damping plate float design reduces the heave response of float by three times lower than the torus heave response although the heave response of torus saturates after a wave period of 10s the heave response magnitude is two times higher than the damping plate float design therefore the relative displacement of damping plate float increases linearly with the wave period under regular wave conditions the frg design has the highest peak power compared to other designs see fig 7d the damping plate design shows a near 50 reduction in peak absorbed power the peak absorbed power of the frg and fcylinder designs is observed to occur at the same wave period 10s natural period the fdp design moves the natural period of the srpa to a higher wave period 12s although fcylinder design has the same natural period as frg the fcylinder design shows a 5 reduction in peak absorbed power for the wave periods lower than 13s the power absorbed by the srpa with fdp design is lower than the other two designs for higher wave periods 13s the fdp design captures ten times more power than other designs the damping plate design of the float requires to displace large amounts of water for each oscillation which reduces the relative velocity between the float and torus in slender body design the relative velocity of the srpa is high compared to the damping plate design which increases the captured power of slender float designs comparing the frg and fcylinder design the frg design captures more power for wave periods less than the natural period 10s and fcylinder captures 5 more power for wave periods higher than the natural period 10s 4 1 2 real waves under real wave conditions the srpa exhibits a non linear trend in relative displacement see fig 7b and c for sea site 44066 the relative displacement observed between the float designs shows a small difference for lower wave periods 10s for higher wave periods 10s the cylinder float design shows a 20 reduction in relative displacement and the damping plate design shows a higher relative displacement similarly for sea site 46069 the relative displacement of damping plate design is 20 higher than the other two float designs for higher wave periods 12s for lower wave periods 12s the difference in relative displacement observed is very small the power captured by srpa with different floats under real wave condition is shown in fig 7e f the power capture performance of different float designs shows a minor 5 difference for the sea site 44066 the frg and fcylinder designs show a negligible difference in captured power for wave periods less than 10s although the power captured by the damping plate design is lower than other designs for lower wave periods 10s for sea site 46069 the damping plate design shows 20 increase in captured power compared to other float designs for higher wave periods 12s increased added mass of the damping plate float design dampens the float motion for low wave periods sea site noaa 44066 however for sea site 46069 the more energetic waves are occurring for wave periods between 10 and 17s where the response of the slender body float and torus reaches in phase motion whereas the damper plate float and torus motions are out of phase the damping plate design has ten times higher added mass compared to the slender configurations and requires nearly ten times higher pto damping coefficient beatty et al 2015 showed that the peak power absorbed period of the float with a damper is higher than the slender float design however the slender float design showed better power performance compared with float with a damper plate for lower wave periods for sea site 44066 the reference float design shows the best performance among the three float designs investigated in this work although the power captured by reference float and cylindrical is similar the reference float configuration shows superior power performance for higher wave periods 12s based on our findings the damping plate float design exhibits performance at higher wave periods and is thus chosen for the sea site 46069 4 2 effect of torus design on srpa performance optimization of floating buoys has a considerable effect on the power capture performance of the wec system comparing the performance of truncated cylinder hemispherical and conical buoys it was observed that a conical buoy absorbs 10 more power goggins and finnegan 2014 pastor and liu 2014b the effect of torus geometry on the srpa is evaluated for three torus designs shown in fig 4 changing the torus cross section from truncated cylinder to wedge shape increases the added mass by 7 while increasing the wedge height of the torus the added mass becomes same as the reference torus since the diameter of all torus designs is the same at the water air interface the radiation damping generated is the same 4 2 1 regular waves the performance of srpa with different torus shapes is first analyzed under regular wave conditions with reference float geometry the relative displacement produced by the reference geometry trg and the wedge torus tw with a wedge height lw of 3 m is similar see fig 8 a shortening the wedge height lw 2 m results in a 14 increase in peak relative displacement compared with the other two torus designs the relative displacement of the srpa reduces by 30 for the shorter wedge height tw1 design compared to the reference geometry for wave periods lower than 10s however for higher wave periods 10s the relative displacement increases by 16 the peak period of relative displacement for torus tw1 moves to 12s since the reference float design is used for all torus designs the reduction in heave response of the shorter wedge torus tw1 reduces the relative displacement of the srpa for lower wave periods the added mass of tw1 which is higher than the other two torus designs reduces the heave response for lower wave periods however the shorter wedge torus has a higher heave response for higher wave periods which attributes to the increased relative displacement of the srpa the power captured by the srpa with different torus designs under regular wave conditions is shown in fig 8d torus tw1 design shows a 4 increase in peak absorbed power compared to the reference torus both torus trg and tw2 designs have a natural period at 10s whereas torus tw1 increases the natural period to 11s although torus tw1 shows the highest peak power a 40 reduction in absorbed power for wave periods lower than 10s is observed for higher wave periods 10s the same torus tw1 design shows a 25 increase in captured power since the radiation damping of all torus designs is the same the relative motion between float and torus is affected by the added mass increased added mass of tw1 reduces the dynamic motion of the torus which in turn reduces the relative velocity of the system however for higher wave periods tw1 shows higher relative velocity compared to other torus designs 4 2 2 real waves in real wave conditions reference float frg is used for sea site 44066 and damper plate float fdp for sea site 46069 for sea site 44066 the relative displacement of short wedge height torus tw1 is 10 higher than the other torus designs for lower wave periods 10s as shown in fig 8b for wave periods higher than 10s the reference torus shows higher relative displacement for sea site 46069 the difference in relative displacement between the torus designs is negligible as shown in fig 8c however the reference torus design shows the highest relative displacement among the torus designs the reference torus and longer wedge torus show similar heave response while the shorter wedge torus shows a 30 reduction in heave response for lower wave periods 10s and a 12 increase in heave response for higher wave periods 10s compared to other torus designs for the lower wave period sea site noaa 44066 increased added mass of tw1 design leads to increased inertia whereas the added mass of the slender body float is lower than the torus body the difference in dynamic motion of float and tw1 is higher than other torus designs which leads to increased relative displacement for sea site 46069 the added mass of tw1 and fdp are higher and both exhibit reduced motion which attributes to reduced relative displacement similar to observations for relative displacement both trg and tw2 torus designs show a negligible difference in absorbed power until a wave period of 9s for sea site 44066 see fig 8e the power absorbed by the srpa with a torus tw1 design captured 10 more power for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the difference in absorbed power between the torus designs shows a negligible difference for sea site 46069 the absorbed power of the srpa with different torus designs shows a negligible difference for wave periods similar to the relative displacement the relative displacement between the slender float body and the shorter wedge torus is higher the tw1 design which is required to displace more water reduces its motion whereas frg oscillates freely the combination of increased inertia of torus and free oscillation of float increases the power performance of the srpa on sea site 44066 the oscillation of fdp is dampened by increased added mass and differences in added mass between the torus designs are small 7 leads to a negligible difference in power performance 4 3 effect of changing the wedged torus diameter the diameter of the floating buoy changes the power absorbing performance of the wec system increasing the diameter of the floating buoy increases the peak absorbed power shadman et al 2018 the added mass of the torus is directly proportional to the cross sectional area of the torus on the water plane the radiation damping is however directly proportional to the outer diameter of the torus decreasing the outer diameter of torus tod1 by 2 m reduces the added mass of the torus by 50 similarly increasing the torus diameter tod2 by 2 m increases the added mass of the torus by 50 4 3 1 regular waves the effect of the outer diameter on the performance of the torus is evaluated by using two torus designs tod1 and tod2 whose outer diameters do are 18 m and 22 m respectively see fig 4c the results are compared to tw1 which has the same shape with an outer diameter of 20 m the relative displacement of the srpa for the three cases is shown in fig 9 a it is observed that changing the outer diameter reduces the peak relative displacement in the srpa a 12 reduction is observed for tod1 while a 6 reduction is observed for tod2 in addition tod2 moves the peak relative displacement to a lower wave period for wave periods lower than 9s both modified torus designs show increased relative displacement tod2 shows a 40 increase while tod1 shows a 14 increase in relative displacement than the tw1 design for wave periods higher than 9s the relative displacement of tod2 drops by 23 whereas tod1 shows a negligible difference in the relative displacement compared with tw1 increasing the outer diameter of the torus increases the added mass which increases the inertia of the body increased added mass reduces the heave response of the torus whereas the slender float heave response higher for lower wave periods and increases the relative motion between the bodies decreasing the diameter reduces the inertial effect of the torus and reduces the relative motion between the float and torus the power performance of the srpa for different torus diameters under regular wave conditions is plotted in fig 9d shadman et al 2018 reported a floating buoy with an increase in the absorbed power without changing the natural frequency as its diameter was changed by 1 m both tw1 and tod2 designs show the same peak absorbed power with torus tod1 shows a 15 reduction in the same parameter the srpa with torus tw1 or tod1 designs has a natural period of 10s however tod2 which has a larger outer diameter has a lower natural period of 9s for wave periods lower than 10s both tod1 and tod2 designs capture more power compared to tw1 the tod1 design shows two times increase in absorbed power whereas tod2 design shows three times increase in absorbed power however for wave periods higher than 10s the tod2 design shows a 30 reduction in absorbed power and tod1 shows a negligible difference in absorbed power since tod2 is required to displace a larger volume of water for each oscillation period compared to torus tw1 the natural period of the srpa with tod2 is expected to move to a lower period which subsequently reduces the absorbed power for higher wave periods however tod1 displaces lesser volume of water when compared to tw1 as a result of which the natural frequency and absorbed power for higher wave periods of the srpa show a negligible difference 4 3 2 real waves similar to the torus design study slender float frg is used for sea site 44066 and damper plate float fdp is used for sea site 46069 for sea site 44066 until the wave period of 10s the relative displacement produced with tod2 is higher than other designs see fig 9b for wave periods higher than 11s tod2 is observed to produce lower relative displacement in addition tod1 design shows a 30 reduction in relative displacement compared to tw1 design for sea site 46069 tod1 design shows a 30 higher relative displacement compared with other torus designs for wave periods less than 10s for wave periods higher than 10s the relative displacement of tod1 reduces by 33 compared to other torus designs for wave periods lower than 10s tod2 design shows a 15 higher heave response compared to other torus designs whereas for wave periods higher than 10s the heave response of tod2 design reduces by 20 similarly for sea site 44066 tod2 design shows a higher heave response for lower wave periods 10s and reduced heave response for higher wave periods 10s however for sea site 46069 the heave response of tod1 design is 30 higher than other torus designs for wave periods lower than 10s and a 25 reduction in heave response for wave periods higher than 10s for the lower wave period site noaa 44066 the added mass and radiation damping of tod2 is highest among the torus designs which attributes to the increased inertia of the torus whereas the added mass and radiation damping of the slender float is low compared to the torus the difference is the inertia of the bodies tod2 and frg are higher which develops increased relative displacement on the contrary for sea site 46069 the added mass of fdp is higher and exhibits reduced motion whereas tod1 has the lowest added mass and inertia therefore the combination of tod1 and fdp shows higher relative displacement for lower wave periods however the oscillatory motion of fdp increases for higher wave periods but the oscillatory motion of trg and tod2 is lower than tod1 therefore the combination of fdp and tod2 shows higher relative displacement for higher wave periods for sea site 44066 tod2 absorbs more power for all wave periods see fig 9e the tod1 design shows nearly a 20 reduction in absorbed power than tw1 and tod2 design shows a 20 increase in absorbed power compared to tw1 design for wave periods higher than 10s the difference in captured power between tw1 and tod2 designs reduces for sea site 46069 the power captured by tod1 design is two times in magnitude compared to other torus designs for wave periods lower than 11s for higher wave periods 11s the power captured by tod1 design is 7 lower than the other designs although the difference in captured power between tw1 and tod2 is small tw1 design captures 5 more power than tod2 the dynamic motion between the frg and tod2 combination is higher compared to other torus designs the increased inertia due to increased added mass of the tod2 design is higher for all wave periods whereas the slender float frg shows increased oscillation for lower wave periods the lower oscillation of tod2 and higher oscillation of frg develops higher relative velocity the combination of tod1 and frg creates the lowest relative velocity for sea site 46069 the oscillatory motion of fdp is very low due to the higher added mass whereas the oscillatory motion of tod1 is highest among the torus designs this combination of tod1 and fdp develops increased relative velocity however for higher wave periods the increased oscillatory motion of fdp reduces the relative motion between the bodies 4 4 resistive control on srpa based on the environmental conditions of the selected sea sites the design of torus and float is chosen for the srpa system it is observed that the modified srpas produce more power at the wave periods with higher probability distribution followed by the design selection of the srpas the pto parameters are varied to improve the power performance of system a resistive control system where the pto damping coefficient is varied was chosen for analysis increasing the pto damping coefficient of a wec system increases the peak absorbed power jaya muliawan et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 increasing the pto damping coefficient above 8 mns m showed a narrower operating bandwidth jaya muliawan et al 2013 for the real wave spectrum in the present study the srpa will exhibit peak performance over a range of operating wave conditions that are specific for each site for the east coast site noaa 44066 the operating wave period is between 3 and 16 s while for the west coast site noaa 46069 the operating wave period is between 4 and 21 s an operating wave period range of 3 21 s is chosen to account for the operating range for both sites the operating wave frequency range of the selected wave period range is 0 3 2 1 rad s the optimal pto damping range is found by matching system impedance over the operating frequency range using eq 15 the optimal pto damping coefficient range for all the srpas is shown in table 4 based on this analysis the pto damping coefficient range is determined for each geometry and a parametric study is conducted over a range of 2 8 mns m fig 10 shows the power capture performance of the srpa systems with different pto damping coefficients for the east coast site the pto damping coefficient of 2 mns m shows the lowest peak absorbed power whereas 8 mns m shows the highest peak absorbed power for reference srpa for modified srpa1 the peak absorbed power with pto damping coefficients 4 mns m and 8 mns m are the same however the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m shows better performance than 8 mns m for a wide range of operating wave periods for the west coast site the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m shows better performance for wave periods less than 12s whereas the pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m shows better power performance for wave periods higher than 12s for modified srpa2 similar to reference srpa the pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m shows increased performance for wave periods above 12s for wave periods less than 10s the srpa with pto damping coefficient 8 mns m shows the least performance on both the sea sites the decreased performance of the srpa with pto damping coefficient of 8 mns m reduces the operating bandwidth which reduces the overall energy production of the srpa therefore the pto damping coefficient of 4 mns m is selected for the performance comparison of the srpas the annual energy produced by the srpas with different pto damping coefficients is shown in table 5 the operating bandwidth of the pto coefficient plays a significant role in the annual power performance of the srpa 4 5 annual energy production since the wave statistics of the sea site vary from site to site a different combination of float and torus is required to extract maximum power the present design parametric study provides the guideline for wec developers to select individual components on site specific wave conditions the site specific design of srpa enhances the modularity in design which reduces the cost by improving the supply chain for wec developers to extract wave energy on east coast the modified srpa1 which is a combination of reference float frg and shorter wedge torus with an outer diameter of 22 m tod2 is chosen see fig 11 b for the west coast the modified srpa2 which is a combination of damping plate float fdp and shorter wedge torus tw1 is chosen see fig 11c the annual mean energy produced by the srpas on each sea site is evaluated by computing the product of the sea state matrix and power matrix of the srpa under regular wave conditions the power matrix of the srpa shows the natural period of the system the power matrices of modified srpas are shown in fig 12 b c the reference srpa shows maximum absorbed power for the wave periods around 10s see fig 12a whereas modifiedsrpas show maximum absorbed power at wave periods between 9s and 12s for modified srpa1 the floating body remains the same as the reference srpa whereas changing the torus to tod2 moves the natural period to a lower wave period since the modified srpa1 is operating in a low wave period site the natural period of the srpa is moved to a lower wave period the natural period of reference srpa is 10s and tuning the torus body design reduces the natural period of the system for modified srpa2 the floating body of the system is changed from slender float to damper plate float to increase the natural period the modified srpa2 requires a drastic increase in the natural period of the system adding a damper plate to the float body increases the natural period of the srpa however under real wave conditions srpas show maximum absorbed power for wave periods higher than the natural period of the system see fig 13 a b for the east coast site the maximum energy period occurs between wave periods 11 13s while for the west coast site the maximum energy period occurs between wave periods 12 15s therefore the absorbed power of modified srpas is higher for wave periods higher than the predominant peak periods of the sea sites under regular wave conditions comparing the annual energy production with srpa1 and srpa2 shows 10 and 26 increments compared to reference srpa see table 6 for sea site 44066 annual energy produced by modified srpa1 is 19 higher than reference srpa for sea site 46069 annual energy produced by modified srpa2 is 6 higher than reference srpa 4 5 1 monthly variation in produced power the wave energy content of the sea varies from month to month the monthly wave statistics for selected sea sites are generated and the monthly average captured power is evaluated and shown in fig 14 the power captured by the srpas is normalized with the total wetted outer surface area of the device shown in table 6 the normalized captured power can be used to scale the power performance of similar srpa devices with different dimensions under regular wave conditions the power captured by modified srpa1 is 2 7 higher than power captured by reference srpa for all months the wave conditions for the east coast site are always distributed for lower wave periods 5 9s therefore the selected combination of srpa1 always generates more power for all seasons during the winter months oct apr modified srpa2 captures two times more power compared to reference srpa however reference srpa captures more power during the summer months for the west coast site the wave conditions are distributed over lower wave periods 4 9s for the summer months the power capture performance of slender body float is higher in lower wave periods which increases the power production of reference srpa under real wave conditions power captured by srpas reduces by 57 compared to regular wave conditions similar to regular wave conditions modified srpa1 captures 12 more power than reference srpa for all months for sea site 46069 the difference in absorbed power between the reference srpa and modified srpa2 drops during winter months modified srpa2 captures 13 more power compared to the reference srpa whereas during summer months reference srpa captures 8 more power compared to modified srpa2 although the energy captured by modified srpa2 drops by 8 the overall annual energy produced by modified srpa2 is 6 higher than the reference srpa the added mass of the damper plate float is higher compared to slender body float which increases the overall hydrodynamic damping of srpa by matching the pto damping with hydrodynamic damping of srpa2 annual energy production can be greatly improved 5 conclusion the present study models the srpa for site specific wave conditions the performance of different float and torus designs is analyzed under real wave conditions observed on the east and west coast of the united states the performance of the modified srpas is studied under real wave conditions the performance study on geometries of the srpa is used to identify the best combination of srpa for selected sea sites the following major conclusions can be made for sea sites with higher wave periods 12s the float with a damping plate was the best design as adding the damping plate moves the peak operating period to higher wave periods 12s and increases the added mass of the float for lower wave period 10s sea sites the float with a slender body design is found to be the best choice the torus design with shorter wedge length was found to perform well under both regular and real wave conditions for lower wave period 10s sea sites increasing the outer diameter increased the power performance of the srpa however for higher wave period 12s sea sites increasing the outer diameter of the torus results in reduced power performance for higher wave heights dynamic motion of damper plate float and torus are in phase which reduces the relative velocity between the bodies based on the design modifications a combination of float and torus shapes may be used for different sea sites for low period site east coast srpa1 consists of slender body float and shorter wedge torus with increased outer diameter is selected for the high period site west coast srpa2 consists of damper plate float and shorter wedge torus is used the power captured by modified srpas are 10 and 26 higher than the reference srpa under regular wave conditions for low wave period sites east coast srpa1 resulted in a 19 increase in captured power compared to the reference srpa for high wave period sites west coast srpa2 captured 6 more power than reference srpa a resistive control system is used with the pto damping coefficient varied between 2 and 8 mns m a damping coefficient of 4 mns m showed the best performance for all both the modified srpa designs at their respective ocean sites when compared to the reference srpa although a further increase in the pto damping coefficient to 8 mn m increased the power performance of the reference srpas it reduces the operating bandwidth of the device such that the power performance fell sharply for wave periods less than 10s this is particularly significant for the west coast site where the peak wave period is larger than 10s this implies that the srpa geometry determines the natural period of the system while the pto control system determines the operating bandwidth and peak power annual variation of the modified designs is also estimated the modified srpa1 captured 2 7 more power compared to reference srpa for all months whereas modified srpa2 captured 13 more power during winter months and 8 reduced power during summer months compared to reference power the annual energy produced by the modified srpas under real wave conditions demonstrates the feasibility to enhance the efficiency of srpa by proper design selection of components for a specific wave site such approaches of choosing float and torus to match site specific wave conditions allow for modularity in design and cost reduction as wave energy technologies mature and the supply chain for a wec developer needs to be established credit authorship

propeller in this regard they compared cavitation results with the uncoated propeller and even tno e008 in the emerson cavitation tunnel the practical result of these tests is that coating usage leads to propeller noise increase in low advance ratios nevertheless it causes the propeller to generate a lower noise level in high advance ratios korkut and atlar 2012 in 2013 hoon et al examined the propeller model installed on a vessel in the samsung ship model basin and recorded its noise signals this study investigates the cavity collapse frequency and its spl lee et al 2013 in 2016 aktas et

analysis of a b series 5 blade propeller with typical skew are done at sharif university of technology cavitation tunnel k23 two hydrophones are used to measure the propeller noise using ittc 87 ittc 1987 recommendations the experimental setup is designed to obtain acoustic results concerning the cavitation bucket diagram and cavitation noise 2 experimental setup open water tests are carried out in the k23 cavitation tunnel of the sharif university of technology this tunnel is fitted with a rectangular test section located in the center of excellence in hydrodynamics and dynamics of marine vehicles cehdmv see fig 1 the test setup considered for noise measurements is similar to the 18th ittc cavitation committee recommendations according to studies on noise measurement in diverse cavitation tunnels and ittc 87 it is necessary to mount at least one hydrophone on the propeller s rotating plane and another downstream in front of the propeller axis bagheri et al 2015 for measuring the propeller noise in the k23 cavitation tunnel two brüel kjær 8103 hydrophones were used the position and arrangement of hydrophones in the cavitation tunnel are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the studied propeller in this research is a b series five bladed propeller with normal skew the main geometric characteristics of the propeller model are given in table 1 the cad drawings are exported to a five axis cnc machine and the manufactured propeller is shown in fig 4 3 hydrodynamic performance test for investigating the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller the model propeller should be examined at different advance ratios j defined as follows 1 j v n d where v is the advance velocity of the propeller n is the rotational speed of the propeller in revolutions per second rps and d is the propeller diameter for reaching the various advance ratios the rotational speed of the model in the cavitation tunnel is kept constant and the flow velocity increased gradually from 0 to 3 m s in the hydrodynamic analysis the tunnel pressure was set to 90 kpa and the propeller revolution was constant at 1500 rpm the thrust and torque coefficients are presented in a non dimensional form 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 j 2 π k t k q where k t is the thrust coefficient t is the thrust k q is the torque coefficient q is the torque and h o is the propeller s open water efficiency 4 cavitation observation scenario the cavitation in propellers could cause severe effects on the total noise of propellers and has significant impacts on their hydrodynamic performance cavitation tests are essential to investigate the inception and development of cavitation on propeller blades therefore the non cavitating region of each propeller operation could be evaluated separately for the cavitation inception test the high vacuum condition is applied to the tunnel and the tests are performed in different advance ratios until the cavitation is observed consequently a well desired bucket diagram is obtained in this research the experimental cavitation number is determined as eq 3 3 σ p p v 0 5 ρ n d 2 where p denotes the test section pressure p v represents the vapor pressure ρ is the density of water n is the propeller rotational speed and σ represents the cavitation number to achieve the cavitation inception number in each advance ratios cavitation tests are performed in constant advance velocity means constant advance ratio by gradual reduction of the test section s pressure these tests were performed for different advance ratios by changing the advance velocity to cover all operational conditions this procedure proceeds until the cavitation is observed on propeller blades by a high speed camera 5 experimental noise measurement procedure to measure the net noise of the propeller in the cavitation tunnel two main steps should be done correctly 1 hydrophones are fixed in the determined position the propeller is not installed the pressure and flow velocity are set to the test condition the shaft rotates and noise is measured termed background sound pressure level s p l b 2 the propeller installed other conditions precisely similar to the previous step the propeller is rotating and the noise is measured termed total sound pressure level s p l t these steps are shown in fig 5 after measurement of total and background noise the difference between noise levels determined as below ebrahimi et al 2019c 4 δ s p l s p l t s p l b according to δ s p l the corrections should be done as follows δ s p l 10 no corrections δ s p l 3 measurements are dominated by background noise and are not acceptable 3 δ s p l 10 concerning the above procedure and using the following equation the total noise of the propeller s p l n is obtained at all 1 3 octave band frequencies seol et al 2007 park et al 2009 korkut and atlar 2009 5 s p l n 10 log 10 s p l t 10 10 s p l b 10 the standard central frequencies of the 1 3 octave band are presented in table 2 jacobsen et al 2011 6 results and discussion 6 1 experimental hydrodynamic performance to obtain hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller after installing the model in the tunnel s test section and attaching the propeller boss according to the ittc standards the thrust and torque are measured using dynamometers at a constant revolution of 1500 rpm and different flow velocities fig 6 shows the propeller hydrodynamic test in the cavitation tunnel of sharif university of technology fig 7 shows the thrust torque and efficiency of the propeller model in non cavitating conditions as can be seen in the diagrams the propeller s maximum efficiency is at an advance ratio of 0 5 which can be known as the design point of the propeller 6 2 cavitation observation results in this research a high tech video camera with an adjustable and automatic electronic shutter is used for capturing the propeller cavitation from non cavitating to fully developed patterns applying the high frame rate for high propeller rpm s the exposure time is too short and two floodlights were used for better resolution and image quality fig 8 shows fully developed cavitation on the model propeller in which the blade sheet cavitation in the suction side and tip vortex cavitation has appeared when the tunnel pressure dropped gradually the vapor volume around each blade s tip would increase drastically fig 9 presents the bucket diagram obtained from investigating the propeller s blade cavitation in the k23 tunnel studying cavitation inception and figuring out the non cavitation region the bold line the boundary of cavitation is determined and shown in this figure the upper region of the bold line shows the non cavitation region in contrast the lower region reveals the operating conditions in which the propeller experiences the sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation 6 3 acoustic measurement results in this section the effects of the propeller rpm tunnel ambient pressure and cavitation number varying both inflow velocity and propeller rpm without keeping any of the constant investigated on the noise of the b series propeller in the k23 cavitation tunnel two hydrophones located in the propeller rotating plane and downstream along the rotation axis with a distance of 10r are used for measuring the propeller noise 6 3 1 effect of propeller rpm to provide three different test conditions for studying the effects of rpm changes the tunnel pressure and the flow velocity are kept fixed at 90 kpa and 1 5 m s respectively it allows different advance ratios from 0 3 to 0 6 while increasing the revolution table 3 presents three test conditions and corresponding cavitation numbers according to the bucket diagram of the propeller fig 9 all of these tests are located in the no cavitation region in the above series of experiments the spls are measured in no cavitation conditions therefore the signals recorded by hydrophones are relevant to the propeller without the impact of cavitation the spls at one third octave band frequencies for the two hydrophones on the rotating plane h1 and downstream in front of the propeller h2 are given in table 4 these data are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 by doubling the rotational speed from 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm beside constant inlet flow the advance ratio decreases from 0 6 to 0 3 in this way the cavitation number dramatically reduces in the constant pressure and the propeller is getting closer to the cavitation region as represented in fig 9 on the other hand the turbulent flow produced at higher revolutions can cause higher spls in no cavitation conditions it can be observed that spls increase from 3 to 7 db in both hydrophones by doubling the propeller rpm at frequencies higher than 500 hz there is a more significant difference between the maximum and minimum spls 6 3 2 the effect of pressure on acoustic results in this section the effects of pressure changes on the propeller noise are investigated three conditions of no cavitation cavitation inception and developed cavitation are studied in the same advance ratio j 0 3 the flow data of these test conditions are presented in table 5 for investigating the effect of tunnel pressure on the propeller s noise the rotational speed and the flow velocity are kept constant in all tests and the pressure is reduced from 90 to 70 kpa which results in non cavitation cavitation inception fig 12 a and developed cavitation conditions fig 12 b on propeller blades under the pressure of 90 kpa the model propeller experiences non cavitation conditions by reducing the pressure blade tip sheet cavitation on the suction side and a thin tip vortex cavitation tvc were observed on propeller blades fig 12 a tvc started from the trailing edge along with the downstream by reducing the tunnel pressure from 80 kpa to 70 kpa as shown in fig 12 b the sheet cavitation volume began to increase and a longer and stronger tvc was occurred and followed downstream the procedure of cavitation inception and development was approximately similar to park et al 2014 in general tvc coupled with sheet cavitation detached bubbles cause higher spl in higher frequencies and lower frequencies are directly influenced by sheet volume on the blade suction side bagheri et al 2015 the spls at one third octave band frequencies recorded by two hydrophones h1 and h2 are given in table 6 these data are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 figs 13 and 14 show that in lower frequencies the spls difference between the three conditions is about 2 6 db however it increased to 3 13 db at higher frequencies using the previous explanation the dominant noise in lower frequencies is due to the difference between sheet patterns on suction sides making spls increase to 6 db from the no cavitation test however tvc and detached bubbles give rise to a maximum of 13 db higher than the no cavitation test at higher frequencies regarding the domination of tvc 6 3 3 analysis of the bucket diagram cavitation is of the highest importance source components in propellers noise and tvc mostly appears as the first type of cavitation in propellers svennberg et al 2019 in this research as described tip vortex cavitation occurs together with sheet cavitation on the suction side during pressure drop at the first stage by passing the time the volume of sheet cavitation and strength of tvc increased cavitation occurrence in submerged propellers operating near the free surface is inevitable in high revolutions so investigating their acoustic behavior versus cavitation numbers has a significant role on propellers design to eliminate higher spls in this way operators could change the vessel velocity and the corresponding propeller s revolutions to find the propellers in new operational low cavitation conditions the related pre calculated spl differences had been obtained using analysis similar to the present study for studying the effects of cavitation numbers on the propeller s noise a series of tests were conducted in a constant specific advance ratio to extract cavitation patterns and related overall spls by comparing test conditions in the bucket diagram s cavitation region the effects of the bucket diagram cavitation numbers on the studied propeller noise are investigated table 7 represents the test conditions of noise versus cavitation numbers these tests are depicted as n1 to n6 in fig 9 all experiments have been done in a constant advance ratio j 0 3 in this experimental study carried out in the k23 tunnel of sharif university with a constant advance ratio n1 shows no cavitation and n2 is placed in the cavitation inception condition in which both tvc and compact sheet bubble appeared the other four experiments indicate fully developed cavitation conditions with their particular pattern of tvc and sheet cavitation which are shown in fig 15 for the six test conditions represented in table 5 propeller noise was measured by two hydrophones h1 and h2 fig 16 and fig 17 show the spls obtained through these tests for studying the acoustic behavior of the model propeller in different conditions a bucket diagram is used to define the cavitation inception border for propellers in which the cavitation terms are usually inevitable this diagram also plays a significant role in the acoustic analysis of the marine propellers in the present case study at two first tests n1 and n2 the rpm and tunnel inlet velocity are kept constant and by changing the tunnel pressure the cavitation numbers of 7 04 and 6 24 were obtained respectively in the cavitation inception condition n2 tvc and low volume sheet cavitation are visible then in the other test conditions n6 n5 n4 and n3 all variables are changed except for tunnel pressure and advance ratio the inlet velocity and rpm are adjusted so that all tests are performed in the constant advanced ratio of 0 3 the practical goal is to provide the model with lower cavitation numbers in the pre obtained bucket diagram and record their spls tvc and sheet cavitation pattern using variation in tunnel parameters propeller rpm inflow velocity and tunnel pressure therefore the variation between each frequency in term of spl in lower cavitation numbers are achievable for various conditions cavitation numbers and these data might give rise to a reliable range of noise results irrespective of how the propeller reaches the desired cavitation numbers changing inflow velocity propeller rotational speed or both as shown in figs 16 and 17 at one third octave band lower frequencies the spls are varied around 12 16 db from n1 non cavitating to n3 maximum developed cavitation however at higher frequencies this range raised to 16 25 db from n1 to n3 this difference is higher in the h1 hydrophone rotating plane than the h2 hydrophone downstream for n1 to n3 therefore according to figs 16 and 17 at a specific advance ratio the lower the value of the cavitation number regardless of its rpm inflow velocity and the ambient pressure the higher the amount of noise emitted from the model propeller which includes loading noise tvc sheet cavitation bubble detachment and collapse 7 conclusion in this research the procedure of the cavitation tests and propeller noise tests explained all tests are based on the ittc 87 recommendations then hydrodynamic performance and cavitation bucket diagram of a five bladed b series model propeller tests are reported at first the thrust torque and hydrodynamic efficiency of the model propeller are measured at 1500 rpm in non cavitating conditions which shows that the propeller s maximum efficiency belongs to j 0 5 comprehensive cavitation tests were also performed regarding the k23 tunnel limitations in rpm and inlet velocity to investigate the cavitation inception points and cavitation development during possible advance ratios regarding the importance of cavitation noise and thrust deduction of the propeller this series of tests was conducted to determine the propeller s non cavitating region in different advance ratios sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation were observed on the blade suction side and along the blade trailing edge path respectively even in cavitation inception conditions by reducing the cavitation numbers the volume of sheet cavitation increases and tvc goes stronger detached bubbles and sheet cavitation collapse are detectable in fully cavitation conditions for this model propeller in the noise evaluation section the effect of rpm increase is investigated as the primary criterion in which all tests are performed in the non cavitation zone as the rpm increases from 1000 to 2000 in constant inflow 1 5 m s and tunnel pressure 90 kpa the cavitation number decreases and the difference between spls in one third octave band rises from 3 to 7 db ambient pressure is considered as the second criterion to study its impact on the propeller s noise in a constant rpm 2000 inflow velocity 1 5 and advance ratio j 0 3 the tunnel pressure reduced from 90 kpa to 70 kpa which covered all three states of non cavitation cavitation inception and cavitation development conditions the spls difference between the three conditions is about 2 6 db for lower frequencies but this difference is about 3 13 db at higher frequencies finally the cavitation bucket diagram is considered as the reference for the acoustic analysis of the model propeller in a constant advance ratio j 0 3 in this regard both inflow velocity and propeller rpm were changed simultaneously results show that by decreasing the cavitation number from 7 04 non cavitation condition to 2 78 fully developed cavitation condition regardless of rpm and inflow velocity the spls in one third octave band are varied around 12 16 db at lower frequencies and 16 25 db at higher frequencies credit authorship contribution statement a ebrahimi conceptualization methodology

propeller in this regard they compared cavitation results with the uncoated propeller and even tno e008 in the emerson cavitation tunnel the practical result of these tests is that coating usage leads to propeller noise increase in low advance ratios nevertheless it causes the propeller to generate a lower noise level in high advance ratios korkut and atlar 2012 in 2013 hoon et al examined the

large cavitation tunnel and presented a noise localization method for propellers in 2017 bagheri et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic performance and noise of dtmb 4119 and a four blade b series propeller using experimental and numerical methods the combination of rans equations and fw h formulation is used to calculate spl and cavitation impacts on noise in this regard the effects of cavitation inception on propeller noise are examined by changing the rotational speed in 2019 ebrahimi et al published a comprehensive paper on the effects of different geometric parameters on hydrodynamic cavitation and marine propellers noise they also suggested a new algorithm for designing the optimal propeller in hydrodynamic and acoustic aspects ebrahimi et al 2019a in 2019 ebrahimi

analysis of a b series 5 blade propeller with typical skew are done at sharif university of technology cavitation tunnel k23 two hydrophones are used to measure the propeller noise using ittc 87 ittc 1987 recommendations the experimental setup is designed to obtain acoustic results concerning the cavitation bucket diagram and cavitation noise 2 experimental setup open water tests are carried out in the k23 cavitation tunnel of the sharif university of technology this tunnel is fitted with a rectangular test section located in the center of excellence in hydrodynamics and dynamics of marine vehicles cehdmv see fig 1 the test setup considered for noise measurements is similar to the 18th ittc cavitation committee recommendations according to studies on noise measurement in diverse cavitation tunnels and ittc 87 it is necessary to mount at least one hydrophone on the propeller s rotating plane and another downstream in front of the propeller axis bagheri et al 2015 for measuring the propeller noise in the k23 cavitation tunnel two brüel kjær 8103 hydrophones were used the position and arrangement of hydrophones in the cavitation tunnel are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the studied propeller in this research is a b series five bladed propeller with normal skew the main geometric characteristics of the propeller model are given in table 1 the cad drawings are exported to a five axis cnc machine and the manufactured propeller is shown in fig 4 3 hydrodynamic performance test for investigating the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller the model propeller should be examined at different advance ratios j defined as follows 1 j v n d where v is the advance velocity of the propeller n is the rotational speed of the propeller in revolutions per second rps and d is the propeller diameter for reaching the various advance ratios the rotational speed of the model in the cavitation tunnel is kept constant and the flow velocity increased gradually from 0 to 3 m s in the hydrodynamic analysis the tunnel pressure was set to 90 kpa and the propeller revolution was constant at 1500 rpm the thrust and torque coefficients are presented in a non dimensional form 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 j 2 π k t k q where k t is the thrust coefficient t is the thrust k q is the torque coefficient q is the torque and h o is the propeller s open water efficiency 4 cavitation observation scenario the cavitation in propellers could cause severe effects on the total noise of propellers and has significant impacts on their hydrodynamic performance cavitation tests are essential to investigate the inception and development of cavitation on propeller blades therefore the non cavitating region of each propeller operation could be evaluated separately for the cavitation inception test the high vacuum condition is applied to the tunnel and the tests are performed in different advance ratios until the cavitation is observed consequently a well desired bucket diagram is obtained in this research the experimental cavitation number is determined as eq 3 3 σ p p v 0 5 ρ n d 2 where p denotes the test section pressure p v represents the vapor pressure ρ is the density of water n is the propeller rotational speed and σ represents the cavitation number to achieve the cavitation inception number in each advance ratios cavitation tests are performed in constant advance velocity means constant advance ratio by gradual reduction of the test section s pressure these tests were performed for different advance ratios by changing the advance velocity to cover all operational conditions this procedure proceeds until the cavitation is observed on propeller blades by a high speed camera 5 experimental noise measurement procedure to measure the net noise of the propeller in the cavitation tunnel two main steps should be done correctly 1 hydrophones are fixed in the determined position the propeller is not installed the pressure and flow velocity are set to the test condition the shaft rotates and noise is measured termed background sound pressure level s p l b 2 the propeller installed other conditions precisely similar to the previous step the propeller is rotating and the noise is measured termed total sound pressure level s p l t these steps are shown in fig 5 after measurement of total and background noise the difference between noise levels determined as below ebrahimi et al 2019c 4 δ s p l s p l t s p l b according to δ s p l the corrections should be done as follows δ s p l 10 no corrections δ s p l 3 measurements are dominated by background noise and are not acceptable 3 δ s p l 10 concerning the above procedure and using the following equation the total noise of the propeller s p l n is obtained at all 1 3 octave band frequencies seol et al 2007 park et al 2009 korkut and atlar 2009 5 s p l n 10 log 10 s p l t 10 10 s p l b 10 the standard central frequencies of the 1 3 octave band are presented in table 2 jacobsen et al 2011 6 results and discussion 6 1 experimental hydrodynamic performance to obtain hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller after installing the model in the tunnel s test section and attaching the propeller boss according to the ittc standards the thrust and torque are measured using dynamometers at a constant revolution of 1500 rpm and different flow velocities fig 6 shows the propeller hydrodynamic test in the cavitation tunnel of sharif university of technology fig 7 shows the thrust torque and efficiency of the propeller model in non cavitating conditions as can be seen in the diagrams the propeller s maximum efficiency is at an advance ratio of 0 5 which can be known as the design point of the propeller 6 2 cavitation observation results in this research a high tech video camera with an adjustable and automatic electronic shutter is used for capturing the propeller cavitation from non cavitating to fully developed patterns applying the high frame rate for high propeller rpm s the exposure time is too short and two floodlights were used for better resolution and image quality fig 8 shows fully developed cavitation on the model propeller in which the blade sheet cavitation in the suction side and tip vortex cavitation has appeared when the tunnel pressure dropped gradually the vapor volume around each blade s tip would increase drastically fig 9 presents the bucket diagram obtained from investigating the propeller s blade cavitation in the k23 tunnel studying cavitation inception and figuring out the non cavitation region the bold line the boundary of cavitation is determined and shown in this figure the upper region of the bold line shows the non cavitation region in contrast the lower region reveals the operating conditions in which the propeller experiences the sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation 6 3 acoustic measurement results in this section the effects of the propeller rpm tunnel ambient pressure and cavitation number varying both inflow velocity and propeller rpm without keeping any of the constant investigated on the noise of the b series propeller in the k23 cavitation tunnel two hydrophones located in the propeller rotating plane and downstream along the rotation axis with a distance of 10r are used for measuring the propeller noise 6 3 1 effect of propeller rpm to provide three different test conditions for studying the effects of rpm changes the tunnel pressure and the flow velocity are kept fixed at 90 kpa and 1 5 m s respectively it allows different advance ratios from 0 3 to 0 6 while increasing the revolution table 3 presents three test conditions and corresponding cavitation numbers according to the bucket diagram of the propeller fig 9 all of these tests are located in the no cavitation region in the above series of experiments the spls are measured in no cavitation conditions therefore the signals recorded by hydrophones are relevant to the propeller without the impact of cavitation the spls at one third octave band frequencies for the two hydrophones on the rotating plane h1 and downstream in front of the propeller h2 are given in table 4 these data are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 by doubling the rotational speed from 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm beside constant inlet flow the advance ratio decreases from 0 6 to 0 3 in this way the cavitation number dramatically reduces in the constant pressure and the propeller is getting closer to the cavitation region as represented in fig 9 on the other hand the turbulent flow produced at higher revolutions can cause higher spls in no cavitation conditions it can be observed that spls increase from 3 to 7 db in both hydrophones by doubling the propeller rpm at frequencies higher than 500 hz there is a more significant difference between the maximum and minimum spls 6 3 2 the effect of pressure on acoustic results in this section the effects of pressure changes on the propeller noise are investigated three conditions of no cavitation cavitation inception and developed cavitation are studied in the same advance ratio j 0 3 the flow data of these test conditions are presented in table 5 for investigating the effect of tunnel pressure on the propeller s noise the rotational speed and the flow velocity are kept constant in all tests and the pressure is reduced from 90 to 70 kpa which results in non cavitation cavitation inception fig 12 a and developed cavitation conditions fig 12 b on propeller blades under the pressure of 90 kpa the model propeller experiences non cavitation conditions by reducing the pressure blade tip sheet cavitation on the suction side and a thin tip vortex cavitation tvc were observed on propeller blades fig 12 a tvc started from the trailing edge along with the downstream by reducing the tunnel pressure from 80 kpa to 70 kpa as shown in fig 12 b the sheet cavitation volume began to increase and a longer and stronger tvc was occurred and followed downstream the procedure of cavitation inception and development was approximately similar to park et al 2014 in general tvc coupled with sheet cavitation detached bubbles cause higher spl in higher frequencies and lower frequencies are directly influenced by sheet volume on the blade suction side bagheri et al 2015 the spls at one third octave band frequencies recorded by two hydrophones h1 and h2 are given in table 6 these data are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 figs 13 and 14 show that in lower frequencies the spls difference between the three conditions is about 2 6 db however it increased to 3 13 db at higher frequencies using the previous explanation the dominant noise in lower frequencies is due to the difference between sheet patterns on suction sides making spls increase to 6 db from the no cavitation test however tvc and detached bubbles give rise to a maximum of 13 db higher than the no cavitation test at higher frequencies regarding the domination of tvc 6 3 3 analysis of the bucket diagram cavitation is of the highest importance source components in propellers noise and tvc mostly appears as the first type of cavitation in propellers svennberg et al 2019 in this research as described tip vortex cavitation occurs together with sheet cavitation on the suction side during pressure drop at the first stage by passing the time the volume of sheet cavitation and strength of tvc increased cavitation occurrence in submerged propellers operating near the free surface is inevitable in high revolutions so investigating their acoustic behavior versus cavitation numbers has a significant role on propellers design to eliminate higher spls in this way operators could change the vessel velocity and the corresponding propeller s revolutions to find the propellers in new operational low cavitation conditions the related pre calculated spl differences had been obtained using analysis similar to the present study for studying the effects of cavitation numbers on the propeller s noise a series of tests were conducted in a constant specific advance ratio to extract cavitation patterns and related overall spls by comparing test conditions in the bucket diagram s cavitation region the effects of the bucket diagram cavitation numbers on the studied propeller noise are investigated table 7 represents the test conditions of noise versus cavitation numbers these tests are depicted as n1 to n6 in fig 9 all experiments have been done in a constant advance ratio j 0 3 in this experimental study carried out in the k23 tunnel of sharif university with a constant advance ratio n1 shows no cavitation and n2 is placed in the cavitation inception condition in which both tvc and compact sheet bubble appeared the other four experiments indicate fully developed cavitation conditions with their particular pattern of tvc and sheet cavitation which are shown in fig 15 for the six test conditions represented in table 5 propeller noise was measured by two hydrophones h1 and h2 fig 16 and fig 17 show the spls obtained through these tests for studying the acoustic behavior of the model propeller in different conditions a bucket diagram is used to define the cavitation inception border for propellers in which the cavitation terms are usually inevitable this diagram also plays a significant role in the acoustic analysis of the marine propellers in the present case study at two first tests n1 and n2 the rpm and tunnel inlet velocity are kept constant and by changing the tunnel pressure the cavitation numbers of 7 04 and 6 24 were obtained respectively in the cavitation inception condition n2 tvc and low volume sheet cavitation are visible then in the other test conditions n6 n5 n4 and n3 all variables are changed except for tunnel pressure and advance ratio the inlet velocity and rpm are adjusted so that all tests are performed in the constant advanced ratio of 0 3 the practical goal is to provide the model with lower cavitation numbers in the pre obtained bucket diagram and record their spls tvc and sheet cavitation pattern using variation in tunnel parameters propeller rpm inflow velocity and tunnel pressure therefore the variation between each frequency in term of spl in lower cavitation numbers are achievable for various conditions cavitation numbers and these data might give rise to a reliable range of noise results irrespective of how the propeller reaches the desired cavitation numbers changing inflow velocity propeller rotational speed or both as shown in figs 16 and 17 at one third octave band lower frequencies the spls are varied around 12 16 db from n1 non cavitating to n3 maximum developed cavitation however at higher frequencies this range raised to 16 25 db from n1 to n3 this difference is higher in the h1 hydrophone rotating plane than the h2 hydrophone downstream for n1 to n3 therefore according to figs 16 and 17 at a specific advance ratio the lower the value of the cavitation number regardless of its rpm inflow velocity and the ambient pressure the higher the amount of noise emitted from the model propeller which includes loading noise tvc sheet cavitation bubble detachment and collapse 7 conclusion in this research the procedure of the cavitation tests and propeller noise tests explained all tests are based on the ittc 87 recommendations then hydrodynamic performance and cavitation bucket diagram of a five bladed b series model propeller tests are reported at first the thrust torque and hydrodynamic efficiency of the model propeller are measured at 1500 rpm in non cavitating conditions which shows that the propeller s maximum efficiency belongs to j 0 5 comprehensive cavitation tests were also performed regarding the k23 tunnel limitations in rpm and inlet velocity to investigate the cavitation inception points and cavitation development during possible advance ratios regarding the importance of cavitation noise and thrust deduction of the propeller this series of tests was conducted to determine the propeller s non cavitating region in different advance ratios sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation were observed on the blade suction side and along the blade trailing edge path respectively even in cavitation inception conditions by reducing the cavitation numbers the volume of sheet cavitation increases and tvc goes stronger detached bubbles and sheet cavitation collapse are detectable in fully cavitation conditions for this model propeller in the noise evaluation section the effect of rpm increase is investigated as the primary criterion in which all tests are performed in the non cavitation zone as the rpm increases from 1000 to 2000 in constant inflow 1 5 m s and tunnel pressure 90 kpa the cavitation number decreases and the difference between spls in one third octave band rises from 3 to 7 db ambient pressure is considered as the second criterion to study its impact on the propeller s noise in a constant rpm 2000 inflow velocity 1 5 and advance ratio j 0 3 the tunnel pressure reduced from 90 kpa to 70 kpa which covered all three states of non cavitation cavitation inception and cavitation development conditions the spls difference between the three conditions is about 2 6 db for lower frequencies but this difference is about 3 13 db at higher frequencies finally the cavitation bucket diagram is considered as the reference for the acoustic analysis of the model propeller in a constant advance ratio j 0 3 in this regard both inflow velocity and propeller rpm were changed simultaneously results show that by decreasing the cavitation number from 7 04 non cavitation condition to 2 78 fully developed cavitation condition regardless of rpm and inflow velocity the spls in one third octave band are varied around 12 16 db at lower frequencies and 16 25 db at higher frequencies credit authorship contribution statement a ebrahimi conceptualization methodology

movement the focus of sauret et al 2015 is to study the effects on sloshing of the liquid foam placed on top of a liquid bath gurusamy and kumar 2020 implemented an experiment to investigate the nonlinear behavior of sloshing in the low level water rectangular tank besides the effects of excitation and dispersion had been focused on from the literature review although there are many studies on numerical solutions for the two three dimensional sloshing movement and analytical solutions for the two dimensional sloshing motion in the partially filled containers few analytical or semi analytical methods for the sloshing frequency in a three dimensional container filled with a fluid of arbitrary depth are addressed since the difficulty lies in the modeling and solution of the sloshing motion of tank with an arbitrary liquid depth in this paper a semi analytical method is proposed to solve sloshing frequencies of a three dimensional partially filled cylindrical tank at arbitrary fluid depths two coordinate systems are set at the midpoint of the free liquid surface and the geometric center of the tank cross section respectively by introducing the liquid potential function and the boundary condition at the free surface and the tank wall the motion equations of the tank are established by the coordinate transform the galerkin method is applied to solve the sloshing frequencies an experimental setup is developed to observe the sloshing motion and the sloshing frequencies and mode shapes are obtained from the experiments the accuracy of the present semi analytical method is verified by comparing it with the results obtained by experiments and other references then the effects of the length radius ratios and liquid depths on the sloshing frequencies are discussed 2 sloshing model of the cylindrical shell a horizontal circular cylindrical shell partially filled with ideal inviscid incompressible fluid is considered with the radius r 0 length l fluid depth h as shown in fig 1 two cylindrical polar coordinate systems are set in this model as shown in fig 2 the origin o 1 of one coordinate system r θ x is attached at the circle center of the endplate and the origin o 2 which is in the other coordinate system r ϕ z is at the midpoint of the liquid surface in the same surface with o 1 in fig 2 r and r represent the radial coordinate in the two coordinate systems respectively h is the distance between the free liquid surface and mid surface of the tank h 0 represents the liquid level is lower than the half filled liquid level while h 0 means that the liquid level is higher while the angle β can be expressed as β θ ϕ the relationship between the fluid height h and h could be written as h r 0 h by employing the linear wave theory the fluid velocity potential φ r ϕ z should satisfy the classical laplace equation which can be written in the polar coordinate system as 1 2 φ 2 φ r 2 1 r φ r 1 r 2 2 φ ϕ 2 2 φ z 2 0 where 2 is the laplace operator the rigid container boundary conditions with reference to figs 1 and 2 can be described as 2 φ z 0 when z 0 l 3 φ r 0 when r r 0 moreover the linearized free surface boundary condition can be depicted in the coordinate system as 4 k φ 1 r φ ϕ 0 when ϕ π 2 where k ω 2 g ω is the radian frequency of the liquid oscillations and g is the gravity acceleration according to eq 2 the velocity potential φ r ϕ z can be written tentatively by separation of variables as 5 φ r ϕ z φ r ϕ cos k z where k pπ l p 0 1 2 when p 0 corresponding to k 0 the three dimensional problem will reduce to a two dimensional case it is clear that according to the sloshing modes the general solution can be divided into two types one is the antisymmetric mode of the free surface oscillation in the transverse direction the other is the symmetric mode the solution for two modes could be expressed as 6 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a n sin n ϕ f a r cos k z for antisymmetric mode 7 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b n cos n ϕ f

the singularity at r 0 liang et al 2015 the solutions of eqs 8 and 9 are given by the first kind of modified bessel function i n kr which is nonsingular ar r 0 so the velocity potential of both modes can be respectively described as 10 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a n sin n ϕ i n k r cos k z for antisymmetric mode 11 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b n cos n ϕ i n k r cos k z for symmetric mode where i n represent the first kind modified bessel function of order n for the antisymmetric mode eq 10 can be rewritten in the addition of odd and even terms as follow 12 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a 2 n 1 sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r a 2 n sin 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos k z substituting eq 12 into the free surface boundary condition eq 4 yields 13 n 1 2 k a 2 n 1 k a 2 n i 2 n 1 k r a 2 n i 2 n k r 0 there is a recursion relationship between the first kind of modified bessel function as follow 14 i 2 n 1 x i 2 n 1 x 2 2 n x 1 i 2 n x so from eq 13 one can get the recursion relationship about a n 15 2 k a 2 n 1 k a 2 n k a 2 n 2 0 then a 2n 1 can be rewritten as 16 a 2 n 1 k a 2 n k a 2 n 2 2 k substituting eq 16 into eq 12 the velocity potential function could be depicted as 17 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a 2 n k 2 k sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos k z now according to the relation between the coordinate system o 1 and o 2 eq 2 can be modified as 18 φ a r φ a r r r φ a ϕ ϕ r 0 when r r 0 and then by using the translation between two coordinate systems the derivatives in the coordinate r could be obtained as r r cos β ϕ r sin β r application of these derivatives gives 19 φ a r φ a r cos β φ a ϕ sin β r 0 where r h 2 2 h r 0 cos θ r 0 2 ϕ arcsin r 0 sin θ r substituting the velocity potential function eq 17 into eq 19 the rigid boundary condition can be described as 20 n 1 a 2 n l 1 l 2 1 k l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 0 where l n represents the equations as follow l 1 k 2 i 2 n 1 k r i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n ϕ cos β l 2 2 n r cos 2 n ϕ sin β l 3 k 2 4 i 2 n 2 k r i 2 n k r sin 2 n 1 ϕ cos β l 4 k 2 4 i 2 n k r i 2 n

the galerkin method is employed in eq 20 the circumferential potential function sin 2 m ϕ is considered as the weighting function so the application of the weighting function now gives 21 n 1 a 2 n 0 θ 0 l 1 l 2 k 0 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 sin 2 m ϕ d θ 0 where m 1 2 n k 0 1 k eq 21 can be written in the matrix form as 22 b k 0 a a 2 n 0 where the matrix b b m n a a m n and the elements of the matrix can be described as b m n 0 θ 0 l 1 sin 2 m ϕ l 2 sin 2 m ϕ d θ a m n 0 θ 0 l 3 sin 2 m ϕ l 4 sin 2 m ϕ l 5 sin 2 m ϕ l 6 sin 2 m ϕ d θ since eq 22 has non trivial solutions the determinant value of the coefficient matrix should be zero 23 b k 0 a 0 with the given axial modal number p p 0 1 2 a series of k 0 could be obtained by combining stepwise search and dichotomy then the sloshing frequency can be obtained according to k 0 for the symmetric modes the procedure follows similarly in this situation the velocity potential φ s can be expressed as 24 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b 2 n cos 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r b 2 n 1 cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r cos k z from the free surface boundary condition eq 4 the relationship between b n can be described as 25 b 2 n k b 2 n 1 k b 2 n 1 2 k so the velocity potential can be rewritten as 26 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b 2 n 1 k 2 k cos 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos 2 n 2 ϕ i 2 n 2 k r cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r cos k z application of the boundary condition in eq 2 gives the equation as follow 27 n

sloshing frequency for the symmetric modes can be achieved by setting the determinant value of the coefficient matrix to be zero 29 d k 0 c 0 similarly eq 29 could also be solved by combining stepwise search and dichotomy to obtain the sloshing frequencies 3 convergence analysis since infinite series exits in eqs 23 and 29 the convergence of the proposed method should be studied to ensure the accuracy of the solution after the series is truncated in this paper the matrix a b c d are square matrixes so the truncated value of rows m and columns n of the matrix are the same changing the truncation parameter n can get the convergence characteristic of this solution in this section the following parameters are used in the case shell length l 2m shell radius r 0 1m the fluid height h is set to be 0 5m 1 0m 1 5m respectively the dimensionless sloshing modes frequencies ω for the cylindrical shell with different fluid heights and truncated values are listed in table 1 where ω kr 0 ω2 r 0 g and p and q indict the longitudinal mode number and transverse mode number respectively it is shown in table 1 that when the truncated number is 20 the non dimensional sloshing frequencies ω become stable and have good precision therefore n 20 is used in the following calculation 4 sloshing experiment of a cylindrical tank with different depths in this section an experiment is implemented to study the sloshing frequencies of a cylindrical shell model and the experimental results are compared with those obtained by the presented method as shown in fig 3 the cylindrical shell model is made of acrylic with the inner diameter d 250 mm equivalent span l 500 mm and mean thickness t 5 mm two circular plates with a thickness of 40 mm are attached at both ends of the shell on the upper surface of the shell six rectangular openings are set for the laser displacement sensors which are used to measure the fluid height variation of the free surface four sensors are set along the longitudinal direction and the other two along the transverse direction theoretically the first two order longitudinal and transverse sloshing modal shapes could be obtained according to the displacements of the sensors fig 4 provides the schematic diagram of the measuring devices including the laser sensors steel plates for the devices fixing test bench cylindrical tank and data acquisition and analysis system in these facilities the cylindrical tank attached to the hoisting steel plate could swing with the steel chains which connect the test bench there is a transition steel plate between the sensor bracket and the hoisting steel plate where the transition steel plate is bolted with the hoisting steel plate and welded with the sensor bracket as shown in fig 5 the experiment is executed with different inner liquid heights for the reason that the sensors could receive the reflection signals of the light from the water surface freshwater added some white pigments is used as a sloshing liquid in addition the pigments have no influence on the viscosity of the sloshing liquid fig 5 a c show the model tank with different liquid heights i e 1 3d 1 2d and 2 3d respectively in this experiment the laser displacement sensors are used to record the data of displacement variation of the free surface when the tank swings back and forth the internal liquid will make the sloshing movement and the data of the displacement variation could be acquired by the acquisition system and be imported into the laptop to make the analysis fig 6 shows the sloshing displacement curve of sensor no 6 with different liquid heights while fig 7 shows photos of the sloshing movement of the internal liquid with different depth as shown in fig 6 the wave height variations are not linear in the first few seconds and then the wave heights demonstrate the linear attenuation trend the linear attenuation data were analyzed to study the sloshing movement of the free sloshing wave from the mode analysis software utekma v2004 the sloshing modal shapes and the sloshing frequencies are obtained table 2 shows the sloshing frequencies of the first few modes with different liquid heights and the experimental sloshing frequencies are compared with those from the present method pm meanwhile table 3 provides the modal shapes of the first few modes where the dash lines represent the original free surface and the solid lines represent the free surface modal shapes in table 3 the longer line represents the longitudinal direction while the shorter represents the transverse direction as can be seen from table 2 the experimental results have a good agreement with the results obtained by the present method 5 accuracy verification of present method to verify the accuracy of the present method two numerical examples are taken into consideration and the computational results are compared with published results or fem results in the first example a two dimensional partially filled cylindrical shell in mciver 1989 is considered since the length of the shell is finite in our theoretical model the shell length radius ratio is set as 200 to model the two dimensional partially filled cylindrical shell in our calculation the non dimensional frequencies with three different fluid heights are listed in table 4 and compared with the results in mciver 1989 for symmetric and antisymmetric modes from table 4 it is obvious that the results calculated by the present method have good agreements with those in the reference mciver 1989 so it is believed that when the shell length is large enough the sloshing frequencies calculated in this method can approximately be regarded as the frequencies with the axial wavenumber be zero which means k 0 in the second example a three dimensional model from hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 is introduced to check the validity of the present method in this case the parameters are used as shell length l 2m shell radius r 0 1m and the fluid height h is set as 0 5m 1m 1 5m respectively table 5 presents the non dimensional sloshing frequencies at different fluid heights it can be found that the sloshing frequencies acquired by the present method show excellent agreement with the results from hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 meanwhile the sloshing frequencies calculated by the present method are also compared with the fem results the structural parameters of the tank are set as the length l 2m r 0 1m fig 8 shows the fem model of the fluid in the cylindrical shell with the fluid height h 0 5m the fluid is modeled with element type fluid30 in ansys in the following calculations the fluid height is set as 0 5m 1 0m 1 5m respectively table 6 gives the sloshing frequencies f pm and f fem which are frequencies obtained by the pm present method and the fem with different fluid heights respectively as shown in table 6 the results obtained by the present method are in great agreement with those of the fem meanwhile the sloshing modal shapes are compared between the present method pm and the fem fig 9 shows modal shapes for the fluid surface with fluid height h 0 5m as seen in fig 9 the mode shapes obtained by the present method are in excellent agreement with those calculated by the fem according to a lot of numerical examples it can be found that the results of the sloshing frequencies have satisfactory accuracy when the fluid level varies from 0 2r 0 1 8r 0 which covers most engineering practices in general these comparison examples all suggest the effectiveness and accuracy of the present semi analytical method 6 parametric analysis and discussions 6 1 effect of fluid height on the sloshing frequencies as can be seen from section 5 the liquid depth has an apparent influence on the sloshing frequencies in this section the effect of fluid height is studied the following case is considered with shell radius r 0 1m and liquid depth 0 7m 0 4m 1 0m 1 4m and 1 7m respectively table 7 and table 8 present the sloshing frequencies corresponding to different axial and transverse modes note p q respectively represents the axial mode number and transverse mode number of the free surface s sloshing and reflects the sloshing mode shape of the free surface the length to radius ratio is set as l r 0 2 3 in tables 7 and 8 respectively fig 10 presents the variation of the sloshing frequencies with different modal shapes with axis mode p 0 1 2 3 and transverse mode q 0 to 6 respectively it reveals some characteristics of the sloshing frequencies as follows at first when the longitudinal modal number p and the fluid height are all determined the sloshing frequencies would increase with the increase of the transverse modal number according to ref graham and rodriguez 1952 the reason can be described as follow in the equivalent mechanical sloshing model the mass of fluid mf can be divided into a fixed mass m f and an infinite series of undamped spring masses m j transverse mode number j 0 1 2 the fixed mass is regarded as the stable part that does not participate in the sloshing motion while the undamped spring masses are considered as the sloshing part with the increase of the transverse modal number the percentage of the sloshing part in the internal fluid would gradually decrease correspondingly there is an increase in the sloshing frequency when the transverse modal number increases fig 11 presents the sloshing frequencies for the partially liquid filled cylindrical shell versus fluid heights with different modal orders as shown in fig 11 the sloshing frequencies corresponding to certain modal shapes change with the liquid depth obviously for the modes with lower transverse orders like q 0 1 2 and constant longitudinal modal number the sloshing frequencies would increase with the growth of the fluid height this may be interpreted that when the sloshing mode is the lower order transverse mode the proportion of the sloshing part in the internal fluid would depress as the fluid height increase and the intensity of sloshing may be reduced as a result there is an increase in the sloshing frequencies accordingly however for the modes with higher transverse orders the sloshing frequencies would decrease at first and then increase with the increase of the fluid height the sloshing frequency is the lowest when the liquid is half filled the reason can be explained that nodes of the free surface corresponding to higher transverse order sloshing would be greater than those of the lower order but the area of the free surface with the higher or lower fluid level are both smaller than that of the half filled fluid level therefore for the half filled case the sloshing frequency is the lowest for higher order modes 6 2 effect of length radius ratio on the sloshing frequencies in this section the sloshing frequencies are also obtained for the partially fluid filled cylindrical with different length radius ratios l r 0 fig 12 shows the sloshing frequencies versus the length radius ratio with different fluid heights where note p q indicts the longitudinal mode number and transverse mode number it is shown in fig 12 that when the transverse mode number keeps constant q 1 or q 4 the sloshing frequency increases with the increase of the longitudinal mode number p for certain sloshing modes i e p and q keep constant it is obvious that the sloshing frequency decreases as the length radius ratio increases moreover it can be observed that the sloshing frequency may decrease to a special value when the increasing length radius ratio is great enough through the subsequent calculation of the sloshing frequencies it can be found that the sloshing frequency will converge to that of axial mode number p 0 for example the sloshing frequency of the mode 1 4 would be close to that of mode 0 4 as the length radius ratio is great enough this conclusion is also consistent with that in section 5 that when the shell length is large enough the sloshing frequencies calculated can be regarded as the frequencies with the axial wavenumber be zero approximately and it would be convergent to the two dimensional sloshing frequency this is linked to the reason that as the length of the tank increases to a very larger value the cylindrical tank could be considered as an infinitely long cylindrical tank 7 conclusion in this paper a semi analytical method is proposed to solve the sloshing frequency of a three dimensional partially filled cylindrical tank with arbitrary liquid depth the internal liquid is considered as the ideal incompressible inviscid liquid and the wall of the tank as a rigid wall based on the linear wave theory and separation of variables the velocity potential function can be obtained with bessel functions the galerkin method is applied to solve the sloshing frequencies and the modal shapes the sloshing experiments of a cylindrical shell model partially filled with water are carried out to investigate the sloshing motion and verify the accuracy of the theoretical method the accuracy of the present method is verified by the comparison with the published results fem results and experimental results the effects of the liquid depths and length radius ratios on the sloshing frequencies are discussed for the modes with lower transverse order q 0 1 2 the sloshing frequencies of the cylindrical shell increase with the growth in the fluid height for the modes with higher transverse order the sloshing frequencies are the lowest when the fluid is half filled since the areas of the free surface are the biggest in those cases when the transverse mode number keeps constant the sloshing frequency increases with the increased longitudinal mode number for certain sloshing mode the sloshing frequency decreases as the length radius ratio increases and it will converge to that of axial mode number p 0 which is also the sloshing frequency of a corresponding two dimensional cylindrical shell this paper provides a method to solve the problem of three dimensional liquid linear sloshing in a horizontal cylindrical tank with an arbitrary liquid depth which also has the

analytical solution was presented to study the free liquid sloshing in a finite length horizontal cylindrical tank by hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 using graf s translational addition theorem and method of separation of variables some experimental studies have also been reported in the past few years kobayashi et al 1989 presented the study of the liquid sloshing response of the small and the large wave heights in the horizontal cylindrical tank they also made a comparison with the results calculated by the approximate analytical method and the analytical solutions had a good agreement with the experimental ones based on developed liquid sloshing equipment panigrahy et al 2009 implemented experiments to study the pressure on the tank walls and the free liquid surface sloshing movement by changing the excitation molin and remy 2013 ran the experiments performed on a rectangular tank with a vertical perforated screen at mid length to investigate free surface sloshing movement the focus of sauret et al 2015 is to study the effects on sloshing of the liquid foam placed on top of a liquid bath gurusamy and kumar 2020 implemented an experiment to investigate the nonlinear behavior of sloshing in the low level water rectangular tank besides the effects of excitation and dispersion had been focused on from the literature review although there are many studies on numerical solutions for the two three dimensional sloshing movement and analytical solutions for the two dimensional sloshing motion in the partially filled containers few analytical or semi analytical methods for the sloshing frequency in a three dimensional container filled with a fluid of arbitrary depth are addressed since the difficulty lies in the modeling and solution of the sloshing motion of tank with an arbitrary liquid depth in this paper a semi analytical method is proposed to solve sloshing frequencies of a three dimensional partially filled cylindrical tank at arbitrary fluid depths two coordinate systems are set at the midpoint of the free liquid surface and the geometric center of the tank cross section respectively by introducing the liquid potential function and the boundary condition at the free surface and the tank wall the motion equations of the tank are established by the coordinate transform the galerkin method is applied to solve the sloshing frequencies an experimental setup is developed to observe the sloshing motion and the sloshing frequencies and mode shapes are obtained from the experiments the accuracy of the present semi analytical method is verified by comparing it with the results obtained by experiments and other references then the effects of the length radius ratios and liquid depths on the sloshing frequencies are discussed 2 sloshing model of the cylindrical shell a horizontal circular cylindrical shell partially filled with ideal inviscid incompressible fluid is considered with the radius r 0 length l fluid depth h as shown in fig 1 two cylindrical polar coordinate systems are set in this model as shown in fig 2 the origin o 1 of one coordinate system r θ x is attached at the circle center of the endplate and the origin o 2 which is in the other coordinate system r ϕ z is at the midpoint of the liquid surface in the same surface with o 1 in fig 2 r and r represent the radial coordinate in the two coordinate systems respectively h is the distance between the free liquid surface and mid surface of the tank h 0 represents the liquid level is lower than the half filled liquid level while h 0 means that the liquid level is higher while the angle β can be expressed as β θ ϕ the relationship between the fluid height h and h could be written as h r 0 h by employing the linear wave theory the fluid velocity potential φ r ϕ z should satisfy the classical laplace equation which can be written in the polar coordinate system as 1 2 φ 2 φ r 2 1 r φ r 1 r 2 2 φ ϕ 2 2 φ z 2 0 where 2 is the laplace operator the rigid container boundary conditions with reference to figs 1 and 2 can be described as 2 φ z 0 when z 0 l 3 φ r 0 when r r 0 moreover the linearized free surface boundary condition can be depicted in the coordinate system as 4 k φ 1 r φ ϕ 0 when ϕ π 2 where k ω 2 g ω is the radian frequency of the liquid oscillations and g is the gravity acceleration according to eq 2 the velocity potential φ r ϕ z can be written tentatively by separation of variables as 5 φ r ϕ z φ r ϕ cos k z where k pπ l p 0 1 2 when p 0 corresponding to k 0 the three dimensional problem will reduce to a two dimensional case it is clear that according to the sloshing modes the general solution can be divided into two types one is the antisymmetric mode of the free surface oscillation in the transverse direction the other is the symmetric mode the solution for two modes could be expressed as 6 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a n sin n ϕ f a r cos k z for antisymmetric mode 7 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b n cos n ϕ f s r cos k z for symmetric mode for k 0 substituting eqs 6 and 7 into 1 the following bessel equations could be obtained 8 r 2 f a r f a n 2 k 2 f a 0 9 r 2 f s r f s n 2 k 2 f s 0 in order to avoid the singularity at r 0 liang et al 2015 the solutions of eqs 8 and 9 are given by the first kind of modified bessel function i n kr which is nonsingular ar r 0 so the velocity potential of both modes can be respectively described as 10 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a n sin n ϕ i n k r cos k z for antisymmetric mode 11 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b n cos n ϕ i n k r cos k z for symmetric mode where i n represent the first kind modified bessel function of order n for the antisymmetric mode eq 10 can be rewritten in the addition of odd and even terms as follow 12 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a 2 n 1 sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r a 2 n sin 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos k z substituting eq 12 into the free surface boundary condition eq 4 yields 13 n 1 2 k a 2 n 1 k a 2 n i 2 n 1 k r a 2 n i 2 n k r 0 there is a recursion relationship between the first kind of modified bessel function as follow 14 i 2 n 1 x i 2 n 1 x 2 2 n x 1 i 2 n x so from eq 13 one can get the recursion relationship about a n 15 2 k a 2 n 1 k a 2 n k a 2 n 2 0 then a 2n 1 can be rewritten as 16 a 2 n 1 k a 2 n k a 2 n 2 2 k substituting eq 16 into eq 12 the velocity potential function could be depicted as 17 φ a r ϕ z n 1 a 2 n k 2 k sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos k z now according to the relation between the coordinate system o 1 and o 2 eq 2 can be modified as 18 φ a r φ a r r r φ a ϕ ϕ r 0 when r r 0 and then by using the translation between two coordinate systems the derivatives in the coordinate r could be obtained as r r cos β ϕ r sin β r application of these derivatives gives 19 φ a r φ a r cos β φ a ϕ sin β r 0 where r h 2 2 h r 0 cos θ r 0 2 ϕ arcsin r 0 sin θ r substituting the velocity potential function eq 17 into eq 19 the rigid boundary condition can be described as 20 n 1 a 2 n l 1 l 2 1 k l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 0 where l n represents the equations as follow l 1 k 2 i 2 n 1 k r i 2 n 1 k r sin 2 n ϕ cos β l 2 2 n r cos 2 n ϕ sin β l 3 k 2 4 i 2 n 2 k r i 2 n k r sin 2 n 1 ϕ cos β l 4 k 2 4 i 2 n k r i 2 n 2 k r sin 2 n 1 ϕ cos β l 5 2 n 1 k 2 r cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin β l 6 2 n 1 k 2 r cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r sin β in order to obtain the sloshing frequencies the value of k in eq 20 should be solved the galerkin method is employed in eq 20 the circumferential potential function sin 2 m ϕ is considered as the weighting function so the application of the weighting function now gives 21 n 1 a 2 n 0 θ 0 l 1 l 2 k 0 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 sin 2 m ϕ d θ 0 where m 1 2 n k 0 1 k eq 21 can be written in the matrix form as 22 b k 0 a a 2 n 0 where the matrix b b m n a a m n and the elements of the matrix can be described as b m n 0 θ 0 l 1 sin 2 m ϕ l 2 sin 2 m ϕ d θ a m n 0 θ 0 l 3 sin 2 m ϕ l 4 sin 2 m ϕ l 5 sin 2 m ϕ l 6 sin 2 m ϕ d θ since eq 22 has non trivial solutions the determinant value of the coefficient matrix should be zero 23 b k 0 a 0 with the given axial modal number p p 0 1 2 a series of k 0 could be obtained by combining stepwise search and dichotomy then the sloshing frequency can be obtained according to k 0 for the symmetric modes the procedure follows similarly in this situation the velocity potential φ s can be expressed as 24 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b 2 n cos 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r b 2 n 1 cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r cos k z from the free surface boundary condition eq 4 the relationship between b n can be described as 25 b 2 n k b 2 n 1 k b 2 n 1 2 k so the velocity potential can be rewritten as 26 φ s r ϕ z n 0 b 2 n 1 k 2 k cos 2 n ϕ i 2 n k r cos 2 n 2 ϕ i 2 n 2 k r cos 2 n 1 ϕ i 2 n 1 k r cos k z application of the boundary condition in eq 2 gives the equation as follow 27 n

sloshing frequency for the symmetric modes can be achieved by setting the determinant value of the coefficient matrix to be zero 29 d k 0 c 0 similarly eq 29 could also be solved by combining stepwise search and dichotomy to obtain the sloshing frequencies 3 convergence analysis since infinite series exits in eqs 23 and 29 the convergence of the proposed method should be studied to ensure the accuracy of the solution after the series is truncated in this paper the matrix a b c d are square matrixes so the truncated value of rows m and columns n of the matrix are the same changing the truncation parameter n can get the convergence characteristic of this solution in this section the following parameters are used in the case shell length l 2m shell radius r 0 1m the fluid height h is set to be 0 5m 1 0m 1 5m respectively the dimensionless sloshing modes frequencies ω for the cylindrical shell with different fluid heights and truncated values are listed in table 1 where ω kr 0 ω2 r 0 g and p and q indict the longitudinal mode number and transverse mode number respectively it is shown in table 1 that when the truncated number is 20 the non dimensional sloshing frequencies ω become stable and have good precision therefore n 20 is used in the following calculation 4 sloshing experiment of a cylindrical tank with different depths in this section an experiment is implemented to study the sloshing frequencies of a cylindrical shell model and the experimental results are compared with those obtained by the presented method as shown in fig 3 the cylindrical shell model is made of acrylic with the inner diameter d 250 mm equivalent span l 500 mm and mean thickness t 5 mm two circular plates with a thickness of 40 mm are attached at both ends of the shell on the upper surface of the shell six rectangular openings are set for the laser displacement sensors which are used to measure the fluid height variation of the free surface four sensors are set along the longitudinal direction and the other two along the transverse direction theoretically the first two order longitudinal and transverse sloshing modal shapes could be obtained according to the displacements of the sensors fig 4 provides the schematic diagram of the measuring devices including the laser sensors steel plates for the devices fixing test bench cylindrical tank and data acquisition and analysis system in these facilities the cylindrical tank attached to the hoisting steel plate could swing with the steel chains which connect the test bench there is a transition steel plate between the sensor bracket and the hoisting steel plate where the transition steel plate is bolted with the hoisting steel plate and welded with the sensor bracket as shown in fig 5 the experiment is executed with different inner liquid heights for the reason that the sensors could receive the reflection signals of the light from the water surface freshwater added some white pigments is used as a sloshing liquid in addition the pigments have no influence on the viscosity of the sloshing liquid fig 5 a c show the model tank with different liquid heights i e 1 3d 1 2d and 2 3d respectively in this experiment the laser displacement sensors are used to record the data of displacement variation of the free surface when the tank swings back and forth the internal liquid will make the sloshing movement and the data of the displacement variation could be acquired by the acquisition system and be imported into the laptop to make the analysis fig 6 shows the sloshing displacement curve of sensor no 6 with different liquid heights while fig 7 shows photos of the sloshing movement of the internal liquid with different depth as shown in fig 6 the wave height variations are not linear in the first few seconds and then the wave heights demonstrate the linear attenuation trend the linear attenuation data were analyzed to study the sloshing movement of the free sloshing wave from the mode analysis software utekma v2004 the sloshing modal shapes and the sloshing frequencies are obtained table 2 shows the sloshing frequencies of the first few modes with different liquid heights and the experimental sloshing frequencies are compared with those from the present method pm meanwhile table 3 provides the modal shapes of the first few modes where the dash lines represent the original free surface and the solid lines represent the free surface modal shapes in table 3 the longer line represents the longitudinal direction while the shorter represents the transverse direction as can be seen from table 2 the experimental results have a good agreement with the results obtained by the present method 5 accuracy verification of present method to verify the accuracy of the present method two numerical examples are taken into consideration and the computational results are compared with published results or fem results in the first example a two dimensional partially filled cylindrical shell in mciver 1989 is considered since the length of the shell is finite in our theoretical model the shell length radius ratio is set as 200 to model the two dimensional partially filled cylindrical shell in our calculation the non dimensional frequencies with three different fluid heights are listed in table 4 and compared with the results in mciver 1989 for symmetric and antisymmetric modes from table 4 it is obvious that the results calculated by the present method have good agreements with those in the reference mciver 1989 so it is believed that when the shell length is large enough the sloshing frequencies calculated in this method can approximately be regarded as the frequencies with the axial wavenumber be zero which means k 0 in the second example a three dimensional model from hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 is introduced to check the validity of the present method in this case the parameters are used as shell length l 2m shell radius r 0 1m and the fluid height h is set as 0 5m 1m 1 5m respectively table 5 presents the non dimensional sloshing frequencies at different fluid heights it can be found that the sloshing frequencies acquired by the present method show excellent agreement with the results from hasheminejad and soleimani 2017 meanwhile the sloshing frequencies calculated by the present method are also compared with the fem results the structural parameters of the tank are set as the length l 2m r 0 1m fig 8 shows the fem model of the fluid in the cylindrical shell with the fluid height h 0 5m the fluid is modeled with element type fluid30 in ansys in the following calculations the fluid height is set as 0 5m 1 0m 1 5m respectively table 6 gives the sloshing frequencies f pm and f fem which are frequencies obtained by the pm present method and the fem with different fluid heights respectively as shown in table 6 the results obtained by the present method are in great agreement with those of the fem meanwhile the sloshing modal shapes are compared between the present method pm and the fem fig 9 shows modal shapes for the fluid surface with fluid height h 0 5m as seen in fig 9 the mode shapes obtained by the present method are in excellent agreement with those calculated by the fem according to a lot of numerical examples it can be found that the results of the sloshing frequencies have satisfactory accuracy when the fluid level varies from 0 2r 0 1 8r 0 which covers most engineering practices in general these comparison examples all suggest the effectiveness and accuracy of the present semi analytical method 6 parametric analysis and discussions 6 1 effect of fluid height on the sloshing frequencies as can be seen from section 5 the liquid depth has an apparent influence on the sloshing frequencies in this section the effect of fluid height is studied the following case is considered with shell radius r 0 1m and liquid depth 0 7m 0 4m 1 0m 1 4m and 1 7m respectively table 7 and table 8 present the sloshing frequencies corresponding to different axial and transverse modes note p q respectively represents the axial mode number and transverse mode number of the free surface s sloshing and reflects the sloshing mode shape of the free surface the length to radius ratio is set as l r 0 2 3 in tables 7 and 8 respectively fig 10 presents the variation of the sloshing frequencies with different modal shapes with axis mode p 0 1 2 3 and transverse mode q 0 to 6 respectively it reveals some characteristics of the sloshing frequencies as follows at first when the longitudinal modal number p and the fluid height are all determined the sloshing frequencies would increase with the increase of the transverse modal number according to ref graham and rodriguez 1952 the reason can be described as follow in the equivalent mechanical sloshing model the mass of fluid mf can be divided into a fixed mass m f and an infinite series of undamped spring masses m j transverse mode number j 0 1 2 the fixed mass is regarded as the stable part that does not participate in the sloshing motion while the undamped spring masses are considered as the sloshing part with the increase of the transverse modal number the percentage of the sloshing part in the internal fluid would gradually decrease correspondingly there is an increase in the sloshing frequency when the transverse modal number increases fig 11 presents the sloshing frequencies for the partially liquid filled cylindrical shell versus fluid heights with different modal orders as shown in fig 11 the sloshing frequencies corresponding to certain modal shapes change with the liquid depth obviously for the modes with lower transverse orders like q 0 1 2 and constant longitudinal modal number the sloshing frequencies would increase with the growth of the fluid height this may be interpreted that when the sloshing mode is the lower order transverse mode the proportion of the sloshing part in the internal fluid would depress as the fluid height increase and the intensity of sloshing may be reduced as a result there is an increase in the sloshing frequencies accordingly however for the modes with higher transverse orders the sloshing frequencies would decrease at first and then increase with the increase of the fluid height the sloshing frequency is the lowest when the liquid is half filled the reason can be explained that nodes of the free surface corresponding to higher transverse order sloshing would be greater than those of the lower order but the area of the free surface with the higher or lower fluid level are both smaller than that of the half filled fluid level therefore for the half filled case the sloshing frequency is the lowest for higher order modes 6 2 effect of length radius ratio on the sloshing frequencies in this section the sloshing frequencies are also obtained for the partially fluid filled cylindrical with different length radius ratios l r 0 fig 12 shows the sloshing frequencies versus the length radius ratio with different fluid heights where note p q indicts the longitudinal mode number and transverse mode number it is shown in fig 12 that when the transverse mode number keeps constant q 1 or q 4 the sloshing frequency increases with the increase of the longitudinal mode number p for certain sloshing modes i e p and q keep constant it is obvious that the sloshing frequency decreases as the length radius ratio increases moreover it can be observed that the sloshing frequency may decrease to a special value when the increasing length radius ratio is great enough through the subsequent calculation of the sloshing frequencies it can be found that the sloshing frequency will converge to that of axial mode number p 0 for example the sloshing frequency of the mode 1 4 would be close to that of mode 0 4 as the length radius ratio is great enough this conclusion is also consistent with that in section 5 that when the shell length is large enough the sloshing frequencies calculated can be regarded as the frequencies with the axial wavenumber be zero approximately and it would be convergent to the two dimensional sloshing frequency this is linked to the reason that as the length of the tank increases to a very larger value the cylindrical tank could be considered as an infinitely long cylindrical tank 7 conclusion in this paper a semi analytical method is proposed to solve the sloshing frequency of a three dimensional partially filled cylindrical tank with arbitrary liquid depth the internal liquid is considered as the ideal incompressible inviscid liquid and the wall of the tank as a rigid wall based on the linear wave theory and separation of variables the velocity potential function can be obtained with bessel functions the galerkin method is applied to solve the sloshing frequencies and the modal shapes the sloshing experiments of a cylindrical shell model partially filled with water are carried out to investigate the sloshing motion and verify the accuracy of the theoretical method the accuracy of the present method is verified by the comparison with the published results fem results and experimental results the effects of the liquid depths and length radius ratios on the sloshing frequencies are discussed for the modes with lower transverse order q 0 1 2 the sloshing frequencies of the cylindrical shell increase with the growth in the fluid height for the modes with higher transverse order the sloshing frequencies are the lowest when the fluid is half filled since the areas of the free surface are the biggest in those cases when the transverse mode number keeps constant the sloshing frequency increases with the increased longitudinal mode number for certain sloshing mode the sloshing frequency decreases as the length radius ratio increases and it will converge to that of axial mode number p 0 which is also the sloshing frequency of a corresponding two dimensional cylindrical shell this paper provides a method to solve the problem of three dimensional liquid linear sloshing in a horizontal cylindrical tank with an arbitrary liquid depth which also has the potential to other structures three dimensional sloshing credit authorship contribution statement yueyang han conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis visualization writing

20233,flow induced vibration fiv of a rotating circular cylinder with high rotation rates between 4 5 and 8 a low reynolds number re of 100 and a mass ratio of 11 5 is investigated by two dimensional numerical simulations the responses of the high speed rotating cylinder are classified into two steady flow regimes s1 and s2 five vortex induced vibration viv regimes viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p and viv 2p and two impulsive galloping ig regimes ig and ig all the regimes are mapped on a rotation rate versus reduced velocity plane in viv t s regime a triplex and a single vortex are shed alternatively from the cylinder in two consecutive vibration periods viv 2p regime has the same number of vortices shed in each vibration period as viv 2p but the amplitude of vibration in two consecutive periods are different from each other in all the identified viv regimes shear layers are separated from only one side of the cylinder and form vortices instead of both sides which is observed at low rotation rates this makes the flow patterns of all the identified viv regimes different from the ones observed at low rotation rates impulsive galloping ig is the repetitive occurrence of the galloping peak followed by a few periods of viv impulsive galloping occurs periodically in the ig regime and randomly in the ig regime during each ig period the vibration displacement reaches

engineering but also in infrastructures such as buildings and bridges it is well known that as the reynolds number re is increased beyond re 47 flow in the wake of a circular cylinder becomes unsteady and vortices are periodically shed from two sides of the cylinder forming a so called von kármán vortex street the reynolds number is defined as re ud ν where u is the incoming flow velocity d is the diameter and ν is kinematic viscosity the wake flow transitions from two dimensional to three dimensional flows at around re 200 thompson et al 1996 barkley and henderson 1996 karniadakis and triantafyllou 1992 hammache and gharib 1991 williamson 1988 rotation of a circular cylinder in a fluid flow changes the flow characteristics drastically especially at high rotation rates the rotation rate α is defined as the ratio of the rotating speed of the cylinder surface to the free stream velocity both reynolds number and rotation rate have profound effects on flow past a rotating cylinder chang and chern 1991 the rotation of the cylinder breaks the symmetry of the wake and thus influences the corresponding forces on the cylinder it was found that at a low rotation rate of α 2 the vortex street of a rotating circular cylinder was similar to von kármán vortex street and the vortex shedding is referred to as mode i shedding stojković et al 2002 pralits et al 2010 in mode i shedding regime the strouhal number is nearly independent of the rotation rate the vortex shedding was found to be fully suppressed when α is greater than 2 diaz et al 1983 badr et al 1990 chew et al 1995 chou 2000 kang et al 1999 numerically investigated laminar flow past a rotating circular cylinder and found that the critical α above which the vortex shedding was suppressed increased with the increase of reynolds number it is about 1 4 1 8 and 1 9 for re 60 100 and 160 respectively the classification of the flow modes for a rotating cylinder can be found in the review by rao et al 2015 lam 2009 studied flow past a rotating cylinder at re 3600 to 5000 and α 2 5 using flow visualization and particle image velocimetry piv measurements he found that the wake became increasingly narrow and deflected sideways with increasing cylinder rotation speed and the formation length of the vortices decreased with the increase of α leading to a slight increase in the vortex shedding frequency stojković et al 2002 and pralits et al 2010 reported a mode ii shedding regime in the rotation rate range of 4 8 α 5 15 at re 100 which is characterized by the shedding of one counterclockwise vortex from one side of the cylinder in one vortex shedding period the lift coefficient increases drastically with the increase of the rotation rate in the mode ii shedding regime mittal and kumar 2003 and lu et al 2011 found that for re 200 the vortex shedding is suppressed at 1 91 α 4 34 and the mode ii shedding starts at α 4 35 el akoury et al 2008 conducted two dimensional numerical simulations for r e 500 and concluded that the flow transitions to mode ii shedding earlier if reynolds number increases mittal 2004 performed numerical simulations to study three dimensionality of flow past a rotating cylinder at re 200 and a wide range of α from 0 to 5 it was found that the centrifugal instabilities exist along the entire span at a rotation rate α of 5 rao et al 2013a b used linear stability analysis to study two to three dimensional transition of wake flow past a rotating cylinder at reynolds numbers less than 400 and rotation rates of α 7 they observed that the three dimensionality in the wake of a rotating cylinder is similar to a non rotating cylinder at α 1 five unsteady three dimensional modes were found in the mode i shedding regime and four three dimensional modes were observed in the steady regimes of flow for α 2 later navrose et al 2015 performed a detailed linear stability analysis at 200 r e 350 to study the steady and unsteady modes associated with mode i shedding and mode ii shedding for a rotational rate range of α 5 in a recent study by munir et al 2019 a detailed three dimensional numerical study was conducted to investigate the two to three dimensional transition of flow both as a function of reynolds number and rotation rate it was found that the transition of flow to three dimensional occur for lower reynolds number and the lift coefficient inside the mode ii shedding rotation rate range for lower reynolds number of re 100 was similar to previous two dimensional numerical results since vibration of cylindrical structures in fluid flows occurs mainly due to the dynamic vortex shedding flow the flow induced vibration of these structures is generally called vortex induced vibration viv the viv of a non rotating circular cylinder has been extensively studied in the past few decades with the aim to understand the physics of viv at low and high mass ratios bearman 1984 feng 1968 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 recently a number of studies are directed towards understanding the influence of the rotation of the cylinder on the viv bourguet and lo jacono 2014 studied one degree of freedom 1dof flow induced vibration of a rotating cylinder in the cross flow direction at a very low reynolds number of 100 zhao et al 2014b performed two dimensional numerical simulations of vortex induced vibration of a rotating cylinder at a low reynolds number of 150 and a low mass ratio of 2 at α 1 the lock in regime was found to widen and the maximum amplitude increased with the increase of rotation rate furthermore the inline vibrations became prominent at higher rotation rates if the cylinder is allowed to vibrate both in the inline and cross flow directions zou et al 2019 bourguet and lo jacono 2015 performed two dimensional numerical simulation of flow past a rotating cylinder allowed to oscillate in inline direction and classified the vibration response as a function of rotation rate a number of studies are dedicated to force reduction using rotational oscillation of a cylinder placed in a fluid flow sengupta and patidar 2018 lee and lee 2007 seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2015 carried out experimental study of viv of a rotating circular cylinder in transverse direction of flow in a recirculating water tunnel for rotation rates ranging from 0 to 2 6 and reynolds numbers ranging from 350 to 1000 it was found that the lock in regime became narrow as the rotation rate was greater than 1 4 and the oscillation of the cylinder ceased at rotation rates greater than 2 4 munir et al 2018 conducted three dimensional numerical simulations at α 3 5 to investigate the effect of higher rotation rate inside the lock in regime it was found that the vibration is suppressed when the rotation rate is increased beyond a critical value which is dependent on reduced velocity recently bourguet 2019 simulated flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder in arbitrary directions at re 100 and α 3 5 galloping type response was found at α 3 and higher reduced velocities if the angle between the incoming flow and direction of vibrating cylinder was greater than 90 bourguet 2020 further performed numerical simulations at re 100 to understand the flow physics of two degree of freedom flow induced vibrations of a high speed rotating cylinder the rotation rate was changed from 0 to 5 5 and reduced velocity from 1 to 25 additional three dimensional simulations showed that the flow transition had less influence on the system behavior in terms of the vibration response the frequency and vibration response obtained from two and three dimensional simulations were very close to each other in the high amplitude response region despite these experimental and numerical studies on fiv of rotating cylinders there are no systematic studies available to understand the dynamics of fiv in cross flow direction of high speed rotating cylinder in mode ii shedding regime and beyond to the best of our knowledge the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to study in detail the amplitude response at rotation rates inside and higher than mode ii shedding regime by performing detailed two dimensional simulations 2 to understand the flow physics of different flow regimes identified on a map of the rotation rate versus reduced velocity plane by analyzing the corresponding flow structures and correlating them with force coefficients and vibration displacement the circular cylinder is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction only and simulations are carried out at α 4 5 to 8 re 100 and reduced velocities of v r 2 to 40 v r is defined as v r u f n d in this study where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the damping ratio the reynolds number and the mass ratio are kept constant at 0 100 and 11 5 respectively the mass ratio of 11 5 was used in a previous numerical study by munir et al 2018 to investigate flow past a low speed rotating cylinder the rest of the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the governing equations and the numerical model used in this study is presented in section 3 a mesh dependency study is presented and the numerical model is validated by comparing the numerical results with published data in sections 4 5 and 6 the response mode the wake flow patterns and the vibration amplitudes are discussed respectively finally conclusions are drawn in section 7 it is envisaged that this study will further improve the understanding of the dynamics of rotating cylinders and lead to an improvement of the designs of subsea drillers and vibrations suppression devices through rotation 2 numerical method fig 1 a show the computational domain used for simulating fiv of a rotating cylinder which is 100d long and 110d wide the center of the cylinder is placed at 50d from the left boundary and the two side boundaries the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction of the flow the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 to simulate the flow the finite element mesh is updated after every computational time step to accommodate the evolution of cylinder position the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method which has been found to be an accurate method for simulating the viv of cylinders in fluid flow is used in this study the velocity u v the time t the length x y and the pressure p are non dimensionalized as u v u v u t u t d x y x y d p p ρ u 2 respectively where the tilde denotes the dimensional parameters and ρ is the fluid density the non dimensional ale formulations of the ns equations for incompressible flow are expressed as 1 u i t u j u j m u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where x 1 x and x 2 y are the cartesian coordinates in the in line and transverse directions of the flow respectively u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction t is the time and u im is the velocity of the moving mesh the non dimensional equation of the motion of the cylinder is 3 y 4 π ζ v r y 4 π 2 v r 2 y 2 c l π m where y y and y are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction respectively m m m d is the mass ratio with m being the mass of the cylinder and m d being the displaced fluid mass ζ is the damping ratio and c l is the lift coefficient which is defined as c l f l ρ d u 2 2 with f l being the lift force on the cylinder in the cross flow direction the detailed pg fem method for solving the ns equations can be found in zhao et al 2007 and will not be discussed here the equation of motion is solved using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm after each computational time step in the numerical simulation the position of the cylinder changes and the whole computation domain has to be moved accordingly in the ale scheme the mesh nodes can be moved in an arbitrary way to ensure that the finite elements are as little distorted as possible if the boundary of the computational domain does not move and only the cylinder moves the displacement of the mesh nodes can be calculated by using the following equation 4 γ s i 0 where s i represents the displacement of the nodal points in the y direction and γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation in order to avoid excessive deformation of the near wall elements the parameter γ in a finite element can be chosen to be inversely proportional to the area of the element zhao and cheng 2011 by specifying the displacements at all the boundaries eq 4 can be solved by the galerkin fem when fiv of a rotating cylinder is simulated at large rotation rates and large reduced velocities the mean deflection of the cylinder was found to be significantly greater than the cylinder diameter of all the studied cases the maximum mean deflection of the cylinder in the negative y direction for the maximum rotation rate and maximum reduced velocity is over 60 diameters using eq 4 without moving the boundary of computational domain proved inadequate to cater for such large displacements because of overlapping mesh to overcome this problem the whole computational domain was made to move together with the cylinder resulting in a mesh velocity the same as the vibration velocity of the cylinder in the whole computational domain i e u x m 0 and u y m y fig 1 b shows the computational mesh near the cylinder surface used in this study herein referred to as the normal mesh the computational domain is divided into 34400 quadrilateral linear finite element the circumference of the cylinder is discretized in to 120 elements and the mesh size in the radial direction is 0 00038d on the cylinder surface initially the velocity and the pressure in the whole computational domain are set to zero the boundary conditions for the ns equations are as follows non slip boundary condition is used on the surface of the cylinder i e the velocity at the inlet boundary is given and the fluid velocity at the cylinder surface equals to the sum of the vibration velocity and the rotation velocity of the cylinder surface at the outlet boundary the pressure and the gradient of velocity in the inline direction are set to zero at the two lateral boundaries the gradient of the pressure and streamwise velocity in the cross flow direction are set to zero and the cross flow velocity is zero 3 mesh dependency study and validation of the numerical model to ensure that the approach of moving the whole computational domain with a constant velocity u y m y does produce the same results as eq 4 at low reduced velocity simulation for α 4 9 and v r 5 is conducted using the two mesh moving methods fig 2 a shows the comparison between the results from the two mesh moving methods it can be seen that the two time histories of the y displacement are almost identical with each other the amplitude and frequency calculated from u y m y differ from their counterparts calculated using eq 4 by about 0 2 and 0 1 respectively a domain size dependency study is conducted to prove the computational domain is large enough to obtain accurate solution of fiv of a cylinder at high rotation rates a simulation was conducted using a larger 110d long and 250d wide computational domain for α v r 8 40 the largest rotational rate and the largest reduced velocity having the largest vibration amplitude in this study fig 2 b presents the time histories of vibration displacement obtained using the larger and normal computational domains the galloping like response will be discussed in detail in section 4 it can be seen from fig 2 b that the frequency of the vibration obtained using larger domain is almost the same as that obtained from the normal computational domain whereas the difference in amplitude between the two results is less than 2 a mesh dependency study is performed to ensure that the mesh density is high enough to get converged results simulations using two additional meshes of different mesh densities are performed at α 5 1 and v r 6 and 40 and the results are listed in table 1 where δr n c and n node stand for the radial element size on the cylinder surface the number of elements along the circumference of the cylinder and the total number of nodes of the elements respectively the results of the amplitude mean displacement and frequencies from different meshes are compared quantitatively with each other in table 1 the response amplitude in the y direction is defined as a y y max y min 2 where the maximum displacement y max and the minimum displacement y min are obtained from the time histories of cylinder displacement in the last 10 vibration periods the frequency of the cylinder in the y direction f y is normalized by the natural frequency of the cylinder f n the difference between the amplitudes calculated from the dense and normal meshes is about 2 and the difference between the mean displacement from the dense and normal meshes is less than 2 6 at α 5 1 and v r 6 the frequencies obtained from the dense and normal mesh at α 5 1 and v r 6 are very close to each other with a difference of 0 4 the frequencies for v r 40 are not available in table 1 because the vibration is aperiodic galloping like vibration as shown in fig 3 b which will be discussed in detail in the next section the amplitudes and mean displacement in y direction of the galloping like vibration in table 1 from different meshes are very close to each other the numerical model used in this study has been previously used to simulate viv of rotating cylinders for re 150 and small rotation rates of α 0 5 and 1 in zhao et al 2014b where a detailed validation study has been performed to validate the numerical model for large rotation rates simulations are performed for a non vibrating cylinder rotating at high speeds at re 200 and a range of rotation rate the corresponding time histories of lift coefficient are compared with the numerical results by lu et al 2011 and mittal 2004 in fig 4 the mean lift coefficients are negative due to the magnus effect caused by the rotation of the cylinder the flow transitions from vortex shedding flow to no vortex shedding flow as the rotation rate is increased beyond a critical value the lift coefficients for α 4 2 which marks the end of no vortex shedding regime agree very well with other two sets of two dimensional numerical results α 4 4 and 4 7 are in the very narrow mode ii shedding regime where the lift coefficient oscillates periodically at very low frequencies the mean value the amplitude and the period of the lift coefficient are almost the same as those in previous studies for α 4 4 and 4 7 however the phases of the lift coefficients in the three studies are not the same this is because the onset of the mode ii shedding occurs randomly in the numerical simulations as the rotation rate is increased beyond 4 7 the vortex shedding is suppressed again and the present results are in very good agreement with the previous results in this range of rotation rate in addition to the above validation additional simulation is carried out at α 5 and re 100 and the calculated frequency mean drag coefficient and lift coefficient are compared with the results in the previous studies by śtojković et al 2002 and bourguet 2020 in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that frequencies and mean lift coefficients in the three studies are in good agreement the mean drag coefficient in the present study is very close to the value in the most recent study by bourguet 2020 in order to validate the present numerical model at very high rotation rate an additional numerical simulation using nektar canwell et al 2015 are performed to simulate the galloping like vibration at α v r 4 9 39 the ns equations were solved through the velocity correction scheme along with a continuous galerkin projection from the unsteady incompressible ns solver a second order implicit explicit time integration scheme was chosen the code employs high order quadrilateral expansions within each element through the gauss lobatto legendre quadrature points np a total number of 877 macro quadrilateral elements were used in nektar simulation while in each element n p 8 8 th order element this results in 42973 elements more than the normal mesh in table 1 fig 5 compares the time histories of the cylinder displacement at α v r 4 9 39 obtained by nektar and the present model the results agree very well thus further validate the accuracy of the present numerical model the occurrence frequency the mean position and the amplitude of impulsive peaks of the vibration differ from their counter parts calculated by nektar by less than 1 the small amplitude vibrations between every two consecutive impulsive peaks from the two methods also agree well with each other 4 vibration response modes the aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of high rotation rate on fiv of a rotating circular cylinder the reynolds number is set to 100 and mass ratio to 11 5 for flow past a stationary cylinder at re 100 the mode ii vortex shedding regime is in the range of 4 8 α 5 15 and the flow is steady as α is greater than 5 15 stojković et al 2002 to capture the variation of the flow near mode ii vortex shedding regime simulations are performed for rotation rates in the range between 4 5 and 5 1 with an increment of 0 1 in additioin α 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 are also simulated where distinct vibration modes are found as v r exceeds a critical value for each rotation rate reduced velocities from 2 to 40 with increment of 1 are covered response modes are found to be very different from those at low rotation rates and they are mapped on the v r α plane in fig 6 fig 7 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for different response regimes viv regime in fig 6 is the regime where vortex shedding and the vibrating frequencies synchronize however the number of vortices that are shed within one periof of vibration is dependent on the reduced velocitiy in this study the viv regimes are further subdivided into a number of sub regimes and the viv regime name is represented by a prefix viv followed by the vortex shedding pattern while the detailed flow patterns will be discussed in sectioin 5 the response modes identified from the map of fig 6 are summarized below o s1 and s2 the flow is steady and the cylinder remains stationary s1 and s2 are the steady flow modes s1 is found at α lower than the rotation rates of mode ii vortex shedding while s2 appears at α higher than that of mode ii o viv 1s the response amplitude is extremely small and the frequency is much lower than the natural frequency fig 7 a only a single vortex viv 1s is shed from the cylinder in one vibration period and flow is similar to mode ii shedding o viv 2s the vortex shedding frequency and the vibration frequency synchronize fig 7 b two single vortices 2s are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration viv 2s regime is observed in the small reduced velocity region o viv t s the vibration and the vortex shedding flow repeat after every two vibration periods as shown in fig 7 c a triplex t of vortices and a single s vortex are alternatively shed from the cylinder in the first and second periods respectively o viv 2p the vibration is periodic and two pair 2p of vortices are shed from the cylinder in each vibration period as shown in fig 7 d the vibration frequency is close to the natural frequency o viv 2p the vortices that are shed from the cylinder in each vibration period is 2p however the vibration and the flow repeat every two periods as shown in fig 7 e o ig this mode is the combination of viv and galloping high peaks due to impulsive galloping occur periodically as shown in fig 7 g and h between two high impulsive galloping peaks there are several periods of viv the high peak amplitude due to impulsive galloping does not perfectly remain constant in fig 7 g and h it varies slightly less than 2 5 from period to period o ig this mode is an ig mode where the impulsive galloping peaks occurs very randomly as shown in fig 7 f 5 wake flow patterns the wake flow patterns of all the response regimes are different from those at low rotation rates except s1 and s2 in addition to the newly found regimes of viv 1s ig and ig the vortex flow pattern in the viv 2s viv t s and viv 2p modes are also different from the 2s t s and 2p modes for viv of a rotating cylinder at low rotation rates α 4 reported in previous studies bourguet and lo jacono 2014 5 1 viv 1s regime at a rotation rate of 4 9 different modes of vibration of the cylinder occur in the whole range of reduced velocity between 2 and 40 the rotation rate of α 4 9 is used to illustrate the response regimes because the response goes through viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p ig and ig regimes with the increase of v r viv 1s regime is excited by very low frequency mode ii vortex shedding in the range of 4 9 v r 5 1 and very small reduced velocities less than 3 fig 8 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficient for viv 1s regime at α v r 4 9 2 the streaklines are generated by releasing particles on two sides of the cylinder between r 0 5 and 1 where r is the distance from the cylinder centre the vibration amplitude is very small 0 00665 because the frequency of the lift coefficient caused by the mode ii shedding is much lower than the natural frequency the lift coefficient and displacement are in phase with each other as shown in fig 8 f the vortex shedding pattern in viv 1s mode is a typical vortex shedding in the mode ii regime for flow past a non vibrating cylinder mittal and kumar 2003 both positive and negative free shear layers are separated from the bottom side of the cylinder and only one positive vortex is shed from the cylinder when the cylinder moves upwards in one period of vibration fig 8 c the size of the positive vortex grows before it is shed from the cylinder at tf n 288 5 when the cylinder moves downwards from c e in fig 8 a new positive vortex gradually forms the very weak separated negative shear layer from the bottom side of the cylinder extends to a long distance downstream the cylinder but does not form vortices the separated negative shear layer dissipates quickly because of the strong cancellation effects from its strong neighboring positive shear layer since only one vortex is shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the vibration mode is defined as viv 1s mode it can be seen in fig 8 f that only one vortex being shed from the cylinder in one vibration cycle makes the vibration displacement and lift coefficient asymmetric the strong vortex in each vibration period can be clearly seen in the streaklines presented in fig 8 g 5 2 viv 2s regime fig 9 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficeint for viv 2s regime at α v r 4 9 8 the lift coefficient and the displacement are in phase but are not of typical sinusoidal shape because the wake is asymmetric similar to that in the viv 1s regime a positive and a negative shear layers are separated from the bottom side of the cylinder however the negative shear layer has become sufficiently strong to form vortices as a result one pair of vortices labeled as a and b in fig 9 are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration forming a diagonally aligned vortex street in the wake a positive and a negative vortex are shed from the cylinder when the cylinder moves downwards and upwards respectively this periodic shedding of vortices from the bottom side of the cylinder results in periodic vibration with a constant amplitude based on the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder the wake is in viv 2s mode where 2s means that two single vortices are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the vibration frequency in fig 9 f is significantly increased compared with that in the viv 1s regime and is close to the natural frequency indicating the lock in between vibration and vortex shedding the arrangement of the two rows of wake vortices of the mode viv 2s in fig 9 is very different from the 2s mode viv of a non rotating cylinder or a rotating cylinder at low rotation rate where the top row vortices are negative and the bottom row of vortices are positive zhao et al 2014 bourguet and lo jacono 2014 however in the viv 2s wake in fig 9 the signs of the two rows of vortices are swapped compared with that of a wake of a non rotating cylinder in the streaklines of fig 9 g the high speed rotation of the cylinder forces all the particles released from the top side of the cylinder to move to the bottom side along the cylinder surface an s shaped wavy streakline pattern is formed in the wake of the cylinder every turning point of the streaklines corresponds to either a positive or a negative vortex in the vorticity contours a wavy streakline pattern with many bends results in a vortex street with positive and negative vortices shown in fig 9 g bourguet and lo jacono 2014 also observed 2s modes of vibrations in their study on flow past a rotating cylinder for low rotation rates α 2 5 however vortices were shed from both the top and bottom sides of the cylinder in their 2s modes instead of being shed from a single side as shown in fig 9 5 3 viv t s regime fig 10 shows the vorticity contours streaklines and the time histories of the lift coefficient and displacement for viv t s regime observed at α v r 4 9 12 fig 10 k shows that both lift coefficient and vibration displacement repeat after every two vibration periods this is because the vortex shedding process repeats every two vibration periods in the period from a e in fig 10 three vortices a b and c are shed from the cylinder of these three vortices a and b are shed when the cylinder moves upward and c is shed when the cylinder moves downwards in the next period from e to i only one vortex d is shed from the cylinder after two consecutive periods of vibration as shown in fig 10 j the three new vortices a b and c are shed exactly the same way as vortices a b and c were shed the vortex shedding pattern in fig 10 is defined as viv t s mode where t s means that the flow repeat after two vibration periods and a triplet and a single vortex is shed in the first and second period respectively in the current viv t s mode all free shear layers are generated from one side of the cylinder before they form vortices while in the t s mode at low rotation rates found by bourguet and lo jacono 2014 free shear layers are separated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices the lift coefficient shown in fig 10 k is clearly the superimposition of high frequency components on a low frequency component in each period because of the change of vortex shedding after each period to understand the correlation between lift coefficient and displacement ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd is used to decompose the lift coefficient into intrinsic mode functions imf and the n th mode is represented as imfn the imfn is the nth mono component function or oscillatory mode with one frequency component eemd is used because it does not have the problem of mode mixing compared to empirical model deposition emd method wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a gaci 2016 the original signal x t can be constructed from imfs using the following relationship 5 x t n 1 n 1 imf n t r n t where n 1 is the number of imfs and r n t is the residue the first three imf components imf1 to imf3 of the lift coefficient are plotted in fig 10 l imf1 of the lift coefficient oscillates irregularly and has a frequency much higher than the vibration frequency fig 10 n shows fft of lift coefficient and vibration displacement where higher harmonics of lift coefficient represents the frequency of imf1 the very irregular but weak oscillations of imf1 are mainly because of the significant difference between the vortex shedding in two adjacent periods as discussed above imf1 does not have any effect on the vibration since its frequency does not synchronize with the vibration frequency and its amplitude is small in the displacement no frequency higher than the vibration frequency is seen as observed from fig 10 n the frequency of imf2 lift coefficient and the frequency of the displacement y synchronize and they are in phase with each other the imf3 of the lift coefficient has a period twice the vibration period which is also observed from fig 10 n as a dominant sub harmonic of lift coefficient and it is strong because of the strong difference between the vortex shedding of two consecutive periods of vibration although imf3 does not lock in with the natural frequency of the cylinder the high amplitude of imf3 lift coefficient causes the slight difference between vibration amplitudes in two consecutive periods all the vortices identified in fig 10 a j can also been seen in the streaklines in fig 10 m where a set of vortices a to d are from the previous dual period vibration cycle and a new vortex a has formed in the new cycle the vortices in the streaklines of fig 10 m are much stronger than those in fig 9 g and the vibration amplitude is higher 5 4 viv 2p regime fig 11 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficient for viv 2p regime at α v r 4 9 22 where both vibration displacement and lift coefficent are periodic see fig 11 g the frequency of the lift coefficient is twice the vibration frequency because the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period is two pairs vortices a to d labeled in fig 11 as a result the vortex shedding is in the viv 2p mode meaning that two pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the lift coefficient in the first half period is different from that in the second half period mainly because within one vibration period the first pair of vortices a and b are different from the second pair c and d after one period see fig 11 e two more pairs of vortices a b c and d are shed from the cylinder in fig 11 f the 2p mode in fig 11 is not the same as the 2p mode for viv of a non rotating cylinder in the present 2p mode two vortices in opposite directions are shed in every half period in the classical 2p mode vortex shedding observed in the lower branch of viv of a non rotating cylinder the sequence of the vortex shedding is such that two positive vortices are shed in the first half period and 2 negative vortices in the second half period govardhan and williamson 2000 in the 2p mode the dominant frequency of the lift coefficient is twice the vibration frequency because of which the response resembles the galloping like response although the period of the lift coefficient is half the vibration period the difference between the lift coefficient in the first and second half vibration periods which is caused by the difference in the vortex shedding creates imp3 lift coefficient that synchronizes with the vibration frequency the vibration amplitude is increased significantly in viv 2p regime because both the vibration frequency and the frequency of imp3 lift coefficient are closer to the natural frequency it is also seen that imp3 of the lift coefficient is in phase with the vibration displacement y by comparing the vorticity contours in figs 8 12 it can be seen that wake vortices are strong in the non lock in regime because the very long vortex shedding period provides sufficient time to allow the single vortex to be fully developed in each period the strength of wake vortices becomes weak in viv 2s regime and increases again as the response mode changes from viv t s and viv 2p fig 12 shows the flow structure of a viv 2p regime at α v r 5 5 21 the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period in viv 2p regime is the same as that in viv 2 regime however the vortex shedding pattern and the vibration in viv 2p regime varies from period to period fig 7 e is an example of viv 2p mode where the vibration repeat every two vibration period two pairs of vortices a to d are shed from the cylinder within the period between a to e and another two pairs of vortices e to h are shed from the cylinder within the period between e to i the wake vortex arrangement at the two instants e and i with the same phase are similar but not exactly the same the response of the cylinder in fig 12 is essentially galloping like response because the vortex shedding frequency is much higher than the vibration frequency of the cylinder as observed at viv 2p during fig 12 a i which is two vibration periods four pair of vortices a h are shed from the cylinder resulting in 2p mode similar to viv 2p regime it is further observed from fig 12 j that the lift coefficient fluctuates very irregularly indicating the instability of the vortex shedding 5 5 impulsive galloping ig regime fig 13 f shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for the impulsive galloping ig regime at α v r 4 9 39 the main characteristic of ig response is the occurrence of impulsive high amplitude peaks that occurs periodically between these peaks a number of small amplitude relative to the impulsive peaks vortex induced vibration occurs the flow mode is defined as galloping because the high amplitude peaks have much higher amplitude than that of viv the galloping amplitude increases with the increase of reduced velocity from the start to the end time of each impulsive peak 10 periods of vortex shedding occur fig 13 d and e the flow mode is defined as ig regime if the impulsive peaks occurs periodically and ig mode if the impulsive peaks occurs randomly see fig 7 f from the map of fig 6 it is observed that ig mode mainly occurs at lower range of reduced velocity than ig mode fig 13 show the evolution of the wake through the galloping stage and viv stage in the ig regime at the instant when the cylinder starts moving upwards and enters the galloping stage in fig 13 a the diagonally aligned vortex street is similar to the viv 1s response vortex in fig 8 where a positive vortex is shed from the cylinder followed by a growth in the negative shear layer the negative shear layer elongates in the wake of the cylinder and dissipates as soon as it is shed because of its weak vorticity during the cylinder s upward motion until the highest position 4 periods of vortex shedding happen in the wake leaving a well defined vortex street in fig 13 c and d as the cylinder moves from its highest to its lowest position the long distance transverse motion also creates a vortex street in its wake see fig 13 e and f during the impulsive galloping the free shear layers are generated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices instead of only from one side as in the viv regimes this makes the vortex street very much like the vortex street of a non rotating cylinder except being diagonally aligned when the cylinder moves up or down during galloping the flow velocity relative to the cylinder points towards bottom right or top right directions respectively making the vortex street diagonally aligned relative to the incoming flow the interesting upside down v shaped vortex street in fig 13 e is caused by the reversal of the cylinder at its highest position during f h in fig 13 the response of the cylinder transitions to viv response with viv 1s vortex shedding mode and remains in viv 1s mode until instant l after which the next round of galloping starts galloping is low frequency high amplitude vibration due to instability where a perturbation in the vibration direction is amplified because its induced force is in the direction of perturbation corless and parkinson 1988 to understand the correlation between the lift coefficient and the vibration the vibration displacement vibration velocity v y dy dt and the lift coefficient are plotted together in fig 13 m and the eemd decomposition of the lift coefficient is shown in fig 13 n low frequency galloping is caused by time averaged fluid force that is in phase with the motion velocity of the cylinder robertson et al 2003 it can be seen in fig 13 m that when the displacement of the cylinder increases from instant a to d the lift force relative to its mean value c l c l and the velocity of the cylinder v y are both positive indicating that the fluid force provides energy to the cylinder and causes the continuous increase in the velocity when the vibration velocity is increasing or decreasing during the galloping period the lift coefficient has very high frequency but low amplitude imf1 component which is caused by the high frequency vortex shedding however this high frequency imf1 does not leave any traces in the displacement y because its frequency is very different from the vibration frequency it appears that the wake vortices are stronger and accompanied by more vortex shedding periods when the cylinder moves from its highest position back to its mean position fig 13 e as compared to when the cylinders moves from its mean position to its highest position fig 13 c this cause both imf1 and imf2 lift coefficient when cylinder moves down greater than those when the cylinder moves up in fig 13 n the vortex shedding frequency during the galloping stage is significantly increased compared with that during the viv stage because the desynchronization between the vibration and vortex shedding and the galloping motion of the cylinder causes significant increase in the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid during the viv period from f l in fig 13 the significant reduction of the vortex shedding frequency allows the synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient are roughly out of phase with each other in the viv stage of the ig regime after instant l in fig 13 m the lift coefficient starts increasing continuously and the next round of impulsive galloping starts the combination of viv and galloping also occurs in the case of flow induced vibration of non circular prisms the combined galloping and viv response of a triangular prism report by chen et al 2020 is very similar to the ig regime in this study fig 14 shows the streaklines corresponding to the case for fig 13 i e α v r 4 9 39 when the cylinder moves up and down during the galloping the wake vortex street is very similar to the karman vortex street the vortex street when the cylinder moves down is stronger than that when the cylinder moves up this is consistent with the vorticity contours shown in fig 13 fig 15 shows the time histories of lift coefficient and displacement for α v r 4 9 29 which in the ig regime where the impulsive peaks occurs randomly in all viv regimes figs 8 11 the lift coefficient may have multiple frequency components but its imf component that synchronizes with the vibration is in phase with the vibration displacement however in the viv stage of the ig regime the lift coefficient is out of phase with the vibration displacement the lift coefficient during the viv stage in the ig regime is also generally out of phase with the displacement in fig 15 the impulsive peak does not occur when the lift coefficient and displacement are in phase with each other as can be seen from fig 15 where the impulsive peak does not occur at tf n 23 there is considerable decrease in the lift coefficient at tf n 23 when the lift coefficient and the displacement are in phase with each other causing imf1 and imf2 to decrease the phase change inside the ig regime is random which makes the occurrence of impulsive peaks also random with increase in the reduced velocity the flow transitions from ig to ig regime where the lift coefficient and the displacement always remain out of phase inside the viv stage and occurrence of impulsive peaks also becomes regular and periodic 6 vibration amplitude and frequency fig 16 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder represented by y max and y min respectively the amplitude of the cylinder and frequency of the viv response with the reduced velocity for α 4 9 5 and 5 1 which is the inside the mode ii shedding regime for a stationary cylinder for a non rotating cylinder α 0 the lock in only occurs within a very narrow range of 4 v r 8 and the maximum vibration amplitude in the whole lock in regime is 0 567 it can be seen that compared with the case of α 0 the vibration amplitude is drastically increased if the cylinder rotates magnus effect leads to negative mean lift coefficient which increases quadratically with the increase in rotation rate kang et al 1999 the frequencies of the vibration are found by fast fourier transform fft of the vibration displacement if a vibration is in the vg regime only the frequency component caused by viv is shown in fig 16 the frequencies of impulsive peaks in the ig and ig regimes are not calculated because they are not correlated to the reduced velocity while y min increases with the increase of the reduced velocity nearly quadratically for all the rotation rate y max experiences three jumps at α 4 9 affected by y max the vibration amplitude also experiences three jumps at same reduced velocities the jumps are correlated well with the change in the response regime or viv frequency shown in fig 15 at α 4 9 the first jump between v r 10 and 12 is very weak and can be seen in the close up view of a y in fig 16 c no frequency jump was found during the first amplitude jump the first jump in the response amplitude is correlated to the change of viv response from viv 2s mode with periodic vibration to the viv t s mode where vibration repeats itself after every two periods the second jump in the y max and a y is correlated to the change of change of viv t s mode to viv 2p mode it can be seen in fig 16 d that the viv frequency reduces slightly after the second amplitude jump the third large scale jump in y max and a y occurs when the response changes from viv 2p to ig regime in the ig and ig regimes the variation of the viv frequency with the reduced velocity becomes irregular because the viv response between impulsive galloping peaks becomes less stable than pure viv regimes overall the viv frequency is close to f n at the lower end of ig and ig regimes and increases with the increase in v r fig 17 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder the amplitude of the cylinder and frequency of the viv response with the reduced velocity for rotation rates of α 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 which are higher than the rotation rates for the mode ii shedding regime there are two jumps observed in the amplitude response a y and y max plot as the rotation rate is increased to α 5 5 for α 5 5 the first jump of the response amplitude at v r 11 corresponds to a change from viv 2s to viv 2p and the second jump at v r 30 is caused by the change of the response from viv 2p to ig these jumps are also correlated with the frequency plot of fig 17 c the vibration frequency remains close to one till v r 20 at α 5 5 after which it increases with increase in the reduced velocity and becomes irregular after v r 30 which is the second jump in the amplitude response the response amplitude at α 5 5 is higher than that at α 5 1 for the entire range of reduced velocity fig 18 shows the contours of vibration amplitude on the α v r plane generally both an increase in v r and an increase in α make the vibration amplitude increase except in steady flow regimes s1 and s2 as α is less than 5 5 the transition of the flow from viv to ig ig regimes can easily be identified from the jump in the vibration amplitude near v r 30 however this jump of the vibration amplitude is not clear at α 6 the amplitude of vibration increases continuously with the increase of the rotation rate inside the ig and ig regimes as observed in fig 18 7 conclusions this study investigated flow induced vibration of a rotating cylinder at high rotation rates α the objective of this study is to identify the vibration response at higher rotation rate and understand its flow physics simulations are conducted for α 4 5 4 9 5 5 1 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 and a wide range of reduced velocities between 2 and 40 to understand the physics of fiv of rotating cylinder inside the mode ii shedding regime refined simulation at α between 4 5 and 5 1 with an interval of 0 1 are also performed the main findings are summarized as follows the identified response modes are mapped on the v r α regime in fig 6 the flow patterns in the range of rotation speed between α 4 5 and 8 and reduced velocity between v r 2 and 40 can be divided into two steady flow regimes s1 and s2 five viv regimes viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p and viv 2p and two impulsive galloping regimes ig and ig the viv 1s 2s and 2p stand for one single vortex two single vortex and two pairs of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period respectively t s means the vibration repeats every two periods and a triplet and a single vortex are shed alternatively from the cylinder in two periods respectively viv 2p is a viv 2p regime where the response repeats every two periods and the vortex shedding in two consecutive periods are different from each other although the number of each periods remains 2p the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in different viv regimes are different from each other the common feature of all viv regimes is that vortices are generated from the shear layer only on the bottom side of the cylinder although some mode names are the same as those of viv of a cylinder at low rotation rates the dynamics of shear layer separation and formation of vortices are very different for low rotation rates less than 4 shear layers are separated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices in the 2s t s and 2p regimes bourguet and lo jacono 2014 the ig regime and ig regimes do not exist at low rotation rates impulsive galloping occurs periodically in the ig regime while it occurs randomly in the ig regime overall the frequency of occurrence of impulsive galloping in the ig regime is smaller than that in the ig regime between two consecutive high vibration amplitude ig peaks there are a number of periods of relatively low amplitude viv during the galloping in the ig and ig regimes vortices are formed by the shear layers separated from the two sides of the cylinder instead of only one side as in the viv regimes many periods of vortex shedding occurs and the vortex shedding frequency is increased significantly data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon

20233,flow induced vibration fiv of a rotating circular cylinder with high rotation rates between 4 5 and 8 a low reynolds number re of 100 and a mass ratio of 11 5 is investigated by two dimensional numerical simulations the responses of the high speed rotating cylinder are classified into two steady flow regimes s1 and s2 five vortex induced vibration viv regimes viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p and viv 2p and two impulsive galloping ig regimes ig and ig all the regimes are mapped on a rotation rate versus reduced velocity plane in viv t s regime a triplex and a single vortex are shed alternatively from the cylinder in two consecutive vibration periods viv 2p regime has the same number of vortices shed in each vibration period as viv 2p but the amplitude of vibration in two consecutive periods are different from each other in all the identified viv regimes shear layers are separated from only one side of the cylinder and form vortices instead of both sides which is observed at low rotation rates this makes the flow patterns of all the identified viv regimes different from the ones observed at low rotation rates impulsive galloping ig is the repetitive occurrence of the galloping peak followed by a few periods of viv impulsive galloping occurs periodically in the ig regime and randomly in the ig regime during each ig period the vibration displacement reaches an impulsive peak where the amplitude of vibration is increased significantly followed by periodic oscillations of viv keywords flow induced vibrations rotating cylinder vortex shedding nomenclature α

engineering but also in infrastructures such as buildings and bridges it is well known that as the reynolds number re is increased beyond re 47 flow in the wake of a circular cylinder becomes unsteady and vortices are periodically shed from two sides of the cylinder forming a so called von kármán vortex street the reynolds number is defined as re ud ν where u is the incoming flow velocity d is the diameter and ν is kinematic viscosity the wake flow transitions from two dimensional to three dimensional flows at around re 200 thompson et al 1996 barkley and henderson 1996 karniadakis and triantafyllou 1992 hammache and gharib 1991 williamson 1988 rotation of a circular cylinder in a fluid flow changes the flow characteristics drastically especially at high rotation rates the rotation rate α is defined as the ratio of the rotating speed of the cylinder surface to the free stream velocity both reynolds number and rotation rate have profound effects on flow past a rotating cylinder chang and chern 1991 the rotation of the cylinder breaks the symmetry of the wake and thus influences the corresponding forces on the cylinder it was found that at a low rotation rate of α 2 the vortex street of a rotating circular cylinder was similar to von kármán vortex street and the vortex shedding is referred to as mode i shedding stojković et al 2002 pralits et al 2010 in mode i shedding regime the strouhal number is nearly independent of the rotation rate the vortex shedding was found to be fully suppressed when α is greater than 2 diaz et al 1983 badr et al 1990 chew et al 1995 chou 2000 kang et al 1999 numerically investigated laminar flow past a rotating circular cylinder and found that the critical α above which the vortex shedding was suppressed increased with the increase of reynolds number it is about 1 4 1 8 and 1 9 for re 60 100 and 160 respectively the classification of the flow modes for a rotating cylinder can be found in the review by rao et al 2015 lam 2009 studied flow past a rotating cylinder at re 3600 to 5000 and α 2 5 using flow visualization and particle image velocimetry piv measurements he found that the wake became increasingly narrow and deflected sideways with increasing cylinder rotation speed and the formation length of the vortices decreased with the increase of α leading to a slight increase in the vortex shedding frequency stojković et al 2002 and pralits et al 2010 reported a mode ii shedding regime in the rotation rate range of 4 8 α 5 15 at re 100 which is characterized by the shedding of one counterclockwise vortex from one side of the cylinder in one vortex shedding period the lift coefficient increases drastically with the increase of the rotation rate in the mode ii shedding regime mittal and kumar 2003 and lu et al 2011 found that for re 200 the vortex shedding is suppressed at 1 91 α 4 34 and the mode ii shedding starts at α 4 35 el akoury et al 2008 conducted two dimensional numerical simulations for r e 500 and concluded that the flow transitions to mode ii shedding earlier if reynolds number increases mittal 2004 performed numerical simulations to study three dimensionality of flow past a rotating cylinder at re 200 and a wide range of α from 0 to 5 it was found that the centrifugal instabilities exist along the entire span at a rotation rate α of 5 rao et al 2013a b used linear stability analysis to study two to three dimensional transition of wake flow past a rotating cylinder at reynolds numbers less than 400 and rotation rates of α 7 they observed that the three dimensionality in the wake of a rotating cylinder is similar to a non rotating cylinder at α 1 five unsteady three dimensional modes were found in the mode i shedding regime and four three dimensional modes were observed in the steady regimes of flow for α 2 later navrose et al 2015 performed a detailed linear stability analysis at 200 r e 350 to study the steady and unsteady modes associated with mode i shedding and mode ii shedding for a rotational rate range of α 5 in a recent study by munir et al 2019 a detailed three dimensional numerical study was conducted to investigate the two to three dimensional transition of flow both as a function of reynolds number and rotation rate it was found that the transition of flow to three dimensional occur for lower reynolds number and the lift coefficient inside the mode ii shedding rotation rate range for lower reynolds number of re 100 was similar to previous two dimensional numerical results since vibration of cylindrical structures in fluid flows occurs mainly due to the dynamic vortex shedding flow the flow induced vibration of these structures is generally called vortex induced vibration viv the viv of a non rotating circular cylinder has been extensively studied in the past few decades with the aim to understand the physics of viv at low and high mass ratios bearman 1984 feng 1968 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 recently a number of studies are directed towards understanding the influence of the rotation of the cylinder on the viv bourguet and lo jacono 2014 studied one degree of freedom 1dof flow induced vibration of a rotating cylinder in the cross flow direction at a very low reynolds number of 100 zhao et al 2014b performed two dimensional numerical simulations of vortex induced vibration of a rotating cylinder at a low reynolds number of 150 and a low mass ratio of 2 at α 1 the lock in regime was found to widen and the maximum amplitude increased with the increase of rotation rate furthermore the inline vibrations became prominent at higher rotation rates if the cylinder is allowed to vibrate both in the inline and cross flow directions zou et al 2019 bourguet and lo jacono 2015 performed two dimensional numerical simulation of flow past a rotating cylinder allowed to oscillate in inline direction and classified the vibration response as a function of rotation rate a number of studies are dedicated to force reduction using rotational oscillation of a cylinder placed in a fluid flow sengupta and patidar 2018 lee and lee 2007 seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2015 carried out experimental study of viv of a rotating circular cylinder in transverse direction of flow in a recirculating water tunnel for rotation rates ranging from 0 to 2 6 and reynolds numbers ranging from 350 to 1000 it was found that the lock in regime became narrow as the rotation rate was greater than 1 4 and the oscillation of the cylinder ceased at rotation rates greater than 2 4 munir et al 2018 conducted three dimensional numerical simulations at α 3 5 to investigate the effect of higher rotation rate inside the lock in regime it was found that the vibration is suppressed when the rotation rate is increased beyond a critical value which is dependent on reduced velocity recently bourguet 2019 simulated flow induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder in arbitrary directions at re 100 and α 3 5 galloping type response was found at α 3 and higher reduced velocities if the angle between the incoming flow and direction of vibrating cylinder was greater than 90 bourguet 2020 further performed numerical simulations at re 100 to understand the flow physics of two degree of freedom flow induced vibrations of a high speed rotating cylinder the rotation rate was changed from 0 to 5 5 and reduced velocity from 1 to 25 additional three dimensional simulations showed that the flow transition had less influence on the system behavior in terms of the vibration response the frequency and vibration response obtained from two and three dimensional simulations were very close to each other in the high amplitude response region despite these experimental and numerical studies on fiv of rotating cylinders there are no systematic studies available to understand the dynamics of fiv in cross flow direction of high speed rotating cylinder in mode ii shedding regime and beyond to the best of our knowledge the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to study in detail the amplitude response at rotation rates inside and higher than mode ii shedding regime by performing detailed two dimensional simulations 2 to understand the flow physics of different flow regimes identified on a map of the rotation rate versus reduced velocity plane by analyzing the corresponding flow structures and correlating them with force coefficients and vibration displacement the circular cylinder is allowed to vibrate in the cross flow direction only and simulations are carried out at α 4 5 to 8 re 100 and reduced velocities of v r 2 to 40 v r is defined as v r u f n d in this study where f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder the damping ratio the reynolds number and the mass ratio are kept constant at 0 100 and 11 5 respectively the mass ratio of 11 5 was used in a previous numerical study by munir et al 2018 to investigate flow past a low speed rotating cylinder the rest of the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 the governing equations and the numerical model used in this study is presented in section 3 a mesh dependency study is presented and the numerical model is validated by comparing the numerical results with published data in sections 4 5 and 6 the response mode the wake flow patterns and the vibration amplitudes are discussed respectively finally conclusions are drawn in section 7 it is envisaged that this study will further improve the understanding of the dynamics of rotating cylinders and lead to an improvement of the designs of subsea drillers and vibrations suppression devices through rotation 2 numerical method fig 1 a show the computational domain used for simulating fiv of a rotating cylinder which is 100d long and 110d wide the center of the cylinder is placed at 50d from the left boundary and the two side boundaries the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction of the flow the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem developed by zhao et al 2007 to simulate the flow the finite element mesh is updated after every computational time step to accommodate the evolution of cylinder position the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method which has been found to be an accurate method for simulating the viv of cylinders in fluid flow is used in this study the velocity u v the time t the length x y and the pressure p are non dimensionalized as u v u v u t u t d x y x y d p p ρ u 2 respectively where the tilde denotes the dimensional parameters and ρ is the fluid density the non dimensional ale formulations of the ns equations for incompressible flow are expressed as 1 u i t u j u j m u i x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where x 1 x and x 2 y are the cartesian coordinates in the in line and transverse directions of the flow respectively u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction t is the time and u im is the velocity of the moving mesh the non dimensional equation of the motion of the cylinder is 3 y 4 π ζ v r y 4 π 2 v r 2 y 2 c l π m where y y and y are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction respectively m m m d is the mass ratio with m being the mass of the cylinder and m d being the displaced fluid mass ζ is the damping ratio and c l is the lift coefficient which is defined as c l f l ρ d u 2 2 with f l being the lift force on the cylinder in the cross flow direction the detailed pg fem method for solving the ns equations can be found in zhao et al 2007 and will not be discussed here the equation of motion is solved using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm after each computational time step in the numerical simulation the position of the cylinder changes and the whole computation domain has to be moved accordingly in the ale scheme the mesh nodes can be moved in an arbitrary way to ensure that the finite elements are as little distorted as possible if the boundary of the computational domain does not move and only the cylinder moves the displacement of the mesh nodes can be calculated by using the following equation 4 γ s i 0 where s i represents the displacement of the nodal points in the y direction and γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation in order to avoid excessive deformation of the near wall elements the parameter γ in a finite element can be chosen to be inversely proportional to the area of the element zhao and cheng 2011 by specifying the displacements at all the boundaries eq 4 can be solved by the galerkin fem when fiv of a rotating cylinder is simulated at large rotation rates and large reduced velocities the mean deflection of the cylinder was found to be significantly greater than the cylinder diameter of all the studied cases the maximum mean deflection of the cylinder in the negative y direction for the maximum rotation rate and maximum reduced velocity is over 60 diameters using eq 4 without moving the boundary of computational domain proved inadequate to cater for such large displacements because of overlapping mesh to overcome this problem the whole computational domain was made to move together with the cylinder resulting in a mesh velocity the same as the vibration velocity of the cylinder in the whole computational domain i e u x m 0 and u y m y fig 1 b shows the computational mesh near the cylinder surface used in this study herein referred to as the normal mesh the computational domain is divided into 34400 quadrilateral linear finite element the circumference of the cylinder is discretized in to 120 elements and the mesh size in the radial direction is 0 00038d on the cylinder surface initially the velocity and the pressure in the whole computational domain are set to zero the boundary conditions for the ns equations are as follows non slip boundary condition is used on the surface of the cylinder i e the velocity at the inlet boundary is given and the fluid velocity at the cylinder surface equals to the sum of the vibration velocity and the rotation velocity of the cylinder surface at the outlet boundary the pressure and the gradient of velocity in the inline direction are set to zero at the two lateral boundaries the gradient of the pressure and streamwise velocity in the cross flow direction are set to zero and the cross flow velocity is zero 3 mesh dependency study and validation of the numerical model to ensure that the approach of moving the whole computational domain with a constant velocity u y m y does produce the same results as eq 4 at low reduced velocity simulation for α 4 9 and v r 5 is conducted using the two mesh moving methods fig 2 a shows the comparison between the results from the two mesh moving methods it can be seen that the two time histories of the y displacement are almost identical with each other the amplitude and frequency calculated from u y m y differ from their counterparts calculated using eq 4 by about 0 2 and 0 1 respectively a domain size dependency study is conducted to prove the computational domain is large enough to obtain accurate solution of fiv of a cylinder at high rotation rates a simulation was conducted using a larger 110d long and 250d wide computational domain for α v r 8 40 the largest rotational rate and the largest reduced velocity having the largest vibration amplitude in this study fig 2 b presents the time histories of vibration displacement obtained using the larger and normal computational domains the galloping like response will be discussed in detail in section 4 it can be seen from fig 2 b that the frequency of the vibration obtained using larger domain is almost the same as that obtained from the normal computational domain whereas the difference in amplitude between the two results is less than 2 a mesh dependency study is performed to ensure that the mesh density is high enough to get converged results simulations using two additional meshes of different mesh densities are performed at α 5 1 and v r 6 and 40 and the results are listed in table 1 where δr n c and n node stand for the radial element size on the cylinder surface the number of elements along the circumference of the cylinder and the total number of nodes of the elements respectively the results of the amplitude mean displacement and frequencies from different meshes are compared quantitatively with each other in table 1 the response amplitude in the y direction is defined as a y y max y min 2 where the maximum displacement y max and the minimum displacement y min are obtained from the time histories of cylinder displacement in the last 10 vibration periods the frequency of the cylinder in the y direction f y is normalized by the natural frequency of the cylinder f n the difference between the amplitudes calculated from the dense and normal meshes is about 2 and the difference between the mean displacement from the dense and normal meshes is less than 2 6 at α 5 1 and v r 6 the frequencies obtained from the dense and normal mesh at α 5 1 and v r 6 are very close to each other with a difference of 0 4 the frequencies for v r 40 are not available in table 1 because the vibration is aperiodic galloping like vibration as shown in fig 3 b which will be discussed in detail in the next section the amplitudes and mean displacement in y direction of the galloping like vibration in table 1 from different meshes are very close to each other the numerical model used in this study has been previously used to simulate viv of rotating cylinders for re 150 and small rotation rates of α 0 5 and 1 in zhao et al 2014b where a detailed validation study has been performed to validate the numerical model for large rotation rates simulations are performed for a non vibrating cylinder rotating at high speeds at re 200 and a range of rotation rate the corresponding time histories of lift coefficient are compared with the numerical results by lu et al 2011 and mittal 2004 in fig 4 the mean lift coefficients are negative due to the magnus effect caused by the rotation of the cylinder the flow transitions from vortex shedding flow to no vortex shedding flow as the rotation rate is increased beyond a critical value the lift coefficients for α 4 2 which marks the end of no vortex shedding regime agree very well with other two sets of two dimensional numerical results α 4 4 and 4 7 are in the very narrow mode ii shedding regime where the lift coefficient oscillates periodically at very low frequencies the mean value the amplitude and the period of the lift coefficient are almost the same as those in previous studies for α 4 4 and 4 7 however the phases of the lift coefficients in the three studies are not the same this is because the onset of the mode ii shedding occurs randomly in the numerical simulations as the rotation rate is increased beyond 4 7 the vortex shedding is suppressed again and the present results are in very good agreement with the previous results in this range of rotation rate in addition to the above validation additional simulation is carried out at α 5 and re 100 and the calculated frequency mean drag coefficient and lift coefficient are compared with the results in the previous studies by śtojković et al 2002 and bourguet 2020 in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that frequencies and mean lift coefficients in the three studies are in good agreement the mean drag coefficient in the present study is very close to the value in the most recent study by bourguet 2020 in order to validate the present numerical model at very high rotation rate an additional numerical simulation using nektar canwell et al 2015 are performed to simulate the galloping like vibration at α v r 4 9 39 the ns equations were solved through the velocity correction scheme along with a continuous galerkin projection from the unsteady incompressible ns solver a second order implicit explicit time integration scheme was chosen the code employs high order quadrilateral expansions within each element through the gauss lobatto legendre quadrature points np a total number of 877 macro quadrilateral elements were used in nektar simulation while in each element n p 8 8 th order element this results in 42973 elements more than the normal mesh in table 1 fig 5 compares the time histories of the cylinder displacement at α v r 4 9 39 obtained by nektar and the present model the results agree very well thus further validate the accuracy of the present numerical model the occurrence frequency the mean position and the amplitude of impulsive peaks of the vibration differ from their counter parts calculated by nektar by less than 1 the small amplitude vibrations between every two consecutive impulsive peaks from the two methods also agree well with each other 4 vibration response modes the aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of high rotation rate on fiv of a rotating circular cylinder the reynolds number is set to 100 and mass ratio to 11 5 for flow past a stationary cylinder at re 100 the mode ii vortex shedding regime is in the range of 4 8 α 5 15 and the flow is steady as α is greater than 5 15 stojković et al 2002 to capture the variation of the flow near mode ii vortex shedding regime simulations are performed for rotation rates in the range between 4 5 and 5 1 with an increment of 0 1 in additioin α 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 are also simulated where distinct vibration modes are found as v r exceeds a critical value for each rotation rate reduced velocities from 2 to 40 with increment of 1 are covered response modes are found to be very different from those at low rotation rates and they are mapped on the v r α plane in fig 6 fig 7 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for different response regimes viv regime in fig 6 is the regime where vortex shedding and the vibrating frequencies synchronize however the number of vortices that are shed within one periof of vibration is dependent on the reduced velocitiy in this study the viv regimes are further subdivided into a number of sub regimes and the viv regime name is represented by a prefix viv followed by the vortex shedding pattern while the detailed flow patterns will be discussed in sectioin 5 the response modes identified from the map of fig 6 are summarized below o s1 and s2 the flow is steady and the cylinder remains stationary s1 and s2 are the steady flow modes s1 is found at α lower than the rotation rates of mode ii vortex shedding while s2 appears at α higher than that of mode ii o viv 1s the response amplitude is extremely small and the frequency is much lower than the natural frequency fig 7 a only a single vortex viv 1s is shed from the cylinder in one vibration period and flow is similar to mode ii shedding o viv 2s the vortex shedding frequency and the vibration frequency synchronize fig 7 b two single vortices 2s are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration viv 2s regime is observed in the small reduced velocity region o viv t s the vibration and the vortex shedding flow repeat after every two vibration periods as shown in fig 7 c a triplex t of vortices and a single s vortex are alternatively shed from the cylinder in the first and second periods respectively o viv 2p the vibration is periodic and two pair 2p of vortices are shed from the cylinder in each vibration period as shown in fig 7 d the vibration frequency is close to the natural frequency o viv 2p the vortices that are shed from the cylinder in each vibration period is 2p however the vibration and the flow repeat every two periods as shown in fig 7 e o ig this mode is the combination of viv and galloping high peaks due to impulsive galloping occur periodically as shown in fig 7 g and h between two high impulsive galloping peaks there are several periods of viv the high peak amplitude due to impulsive galloping does not perfectly remain constant in fig 7 g and h it varies slightly less than 2 5 from period to period o ig this mode is an ig mode where the impulsive galloping peaks occurs very randomly as shown in fig 7 f 5 wake flow patterns the wake flow patterns of all the response regimes are different from those at low rotation rates except s1 and s2 in addition to the newly found regimes of viv 1s ig and ig the vortex flow pattern in the viv 2s viv t s and viv 2p modes are also different from the 2s t s and 2p modes for viv of a rotating cylinder at low rotation rates α 4 reported in previous studies bourguet and lo jacono 2014 5 1 viv 1s regime at a rotation rate of 4 9 different modes of vibration of the cylinder occur in the whole range of reduced velocity between 2 and 40 the rotation rate of α 4 9 is used to illustrate the response regimes because the response goes through viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p ig and ig regimes with the increase of v r viv 1s regime is excited by very low frequency mode ii vortex shedding in the range of 4 9 v r 5 1 and very small reduced velocities less than 3 fig 8 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficient for viv 1s regime at α v r 4 9 2 the streaklines are generated by releasing particles on two sides of the cylinder between r 0 5 and 1 where r is the distance from the cylinder centre the vibration amplitude is very small 0 00665 because the frequency of the lift coefficient caused by the mode ii shedding is much lower than the natural frequency the lift coefficient and displacement are in phase with each other as shown in fig 8 f the vortex shedding pattern in viv 1s mode is a typical vortex shedding in the mode ii regime for flow past a non vibrating cylinder mittal and kumar 2003 both positive and negative free shear layers are separated from the bottom side of the cylinder and only one positive vortex is shed from the cylinder when the cylinder moves upwards in one period of vibration fig 8 c the size of the positive vortex grows before it is shed from the cylinder at tf n 288 5 when the cylinder moves downwards from c e in fig 8 a new positive vortex gradually forms the very weak separated negative shear layer from the bottom side of the cylinder extends to a long distance downstream the cylinder but does not form vortices the separated negative shear layer dissipates quickly because of the strong cancellation effects from its strong neighboring positive shear layer since only one vortex is shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the vibration mode is defined as viv 1s mode it can be seen in fig 8 f that only one vortex being shed from the cylinder in one vibration cycle makes the vibration displacement and lift coefficient asymmetric the strong vortex in each vibration period can be clearly seen in the streaklines presented in fig 8 g 5 2 viv 2s regime fig 9 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficeint for viv 2s regime at α v r 4 9 8 the lift coefficient and the displacement are in phase but are not of typical sinusoidal shape because the wake is asymmetric similar to that in the viv 1s regime a positive and a negative shear layers are separated from the bottom side of the cylinder however the negative shear layer has become sufficiently strong to form vortices as a result one pair of vortices labeled as a and b in fig 9 are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration forming a diagonally aligned vortex street in the wake a positive and a negative vortex are shed from the cylinder when the cylinder moves downwards and upwards respectively this periodic shedding of vortices from the bottom side of the cylinder results in periodic vibration with a constant amplitude based on the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder the wake is in viv 2s mode where 2s means that two single vortices are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the vibration frequency in fig 9 f is significantly increased compared with that in the viv 1s regime and is close to the natural frequency indicating the lock in between vibration and vortex shedding the arrangement of the two rows of wake vortices of the mode viv 2s in fig 9 is very different from the 2s mode viv of a non rotating cylinder or a rotating cylinder at low rotation rate where the top row vortices are negative and the bottom row of vortices are positive zhao et al 2014 bourguet and lo jacono 2014 however in the viv 2s wake in fig 9 the signs of the two rows of vortices are swapped compared with that of a wake of a non rotating cylinder in the streaklines of fig 9 g the high speed rotation of the cylinder forces all the particles released from the top side of the cylinder to move to the bottom side along the cylinder surface an s shaped wavy streakline pattern is formed in the wake of the cylinder every turning point of the streaklines corresponds to either a positive or a negative vortex in the vorticity contours a wavy streakline pattern with many bends results in a vortex street with positive and negative vortices shown in fig 9 g bourguet and lo jacono 2014 also observed 2s modes of vibrations in their study on flow past a rotating cylinder for low rotation rates α 2 5 however vortices were shed from both the top and bottom sides of the cylinder in their 2s modes instead of being shed from a single side as shown in fig 9 5 3 viv t s regime fig 10 shows the vorticity contours streaklines and the time histories of the lift coefficient and displacement for viv t s regime observed at α v r 4 9 12 fig 10 k shows that both lift coefficient and vibration displacement repeat after every two vibration periods this is because the vortex shedding process repeats every two vibration periods in the period from a e in fig 10 three vortices a b and c are shed from the cylinder of these three vortices a and b are shed when the cylinder moves upward and c is shed when the cylinder moves downwards in the next period from e to i only one vortex d is shed from the cylinder after two consecutive periods of vibration as shown in fig 10 j the three new vortices a b and c are shed exactly the same way as vortices a b and c were shed the vortex shedding pattern in fig 10 is defined as viv t s mode where t s means that the flow repeat after two vibration periods and a triplet and a single vortex is shed in the first and second period respectively in the current viv t s mode all free shear layers are generated from one side of the cylinder before they form vortices while in the t s mode at low rotation rates found by bourguet and lo jacono 2014 free shear layers are separated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices the lift coefficient shown in fig 10 k is clearly the superimposition of high frequency components on a low frequency component in each period because of the change of vortex shedding after each period to understand the correlation between lift coefficient and displacement ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd is used to decompose the lift coefficient into intrinsic mode functions imf and the n th mode is represented as imfn the imfn is the nth mono component function or oscillatory mode with one frequency component eemd is used because it does not have the problem of mode mixing compared to empirical model deposition emd method wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a gaci 2016 the original signal x t can be constructed from imfs using the following relationship 5 x t n 1 n 1 imf n t r n t where n 1 is the number of imfs and r n t is the residue the first three imf components imf1 to imf3 of the lift coefficient are plotted in fig 10 l imf1 of the lift coefficient oscillates irregularly and has a frequency much higher than the vibration frequency fig 10 n shows fft of lift coefficient and vibration displacement where higher harmonics of lift coefficient represents the frequency of imf1 the very irregular but weak oscillations of imf1 are mainly because of the significant difference between the vortex shedding in two adjacent periods as discussed above imf1 does not have any effect on the vibration since its frequency does not synchronize with the vibration frequency and its amplitude is small in the displacement no frequency higher than the vibration frequency is seen as observed from fig 10 n the frequency of imf2 lift coefficient and the frequency of the displacement y synchronize and they are in phase with each other the imf3 of the lift coefficient has a period twice the vibration period which is also observed from fig 10 n as a dominant sub harmonic of lift coefficient and it is strong because of the strong difference between the vortex shedding of two consecutive periods of vibration although imf3 does not lock in with the natural frequency of the cylinder the high amplitude of imf3 lift coefficient causes the slight difference between vibration amplitudes in two consecutive periods all the vortices identified in fig 10 a j can also been seen in the streaklines in fig 10 m where a set of vortices a to d are from the previous dual period vibration cycle and a new vortex a has formed in the new cycle the vortices in the streaklines of fig 10 m are much stronger than those in fig 9 g and the vibration amplitude is higher 5 4 viv 2p regime fig 11 shows vorticity contours streaklines and time histories of the displacement and lift coefficient for viv 2p regime at α v r 4 9 22 where both vibration displacement and lift coefficent are periodic see fig 11 g the frequency of the lift coefficient is twice the vibration frequency because the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period is two pairs vortices a to d labeled in fig 11 as a result the vortex shedding is in the viv 2p mode meaning that two pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period the lift coefficient in the first half period is different from that in the second half period mainly because within one vibration period the first pair of vortices a and b are different from the second pair c and d after one period see fig 11 e two more pairs of vortices a b c and d are shed from the cylinder in fig 11 f the 2p mode in fig 11 is not the same as the 2p mode for viv of a non rotating cylinder in the present 2p mode two vortices in opposite directions are shed in every half period in the classical 2p mode vortex shedding observed in the lower branch of viv of a non rotating cylinder the sequence of the vortex shedding is such that two positive vortices are shed in the first half period and 2 negative vortices in the second half period govardhan and williamson 2000 in the 2p mode the dominant frequency of the lift coefficient is twice the vibration frequency because of which the response resembles the galloping like response although the period of the lift coefficient is half the vibration period the difference between the lift coefficient in the first and second half vibration periods which is caused by the difference in the vortex shedding creates imp3 lift coefficient that synchronizes with the vibration frequency the vibration amplitude is increased significantly in viv 2p regime because both the vibration frequency and the frequency of imp3 lift coefficient are closer to the natural frequency it is also seen that imp3 of the lift coefficient is in phase with the vibration displacement y by comparing the vorticity contours in figs 8 12 it can be seen that wake vortices are strong in the non lock in regime because the very long vortex shedding period provides sufficient time to allow the single vortex to be fully developed in each period the strength of wake vortices becomes weak in viv 2s regime and increases again as the response mode changes from viv t s and viv 2p fig 12 shows the flow structure of a viv 2p regime at α v r 5 5 21 the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period in viv 2p regime is the same as that in viv 2 regime however the vortex shedding pattern and the vibration in viv 2p regime varies from period to period fig 7 e is an example of viv 2p mode where the vibration repeat every two vibration period two pairs of vortices a to d are shed from the cylinder within the period between a to e and another two pairs of vortices e to h are shed from the cylinder within the period between e to i the wake vortex arrangement at the two instants e and i with the same phase are similar but not exactly the same the response of the cylinder in fig 12 is essentially galloping like response because the vortex shedding frequency is much higher than the vibration frequency of the cylinder as observed at viv 2p during fig 12 a i which is two vibration periods four pair of vortices a h are shed from the cylinder resulting in 2p mode similar to viv 2p regime it is further observed from fig 12 j that the lift coefficient fluctuates very irregularly indicating the instability of the vortex shedding 5 5 impulsive galloping ig regime fig 13 f shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for the impulsive galloping ig regime at α v r 4 9 39 the main characteristic of ig response is the occurrence of impulsive high amplitude peaks that occurs periodically between these peaks a number of small amplitude relative to the impulsive peaks vortex induced vibration occurs the flow mode is defined as galloping because the high amplitude peaks have much higher amplitude than that of viv the galloping amplitude increases with the increase of reduced velocity from the start to the end time of each impulsive peak 10 periods of vortex shedding occur fig 13 d and e the flow mode is defined as ig regime if the impulsive peaks occurs periodically and ig mode if the impulsive peaks occurs randomly see fig 7 f from the map of fig 6 it is observed that ig mode mainly occurs at lower range of reduced velocity than ig mode fig 13 show the evolution of the wake through the galloping stage and viv stage in the ig regime at the instant when the cylinder starts moving upwards and enters the galloping stage in fig 13 a the diagonally aligned vortex street is similar to the viv 1s response vortex in fig 8 where a positive vortex is shed from the cylinder followed by a growth in the negative shear layer the negative shear layer elongates in the wake of the cylinder and dissipates as soon as it is shed because of its weak vorticity during the cylinder s upward motion until the highest position 4 periods of vortex shedding happen in the wake leaving a well defined vortex street in fig 13 c and d as the cylinder moves from its highest to its lowest position the long distance transverse motion also creates a vortex street in its wake see fig 13 e and f during the impulsive galloping the free shear layers are generated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices instead of only from one side as in the viv regimes this makes the vortex street very much like the vortex street of a non rotating cylinder except being diagonally aligned when the cylinder moves up or down during galloping the flow velocity relative to the cylinder points towards bottom right or top right directions respectively making the vortex street diagonally aligned relative to the incoming flow the interesting upside down v shaped vortex street in fig 13 e is caused by the reversal of the cylinder at its highest position during f h in fig 13 the response of the cylinder transitions to viv response with viv 1s vortex shedding mode and remains in viv 1s mode until instant l after which the next round of galloping starts galloping is low frequency high amplitude vibration due to instability where a perturbation in the vibration direction is amplified because its induced force is in the direction of perturbation corless and parkinson 1988 to understand the correlation between the lift coefficient and the vibration the vibration displacement vibration velocity v y dy dt and the lift coefficient are plotted together in fig 13 m and the eemd decomposition of the lift coefficient is shown in fig 13 n low frequency galloping is caused by time averaged fluid force that is in phase with the motion velocity of the cylinder robertson et al 2003 it can be seen in fig 13 m that when the displacement of the cylinder increases from instant a to d the lift force relative to its mean value c l c l and the velocity of the cylinder v y are both positive indicating that the fluid force provides energy to the cylinder and causes the continuous increase in the velocity when the vibration velocity is increasing or decreasing during the galloping period the lift coefficient has very high frequency but low amplitude imf1 component which is caused by the high frequency vortex shedding however this high frequency imf1 does not leave any traces in the displacement y because its frequency is very different from the vibration frequency it appears that the wake vortices are stronger and accompanied by more vortex shedding periods when the cylinder moves from its highest position back to its mean position fig 13 e as compared to when the cylinders moves from its mean position to its highest position fig 13 c this cause both imf1 and imf2 lift coefficient when cylinder moves down greater than those when the cylinder moves up in fig 13 n the vortex shedding frequency during the galloping stage is significantly increased compared with that during the viv stage because the desynchronization between the vibration and vortex shedding and the galloping motion of the cylinder causes significant increase in the relative velocity of the cylinder to the fluid during the viv period from f l in fig 13 the significant reduction of the vortex shedding frequency allows the synchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient are roughly out of phase with each other in the viv stage of the ig regime after instant l in fig 13 m the lift coefficient starts increasing continuously and the next round of impulsive galloping starts the combination of viv and galloping also occurs in the case of flow induced vibration of non circular prisms the combined galloping and viv response of a triangular prism report by chen et al 2020 is very similar to the ig regime in this study fig 14 shows the streaklines corresponding to the case for fig 13 i e α v r 4 9 39 when the cylinder moves up and down during the galloping the wake vortex street is very similar to the karman vortex street the vortex street when the cylinder moves down is stronger than that when the cylinder moves up this is consistent with the vorticity contours shown in fig 13 fig 15 shows the time histories of lift coefficient and displacement for α v r 4 9 29 which in the ig regime where the impulsive peaks occurs randomly in all viv regimes figs 8 11 the lift coefficient may have multiple frequency components but its imf component that synchronizes with the vibration is in phase with the vibration displacement however in the viv stage of the ig regime the lift coefficient is out of phase with the vibration displacement the lift coefficient during the viv stage in the ig regime is also generally out of phase with the displacement in fig 15 the impulsive peak does not occur when the lift coefficient and displacement are in phase with each other as can be seen from fig 15 where the impulsive peak does not occur at tf n 23 there is considerable decrease in the lift coefficient at tf n 23 when the lift coefficient and the displacement are in phase with each other causing imf1 and imf2 to decrease the phase change inside the ig regime is random which makes the occurrence of impulsive peaks also random with increase in the reduced velocity the flow transitions from ig to ig regime where the lift coefficient and the displacement always remain out of phase inside the viv stage and occurrence of impulsive peaks also becomes regular and periodic 6 vibration amplitude and frequency fig 16 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder represented by y max and y min respectively the amplitude of the cylinder and frequency of the viv response with the reduced velocity for α 4 9 5 and 5 1 which is the inside the mode ii shedding regime for a stationary cylinder for a non rotating cylinder α 0 the lock in only occurs within a very narrow range of 4 v r 8 and the maximum vibration amplitude in the whole lock in regime is 0 567 it can be seen that compared with the case of α 0 the vibration amplitude is drastically increased if the cylinder rotates magnus effect leads to negative mean lift coefficient which increases quadratically with the increase in rotation rate kang et al 1999 the frequencies of the vibration are found by fast fourier transform fft of the vibration displacement if a vibration is in the vg regime only the frequency component caused by viv is shown in fig 16 the frequencies of impulsive peaks in the ig and ig regimes are not calculated because they are not correlated to the reduced velocity while y min increases with the increase of the reduced velocity nearly quadratically for all the rotation rate y max experiences three jumps at α 4 9 affected by y max the vibration amplitude also experiences three jumps at same reduced velocities the jumps are correlated well with the change in the response regime or viv frequency shown in fig 15 at α 4 9 the first jump between v r 10 and 12 is very weak and can be seen in the close up view of a y in fig 16 c no frequency jump was found during the first amplitude jump the first jump in the response amplitude is correlated to the change of viv response from viv 2s mode with periodic vibration to the viv t s mode where vibration repeats itself after every two periods the second jump in the y max and a y is correlated to the change of change of viv t s mode to viv 2p mode it can be seen in fig 16 d that the viv frequency reduces slightly after the second amplitude jump the third large scale jump in y max and a y occurs when the response changes from viv 2p to ig regime in the ig and ig regimes the variation of the viv frequency with the reduced velocity becomes irregular because the viv response between impulsive galloping peaks becomes less stable than pure viv regimes overall the viv frequency is close to f n at the lower end of ig and ig regimes and increases with the increase in v r fig 17 shows the variations of the maximum and minimum displacements of the cylinder the amplitude of the cylinder and frequency of the viv response with the reduced velocity for rotation rates of α 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 which are higher than the rotation rates for the mode ii shedding regime there are two jumps observed in the amplitude response a y and y max plot as the rotation rate is increased to α 5 5 for α 5 5 the first jump of the response amplitude at v r 11 corresponds to a change from viv 2s to viv 2p and the second jump at v r 30 is caused by the change of the response from viv 2p to ig these jumps are also correlated with the frequency plot of fig 17 c the vibration frequency remains close to one till v r 20 at α 5 5 after which it increases with increase in the reduced velocity and becomes irregular after v r 30 which is the second jump in the amplitude response the response amplitude at α 5 5 is higher than that at α 5 1 for the entire range of reduced velocity fig 18 shows the contours of vibration amplitude on the α v r plane generally both an increase in v r and an increase in α make the vibration amplitude increase except in steady flow regimes s1 and s2 as α is less than 5 5 the transition of the flow from viv to ig ig regimes can easily be identified from the jump in the vibration amplitude near v r 30 however this jump of the vibration amplitude is not clear at α 6 the amplitude of vibration increases continuously with the increase of the rotation rate inside the ig and ig regimes as observed in fig 18 7 conclusions this study investigated flow induced vibration of a rotating cylinder at high rotation rates α the objective of this study is to identify the vibration response at higher rotation rate and understand its flow physics simulations are conducted for α 4 5 4 9 5 5 1 5 5 6 6 5 7 and 8 and a wide range of reduced velocities between 2 and 40 to understand the physics of fiv of rotating cylinder inside the mode ii shedding regime refined simulation at α between 4 5 and 5 1 with an interval of 0 1 are also performed the main findings are summarized as follows the identified response modes are mapped on the v r α regime in fig 6 the flow patterns in the range of rotation speed between α 4 5 and 8 and reduced velocity between v r 2 and 40 can be divided into two steady flow regimes s1 and s2 five viv regimes viv 1s viv 2s viv t s viv 2p and viv 2p and two impulsive galloping regimes ig and ig the viv 1s 2s and 2p stand for one single vortex two single vortex and two pairs of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in one vibration period respectively t s means the vibration repeats every two periods and a triplet and a single vortex are shed alternatively from the cylinder in two periods respectively viv 2p is a viv 2p regime where the response repeats every two periods and the vortex shedding in two consecutive periods are different from each other although the number of each periods remains 2p the number of vortices that are shed from the cylinder in different viv regimes are different from each other the common feature of all viv regimes is that vortices are generated from the shear layer only on the bottom side of the cylinder although some mode names are the same as those of viv of a cylinder at low rotation rates the dynamics of shear layer separation and formation of vortices are very different for low rotation rates less than 4 shear layers are separated from two sides of the cylinder and form vortices in the 2s t s and 2p regimes bourguet and lo jacono 2014 the ig regime and ig regimes do not exist at low rotation rates impulsive galloping occurs periodically in the ig regime while it occurs randomly in the ig regime overall the frequency of occurrence of impulsive galloping in the ig regime is smaller than that in the ig regime between two consecutive high vibration amplitude ig peaks there are a number of periods of relatively low amplitude viv during the galloping in the ig and ig regimes vortices are formed by the shear layers separated from the two sides of the cylinder instead of only one side as in the viv regimes many periods of vortex shedding occurs and the vortex shedding frequency is increased significantly data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon

introduction the ship speed power performance is usually one of the most important factors for a ship operator at the moment only model test based predictions are widely accepted for large and expensive projects in the marine industry computational fluid dynamics cfd has been successfully applied to model scale simulations for many years the availability of validation data both open and proprietary makes it relatively easy to develop the best practice and use the method for ship design it is more difficult to predict the propulsion power at full scale in some cases it is necessary to simulate at the correct reynolds number due to the flow characteristics while in other cases the designers wish to achieve better designs without extrapolating from a model scale accessible full scale measurements of good quality are still scarce most data comes from sea trials which are often carried out only at ballast draught or from monitoring systems on ships in operation in principle both can be used for validation purposes the problems are that the data is most of the time strictly confidential and or difficult to process due to the uncertainties linked to the measurement accuracy and condition details in recent years an increased interest is observed in full scale simulations this is due to advancements in numerical methods more powerful computers as well as trust that the cfd has gained through for example the series of workshops on cfd in ship hydrodynamics initiated in 1980 hino et al 2020 however even as recently as in 2008 raven et al 2008 concluded that a prediction of the full scale power entirely based on cfd is still not reliable enough when high accuracy is required the importance of cfd simulations at full scale was highlighted later in hochkirch and mallol 2013 and a practical example illustrated by kim et al 2014 in both papers the advantage of full scale simulations and optimizations of hulls and appendages are shown lloyd s register s full scale numerical modelling workshop has recently contributed with an open test case for validations the workshop results were summarized by ponkratov 2017 further analysis of the published results shows that the mean comparison error of the predicted power is 13 for all submitted results and 3 out of 27 participants had errors below 3 for all considered speeds a thorough study of the numerical accuracy both at model and full scale can be found in eça et al 2010 and pereira et al 2017 for a large number of turbulence models without wall functions however the papers contain no full scale validation in this work carefully selected data from an established operator for a large number of sister ships is collected and used for validation the rans method used for simulations incorporates the wall roughness modelling without the need for wall functions therefore the numerical challenge is greater than the works presented earlier however there is also a potential for more accurate predictions an uncertainty study is presented which is often lacking in other publications the paper first gives a brief introduction to the numerical method used in the code thereafter the case and computational setup are described the verification a process which is used to determine numerical errors is presented in the validation section only full scale measurements are used model scale data are not shown for the confidentiality reasons in connection with the validation the hull roughness is discussed and an explanation of the current approach is given the full scale delivered power cfd predictions are presented and compared to the collected sea trial measurements the final section discusses additional errors resulting from the numerical methods physical modelling and input data 2 numerical method the commercial cfd software shipflow is used for the simulations it includes several flow solvers broberg et al 2007 the potential flow solver xpan and the rans solver xchap were used in the present study xpan is a non linear rankine source panel method janson 1997 it uses higher order panels and singularity distributions non linear boundary conditions are used for the free surface dynamic sinkage and trim are computed during the iterative procedure for the non linear free surface boundary condition during each iteration the ship is repositioned and the panellization of the hull and free surface is regenerated xchap solves the steady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using a finite volume method the explicit algebraic stress turbulence model easm deng et al 2005 is used in the present paper no wall functions are used and the equations are integrated down to the wall the equations are discretized using the roe scheme roe 1981 for the convection while a central scheme is used for the diffusive fluxes an explicit flux correction is applied to achieve second order accuracy dick and linden 1992 and chakravarthy and osher 1985 the hull roughness effect is modelled by a modification of the boundary conditions for the specific dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy ω and the turbulent kinetic energy k orych et al 2021 the roughness is quantified using the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s xchap uses structured grids a single block grid is typically generated for a bare hull case multi block structured or overlapping grids are applied for more complex geometries such as hulls with appendages and local grid refinements the solver is flexible in terms of h c o grid topologies and it can handle grid point and line singularities at the boundary surfaces as well as folded and periodic grids to simulate the effect of the propeller body forces are introduced when the flow passes through the propeller swept volume its linear and angular momentum increase as if it had passed a propeller with an infinite number of blades the forces vary in space but are independent of time and generate a propeller induced steady flow the body forces are computed with a built in lifting line propeller analysis program zhang 1990 additionally a friction resistance component is accounted for that contributes to the propeller torque this simple modelling is also used to take into account the blade roughness the computation of the body forces is embedded in an iterative procedure where first the current approximation of the velocity field is extracted at a representative propeller plane the effective wake is thereafter obtained by subtracting the induced propeller wake this is the function of the propeller code and is computed by the circulation from the previous iteration in the lifting line method the new circulation and forces are computed in the effective wake thereafter the forces are distributed over the volume cells in the cylindrical grid the body forces are added to the right hand side of the flow equations this will give a new velocity field after solving the equations the body forces are updated in every iteration at convergence the total wake computed by the rans solver and the lifting line method should match in the selected propeller plane to simulate self propulsion the program automatically adjusts the propeller rotational speed to achieve a balance between resistance and thrust for the model scale simulations an allowance force can be given or computed according to the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 2017a the momentum and continuity equations are solved in a coupled manner while the turbulent quantities are solved separately a krylov type solver from the petsc software suite petsc 2020a is used to solve the linear equations the selected gmres petsc 2020b with the block jacobi preconditioner petsc 2020c is in this case very efficient both in terms of convergence speed and stability 3 case description the test case for this validation was carefully selected to get a high quality reference it is a conventional single screw cargo vessel with lpp about 180 m beam 30 m and block coefficient of 0 78 however most of the data is confidential therefore not all details can be included in the paper a full set of towing tank and sea trial measurements is available the model tests are performed for both resistance and self propulsion with a hull length of 7 m a large number of these ships were built and the measurements for the validation come from 12 sister ships this substantially increases the reliability of the full scale data the collected measurements were obtained during the sea trials upon delivery from the yard they are post processed according to the ittc procedure for sea trials analysis ittc 2017a environmental effects such as wind waves and currents are eliminated for a fair comparison with the numerical predictions performed with a steady state code the design draught and the 12 5 knots speed corresponding to reynolds number of approximately 8 5 1 0 6 and 9 6 1 0 8 in model and full scale respectively are used in the verification computations for the validation additional speeds are added 13 5 and 14 5 knots 4 computational setup the computational setup follows the current best practice for shipflow two different methods are used to obtain the solution the nonlinear potential flow method xpan module is used to compute the wave pattern dynamic sinkage and trim the wave resistance is evaluated using a wave cut integration method the viscous pressure resistance and friction are computed using the rans method xchap for this computation an h o structured background grid describing the hull is complemented with overlapping component grids the domain extends 0 8 lpp in front of and behind the hull and the outer radius of the semi cylindrical domain is 3 0 lpp behind the submerged part of the transom a separate grid block is used an additional cylindrical domain represents the propeller the separate rudder grid is of o o type both the propeller and the rudder are encapsulated within a local refinement that is based on the background grid where each cell is split to generate eight new cells bilge keel geometry is not included in the simulations an example grid assembly is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that in the rans simulations the free surface effects are not taken into account and a double model approach with a slip boundary condition at the water plane is used simulations performed using a viscous free surface flow variant of the code confirm a limited interaction between the wave pattern and the viscous flow therefore the double model approximation can be applied in this case however the dynamic sinkage and trim computed by the potential flow method is taken into account a detailed description of the applied boundary conditions is given in broberg et al 2007 the simulations are performed with the fluid properties corresponding to the towing tank test conditions at model scale and 15 c seawater at full scale in both model and full scale the hull is considered hydraulically smooth in the grid dependency study the hull roughness modelling at full scale is used in the final validation only 5 verification verification is carried out to investigate the numerical accuracy it covers towed and self propelled cases at a model and full scale although the main focus of the paper is the full scale the verification at both scales is presented since there is much more experience from model scale simulations in the ship hydrodynamics community therefore one can easily judge the quality of the presented results the second reason is that the code behaviour at full scale can be compared to the model scale for reference due to the hybrid rans and potential flow approach the verification process is divided into numerical uncertainty estimations for the rans solver and the potential flow solver separately in all rans computations the potential flow meshing is unchanged a separate test described in the discussion section is done to estimate the potential flow mesh sensitivity this approach is adopted since there might be a reason to question mesh refinement studies for free surface potential flow solvers the problem is that refining the free surface spatial discretization in a potential flow panel method will lead to the point where breaking waves start appearing this means that a new physical phenomenon appears in the solution which cannot be resolved with the potential flow method and causes the solver to fail for the rans grid dependency study the calculations are performed in several steps to find the most suitable grid distribution and also to investigate the effect of overlapping grids on the results before generating the set of geometrically similar grids the sensitivity of the solution to a varying number of cells in the girth wise normal and length wise directions in several regions along the hull is studied in this way a more balanced distribution of cells is found that provides a good description of the flow without the need to overspend the computational resources thereafter two sets of systematically varied grids are studied for initial and optimized cell distributions it is found that the results converge with an increasing number of cells to similar values for both sets of grids however the optimized one shows monotonic convergence for a lower total amount of cells the grid refinement ratio is 2 4 in each direction and the total number of cells range from 2 03 1 0 6 to 25 54 1 0 6 and from 3 77 1 0 6 to 44 14 1 0 6 at model and full scale respectively the cell sizes in selected regions for the optimized cell distribution for the finest 1 and coarsest 6 grids are given in table 1 the length and girth wise sizes are non dimensionalized by lpp it should be noted that the aftbody cell size in the length wise direction is given in a region where the overlapping grid refinement is used the number of cells in the normal direction for the full scale simulations is about 65 larger compared to the model scale to compensate for the clustering of cells close to the hull due to the stretching necessary to keep y according to the requirements of the turbulence model the simulations are executed for a bare hull grid first then the rudder and refinement grids are added in subsequent steps in all cases a similar level of uncertainties is observed leading to the conclusion that the overlapping grid algorithm has a very limited impact on the overall result quality one very important observation that confirms earlier experience korkmaz 2015 is that for self propulsion computations the refinement in the volume surrounding the propeller is necessary to avoid a scatter visible as an oscillatory grid convergence if the embedding grid is not fine enough especially in the axial direction the insufficiently accurate interpolation of the forces introduced by the propeller leads to increased uncertainty of the propulsive factors the least square root lsr method is used to determine the numerical uncertainty and the order of accuracy eça and hoekstra 2014 a software tool prepared by marin marin 2018 is used to process the results 5 1 model scale the model scale towed condition results are given in table 2 the total resistance coefficient as well as frictional and viscous pressure components and nominal wake fraction are presented c f increases while c p decreases with grid size which seems to be a feature of the solver all variables converge well with limited scatter in the case of c f and c t the observed order of accuracy p is above the limit suggested by eça hence it is set to 2 0 see eça and hoekstra 2014 the grid uncertainty u g is expressed as a percentage of the solution from the finest grid s 1 table 3 contains c t results obtained for all grid sizes n g as well as the value extrapolated to an infinite number of cells since it is often not practical to use the finest grid that was included in the verification study the uncertainties for coarser grids are also very important here expressed as a percentage of the solution for each grid s i the last column can be of particular interest to the designers it shows a difference between c t 0 the value extrapolated to zero step size and each grid result c t i in percent of c t 0 the total resistance average comparison error e d is about 1 for all three speeds that are considered the propeller action in the self propulsion case seems to stabilize the flow and the resistance components show lower uncertainty table 4 for a better perception of the data the results are also plotted in fig 2 the horizontal axis represents the relative step size between the grids the resistance coefficients indicate monotonous grid convergence with small uncertainties and limited scatter also the propulsive factors behave well and the delivered power converges at a nearly theoretical rate for this method and with small scatter table 5 the deviation from the value extrapolated to the infinitesimally fine grid is 0 15 for the finest grid and the maximum is 0 67 for the second coarsest one table 6 the last column shows a difference between the extrapolated value of p d 0 and each grid result p d i in percent of p d 0 the same values of u g s i for all grids are the result of the used verification method and its specific evaluation process for a detailed description the reader is referred to eça and hoekstra 2014 5 2 full scale the resistance components and nominal wake for the towed full scale case are given in table 7 only for reference as these quantities are in practice not measured the uncertainties are at a similar level to those observed at model scale in table 8 the results from the grid dependence study for resistance components of a self propelled case are shown the results are also plotted in fig 3 it can be noticed that the scatter at full scale is not larger than in the model scale small uncertainties can also be observed for all propulsive factors see table 9 values well below 1 are seen for k t k q and n for the finest grid the delivered power grid uncertainty u g s 1 is 1 4 and the deviation from the extrapolated value p d 1 p d 0 p d 0 is 0 49 see table 10 the results for k t k q and n are plotted for all grids as a function of the relative grid size in fig 4 and p d in fig 5 all the above verification results are given for a smooth hull further calculations with roughness show that the applied modelling does not seem to increase the scatter in the solutions and the uncertainties are very similar therefore only one set of data is presented 6 validation the computations for the verification part are performed with some simplifications to isolate potential sources of scatter in the numerical solution to validate the computed results with the measurements the ship geometry and conditions have to be represented as accurately as possible and the missing drag sources need to be recognized and included in the final results the roughness effects on the hull and propeller at full scale are computed using the model implemented in the rans code the aerodynamic resistance is added using the ship frontal area and a coefficient provided by the model testing facility there is also an addition of the bilge keel drag considering the computational effort the fourth finest grid is used in the validation the delivered power difference between the finest setup with over 44 1 0 6 cells and the selected one with about 10 1 0 6 is less than 0 5 table 10 6 1 hull roughness the added resistance due to the hull roughness can significantly increase the power demand even a newly painted surface may exhibit roughness large enough to raise the fuel consumption a few percent compared to a hydraulically smooth surface the topological properties of the rough surfaces are often described with only a single parameter one example used in ship hydrodynamics is the average hull roughness a h r see townsin et al 1981 in many cfd methods the roughness models also use a single number description in the form of an equivalent sand roughness k s the numerical models are often tuned to represent certain measurements therefore there is a large number of models available and more are being developed to suit specific surface types and conditions some of them were studied in orych et al 2021 where their different behaviours were presented for the currently available models the remaining challenge is the correlation between the two measures namely a h r and k s in the ittc extrapolation method townsin s formula for added resistance due to roughness is used ittc 2017b it is quite instinctive for a naval architect to cross check the cfd results against this solution plotting the increase in frictional resistance as a function of average hull roughness δ c f a h r based on townsin s method together with computed increase as a function of equivalent sand roughness δ c f k s should help to find the relation between the a h r and k s as the first example a flat plate with length and speed corresponding to the kriso container ship kcs hino et al 2020 is considered using the a h r k s factor of 5 yields nearly perfect correlation between the aupoix colebrook model aupoix 2014 and townsin s method up to the suggested maximum of 230 μ m for the latter one see fig 6 however repeating the exercise for the present ship which is shorter and slower the results are disappointing quite different curves are noticeable in fig 7 decreasing length and speed further shows that the roughness limit for a hydraulically smooth surface based on townsin s formula is unreasonably high and may lead to underestimation of the resistance due to roughness in such applications the second approach to find the a h r k s correlation is based on experimental results for a flat plate the measurements of several painted surfaces are extrapolated to full scale length with granville s method and to appropriate speed with grigson s method with help of sspa s skin friction database tool leer andersen 2020 in this case both newly painted plates and cleaned ones after deployment in the sea are used the a h r for these samples is from 65 to 140 μ m for the same correlation factor that seemed to be suitable for townsin s formula in case of the conditions similar to the kcs the extrapolated measured values and cfd results show a good level of consistency for both ships figs 6 and 7 considering the fact that the experiments which constitute the basis of the roughness models implemented in the cfd code are based on different surface roughness types the agreement is satisfactory and seems more reliable than townsin s formula for the kcs case the results from other extrapolated measurements described by demirel et al 2017 are shown in fig 6 it has to be highlighted that there is no universal a h r k s correlation factor not only due to the numerical models but also since the rough surface topology cannot be adequately represented by a single number a good example of that is the significant difference in c f change between the newly painted aged and subsequently cleaned surfaces with the same a h r which can also be seen in the figures the full scale data considered in this work is based on delivered power measurements of ships during sea trials the average hull roughness was reported but there is no detailed description of the surface texture therefore the aupoix colebrook roughness model with a h r k s 5 which indicates conservative values of resistance increase is selected 6 2 full scale measurements and post processing it is notoriously difficult to obtain sea trial data from a shipowner by a third party even more problematic is to get good quality materials with accurate measurements and proper records of the procedure in this case the authors are fortunate to gain access to a well documented set of measurements for 12 sister ships the trials are performed according to the ittc procedure ittc 2017c also included in iso 15016 standard three power settings are included and data acquired for power speed propeller rate of revolution wind waves current and temperature among others corrections are applied for wind waves current and temperature effects in connection to the trial runs the average hull roughness is measured three sister vessels are selected based on the conditions during the measurements these are tested at design draught in nearly perfect weather conditions which minimize the measurement and correction errors therefore the resulting measurement uncertainty is at a level allowing for proper validation of the cfd simulations 6 3 full scale predictions the most important part of this investigation is a full scale self propulsion simulation it is performed at speeds of 12 5 13 5 and 14 5 knots this range includes the available sea trial runs for the selected cases in the computations the roughness effects are taken into account and the a h r is set to 100 μ m according to the average of the measured values the windage is computed using the frontal ship area and a resistance coefficient suggested by the towing tank performing the model tests to estimate the drag of the bilge keels their wetted area and the frictional resistance coefficient for the bare hull are used both are added as an additional resistance during the self propulsion simulation to account for the propeller roughness a value of 30 μ m indicated by ittc extrapolation method is used the delivered power from the sea trials and shipflow simulations are presented in fig 8 the curve fitting of the sea trial data is done according to the ittc recommendations ittc 2017c thus a curve representing the mean value of the two available towing tank predictions is shifted vertically such that the root mean square rms error of the data points is minimized the normalized rms error is 2 8 included in the plot are also the uncertainties estimated for the sea trials and the cfd results a band of 6 1 represents the experimental uncertainty u d which can be expected from these sea trials it is computed based on the sea trial uncertainties presented by werner and gustafsson 2020 where for good weather conditions during trials the precision uncertainty is 8 for each individual point the uncertainty of the mean value is obtained by dividing by the square root of the number of sister ships farrance and frenkel 2012 resulting in a precision error p of 4 6 for this case furthermore according to insel 2008 the expected bias error b for delivered power is at a level of 4 p and b can be combined to obtain u d p 2 b 2 as it can be recalled from the verification part in this paper the delivered power numerical uncertainty u s n is 3 65 for the grid size used in the simulations it is estimated at 12 5 knots of speed and is assumed to be similar at 13 5 and 14 5 knots according to the ittc 2017d a computation is considered validated at the u v a l level if the comparison error e is smaller than u v a l e u v a l u s n 2 u d 2 to assess the comparison error of the validation e the differences between computed results and the sea trial data fit are calculated and expressed in percent of the latter one d table 11 the computed delivered power errors are much smaller than the validation uncertainty therefore the simulations may be considered validated at the u v a l level 7 1 it is worth noting that the numerical uncertainty is lower than and entirely within the experimental uncertainty no validation of the propeller rate of revolution is presented since there is not sufficient data to estimate the bias error and there is a strong impression that the propeller pitch was modified compared to the initial design to adjust the rpm to better match the engine characteristics 7 discussion there are three types of errors in a computation coleman 2009 numerical errors physical modelling errors and errors in input data the numerical errors including discretization scheme are investigated through grid dependence studies the physical errors stem from different sources turbulence model boundary conditions propeller model free surface approximation roughness modelling and in the present case the modelling of bilge keels and air resistance the input data errors are related to the cad description of the hull all these errors but the turbulence model and the boundary conditions are discussed here the grid dependency study presented in verification section is done only for the rans part of the solution the wave resistance is computed with a separate potential flow method in the verification and the validation described earlier it is computed with a mesh that is set up based on many validations carried out since the method was developed to complete the study and quantify the uncertainties associated with the potential flow solution a series of six meshes is prepared ranging from 9409 to 53908 panels the upper limit of this range is set by the onset of wave breaking and therefore inevitable convergence issues this series of potential flow meshes is combined with the rans grid with 10 1 0 6 cells the p d uncertainty due to the potential flow mesh size is in this setup 0 81 for the finest mesh see fig 9 for the validation part where the fourth finest rans and potential flow solutions are used the total p d uncertainty is 3 90 it is evaluated using the root sum of the squares with contributions from the viscous part that is 3 65 and potential flow part 1 38 therefore the uncertainty increase of 0 25 associated with the potential flow part of the solution does not change the overall conclusions this is also in part due to the small wave resistance contribution to the total resistance approximately 5 at 12 5 knots speed the numerical uncertainty includes both grid and iterative uncertainties however the simulations are carried out with very strict convergence criteria until the iterative errors are insignificant for the grid with 10 1 0 6 cells the standard deviations of the integrated values calculated for the last 10 of iterations are below 0 03 for c p 0 01 for c t 0 005 for c f k t k q n and p d this indicates that the iterative uncertainty is very small and it is not included in the analysis when it comes to the hull roughness the uncertainties lay on both experimental and numerical sides the measured average hull roughness is a single number that describes the hull condition it does not take into account the local surface geometry which influences the efficiency of the roughness elements to create disturbance in the flow as seen in figs 6 and 7 a surface with the same a h r can give noticeably different resistance depending on whether the hull was freshly painted or cleaned also the paint type would affect the resistance the current numerical methods usually use an equivalent sand roughness that is not universally translatable from a h r for these reasons it is important to check how large an effect the a h r and a h r k s correlation factor would have on the results here the a h r is varied by 25 which is a spread between sister ships observed in the measurements if this variation is associated with the correlation factor it creates an envelope in the change of c f that contains all of the markers in figs 6 and 7 the delivered power change due to this variation is 1 5 a similar study is also applied to the propeller roughness this is realized by modification of the blade frictional coefficient introduced to the lifting line the nominal propeller roughness is varied by as much as 20 corresponding to the blades c f change of 5 this results in 0 9 difference in delivered power the estimation of air resistance is approximate as there are no wind tunnel measurements available however the air resistance is just 2 5 of the total resistance and therefore the contribution to the total uncertainty is expected to be less than 0 25 assuming the range of possible air resistance coefficients in the same way the resistance from the bilge keels is only roughly estimated they contribute to 0 7 of the total resistance and the uncertainty introduced by this coarse approximation is considered marginal at the simulation preparation stage it became obvious that the hull geometry described in the cad model is not smooth and requires small corrections this is not uncommon and the computed hull shape and the built ship differ slightly furthermore there is a small change introduced at the stern to the otherwise similar sister ships after several completed builds this means that two slightly different hulls are used in the selected sea trials the differences between the original smoothened and modified hull shapes are investigated with cfd and the delivered power discrepancy between them is about 1 3 the above complementary studies of sensitivity to several important simulation parameters substantiate the confidence in the validity of the achieved numerical predictions accuracy at full scale 8 conclusions the main objective of this paper is to present a validation of cfd simulations of delivered power for a full scale ship in addition a verification of the numerical method through systematic grid refinement studies is presented both for model scale and full scale numerical uncertainties are determined for the total resistance and its components the propulsive factors and the delivered power the numerical uncertainty of the delivered power at model scale is 2 3 and at full scale 3 7 for a medium size grid with ten million cells in the full scale validation special emphasis is placed on the effect of the surface roughness both of the hull and the propeller the validation is based on sea trial results where the experimental uncertainty is estimated to 6 together with the numerical uncertainty this gives a validation uncertainty of 7 for the speed range from 12 5 to 14 5 knots the

exhibits the numerical uncertainty of 1 40 at full scale computed results are compared with sea trial data for three sister ships special attention is paid to the effect of roughness on the hull and

introduction the ship speed power performance is usually one of the most important factors for a ship operator at the moment only model test based predictions are widely accepted for large and expensive projects in the marine industry computational fluid dynamics cfd has been successfully applied to model scale simulations for many years the availability of validation data both open and proprietary makes it relatively easy to develop the best practice and use the method for ship design it is more difficult to predict the propulsion power at full scale in some cases it is necessary to simulate at the correct reynolds number due to the flow characteristics while in other cases the designers wish to achieve better designs without extrapolating from a model scale accessible full scale measurements of good quality are still scarce most data comes from sea trials which are often carried out only at ballast draught or from monitoring systems on ships in operation in principle both can be used for validation purposes the problems are that the data is most of the time strictly confidential and or difficult to process due to the uncertainties linked to the measurement accuracy and condition details in recent years an increased interest is observed in full scale simulations this is due to advancements in numerical methods more powerful computers as well as trust that the cfd has gained through for example the series of workshops on cfd in ship hydrodynamics initiated in 1980 hino et al 2020 however even as recently as in 2008 raven et al 2008 concluded that a prediction of the full scale power entirely based on cfd is still not reliable enough when high accuracy is required the importance of cfd simulations at full scale was highlighted later in hochkirch and mallol 2013 and a practical example illustrated by kim et al 2014 in both papers the advantage of full scale simulations and optimizations of hulls and appendages are shown lloyd s register s full scale numerical modelling workshop has recently contributed with an open test case for validations the workshop results were summarized by ponkratov 2017 further analysis of the published results shows that the mean comparison error of the predicted power is 13 for all submitted results and 3 out of 27 participants had errors below 3 for all considered speeds a thorough study of the numerical accuracy both at model and full scale can be found in eça et al 2010 and pereira et al 2017 for a large number of turbulence models without wall functions however the papers contain no full scale validation in this work carefully selected data from an established operator for a large number of sister ships is collected and used for validation the rans method used for simulations incorporates the wall roughness modelling without the need for wall functions therefore the numerical challenge is greater than the works presented earlier however there is also a potential for more accurate predictions an uncertainty study is presented which is often lacking in other publications the paper first gives a brief introduction to the numerical method used in the code thereafter the case and computational setup are described the verification a process which is used to determine numerical errors is presented in the validation section only full scale measurements are used model scale data are not shown for the confidentiality reasons in connection with the validation the hull roughness is discussed and an explanation of the current approach is given the full scale delivered power cfd predictions are presented and compared to the collected sea trial measurements the final section discusses additional errors resulting from the numerical methods physical modelling and input data 2 numerical method the commercial cfd software shipflow is used for the simulations it includes several flow solvers broberg et al 2007 the potential flow solver xpan and the rans solver xchap were used in the present study xpan is a non linear rankine source panel method janson 1997 it uses higher order panels and singularity distributions non linear boundary conditions are used for the free surface dynamic sinkage and trim are computed during the iterative procedure for the non linear free surface boundary condition during each iteration the ship is repositioned and the panellization of the hull and free surface is regenerated xchap solves the steady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using a finite volume method the explicit algebraic stress turbulence model easm deng et al 2005 is used in the present paper no wall functions are used and the equations are integrated down to the wall the equations are discretized using the roe scheme roe 1981 for the convection while a central scheme is used for the diffusive fluxes an explicit flux correction is applied to achieve second order accuracy dick and linden 1992 and chakravarthy and osher 1985 the hull roughness effect is modelled by a modification of the boundary conditions for the specific dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy ω and the turbulent kinetic energy k orych et al 2021 the roughness is quantified using the equivalent sand grain roughness height k s xchap uses structured grids a single block grid is typically generated for a bare hull case multi block structured or overlapping grids are applied for more complex geometries such as hulls with appendages and local grid refinements the solver is flexible in terms of h c o grid topologies and it can handle grid point and line singularities at the boundary surfaces as well as folded and periodic grids to simulate the effect of the propeller body forces are introduced when the flow passes through the propeller swept volume its linear and angular momentum increase as if it had passed a propeller with an infinite number of blades the forces vary in space but are independent of time and generate a propeller induced steady flow the body forces are computed with a built in lifting line propeller analysis program zhang 1990 additionally a friction resistance component is accounted for that contributes to the propeller torque this simple modelling is also used to take into account the blade roughness the computation of the body forces is embedded in an iterative procedure where first the current approximation of the velocity field is extracted at a representative propeller plane the effective wake is thereafter obtained by subtracting the induced propeller wake this is the function of the propeller code and is computed by the circulation from the previous iteration in the lifting line method the new circulation and forces are computed in the effective wake thereafter the forces are distributed over the volume cells in the cylindrical grid the body forces are added to the right hand side of the flow equations this will give a new velocity field after solving the equations the body forces are updated in every iteration at convergence the total wake computed by the rans solver and the lifting line method should match in the selected propeller plane to simulate self propulsion the program automatically adjusts the propeller rotational speed to achieve a balance between resistance and thrust for the model scale simulations an allowance force can be given or computed according to the 1978 ittc performance prediction method ittc 2017a the momentum and continuity equations are solved in a coupled manner while the turbulent quantities are solved separately a krylov type solver from the petsc software suite petsc 2020a is used to solve the linear equations the selected gmres petsc 2020b with the block jacobi preconditioner petsc 2020c is in this case very efficient both in terms of convergence speed and stability 3 case description the test case for this validation was carefully selected to get a high quality reference it is a conventional single screw cargo vessel with lpp about 180 m beam 30 m and block coefficient of 0 78 however most of the data is confidential therefore not all details can be included in the paper a full set of towing tank and sea trial measurements is available the model tests are performed for both resistance and self propulsion with a hull length of 7 m a large number of these ships were built and the measurements for the validation come from 12 sister ships this substantially increases the reliability of the full scale data the collected measurements were obtained during the sea trials upon delivery from the yard they are post processed according to the ittc procedure for sea trials analysis ittc 2017a environmental effects such as wind waves and currents are eliminated for a fair comparison with the numerical predictions performed with a steady state code the design draught and the 12 5 knots speed corresponding to reynolds number of approximately 8 5 1 0 6 and 9 6 1 0 8 in model and full scale respectively are used in the verification computations for the validation additional speeds are added 13 5 and 14 5 knots 4 computational setup the computational setup follows the current best practice for shipflow two different methods are used to obtain the solution the nonlinear potential flow method xpan module is used to compute the wave pattern dynamic sinkage and trim the wave resistance is evaluated using a wave cut integration method the viscous pressure resistance and friction are computed using the rans method xchap for this computation an h o structured background grid describing the hull is complemented with overlapping component grids the domain extends 0 8 lpp in front of and behind the hull and the outer radius of the semi cylindrical domain is 3 0 lpp behind the submerged part of the transom a separate grid block is used an additional cylindrical domain represents the propeller the separate rudder grid is of o o type both the propeller and the rudder are encapsulated within a local refinement that is based on the background grid where each cell is split to generate eight new cells bilge keel geometry is not included in the simulations an example grid assembly is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that in the rans simulations the free surface effects are not taken into account and a double model approach with a slip boundary condition at the water plane is used simulations performed using a viscous free surface flow variant of the code confirm a limited interaction between the wave pattern and the viscous flow therefore the double model approximation can be applied in this case however the dynamic sinkage and trim computed by the potential flow method is taken into account a detailed description of the applied boundary conditions is given in broberg et al 2007 the simulations are performed with the fluid properties corresponding to the towing tank test conditions at model scale and 15 c seawater at full scale in both model and full scale the hull is considered hydraulically smooth in the grid dependency study the hull roughness modelling at full scale is used in the final validation only 5 verification verification is carried out to investigate the numerical accuracy it covers towed and self propelled cases at a model and full scale although the main focus of the paper is the full scale the verification at both scales is presented since there is much more experience from model scale simulations in the ship hydrodynamics community therefore one can easily judge the quality of the presented results the second reason is that the code behaviour at full scale can be compared to the model scale for reference due to the hybrid rans and potential flow approach the verification process is divided into numerical uncertainty estimations for the rans solver and the potential flow solver separately in all rans computations the potential flow meshing is unchanged a separate test described in the discussion section is done to estimate the potential flow mesh sensitivity this approach is adopted since there might be a reason to question mesh refinement studies for free surface potential flow solvers the problem is that refining the free surface spatial discretization in a potential flow panel method will lead to the point where breaking waves start appearing this means that a new physical phenomenon appears in the solution which cannot be resolved with the potential flow method and causes the solver to fail for the rans grid dependency study the calculations are performed in several steps to find the most suitable grid distribution and also to investigate the effect of overlapping grids on the results before generating the set of geometrically similar grids the sensitivity of the solution to a varying number of cells in the girth wise normal and length wise directions in several regions along the hull is studied in this way a more balanced distribution of cells is found that provides a good description of the flow without the need to overspend the computational resources thereafter two sets of systematically varied grids are studied for initial and optimized cell distributions it is found that the results converge with an increasing number of cells to similar values for both sets of grids however the optimized one shows monotonic convergence for a lower total amount of cells the grid refinement ratio is 2 4 in each direction and the total number of cells range from 2 03 1 0 6 to 25 54 1 0 6 and from 3 77 1 0 6 to 44 14 1 0 6 at model and full scale respectively the cell sizes in selected regions for the optimized cell distribution for the finest 1 and coarsest 6 grids are given in table 1 the length and girth wise sizes are non dimensionalized by lpp it should be noted that the aftbody cell size in the length wise direction is given in a region where the overlapping grid refinement is used the number of cells in the normal direction for the full scale simulations is about 65 larger compared to the model scale to compensate for the clustering of cells close to the hull due to the stretching necessary to keep y according to the requirements of the turbulence model the simulations are executed for a bare hull grid first then the rudder and refinement grids are added in subsequent steps in all cases a similar level of uncertainties is observed leading to the conclusion that the overlapping grid algorithm has a very limited impact on the overall result quality one very important observation that confirms earlier experience korkmaz 2015 is that for self propulsion computations the refinement in the volume surrounding the propeller is necessary to avoid a scatter visible as an oscillatory grid convergence if the embedding grid is not fine enough especially in the axial direction the insufficiently accurate interpolation of the forces introduced by the propeller leads to increased uncertainty of the propulsive factors the least square root lsr method is used to determine the numerical uncertainty and the order of accuracy eça and hoekstra 2014 a software tool prepared by marin marin 2018 is used to process the results 5 1 model scale the model scale towed condition results are given in table 2 the total resistance coefficient as well as frictional and viscous pressure components and nominal wake fraction are presented c f increases while c p decreases with grid size which seems to be a feature of the solver all variables converge well with limited scatter in the case of c f and c t the observed order of accuracy p is above the limit suggested by eça hence it is set to 2 0 see eça and hoekstra 2014 the grid uncertainty u g is expressed as a percentage of the solution from the finest grid s 1 table 3 contains c t results obtained for all grid sizes n g as well as the value extrapolated to an infinite number of cells since it is often not practical to use the finest grid that was included in the verification study the uncertainties for coarser grids are also very important here expressed as a percentage of the solution for each grid s i the last column can be of particular interest to the designers it shows a difference between c t 0 the value extrapolated to zero step size and each grid result c t i in percent of c t 0 the total resistance average comparison error e d is about 1 for all three speeds that are considered the propeller action in the self propulsion case seems to stabilize the flow and the resistance components show lower uncertainty table 4 for a better perception of the data the results are also plotted in fig 2 the horizontal axis represents the relative step size between the grids the resistance coefficients indicate monotonous grid convergence with small uncertainties and limited scatter also the propulsive factors behave well and the delivered power converges at a nearly theoretical rate for this method and with small scatter table 5 the deviation from the value extrapolated to the infinitesimally fine grid is 0 15 for the finest grid and the maximum is 0 67 for the second coarsest one table 6 the last column shows a difference between the extrapolated value of p d 0 and each grid result p d i in percent of p d 0 the same values of u g s i for all grids are the result of the used verification method and its specific evaluation process for a detailed description the reader is referred to eça and hoekstra 2014 5 2 full scale the resistance components and nominal wake for the towed full scale case are given in table 7 only for reference as these quantities are in practice not measured the uncertainties are at a similar level to those observed at model scale in table 8 the results from the grid dependence study for resistance components of a self propelled case are shown the results are also plotted in fig 3 it can be noticed that the scatter at full scale is not larger than in the model scale small uncertainties can also be observed for all propulsive factors see table 9 values well below 1 are seen for k t k q and n for the finest grid the delivered power grid uncertainty u g s 1 is 1 4 and the deviation from the extrapolated value p d 1 p d 0 p d 0 is 0 49 see table 10 the results for k t k q and n are plotted for all grids as a function of the relative grid size in fig 4 and p d in fig 5 all the above verification results are given for a smooth hull further calculations with roughness show that the applied modelling does not seem to increase the scatter in the solutions and the uncertainties are very similar therefore only one set of data is presented 6 validation the computations for the verification part are performed with some simplifications to isolate potential sources of scatter in the numerical solution to validate the computed results with the measurements the ship geometry and conditions have to be represented as accurately as possible and the missing drag sources need to be recognized and included in the final results the roughness effects on the hull and propeller at full scale are computed using the model implemented in the rans code the aerodynamic resistance is added using the ship frontal area and a coefficient provided by the model testing facility there is also an addition of the bilge keel drag considering the computational effort the fourth finest grid is used in the validation the delivered power difference between the finest setup with over 44 1 0 6 cells and the selected one with about 10 1 0 6 is less than 0 5 table 10 6 1 hull roughness the added resistance due to the hull roughness can significantly increase the power demand even a newly painted surface may exhibit roughness large enough to raise the fuel consumption a few percent compared to a hydraulically smooth surface the topological properties of the rough surfaces are often described with only a single parameter one example used in ship hydrodynamics is the average hull roughness a h r see townsin et al 1981 in many cfd methods the roughness models also use a single number description in the form of an equivalent sand roughness k s the numerical models are often tuned to represent certain measurements therefore there is a large number of models available and more are being developed to suit specific surface types and conditions some of them were studied in orych et al 2021 where their different behaviours were presented for the currently available models the remaining challenge is the correlation between the two measures namely a h r and k s in the ittc extrapolation method townsin s formula for added resistance due to roughness is used ittc 2017b it is quite instinctive for a naval architect to cross check the cfd results against this solution plotting the increase in frictional resistance as a function of average hull roughness δ c f a h r based on townsin s method together with computed increase as a function of equivalent sand roughness δ c f k s should help to find the relation between the a h r and k s as the first example a flat plate with length and speed corresponding to the kriso container ship kcs hino et al 2020 is considered using the a h r k s factor of 5 yields nearly perfect correlation between the aupoix colebrook model aupoix 2014 and townsin s method up to the suggested maximum of 230 μ m for the latter one see fig 6 however repeating the exercise for the present ship which is shorter and slower the results are disappointing quite different curves are noticeable in fig 7 decreasing length and speed further shows that the roughness limit for a hydraulically smooth surface based on townsin s formula is unreasonably high and may lead to underestimation of the resistance due to roughness in such applications the second approach to find the a h r k s correlation is based on experimental results for a flat plate the measurements of several painted surfaces are extrapolated to full scale length with granville s method and to appropriate speed with grigson s method with help of sspa s skin friction database tool leer andersen 2020 in this case both newly painted plates and cleaned ones after deployment in the sea are used the a h r for these samples is from 65 to 140 μ m for the same correlation factor that seemed to be suitable for townsin s formula in case of the conditions similar to the kcs the extrapolated measured values and cfd results show a good level of consistency for both ships figs 6 and 7 considering the fact that the experiments which constitute the basis of the roughness models implemented in the cfd code are based on different surface roughness types the agreement is satisfactory and seems more reliable than townsin s formula for the kcs case the results from other extrapolated measurements described by demirel et al 2017 are shown in fig 6 it has to be highlighted that there is no universal a h r k s correlation factor not only due to the numerical models but also since the rough surface topology cannot be adequately represented by a single number a good example of that is the significant difference in c f change between the newly painted aged and subsequently cleaned surfaces with the same a h r which can also be seen in the figures the full scale data considered in this work is based on delivered power measurements of ships during sea trials the average hull roughness was reported but there is no detailed description of the surface texture therefore the aupoix colebrook roughness model with a h r k s 5 which indicates conservative values of resistance increase is selected 6 2 full scale measurements and post processing it is notoriously difficult to obtain sea trial data from a shipowner by a third party even more problematic is to get good quality materials with accurate measurements and proper records of the procedure in this case the authors are fortunate to gain access to a well documented set of measurements for 12 sister ships the trials are performed according to the ittc procedure ittc 2017c also included in iso 15016 standard three power settings are included and data acquired for power speed propeller rate of revolution wind waves current and temperature among others corrections are applied for wind waves current and temperature effects in connection to the trial runs the average hull roughness is measured three sister vessels are selected based on the conditions during the measurements these are tested at design draught in nearly perfect weather conditions which minimize the measurement and correction errors therefore the resulting measurement uncertainty is at a level allowing for proper validation of the cfd simulations 6 3 full scale predictions the most important part of this investigation is a full scale self propulsion simulation it is performed at speeds of 12 5 13 5 and 14 5 knots this range includes the available sea trial runs for the selected cases in the computations the roughness effects are taken into account and the a h r is set to 100 μ m according to the average of the measured values the windage is computed using the frontal ship area and a resistance coefficient suggested by the towing tank performing the model tests to estimate the drag of the bilge keels their wetted area and the frictional resistance coefficient for the bare hull are used both are added as an additional resistance during the self propulsion simulation to account for the propeller roughness a value of 30 μ m indicated by ittc extrapolation method is used the delivered power from the sea trials and shipflow simulations are presented in fig 8 the curve fitting of the sea trial data is done according to the ittc recommendations ittc 2017c thus a curve representing the mean value of the two available towing tank predictions is shifted vertically such that the root mean square rms error of the data points is minimized the normalized rms error is 2 8 included in the plot are also the uncertainties estimated for the sea trials and the cfd results a band of 6 1 represents the experimental uncertainty u d which can be expected from these sea trials it is computed based on the sea trial uncertainties presented by werner and gustafsson 2020 where for good weather conditions during trials the precision uncertainty is 8 for each individual point the uncertainty of the mean value is obtained by dividing by the square root of the number of sister ships farrance and frenkel 2012 resulting in a precision error p of 4 6 for this case furthermore according to insel 2008 the expected bias error b for delivered power is at a level of 4 p and b can be combined to obtain u d p 2 b 2 as it can be recalled from the verification part in this paper the delivered power numerical uncertainty u s n is 3 65 for the grid size used in the simulations it is estimated at 12 5 knots of speed and is assumed to be similar at 13 5 and 14 5 knots according to the ittc 2017d a computation is considered validated at the u v a l level if the comparison error e is smaller than u v a l e u v a l u s n 2 u d 2 to assess the comparison error of the validation e the differences between computed results and the sea trial data fit are calculated and expressed in percent of the latter one d table 11 the computed delivered power errors are much smaller than the validation uncertainty therefore the simulations may be considered validated at the u v a l level 7 1 it is worth noting that the numerical uncertainty is lower than and entirely within the experimental uncertainty no validation of the propeller rate of revolution is presented since there is not sufficient data to estimate the bias error and there is a strong impression that the propeller pitch was modified compared to the initial design to adjust the rpm to better match the engine characteristics 7 discussion there are three types of errors in a computation coleman 2009 numerical errors physical modelling errors and errors in input data the numerical errors including discretization scheme are investigated through grid dependence studies the physical errors stem from different sources turbulence model boundary conditions propeller model free surface approximation roughness modelling and in the present case the modelling of bilge keels and air resistance the input data errors are related to the cad description of the hull all these errors but the turbulence model and the boundary conditions are discussed here the grid dependency study presented in verification section is done only for the rans part of the solution the wave resistance is computed with a separate potential flow method in the verification and the validation described earlier it is computed with a mesh that is set up based on many validations carried out since the method was developed to complete the study and quantify the uncertainties associated with the potential flow solution a series of six meshes is prepared ranging from 9409 to 53908 panels the upper limit of this range is set by the onset of wave breaking and therefore inevitable convergence issues this series of potential flow meshes is combined with the rans grid with 10 1 0 6 cells the p d uncertainty due to the potential flow mesh size is in this setup 0 81 for the finest mesh see fig 9 for the validation part where the fourth finest rans and potential flow solutions are used the total p d uncertainty is 3 90 it is evaluated using the root sum of the squares with contributions from the viscous part that is 3 65 and potential flow part 1 38 therefore the uncertainty increase of 0 25 associated with the potential flow part of the solution does not change the overall conclusions this is also in part due to the small wave resistance contribution to the total resistance approximately 5 at 12 5 knots speed the numerical uncertainty includes both grid and iterative uncertainties however the simulations are carried out with very strict convergence criteria until the iterative errors are insignificant for the grid with 10 1 0 6 cells the standard deviations of the integrated values calculated for the last 10 of iterations are below 0 03 for c p 0 01 for c t 0 005 for c f k t k q n and p d this indicates that the iterative uncertainty is very small and it is not included in the analysis when it comes to the hull roughness the uncertainties lay on both experimental and numerical sides the measured average hull roughness is a single number that describes the hull condition it does not take into account the local surface geometry which influences the efficiency of the roughness elements to create disturbance in the flow as seen in figs 6 and 7 a surface with the same a h r can give noticeably different resistance depending on whether the hull was freshly painted or cleaned also the paint type would affect the resistance the current numerical methods usually use an equivalent sand roughness that is not universally translatable from a h r for these reasons it is important to check how large an effect the a h r and a h r k s correlation factor would have on the results here the a h r is varied by 25 which is a spread between sister ships observed in the measurements if this variation is associated with the correlation factor it creates an envelope in the change of c f that contains all of the markers in figs 6 and 7 the delivered power change due to this variation is 1 5 a similar study is also applied to the propeller roughness this is realized by modification of the blade frictional coefficient introduced to the lifting line the nominal propeller roughness is varied by as much as 20 corresponding to the blades c f change of 5 this results in 0 9 difference in delivered power the estimation of air resistance is approximate as there are no wind tunnel measurements available however the air resistance is just 2 5 of the total resistance and therefore the contribution to the total uncertainty is expected to be less than 0 25 assuming the range of possible air resistance coefficients in the same way the resistance from the bilge keels is only roughly estimated they contribute to 0 7 of the total resistance and the uncertainty introduced by this coarse approximation is considered marginal at the simulation preparation stage it became obvious that the hull geometry described in the cad model is not smooth and requires small corrections this is not uncommon and the computed hull shape and the built ship differ slightly furthermore there is a small change introduced at the stern to the otherwise similar sister ships after several completed builds this means that two slightly different hulls are used in the selected sea trials the differences between the original smoothened and modified hull shapes are investigated with cfd and the delivered power discrepancy between them is about 1 3 the above complementary studies of sensitivity to several important simulation parameters substantiate the confidence in the validity of the achieved numerical predictions accuracy at full scale 8 conclusions the main objective of this paper is to present a validation of cfd simulations of delivered power for a full scale ship in addition a verification of the numerical method through systematic grid refinement studies is presented both for model scale and full scale numerical uncertainties are determined for the total resistance and its components the propulsive factors and the delivered power the numerical uncertainty of the delivered power at model scale is 2 3 and at full scale 3 7 for a medium size grid with ten million cells in the full scale validation special emphasis is placed on the effect of the surface roughness both of the hull and the propeller the validation is based on sea trial results where the experimental uncertainty is estimated to 6 together with the numerical uncertainty this gives a validation uncertainty of 7 for the speed range from 12 5 to 14 5 knots the average comparison error is 1 i e considerably smaller than the validation uncertainty credit authorship contribution statement michal orych conceptualization methodology software validation
