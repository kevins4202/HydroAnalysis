22665,in this paper a review is given on the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing to be more close to the realistic sea states not only unidirectional waves but also directional waves characterized by different directional spreading effects are considered herein particular attention is paid to the variation of characteristics of 2d extreme waves because their corresponding evolutionary tendency can be clearly divided into several critical stages and associated energy exchange in this process can be discussed from a statistical point of view moreover four typical phase resolving deterministic models that can account for the third order nonlinear mechanism are briefly commented based on their features in stochastic analysis of extreme waves with monte carlo simulations keywords bound wave effect extreme waves laboratory experiment nonlinear wave focusing phase resolving deterministic models 1 introduction with more frequently appeared extreme weather due to global warming and more rapid exploration and exploitation in the ocean by human being the chance to encounter an extreme wave is very high today the destructive power of extreme waves is truly awesome and sometimes it can cause damage to the floating body in the ocean leading to serious loss of life and property or even to local pollution and environmental risk kharif and pelinovsky 2003 toffoli et al 2005 bitner gregersen and toffoli 2014 in addition to indicating the large amplitude that is normally identified by crest to trough height exceeding 2 times the surrounding significant wave height the term extreme waves is also used to specify the tail of some typical statistical distribution of wave heights meaning its appearance is rare but more often than would be expected from the traditional probability theory although the extreme waves had been part of marine folklore for centuries oceanographers did not believe them until the 70s of last century intensive research has been motivated by the published record of new year wave which is an extreme event that is measured by the laser based wave sensor on the draupner e platform in the central north sea on january 1st 1995 during the last 40 years a lot of progress has been made on understanding the physical mechanisms of extreme waves under many circumstances the rogue or extreme waves can be generated and the mechanisms involved are various which may be eventually traced back to the following three types geometrical focusing dispersive focusing and nonlinear focusing dysthe et al 2008 some reviews on the physical mechanisms of the extreme wave phenomenon have been made in the past from a popular and physically general point of view slunyaev et al 2011 simply described the extreme waves appeared in deepwater shallow water and coastal areas emphasizing the difference between water wave physics at these locations to understand these complex linear and nonlinear mechanisms one can seek for the professional and comprehensive review of kharif and pelinovsky 2003 rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and have been observed in a variety of different contexts the associated review has been made by onorato et al 2013 who conducted a detailed discussion on rogue waves appeared in water and in optics the universal mechanism that may be used to explain these rogue waves is modulational instability after reviewing some early instructive works in different physical situations developed independently in the 1960s and early 1970s zakharov and ostrovsky 2009 pointed out that various methods had been used to treat modulational instability which might be formally different but essentially led to the same mathematical and physical results restricting to surface waves in the open sea the mechanism of formation of extreme waves is more complex because wind forcing wave breaking wave current interactions and the tridimensionality of wave field cannot be neglected as summarized by dysthe et al 2008 there is no generally accepted explanation or theory so far for the occurrence of such true rogue waves however some attempts to forecast extreme waves in a deterministic or a statistical fashion have been made such as the warning system developed by ecmwf based on wave spectral evolution janssen and bidlot 2009 recently some new perspectives on the formation of extreme waves were proposed by onorato and suret 2016 who believed that the external factors can set the spectrum out of local equilibrium and that the induced nonlinearity in some cases can lead to strong deviations from gaussian statistics and eventually to rogue waves nevertheless modulational instability or benjamin feir instability bfi has been receiving a lot of attention up to now it is the only nonlinear mechanism that seems to be capable of catching the main features of rogue waves in the deep sea kharif et al 2009 since the landmark discovery of modulational instability of weakly nonlinear deepwater wave trains by lighthill 1965 and benjamin and feir 1967 research associated with nonlinear deepwater waves has entered a new era the nonlinear stage of the modulational instability can be described by analytical formulations such as breather solutions the akhmediev breather solution that is periodic in space and characterized by an amplification factor ranging from 1 to 3 was produced unconsciously in laboratories e g yuen and lake 1980 the kuznetsov ma breather solution that is periodic in time and decreases exponentially in space was also produced in tank e g osborne 2010 recently chabchoub et al 2011 successfully performed peregrine breather solution for water waves in a wave tank for the first time which has the peculiarity of appearing only once in space and time shemer and alperovich 2013 carried out the similar experiment but found a much larger amplification of extreme wave crest with a longer evolutional distance besides chabchoub et al 2012 observed a super rogue wave with amplitude up to 5 times the background value in a water wave tank making a significant impact on the study of extreme waves recalling that the standard modulational instability concerns the instability of a monochromatic wave to long wave perturbations a number of questions appear naturally considering that ocean waves are far from being monochromatic and characterized by a finite spectral width recently chabchoub 2016 conducted another extensive experimental study confirming that extreme localizations in an irregular background wave field can be originally tracked back to the exact nls nonlinear schrödinger equation breather solutions such as peregrine breather in the more realistic sea state characterized by unidirectional jonswap wave spectrum onorato et al 2004 experimentally confirmed the fact that large amplitude unidirectional waves in random sea states may result from the nonlinear wave focusing and verified the correspondence of the benjamin feir index to the extreme wave statistics unidirectional random waves with an initial gaussian spectrum were produced by shemer and sergeeva 2009 in a 300 m long wave tank interestingly the initial narrow gaussian spectrum becomes wider at the early stages of the evolution and then narrower again their extensive experiments shemer et al 2010 demonstrates that the width and shape of initial spectrum can strongly affect the formation of extreme waves regarding directional waves stansberg 1994 reported that nonlinear four wave interaction may lead to a larger increase of extreme waves in narrow banded long crested waves while observations in short crested waves show very little influence of these space dependent modulational effects using directional jonswap wave spectrum onorato et al 2009 and waseda et al 2009 revealed that in wave tank experiments the occurrence of extreme waves is significantly reduced when the directionality broadens for the special case of crossing sea states toffoli et al 2011 demonstrated that the number of extreme events depends on the angle between the two interacting systems with regard to the effect of an opposing current in directional sea states it has been experimentally investigated by onorato et al 2011 and systematically reviewed by toffoli 2016 concurrent with this line of laboratory investigation is the numerical simulation performed with different mathematical models with a spectral method zakharov 1968 first derived the nls equation for water waves which is a third order nonlinear model being able to represent modulational instability nls equation is adequate for a qualitative description of certain global properties of the envelope evolution such as a local exponential growth in the amplitude of a wave train but is incapable of capturing more subtle features like the emerging front tail asymmetry besides nls equation cannot represent the spectral downshifting at scale of the benjamin feir index as well in order to enlarge its range of validity dysthe 1979 extended the nls equation correctly by adding the higher order nonlinear terms mnls this new model can be further generalized by relaxing the constraint on the bandwidth bmnls or introducing a pseudo differential operator to include the exact linear dispersion emnls to be convenient for comparison with laboratory observation lo and mei 1985 first reversed time and coordinate in this envelope equation and obtained the spatial version of dysthe model as reviewed by trulsen 2006 these higher order nonlinear schrödinger equations can be expressed in terms of the surface displacement or the velocity potential the choice of which will lead to qualitatively different equations with remarkably different properties a more general model for fully linear dispersive and weakly nonlinear waves is zakharov equation zakharov 1968 which can give more accurate expression for nonlinear dispersive effects taking into account the fourth and fifth order of nonlinear effects in the truncated hamiltonian krasitskii 1994 derived the five wave reduced zakharov equation while it is still the most sophisticated approximate model for the spatio temporal evolution of water waves by extending the mode coupling idea west et al 1987 and dommermuth and yue 1987 independently proposed a more direct numerical approach for surface gravity waves referred to the higher order spectral method hos which can account for the nonlinear interaction up to any specific order m in wave steepness ε this method has been proved to be an accurate and computationally efficient numerical tool and some modified versions of hos method have been developed in the past decades based on the nonstationary conformal mapping method chalikov and sheinin 1996 rewrote the primitive equations of potential hydrodynamics in a new coordinate system such that they could be solved with a straightforward numerical method essentially cs chalikov sheinin model is valid up to the moment when an overturning volume of water touches the surface and only limited to 2d waves for 3d waves chalikov et al 2014 also developed a simple and exact numerical scheme that could be applied to the long term multi mode wave field evolution in the deep ocean in fact a lot of highly or fully nonlinear models which can not be listed exhaustively herein are developed in the past decades to study various complex wave phenomena as reviewed by tsai and yue 1996 and dias and kharif 1999 the common drawback of the existing fully nonlinear methods is that the computational schemes are slow motivated by seeking a fast laplace equation solver clamond and grue 2001 developed a novel rapid method by means of integral equations while its computational efficiency was only validated by relatively simple wave fields although navier stokes equation or large eddy simulation equation requires large computational resources some issues such as two phase flow and wave breaking beyond the scope of potential theory have to be researched with such kind of models for example iafrati et al 2013 investigated the dynamics of the modulational instability of free surface waves and its contribution to the interaction between ocean and atmosphere and perić et al 2015 studied the peregrine breather dynamics up to the initial stages of wave breaking in the past most reviews are given from a mathematical or physical point of view in an attempt to summarize various mechanisms that may induce the formation of extreme waves this paper from the perspective of practical application reviews the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing along with a purpose to facilitate various model tests related to extreme waves in ocean engineering besides the irreversible energy transfer in this process is clearly revealed by reanalysing some statistical distributions associated with extreme waves this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves are reviewed in detail with the help of laboratory experiments conducted in marintek section 3 briefly summarizes four typical phase resolving deterministic wave models in the frame of potential theory and gives some comments on the features of these wave models in numerical study of extreme waves finally in section 4 conclusions are drawn and problems to be solved in the future are discussed 2 evolutionary properties of extreme waves observed in laboratory experiments to better review the spatial variations of characteristics of extreme waves and clearly indicate how different nonlinear effects work together on the whole evolutionary process two different types of experiments identified by the initial benjamin feir index are systemically reanalysed in this section in the aspects of spectral and statistical properties the main parameters of these experiments which are characterized by jonswap wave spectrum are listed in table 1 detailed description about experimental setup can be found in the original works onorato et al 2009 toffoli 2016 and thus is omitted here for brevity moreover to consider the influence of directional spreading effect five different values of the spreading coefficient n see fig 1 have been used to model the energy distribution in the directional domain note that janssen and bidlot 2009 proposed a new definition for bfi which could include the information of directional spreading but the original one proposed by onorato et al 2001 is still used in this paper in order to clearly demonstrate the influence of directionality on the evolutionary process of extreme waves 2 1 wave spectrum wave spectrum can show the distribution of wave energy among different wave frequencies or wavelengths and thus it should be able to provide an indication on the formation of extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing however for unidirectional waves after analysing some laboratory experiments conducted in different wave tanks it is found that the wave spectrum does not always present very prominent variation in this process except for the slightly decreased slope of equilibrium range e g fedele et al 2010 nevertheless it does not mean that the energy exchange does not happen in the nonlinear focusing process it is just not easy to be visible in the sea state characterized by a continuous broad wave spectrum e g in the case of γ 3 this argument can be substantiated by observing the evolution of various breather solutions such as peregrine or kuznetsov ma breather of which the major wave components are identified easily and clearly the amplitude of their carrier wave decreases sharply with apparent energy exchange among different wave components when the modulational instability is trigged chabchoub et al 2012 2017 shemer and alperovich 2013 zhang et al 2017b in fig 2 the spectrum in case a bfi 0 70 and case b bfi 1 10 exhibits the similar evolutionary tendency in the presence of the same directional spreading coefficient n the downshift of peak frequency and the decrease of slope of equilibrium range are both detected with various degrees mainly depending on the directional spreading effect however the mechanisms involved may be quite different as revealed in the previous research e g trulsen and dysthe 1997 dias and kharif 1999 such kind of spectral variations can be attributed to a lot of factors for example nonlinear dynamics of free waves wave breaking and dissipation as well as oblique sideband perturbation in directional sea state moreover it has to be mentioned that in two dimensions without any dissipative effects added there is no permanent frequency downshift while the situation will be different in three dimensions besides another interesting phenomenon is that as the directional spreading effect increases the bound wave components e g 2ω p at the location of x l 0 3 1 gradually decrease in fig 3 three examples of cases a and b are given to illustrate the evolutionary tendency of directional spreading of wave energy the obvious broadening trend along the basin will decrease the chance of concentrating wave energy into a small area and consequently suppress the formation of rogue waves 2 2 higher order statistics coefficient of skewness λ 30 can indicate the vertical asymmetry of wave profile even in the frame of third order wave theory it is still mainly provoked by bound wave effects as shown in the first column of fig 4 the coefficient of skewness presents a slightly decreasing trend along the wave basin which actually is observed in all cases it is mainly due to the decreased amplitude of bound waves which can be inferred from the reduced level on the right tail of frequency spectrum moreover the contingent downshift of peak frequency can further reduce the wave steepness as a consequence the bound wave effects are weakened reducing the vertical asymmetry of wave profile based on gram charlier series approximation tayfun and fedele 2007 proposed the third order nonlinear gc model for long crested waves which will be consistent with mer model of mori and janssen 2006 if λ λ app 8λ 40 3 where λ λ 40 2λ 22 λ 04 and λ ij represents the fourth order normalized joint cumulants according to the past research of 2d extreme waves from different laboratory experiments and numerical simulations performed with various wave models λ λ app only holds in the absence of vertical asymmetry more often than not λ will be smaller than λ app this is contrary to the conclusion obtained from the second order wave theory where λ 40 3λ 22 λ 04 tayfun and fedele 2007 in the first column of fig 4 it shows that λ 40 λ 04 3λ 22 and their difference will be enlarged as the vertical asymmetry of wave profile increases to a certain degree it is consistent with the theory developed by janssen and bidlot 2009 who pointed out the total λ 40 consists of the sum of the dynamics contribution and the wave shape contribution therefore for long crested nonlinear waves the relationship among fourth order joint cumulants has to be discussed in the context of both second order and third order nonlinear wave theories however if the directional spreading effect is considered these fourth order cumulants for example the coefficient of kurtosis presented in the second column of fig 4 will be dramatically changed while the third order cumulants such as the coefficient of skewness only show little variation with the directional spreading coefficient n actually in the sea state with large initial bfi and n the whole wave field in the basin is inhomogeneous and its fourth order statistics vary largely along the basin consequently it will be very difficult to establish the relationship between coefficients of kurtosis and skewness see the third column of fig 4 in other words it seems those quadratic functions guedes soares et al 2003 mori and janssen 2006 can fit the experimental results reasonably well only if the nonlinear wave focusing is mostly quenched by the directional spreading effect 2 3 probabilities at critical evolutionary stages since the coefficient of kurtosis λ 40 can work as an index on the formation of extreme waves janssen and onorato 2007 janssen and bidlot 2009 fedele 2015 according to its variation tendency in space the evolutionary process of 2d extreme waves in the experiments can be roughly divided into four phases the initial intermediate peak and stable stages note that the phase should be evaluated with the relative distance from the wave maker in terms of l 0 which represents the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the spectrum at the first probe in the upper panels of fig 5 and fig 6 the statistical distributions at the locations of 3 1l 0 15 9l 0 and 28 7l 0 can show the characteristics of extreme waves at the initial intermediate and peak stages while in the lower panels the same locations represent initial peak and stable stages as a result of faster evolutionary rate induced by the stronger nonlinear four wave interaction take the first case of bfi 0 70 as an example upper panels in fig 5 at the initial stage 3 1l 0 only the bound wave effects fully work on the evolutionary process and thus the waves immediately become skewed with higher more peaked crests and shallower more rounded troughs however for narrow banded waves nonlinearity up to the second order modifies crests and trough in the same way with almost equal magnitude resulting in little variation on crest to trough height all these conclusions can be verified by comparing the laboratory observations with the corresponding linear rayleigh distributions as nonlinear wave focusing begins to dominate the evolutionary process 15 9l 0 and 28 7l 0 a significant increase can be detected on the tails of all exceedance distributions including crest trough and height comparing the variations of exceedance distributions at the three successive stages two notable bifurcations can be detected in sequence particularly pronounced for wave height hence it can be deduced that wave energy is gradually transferred to a few waves to ultimately form extreme waves at the peak stage besides it seems that free wave modes and bound wave modes present a synergistic effect on wave crest while a neutralizing effect on wave trough the similar variation can be observed in the case of bfi 1 10 lower panels in fig 5 moreover at the stable stage 28 7l 0 wave energy of some extreme waves begins to retransfer back to the other waves mainly revealed by the apparently decreased amplitude of wave crests comparison between blue circles and red stars interestingly no significant variation can be detected on wave trough at the stable stage hence the decreased exceedance probability of wave height is mainly due to the change of crests of extreme waves nevertheless the extreme wave is still possible to appear at this stage but the probability becomes a bit lower now in addition it can be argued that wave crest is more sensitive to the dynamics of free waves than wave trough to further understand the mechanism of nonlinear wave focusing in the unidirectional sea state variations of joint distribution of wave height and wave period at critical stages janssen 2014 are presented in fig 6 where the thoretical longuet higgins joint distribution is also plotted black solid contours which varies little in the whole evolutionary process due to the limited change in wave spectral width zhang and guedes soares 2016 apparently the quasi resonant four wave interaction mainly modifies wave heights the largest r gradually increased which occurs among free waves around peak frequency the largest r almost corresponding to peak t and has insignificant influence on maximal wavelength little change on the largest t more specifically as the nonlinear wave focusing begins to dominate the evolutionary process see the upper panels of fig 6 the domain around peak density e g purple contour zone of joint distribution will become larger and larger meaning wave energy is accumulated to some specific waves around peak frequency to prepare for the formation of extreme waves in the lower panels of fig 6 it is very evident that before the peak stage 15 9l 0 the location of peak density of joint distribution is moving towards the bottom right corner since the energy evaluated by the zeroth order spectral moment is almost conserved it can be deduced that part of wave energy around this area is gradually transferred away to generate some larger waves including a few extreme waves at the stable stage 28 7l 0 it almost stops moving while the domain surrounding peak density i e blue and purple contour zones is still enlarged consequently it can be further inferred that the wave energy released mainly through reducing the magnitude of large wave crests see the corresponding panel in fig 5 is redistributed to the waves in this area rather than the original waves if comparing with the shape of joint distribution at the initial stage 3 1l 0 for directional waves especially in the case with a broad directional distribution e g n 24 it makes no sense to discuss the evolutionary stages considering that the dynamics of free waves no longer provides a significant contribution to the statistical properties of extreme waves strictly speaking the crest and trough of directional waves are also very difficult to be accurately determined from the recorded time series at one single point not to mention the height and period dysthe et al 2008 therefore in fig 7 only surface elevations are analyzed for directional waves to a certain degree they can implicitly indicate the probability of observing extreme waves in the basin apparently for large directional spreading e g n 100 the probability density function of surface elevations in the whole basin is fitted very well by tayfun distribution regardless of the initial bfi therefore the probability of observing extreme waves in these cases can be predicted by the second order theory however as waves become long crested the maximum of the scaled surface elevation grows quickly with n particularly pronounced in the case with smaller initial benjamin feir index note that in the third column of fig 7 all dimensional quantities in case b blue squares are actually larger than those in case a red circles the appearance of extreme waves can be underpredicted by about one order of magnitude in the frame of second order wave theory 3 numerical models applicable to the study of extreme waves in most cases neither is the laboratory test cheap nor is the facility available for each researcher therefore numerical simulation has become a feasible and efficient way to study extreme waves moreover for directional waves numerical simulation can overcome the shortcoming of single point measurement in realistic wave field apart from various numerical wave tanks there are also many different phase resolving deterministic models that have been utilized to explore the characteristics of extreme waves based on monte carlo simulations it means that the initial free surface elevation η 0 t or η x 0 is synthesized by the following random process 1 η x t n 1 n c n cos k n x ω n t θ n where θ n is a uniformly distributed random number in the interval 0 2π and c n 2 s ω n ln u n δ ω n with u n being another independent random number uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 to produce random amplitude c n s ω n represents the corresponding wave spectrum and ln u n is the natural logarithm function generally speaking each phase resolving deterministic model has their own advantages and disadvantages in numerical study of extreme waves in random sea states to make this point clear four typical wave models such as nls dysthe hos and cs models will be discussed briefly in this section 3 1 mathematical formulation considering the irrotational motion of a fluid that is homogeneous inviscid and incompressible under a free surface in infinite depth the flow can be described by a velocity potential ϕ that satisfies laplace s equation within the domain the governing equation and its boundary conditions are 2 2 ϕ x z t 0 z η x t 3 η t h ϕ h η ϕ z 0 z η x t 4 ϕ t g z 1 2 ϕ 2 0 z η x t 5 ϕ z 0 z where η x t is the free surface displacement and the origin of the vertical coordinate z is located at the mean free surface h x y denotes the horizontal gradient and the atmospheric pressure at the free surface is assumed to be zero due to the variation of free surface boundary conditions straightforward numerical integration of this system is computationally inefficient and thus numerical technique has to be introduced to address this issue for example pseudospectral method e g west et al 1987 dommermuth and yue 1987 evaluates the velocity potential at the free surface in term of ψ x t ϕ x η x t t and thus the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions hos method can be rewritten as 6 η t h ψ h η w 1 h η 2 0 7 ψ t g η 1 2 h ψ 2 1 2 w 2 1 h η 2 0 where w x t denotes the vertical velocity at the free surface 8 w ϕ z z η x t the similar form of kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions expressed in eqs 6 and 7 can also be derived if introducing the nonstationary surface following nonorthogonal coordinate system while the laplace equation has to be changed chalikov et al 2014 for 2d surface waves the conformal mapping method can be applied chalikov and sheinin 1996 and the kinematic and dynamic boundary equations can be transformed to the new ξ ς coordinate cs model without any approximation as below 9 z τ x ξ ζ t z ξ ξ t 10 φ τ ξ t φ ξ 1 2 j 1 φ ξ 2 φ ζ 2 z where j is the jacobian of the transformation and φ φ ζ 0 τ represents time in the new coordinate system in principle both hos method and cs model try to represent the variable free surface boundary conditions in a deterministic way with respect to hos method taylor expanding each variable around z 0 and collecting terms at each order can reduce the original single dirichlet problem in a region with complicated boundary shape given by z η x t to a series of m e g m 3 or 4 frequently used in hos method dirichlet problems in a region with a simple boundary shape given by z 0 in cs model the same aim is achieved by transforming the free surface z η in physical plane to ζ 0 in mapping plane moreover if the waves are characterized by a narrow banded spectrum centred at frequency ω 0 the velocity potential ϕ and surface displacement η of the wave field can be expanded in harmonic expansions dysthe 1979 employing perturbation expansion and solving those boundary value problems sequentially up to fourth order in wave steepness dysthe equation mnls can be derived 11 a x i k 0 ω 0 2 2 a t 2 i k 0 3 a 2 a i 1 2 k 0 2 a y 2 8 k 0 3 ω 0 a 2 a t 2 k 0 3 ω 0 a 2 a t 1 k 0 ω 0 3 a t y 2 i 4 k 0 3 ω 0 2 a ϕ t z 0 0 where k 0 ω 0 2 g and the induced mean flow potential ϕ is governed by 12 2 z 2 2 y 2 4 k 0 2 ω 0 2 2 t 2 ϕ 0 z 0 ϕ z k 0 a 2 t z 0 ϕ z 0 z a is the complex wave envelope related to the surface elevation η as follows 13 η k 0 ω 0 2 ϕ t re a exp i k 0 x ω 0 t k 0 2 a 2 i k 0 ω 0 a a t exp 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t 3 k 0 2 8 a 3 exp 3 i k 0 x ω 0 t furthermore by truncating the nonlinear part to retain only the leading cubic nonlinear term the standard nonlinear schrödinger equation can be straightforwardly reconstructed 14 a x i k 0 ω 0 2 2 a t 2 i 1 2 k 0 2 a y 2 i k 0 3 a 2 a 0 15 η re a exp i k 0 x ω 0 t k 0 2 a 2 exp 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t note that both dysthe and nls equations given above are spatial versions of formulations written in a frame moving at the linear group velocity these equations can be easily inverted with respect to space and time to yield the corresponding temporal versions of formulations 3 2 comments on four phase resolving deterministic models the 2d cubic nls equation is an integrable system and thus has many analytical solutions for example the family of breather solutions which can be considered as the prototypes of extreme waves and have been used to research the related dynamical and physical properties dysthe and trulsen 1999 henderson et al 1999 osborne et al 2000 kharif et al 2001 onorato et al 2001 moreover nls equation together with dysthe mnls equation has another special characteristic that can separate the dynamics of free waves from bound wave effects one example is given in fig 8 where comparison of freedyn with dysthe clearly depict how much contribution the quasi resonant four wave interaction has made in the formation of extreme waves a direct connection between the deviations from normal statistics and the third order nonlinearity has been proved by janssen 2003 besides comparative analysis on nls and dysthe models can explicitly demonstrate the function of each fourth order nonlinear term in such kind of energy focusing process zhang et al 2014 up to now most laboratory records are still about the temporal variation of the free surface elevation thus only the simulations performed by those spatial versions of nls type models can make a direct comparison with the experimental data slunyaev et al 2005 fedele et al 2010 normally if the nonlinearity is not very strong in the wave series the temporal versions of nls type models will give the same result as the spatial versions within their range of validity toffoli et al 2010 otherwise temporal versions will tend to present some larger values in the peak evolutionary stage zhang et al 2016b anyway these nls type models are able to catch the evolutionary properties of extreme waves reasonably well apparently compared with hos and cs models nls type governing equations ignore the higher order nonlinear terms which may have some impact on the accuracy of numerical simulations of extreme waves goullet and choi 2011 zhang et al 2016a as shown in fig 9 these ignored higher order nonlinear effects only significantly increase the intermediate part i e 10 3 10 1 of exceedance probability of wave crest in a few cases with large initial bfi and n while always have little influence on the exceedance probability of wave trough in all cases it means that for extreme waves these higher order nonlinear terms mainly modify some subtle features without significantly changing their heights therefore if just for a rough estimation of extreme waves nls type models will be enough due to their computational efficiency nls type models are favoured for a large number of random numerical simulations based on monte carlo method however it has to be pointed out that nls type models are only appropriate for narrow banded waves while hos and cs models have no constraint on spectral width bitner gregersen and gramstad 2015 interestingly enough some research also suggests that the modified dysthe equation bmnls can provide a similar result to hos method even for broad directional distributions in good quantitative agreement with laboratory observation e g toffoli et al 2010 normally more accurate models are capable of catching more subtle features of extreme waves but they are more prone to numerical instability in the presence of strong nonlinearity as a result of spurious energy accumulation therefore some numerical techniques such as simply adding dissipation terms have to be used to address the large wave number or high frequency components in addition the initial condition in nls type models can be simply synthesized by free surface elevation or wave spectrum with a hilbert transform for hos and cs models the initial condition involves the velocity potential that is linked to the free surface elevation in the context of linear wave theory thus an adjustment procedure has to be developed carefully when simulating nonlinear dispersive progressive waves otherwise the rate of energy exchange among free waves will be too fast and energy tends to pile up near harmonics of the primary waves leading to wave breaking dommermuth 2000 in principle hos method and cs model are two different numerical algorithms to solve the same euler equations and they could achieve the same accuracy under most circumstances if the order of m in hos method is large enough as shown in fig 10 within a short distance the evolutionary tendency captured by both models is in good agreement with the laboratory observation although a little discrepancy can be detected zhang et al 2017a nevertheless it has to be pointed out that the difference will be enlarged in the long term evolutionary process chalikov et al 2014 in addition conformal mapping in cs model limited to unidirectional waves is capable of reproducing wave overturning that is multi valued function of the horizontal coordinate while hos method will stop running much earlier in this case even for the same numerical algorithm e g hos method addressing dealiasing carefully can significantly improve the convergence property and extend its range of application bonnefoy et al 2010 toffoli et al 2008 ducrozet et al 2007 2016 considering that hos and cs models normally simulate the temporal evolution of free surface elevation direct comparison with laboratory observation is impossible however with the help of wave group velocity slunyaev et al 2014 which is normally assumed to be linear and apparently inaccurate in most nonlinear cases outputting time series of free surface elevation at a specific spatial point is still feasible nevertheless a phase error has to be corrected to various degrees mainly depending on the property of phase resolving deterministic model as well as the distance from the wave maker and the initial condition it has to be stressed that all these four models discussed above are developed in the frame of potential theory wave breaking such as white capping cannot be directly simulated but its effect can be parameterized with some simple methods e g chalikov and sheinin 2005 thus although multiple breaking events may occur in the evolutionary process numerical simulation performed by these models is still possible zhang et al 2017b finally for the purpose of being clear the above comments are briefly summarized in table 2 where y and n represent yes and no and increasing means the corresponding feature increases from left to right 4 conclusions and problems to be solved in order to uncover the secret veil of nonlinear wave focusing in random sea states the spatial evolutionary properties of extreme waves observed in the wave basin are systematically reviewed mainly from a statistical point of view the nonlinear focusing process can redistribute wave energy among different wave components however it is not easy to be identified in reality because the other reasons such as wave breaking dissipation and oblique sideband perturbation can also result in the similar variation on wave spectrum nevertheless based on some hypotheses it is still possible to predict extreme waves according to the change in wave spectrum janssen 2003 alternatively as indicated in this paper there seems to be another feasible method to reveal the irreversible energy transfer in the evolutionary process that is to analyse the variations of exceedance distributions of wave amplitudes and crest to trough height as well as joint distribution of wave height and wave period the final shape of extreme waves is determined by different kinds of nonlinear effects if the directional distribution is very broad bound wave effects will be the only nonlinearity that dominates the evolutionary process if the waves are long crested or unidirectional the resonant or quasi resonant four wave interaction can be trigged under certain circumstances at this moment both types of nonlinearity coexist while their effects are not always consistent for instance they produce a synergistic effect on wave crest but a neutralizing effect on wave trough as a result for extreme wave the height of water wall is more likely to be larger than the depth of deep hole although various phase resolving deterministic models have been intensively developed in the past decades to explore the mechanisms and features of extreme waves each physical model has their own peculiarities showing different advantages and disadvantages in the numerical study for example nls type models are favoured for a large amount of random numerical simulations while hos and cs models are able to catch some more subtle characteristics of extreme waves all numerical results are very sensitive to the model parameters such as the shape of initial wave spectrum the various corrections of the weakly nonlinear evolution models and the accuracy of numerical schemes it has to be admitted that most conclusions drawn above are limited to the mechanically generated deepwater extreme waves characterized by jonswap wave spectrum apparently decreasing water depth can slow the nonlinear wave focusing process and even change the evolutionary mechanism nevertheless nonlinearity induced by wave shoaling is still able to generate extreme waves appropriate oblique perturbation is also capable of triggering and sustaining modulational instability in finite water depth toffoli et al 2013 fernandez et al 2016 until now there are still a lot of challenges in the research of 3d extreme waves especially in the realistic wave field the first challenge is how to define wave height in three dimensional space no consensus has been reached on this issue although records on rogue waves in the open sea have been published all these measurements are mainly from one single point how to measure the complex 3d surface elevations accurately with limited instruments in the inhomogeneous wave field is still a big problem to be solved tank experiments are of vital importance for scientific community while their controlled circumstances might not correctly reveal the randomness of extreme waves in the ocean moreover due to the complex external factors in reality to explain the formation of deepwater extreme waves with the nonlinear wave focusing is still controversial fedele et al 2016 in addition the horseshoe or crescent shaped patterns are quite commonly observed on the sea surface under the effect of wind this kind of 3d structure may involve class i and class ii instabilities so far there are only a few experimental and theoretical studies on their formation and persistence so far the cumulative error cannot be avoided in phase resolving deterministic wave models and it will become significant in the long term evolutionary process and thus lead to some errors particularly pronounced in the case with strong nonlinearity although the accuracy of phase resolving deterministic model has been gradually improved in the past it is still difficult to exactly capture what happens to those extreme waves in the open sea due to the ignored or simplified external factors such as wind besides periodicity is also applied in order to use fft algorithm in numerical computation but apparently incorrect in reality finally progress on the investigation of extreme waves in realistic wave field is expected to come from a combination of more reliable

22665,in this paper a review is given on the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing to be more close to the realistic sea states not only unidirectional waves but also directional waves characterized by different directional spreading effects are considered herein particular attention is paid to the variation of characteristics of 2d extreme waves because their corresponding evolutionary tendency can be clearly divided into several critical stages and associated energy exchange in this process can be discussed from a statistical point of view moreover four typical phase resolving deterministic models that can account for the third order nonlinear mechanism are briefly commented based on their features in stochastic analysis of extreme waves with monte carlo simulations keywords bound wave effect extreme waves laboratory experiment nonlinear wave focusing phase resolving deterministic models 1 introduction with more frequently appeared extreme weather due to global warming and more rapid exploration and exploitation in the ocean by human being the chance to encounter an extreme wave is very high today the destructive power of extreme waves is truly awesome and sometimes it can cause damage to the floating body in the ocean leading to serious loss of life and property or even to local pollution and environmental risk kharif and pelinovsky 2003 toffoli et al 2005 bitner gregersen and toffoli 2014 in addition to indicating the large amplitude that is normally identified by crest to trough height exceeding 2 times the surrounding significant wave height the term extreme waves is also used to specify the tail of some typical statistical distribution of wave heights meaning its appearance is rare but more often than would be expected from the traditional probability theory although the extreme waves had been part of marine folklore for centuries oceanographers did not believe them until the 70s of last century intensive research has been motivated by the published record of new year wave which is an extreme event that is measured by the laser based wave sensor on the draupner e platform in the central north sea on january 1st 1995 during the last 40 years a lot of progress has been made on understanding the physical mechanisms of extreme waves under many circumstances the rogue or extreme waves can be generated and the mechanisms involved are various which may be eventually traced back to the following three types geometrical focusing dispersive focusing and nonlinear focusing dysthe et al 2008 some reviews on the physical mechanisms of the extreme wave phenomenon have been made in the past from a popular and physically general point of view slunyaev et al 2011 simply described the extreme waves appeared in deepwater shallow water and coastal areas emphasizing the difference between water wave physics at these locations to understand these complex linear and nonlinear mechanisms one can seek for the professional and comprehensive review of kharif and pelinovsky 2003 rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and have been observed in a variety of different contexts the associated review has been made by onorato et al 2013 who conducted a detailed discussion on rogue waves appeared in water and in optics the universal mechanism that may be used to explain these rogue waves is modulational instability after reviewing some early instructive works in different physical situations developed independently in the 1960s and early 1970s zakharov and ostrovsky 2009 pointed out that various methods had been used to treat modulational instability which might be formally different but essentially led to the same mathematical and physical results restricting to surface waves in the open sea the mechanism of formation of extreme waves is more complex because wind forcing wave breaking wave current interactions and the tridimensionality of wave field cannot be neglected as summarized by dysthe et al 2008 there is no generally accepted explanation or theory so far for the occurrence of such true rogue waves however some attempts to forecast extreme waves in a deterministic or a statistical fashion have been made such as the warning system developed by ecmwf based on wave spectral evolution janssen and bidlot 2009 recently some new perspectives on the formation of extreme waves were proposed by onorato and suret 2016 who believed that the external factors can set the spectrum out of local equilibrium and that the induced nonlinearity in some cases can lead to strong deviations from gaussian statistics and eventually to rogue waves nevertheless modulational instability or benjamin feir instability bfi has been receiving a lot of attention up to now it is the only nonlinear mechanism that seems to be capable of catching the main features of rogue waves in the deep sea kharif et al 2009 since the landmark discovery of modulational instability of weakly nonlinear deepwater wave trains by lighthill 1965 and benjamin and feir 1967 research associated with nonlinear deepwater waves has entered a new era the nonlinear stage of the modulational instability can be described by analytical formulations such as breather solutions the akhmediev breather solution that is periodic in space and characterized by an amplification factor ranging from 1 to 3 was produced unconsciously in laboratories e g yuen and lake 1980 the kuznetsov ma breather solution that is periodic in time and decreases exponentially in space was also produced in tank e g osborne 2010 recently chabchoub et al 2011 successfully performed peregrine breather solution for water waves in a wave tank for the first time which has the peculiarity of appearing only once in space and time shemer and alperovich 2013 carried out the similar experiment but found a much larger amplification of extreme wave crest with a longer evolutional distance besides chabchoub et al 2012 observed a super rogue wave with amplitude up to 5 times the background value in a water wave tank making a significant impact on the study of extreme waves recalling that the standard modulational instability concerns the instability of a monochromatic wave to long wave perturbations a number of questions appear naturally considering that ocean waves are far from being monochromatic and characterized by a finite spectral width recently chabchoub 2016 conducted another extensive experimental study confirming that extreme localizations in an irregular background wave field can be originally tracked back to the exact nls nonlinear schrödinger equation breather solutions such as peregrine breather in the more realistic sea state characterized by unidirectional jonswap wave spectrum onorato et al 2004 experimentally confirmed the fact that large amplitude unidirectional waves in random sea states may result from the nonlinear wave focusing and verified the correspondence of the benjamin feir index to the extreme wave statistics unidirectional random waves with an initial gaussian spectrum were produced by shemer and sergeeva 2009 in a 300 m long wave tank interestingly the initial narrow gaussian spectrum becomes wider at the early stages of the evolution and then narrower again their extensive experiments shemer et al 2010 demonstrates that the width and shape of initial spectrum can strongly affect the formation of extreme waves regarding directional waves stansberg 1994 reported that nonlinear four wave interaction may lead to a larger increase of extreme waves in narrow banded long crested waves while observations in short crested waves show very little influence of these space dependent modulational effects using directional jonswap wave spectrum onorato et al 2009 and waseda et al 2009 revealed that in wave tank experiments the occurrence of extreme waves is significantly reduced when the directionality broadens for the special case of crossing sea states toffoli et al 2011 demonstrated that the number of extreme events depends on the angle between the two interacting systems with regard to the effect of an opposing current in directional sea states it has been experimentally investigated by onorato et al 2011 and systematically reviewed by toffoli 2016 concurrent with this line of laboratory investigation is the numerical simulation performed with different mathematical models with a spectral method zakharov 1968 first derived the nls equation for water waves which is a third order nonlinear model being able to represent modulational instability nls equation is adequate for a qualitative description of certain global properties of the envelope evolution such as a local exponential growth in the amplitude of a wave train but is incapable of capturing more subtle features like the emerging front tail asymmetry besides nls equation cannot represent the spectral downshifting at scale of the benjamin feir index as well in order to enlarge its range of validity dysthe 1979 extended the nls equation correctly by adding the higher order nonlinear terms mnls this new model can be further generalized by relaxing the constraint on the bandwidth bmnls or introducing a pseudo differential operator to include the exact linear dispersion emnls to be convenient for comparison with laboratory observation lo and mei 1985 first reversed time and coordinate in this envelope equation and obtained the spatial version of dysthe model as reviewed by trulsen 2006 these higher order nonlinear schrödinger equations can be expressed in terms of the surface displacement or the velocity potential the choice of which will lead to qualitatively different equations with remarkably different properties a more general model for fully linear dispersive and weakly nonlinear waves is zakharov equation zakharov 1968 which can give more accurate expression for nonlinear dispersive effects taking into account the fourth and fifth order of nonlinear effects in the truncated hamiltonian krasitskii 1994 derived the five wave reduced zakharov equation while it is still the most sophisticated approximate model for the spatio temporal evolution of water waves by extending the mode coupling idea west et al 1987 and dommermuth and yue 1987 independently proposed a more direct numerical approach for surface gravity waves referred to the higher order spectral method hos which can account for the nonlinear interaction up to any specific order m in wave steepness ε this method has been proved to be an accurate and computationally efficient numerical tool and some modified versions of hos method have been developed in the past decades based on the nonstationary conformal mapping method chalikov and sheinin 1996 rewrote the primitive equations of potential hydrodynamics in a new coordinate system such that they could be solved with a straightforward numerical method essentially cs chalikov sheinin model is valid up to the moment when an overturning volume of water touches the surface and only limited to 2d waves for 3d waves chalikov et al 2014 also developed a simple and exact numerical scheme that could be applied to the long term multi mode wave field evolution in the deep ocean in fact a lot of highly or fully nonlinear models which can not be listed exhaustively herein are developed in the past decades to study various complex wave phenomena as reviewed by tsai and yue 1996 and dias and kharif 1999 the common drawback of the existing fully nonlinear methods is that the computational schemes are slow motivated by seeking a fast laplace equation solver clamond and grue 2001 developed a novel rapid method by means of integral equations while its computational efficiency was only validated by relatively simple wave fields although navier stokes equation or large eddy simulation equation requires large computational resources some issues such as two phase flow and wave breaking beyond the scope of potential theory have to be researched with such kind of models for example iafrati et al 2013 investigated the dynamics of the modulational instability of free surface waves and its contribution to the interaction between ocean and atmosphere and perić et al 2015 studied the peregrine breather dynamics up to the initial stages of wave breaking in the past most reviews are given from a mathematical or physical point of view in an attempt to summarize various mechanisms that may induce the formation of extreme waves this paper from the perspective of practical application reviews the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing along with a purpose to facilitate various model tests related to extreme waves in ocean engineering besides the irreversible energy transfer in this process is clearly revealed by reanalysing some statistical distributions associated with extreme waves this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the evolutionary properties of mechanically generated extreme waves are reviewed in detail with the help of laboratory experiments conducted in marintek section 3 briefly summarizes four typical phase resolving deterministic wave models in the frame of potential theory and gives some comments on the features of these wave models in numerical study of extreme waves finally in section 4 conclusions are drawn and problems to be solved in the future are discussed 2 evolutionary properties of extreme waves observed in laboratory experiments to better review the spatial variations of characteristics of extreme waves and clearly indicate how different nonlinear effects work together on the whole evolutionary process two different types of experiments identified by the initial benjamin feir index are systemically reanalysed in this section in the aspects of spectral and statistical properties the main parameters of these experiments which are characterized by jonswap wave spectrum are listed in table 1 detailed description about experimental setup can be found in the original works onorato et al 2009 toffoli 2016 and thus is omitted here for brevity moreover to consider the influence of directional spreading effect five different values of the spreading coefficient n see fig 1 have been used to model the energy distribution in the directional domain note that janssen and bidlot 2009 proposed a new definition for bfi which could include the information of directional spreading but the original one proposed by onorato et al 2001 is still used in this paper in order to clearly demonstrate the influence of directionality on the evolutionary process of extreme waves 2 1 wave spectrum wave spectrum can show the distribution of wave energy among different wave frequencies or wavelengths and thus it should be able to provide an indication on the formation of extreme waves induced by nonlinear wave focusing however for unidirectional waves after analysing some laboratory experiments conducted in different wave tanks it is found that the wave spectrum does not always present very prominent variation in this process except for the slightly decreased slope of equilibrium range e g fedele et al 2010 nevertheless it does not mean that the energy exchange does not happen in the nonlinear focusing process it is just not easy to be visible in the sea state characterized by a continuous broad wave spectrum e g in the case of γ 3 this argument can be substantiated by observing the evolution of various breather solutions such as peregrine or kuznetsov ma breather of which the major wave components are identified easily and clearly the amplitude of their carrier wave decreases sharply with apparent energy exchange among different wave components when the modulational instability is trigged chabchoub et al 2012 2017 shemer and alperovich 2013 zhang et al 2017b in fig 2 the spectrum in case a bfi 0 70 and case b bfi 1 10 exhibits the similar evolutionary tendency in the presence of the same directional spreading coefficient n the downshift of peak frequency and the decrease of slope of equilibrium range are both detected with various degrees mainly depending on the directional spreading effect however the mechanisms involved may be quite different as revealed in the previous research e g trulsen and dysthe 1997 dias and kharif 1999 such kind of spectral variations can be attributed to a lot of factors for example nonlinear dynamics of free waves wave breaking and dissipation as well as oblique sideband perturbation in directional sea state moreover it has to be mentioned that in two dimensions without any dissipative effects added there is no permanent frequency downshift while the situation will be different in three dimensions besides another interesting phenomenon is that as the directional spreading effect increases the bound wave components e g 2ω p at the location of x l 0 3 1 gradually decrease in fig 3 three examples of cases a and b are given to illustrate the evolutionary tendency of directional spreading of wave energy the obvious broadening trend along the basin will decrease the chance of concentrating wave energy into a small area and consequently suppress the formation of rogue waves 2 2 higher order statistics coefficient of skewness λ 30 can indicate the vertical asymmetry of wave profile even in the frame of third order wave theory it is still mainly provoked by bound wave effects as shown in the first column of fig 4 the coefficient of skewness presents a slightly decreasing trend along the wave basin which actually is observed in all cases it is mainly due to the decreased amplitude of bound waves which can be inferred from the reduced level on the right tail of frequency spectrum moreover the contingent downshift of peak frequency can further reduce the wave steepness as a consequence the bound wave effects are weakened reducing the vertical asymmetry of wave profile based on gram charlier series approximation tayfun and fedele 2007 proposed the third order nonlinear gc model for long crested waves which will be consistent with mer model of mori and janssen 2006 if λ λ app 8λ 40 3 where λ λ 40 2λ 22 λ 04 and λ ij represents the fourth order normalized joint cumulants according to the past research of 2d extreme waves from different laboratory experiments and numerical simulations performed with various wave models λ λ app only holds in the absence of vertical asymmetry more often than not λ will be smaller than λ app this is contrary to the conclusion obtained from the second order wave theory where λ 40 3λ 22 λ 04 tayfun and fedele 2007 in the first column of fig 4 it shows that λ 40 λ 04 3λ 22 and their difference will be enlarged as the vertical asymmetry of wave profile increases to a certain degree it is consistent with the theory developed by janssen and bidlot 2009 who pointed out the total λ 40 consists of the sum of the dynamics contribution and the wave shape contribution therefore for long crested nonlinear waves the relationship among fourth order joint cumulants has to be discussed in the context of both second order and third order nonlinear wave theories however if the directional spreading effect is considered these fourth order cumulants for example the coefficient of kurtosis presented in the second column of fig 4 will be dramatically changed while the third order cumulants such as the coefficient of skewness only show little variation with the directional spreading coefficient n actually in the sea state with large initial bfi and n the whole wave field in the basin is inhomogeneous and its fourth order statistics vary largely along the basin consequently it will be very difficult to establish the relationship between coefficients of kurtosis and skewness see the third column of fig 4 in other words it seems those quadratic functions guedes soares et al 2003 mori and janssen 2006 can fit the experimental results reasonably well only if the nonlinear wave focusing is mostly quenched by the directional spreading effect 2 3 probabilities at critical evolutionary stages since the coefficient of kurtosis λ 40 can work as an index on the formation of extreme waves janssen and onorato 2007 janssen and bidlot 2009 fedele 2015 according to its variation tendency in space the evolutionary process of 2d extreme waves in the experiments can be roughly divided into four phases the initial intermediate peak and stable stages note that the phase should be evaluated with the relative distance from the wave maker in terms of l 0 which represents the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the spectrum at the first probe in the upper panels of fig 5 and fig 6 the statistical distributions at the locations of 3 1l 0 15 9l 0 and 28 7l 0 can show the characteristics of extreme waves at the initial intermediate and peak stages while in the lower panels the same locations represent initial peak and stable stages as a result of faster evolutionary rate induced by the stronger nonlinear four wave interaction take the first case of bfi 0 70 as an example upper panels in fig 5 at the initial stage 3 1l 0 only the bound wave effects fully work on the evolutionary process and thus the waves immediately become skewed with higher more peaked crests and shallower more rounded troughs however for narrow banded waves nonlinearity up to the second order modifies crests and trough in the same way with almost equal magnitude resulting in little variation on crest to trough height all these conclusions can be verified by comparing the laboratory observations with the corresponding linear rayleigh distributions as nonlinear wave focusing begins to dominate the evolutionary process 15 9l 0 and 28 7l 0 a significant increase can be detected on the tails of all exceedance distributions including crest trough and height comparing the variations of exceedance distributions at the three successive stages two notable bifurcations can be detected in sequence particularly pronounced for wave height hence it can be deduced that wave energy is gradually transferred to a few waves to ultimately form extreme waves at the peak stage besides it seems that free wave modes and bound wave modes present a synergistic effect on wave crest while a neutralizing effect on wave trough the similar variation can be observed in the case of bfi 1 10 lower panels in fig 5 moreover at the stable stage 28 7l 0 wave energy of some extreme waves begins to retransfer back to the other waves mainly revealed by the apparently decreased amplitude of wave crests comparison between blue circles and red stars interestingly no significant variation can be detected on wave trough at the stable stage hence the decreased exceedance probability of wave height is mainly due to the change of crests of extreme waves nevertheless the extreme wave is still possible to appear at this stage but the probability becomes a bit lower now in addition it can be argued that wave crest is more sensitive to the dynamics of free waves than wave trough to further understand the mechanism of nonlinear wave focusing in the unidirectional sea state variations of joint distribution of wave height and wave period at critical stages janssen 2014 are presented in fig 6 where the thoretical longuet higgins joint distribution is also plotted black solid contours which varies little in the whole evolutionary process due to the limited change in wave spectral width zhang and guedes soares 2016 apparently the quasi resonant four wave interaction mainly modifies wave heights the largest r gradually increased which occurs among free waves around peak frequency the largest r almost corresponding to peak t and has insignificant influence on maximal wavelength little change on the largest t more specifically as the nonlinear wave focusing begins to dominate the evolutionary process see the upper panels of fig 6 the domain around peak density e g purple contour zone of joint distribution will become larger and larger meaning wave energy is accumulated to some specific waves around peak frequency to prepare for the formation of extreme waves in the lower panels of fig 6 it is very evident that before the peak stage 15 9l 0 the location of peak density of joint distribution is moving towards the bottom right corner since the energy evaluated by the zeroth order spectral moment is almost conserved it can be deduced that part of wave energy around this area is gradually transferred away to generate some larger waves including a few extreme waves at the stable stage 28 7l 0 it almost stops moving while the domain surrounding peak density i e blue and purple contour zones is still enlarged consequently it can be further inferred that the wave energy released mainly through reducing the magnitude of large wave crests see the corresponding panel in fig 5 is redistributed to the waves in this area rather than the original waves if comparing with the shape of joint distribution at the initial stage 3 1l 0 for directional waves especially in the case with a broad directional distribution e g n 24 it makes no sense to discuss the evolutionary stages considering that the dynamics of free waves no longer provides a significant contribution to the statistical properties of extreme waves strictly speaking the crest and trough of directional waves are also very difficult to be accurately determined from the recorded time series at one single point not to mention the height and period dysthe et al 2008 therefore in fig 7 only surface elevations are analyzed for directional waves to a certain degree they can implicitly indicate the probability of observing extreme waves in the basin apparently for large directional spreading e g n 100 the probability density function of surface elevations in the whole basin is fitted very well by tayfun distribution regardless of the initial bfi therefore the probability of observing extreme waves in these cases can be predicted by the second order theory however as waves become long crested the maximum of the scaled surface elevation grows quickly with n particularly pronounced in the case with smaller initial benjamin feir index note that in the third column of fig 7 all dimensional quantities in case b blue squares are actually larger than those in case a red circles the appearance of extreme waves can be underpredicted by about one order of magnitude in the frame of second order wave theory 3 numerical models applicable to the study of extreme waves in most cases neither is the laboratory test cheap nor is the facility available for each researcher therefore numerical simulation has become a feasible and efficient way to study extreme waves moreover for directional waves numerical simulation can overcome the shortcoming of single point measurement in realistic wave field apart from various numerical wave tanks there are also many different phase resolving deterministic models that have been utilized to explore the characteristics of extreme waves based on monte carlo simulations it means that the initial free surface elevation η 0 t or η x 0 is synthesized by the following random process 1 η x t n 1 n c n cos k n x ω n t θ n where θ n is a uniformly distributed random number in the interval 0 2π and c n 2 s ω n ln u n δ ω n with u n being another independent random number uniformly distributed in the range 0 1 to produce random amplitude c n s ω n represents the corresponding wave spectrum and ln u n is the natural logarithm function generally speaking each phase resolving deterministic model has their own advantages and disadvantages in numerical study of extreme waves in random sea states to make this point clear four typical wave models such as nls dysthe hos and cs models will be discussed briefly in this section 3 1 mathematical formulation considering the irrotational motion of a fluid that is homogeneous inviscid and incompressible under a free surface in infinite depth the flow can be described by a velocity potential ϕ that satisfies laplace s equation within the domain the governing equation and its boundary conditions are 2 2 ϕ x z t 0 z η x t 3 η t h ϕ h η ϕ z 0 z η x t 4 ϕ t g z 1 2 ϕ 2 0 z η x t 5 ϕ z 0 z where η x t is the free surface displacement and the origin of the vertical coordinate z is located at the mean free surface h x y denotes the horizontal gradient and the atmospheric pressure at the free surface is assumed to be zero due to the variation of free surface boundary conditions straightforward numerical integration of this system is computationally inefficient and thus numerical technique has to be introduced to address this issue for example pseudospectral method e g west et al 1987 dommermuth and yue 1987 evaluates the velocity potential at the free surface in term of ψ x t ϕ x η x t t and thus the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions hos method can be rewritten as 6 η t h ψ h η w 1 h η 2 0 7 ψ t g η 1 2 h ψ 2 1 2 w 2 1 h η 2 0 where w x t denotes the vertical velocity at the free surface 8 w ϕ z z η x t the similar form of kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions expressed in eqs 6 and 7 can also be derived if introducing the nonstationary surface following nonorthogonal coordinate system while the laplace equation has to be changed chalikov et al 2014 for 2d surface waves the conformal mapping method can be applied chalikov and sheinin 1996 and the kinematic and dynamic boundary equations can be transformed to the new ξ ς coordinate cs model without any approximation as below 9 z τ x ξ ζ t z ξ ξ t 10 φ τ ξ t φ ξ 1 2 j 1 φ ξ 2 φ ζ 2 z where j is the jacobian of the transformation and φ φ ζ 0 τ represents time in the new coordinate system in principle both hos method and cs model try to represent the variable free surface boundary conditions in a deterministic way with respect to hos method taylor expanding each variable around z 0 and collecting terms at each order can reduce the original single dirichlet problem in a region with complicated boundary shape given by z η x t to a series of m e g m 3 or 4 frequently used in hos method dirichlet problems in a region with a simple boundary shape given by z 0 in cs model the same aim is achieved by transforming the free surface z η in physical plane to ζ 0 in mapping plane moreover if the waves are characterized by a narrow banded spectrum centred at frequency ω 0 the velocity potential ϕ and surface displacement η of the wave field can be expanded in harmonic expansions dysthe 1979 employing perturbation expansion and solving those boundary value problems sequentially up to fourth order in wave steepness dysthe equation mnls can be derived 11 a x i k 0 ω 0 2 2 a t 2 i k 0 3 a 2 a i 1 2 k 0 2 a y 2 8 k 0 3 ω 0 a 2 a t 2 k 0 3 ω 0 a 2 a t 1 k 0 ω 0 3 a t y 2 i 4 k 0 3 ω 0 2 a ϕ t z 0 0 where k 0 ω 0 2 g and the induced mean flow potential ϕ is governed by 12 2 z 2 2 y 2 4 k 0 2 ω 0 2 2 t 2 ϕ 0 z 0 ϕ z k 0 a 2 t z 0 ϕ z 0 z a is the complex wave envelope related to the surface elevation η as follows 13 η k 0 ω 0 2 ϕ t re a exp i k 0 x ω 0 t k 0 2 a 2 i k 0 ω 0 a a t exp 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t 3 k 0 2 8 a 3 exp 3 i k 0 x ω 0 t furthermore by truncating the nonlinear part to retain only the leading cubic nonlinear term the standard nonlinear schrödinger equation can be straightforwardly reconstructed 14 a x i k 0 ω 0 2 2 a t 2 i 1 2 k 0 2 a y 2 i k 0 3 a 2 a 0 15 η re a exp i k 0 x ω 0 t k 0 2 a 2 exp 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t note that both dysthe and nls equations given above are spatial versions of formulations written in a frame moving at the linear group velocity these equations can be easily inverted with respect to space and time to yield the corresponding temporal versions of formulations 3 2 comments on four phase resolving deterministic models the 2d cubic nls equation is an integrable system and thus has many analytical solutions for example the family of breather solutions which can be considered as the prototypes of extreme waves and have been used to research the related dynamical and physical properties dysthe and trulsen 1999 henderson et al 1999 osborne et al 2000 kharif et al 2001 onorato et al 2001 moreover nls equation together with dysthe mnls equation has another special characteristic that can separate the dynamics of free waves from bound wave effects one example is given in fig 8 where comparison of freedyn with dysthe clearly depict how much contribution the quasi resonant four wave interaction has made in the formation of extreme waves a direct connection between the deviations from normal statistics and the third order nonlinearity has been proved by janssen 2003 besides comparative analysis on nls and dysthe models can explicitly demonstrate the function of each fourth order nonlinear term in such kind of energy focusing process zhang et al 2014 up to now most laboratory records are still about the temporal variation of the free surface elevation thus only the simulations performed by those spatial versions of nls type models can make a direct comparison with the experimental data slunyaev et al 2005 fedele et al 2010 normally if the nonlinearity is not very strong in the wave series the temporal versions of nls type models will give the same result as the spatial versions within their range of validity toffoli et al 2010 otherwise temporal versions will tend to present some larger values in the peak evolutionary stage zhang et al 2016b anyway these nls type models are able to catch the evolutionary properties of extreme waves reasonably well apparently compared with hos and cs models nls type governing equations ignore the higher order nonlinear terms which may have some impact on the accuracy of numerical simulations of extreme waves goullet and choi 2011 zhang et al 2016a as shown in fig 9 these ignored higher order nonlinear effects only significantly increase the intermediate part i e 10 3 10 1 of exceedance probability of wave crest in a few cases with large initial bfi and n while always have little influence on the exceedance probability of wave trough in all cases it means that for extreme waves these higher order nonlinear terms mainly modify some subtle features without significantly changing their heights therefore if just for a rough estimation of extreme waves nls type models will be enough due to their computational efficiency nls type models are favoured for a large number of random numerical simulations based on monte carlo method however it has to be pointed out that nls type models are only appropriate for narrow banded waves while hos and cs models have no constraint on spectral width bitner gregersen and gramstad 2015 interestingly enough some research also suggests that the modified dysthe equation bmnls can provide a similar result to hos method even for broad directional distributions in good quantitative agreement with laboratory observation e g toffoli et al 2010 normally more accurate models are capable of catching more subtle features of extreme waves but they are more prone to numerical instability in the presence of strong nonlinearity as a result of spurious energy accumulation therefore some numerical techniques such as simply adding dissipation terms have to be used to address the large wave number or high frequency components in addition the initial condition in nls type models can be simply synthesized by free surface elevation or wave spectrum with a hilbert transform for hos and cs models the initial condition involves the velocity potential that is linked to the free surface elevation in the context of linear wave theory thus an adjustment procedure has to be developed carefully when simulating nonlinear dispersive progressive waves otherwise the rate of energy exchange among free waves will be too fast and energy tends to pile up near harmonics of the primary waves leading to wave breaking dommermuth 2000 in principle hos method and cs model are two different numerical algorithms to solve the same euler equations and they could achieve the same accuracy under most circumstances if the order of m in hos method is large enough as shown in fig 10 within a short distance the evolutionary tendency captured by both models is in good agreement with the laboratory observation although a little discrepancy can be detected zhang et al 2017a nevertheless it has to be pointed out that the difference will be enlarged in the long term evolutionary process chalikov et al 2014 in addition conformal mapping in cs model limited to unidirectional waves is capable of reproducing wave overturning that is multi valued function of the horizontal coordinate while hos method will stop running much earlier in this case even for the same numerical algorithm e g hos method addressing dealiasing carefully can significantly improve the convergence property and extend its range of application bonnefoy et al 2010 toffoli et al 2008 ducrozet et al 2007 2016 considering that hos and cs models normally simulate the temporal evolution of free surface elevation direct comparison with laboratory observation is impossible however with the help of wave group velocity slunyaev et al 2014 which is normally assumed to be linear and apparently inaccurate in most nonlinear cases outputting time series of free surface elevation at a specific spatial point is still feasible nevertheless a phase error has to be corrected to various degrees mainly depending on the property of phase resolving deterministic model as well as the distance from the wave maker and the initial condition it has to be stressed that all these four models discussed above are developed in the frame of potential theory wave breaking such as white capping cannot be directly simulated but its effect can be parameterized with some simple methods e g chalikov and sheinin 2005 thus although multiple breaking events may occur in the evolutionary process numerical simulation performed by these models is still possible zhang et al 2017b finally for the purpose of being clear the above comments are briefly summarized in table 2 where y and n represent yes and no and increasing means the corresponding feature increases from left to right 4 conclusions and problems to be solved in order to uncover the secret veil of nonlinear wave focusing in random sea states the spatial evolutionary properties of extreme waves observed in the wave basin are systematically reviewed mainly from a statistical point of view the nonlinear focusing process can redistribute wave energy among different wave components however it is not easy to be identified in reality because the other reasons such as wave breaking dissipation and oblique sideband perturbation can also result in the similar variation on wave spectrum nevertheless based on some hypotheses it is still possible to predict extreme waves according to the change in wave spectrum janssen 2003 alternatively as indicated in this paper there seems to be another feasible method to reveal the irreversible energy transfer in the evolutionary process that is to analyse the variations of exceedance distributions of wave amplitudes and crest to trough height as well as joint distribution of wave height and wave period the final shape of extreme waves is determined by different kinds of nonlinear effects if the directional distribution is very broad bound wave effects will be the only nonlinearity that dominates the evolutionary process if the waves are long crested or unidirectional the resonant or quasi resonant four wave interaction can be trigged under certain circumstances at this moment both types of nonlinearity coexist while their effects are not always consistent for instance they produce a synergistic effect on wave crest but a neutralizing effect on wave trough as a result for extreme wave the height of water wall is more likely to be larger than the depth of deep hole although various phase resolving deterministic models have been intensively developed in the past decades to explore the mechanisms and features of extreme waves each physical model has their own peculiarities showing different advantages and disadvantages in the numerical study for example nls type models are favoured for a large amount of random numerical simulations while hos and cs models are able to catch some more subtle characteristics of extreme waves all numerical results are very sensitive to the model parameters such as the shape of initial wave spectrum the various corrections of the weakly nonlinear evolution models and the accuracy of numerical schemes it has to be admitted that most conclusions drawn above are limited to the mechanically generated deepwater extreme waves characterized by jonswap wave spectrum apparently decreasing water depth can slow the nonlinear wave focusing process and even change the evolutionary mechanism nevertheless nonlinearity induced by wave shoaling is still able to generate extreme waves appropriate oblique perturbation is also capable of triggering and sustaining modulational instability in finite water depth toffoli et al 2013 fernandez et al 2016 until now there are still a lot of challenges in the research of 3d extreme waves especially in the realistic wave field the first challenge is how to define wave height in three dimensional space no consensus has been reached on this issue although records on rogue waves in the open sea have been published all these measurements are mainly from one single point how to measure the complex 3d surface elevations accurately with limited instruments in the inhomogeneous wave field is still a big problem to be solved tank experiments are of vital importance for scientific community while their controlled circumstances might not correctly reveal the randomness of extreme waves in the ocean moreover due to the complex external factors in reality to explain the formation of deepwater extreme waves with the nonlinear wave focusing is still controversial fedele et al 2016 in addition the horseshoe or crescent shaped patterns are quite commonly observed on the sea surface under the effect of wind this kind of 3d structure may involve class i and class ii instabilities so far there are only a few experimental and theoretical studies on their formation and persistence so far the cumulative error cannot be avoided in phase resolving deterministic wave models and it will become significant in the long term evolutionary process and thus lead to some errors particularly pronounced in the case with strong nonlinearity although the accuracy of phase resolving deterministic model has been gradually improved in the past it is still difficult to exactly capture what happens to those extreme waves in the open sea due to the ignored or simplified external factors such as wind besides periodicity is also applied in order to use fft algorithm in numerical computation but apparently incorrect in reality finally progress on the investigation of extreme waves in realistic wave field is expected to come from a combination of more reliable measurements extensive field observations careful statistical analysis and advanced numerical simulations acknowledgements the first author gratefully acknowledges the financial supports provided by

22666,ocean wave energy is attractive for its large reserves exploitability and low emissions although many wave energy converter wec concepts have been proposed high construction cost hinders the engineering application of wecs similar challenges arise in the applications of floating breakwaters the construction cost can be reduced by combining different structures as one integrated system which has the advantage of cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality this integrated design approach has stimulated the rapid development of the hybrid system combining floating breakwaters and wecs in recent years the novel floating breakwater wec system is often classified as a wave energy utilizing type floating breakwater the different approaches for integrating floating breakwaters and wecs are summarized in this review the hydrodynamic performance and power take off performance of these hybrid floating breakwater wec systems are the focus of this review the insights gained from previous studies of this kind of system and the potential challenges for further developments of this technology are also provided the cost sharing and multi function of the breakwater wec system can help facilitate the engineering application of the floating breakwaters and wecs keywords breakwater wave energy converter hybrid system hydrodynamic performance power take off 1 introduction with the depletion of the traditional energy resources and low carbon requirement ocean renewable energy is attractive for its large reserves and exploitability in many sea areas clément et al 2002 wang et al 2011 lehmann et al 2017 guerra 2018 hemer et al 2018 neill et al 2018 even though the technical solutions of the wave energy utilization are mature to some extent and some devices are in the pre commercial stage the present research and developments indicate that wave energy devices are still far from reaching the stage of real engineering application cruz 2007 drew et al 2009 the high construction cost of the wecs may directly lead to uneconomic price of the electricity converted from ocean wave power therefore these high construction costs of wecs is one of the major obstacles that limits the past and future development of the wave energy utilization device ferro 2006 allan et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2013 astariz et al 2015a b mustapa et al 2017 the competitiveness of wave power extraction in the energy market can be enhanced by reducing the construction cost the cost sharing strategy may be one of the solutions to reduce the construction cost this can be achieved by combining two or more kinds of marine structures into one installation it is worth noting that the marine structures to be combined would be producing the synergistic effect and operating in similar environmental conditions such similarities may pave the way for the integration of the different functional aspects in addition the multi purpose objective of the marine structures can be achieved simultaneously the hybrid systems include breakwater wec integrations mustapa et al 2017 offshore wind turbine wec integrations pérez collazo et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b elginoz et al 2017 offshore platform wec integrations zhang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 and aquaculture cage wec integrations toner et al 2002 vassiliou et al 2015 lopes de almeida 2017 examples of these integrations include floating power plant p80 floating power plant products and services 2019 spar torus combination stc concept muliawan et al 2013 windwavefloat concept peiffer et al 2011 berkeley wedge concept madhi et al 2014 etc through the integration strategy the cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality of the hybrid structures can be achieved consequently the cost per structure can be effectively reduced and the engineering application of wave energy harvesting devices becomes more feasible wecs are used to convert wave energy to other useful forms theoretically a capture width ratio cwr of 100 can be achieved by using a device with special design such as a capturing buoy oscillating in multiple degree of freedoms dofs evans 1976 or an asymmetrical capturing buoy mynett et al 1979 however it is difficult to install a device with a cwr of 100 in the field conditions salter 1974 when incident waves encounter a wec array part of the incident wave energy is absorbed and the remained unabsorbed part is transmitted across the wec array as a result the wave height at the lee side of the wec array is reduced significantly the purpose of breakwaters is to attenuate wave energy and provide sheltering for coastal communities and infrastructure the wave height at the leeside of breakwaters is smaller than that at the weather side this is the common characteristic for the wecs array and breakwaters in terms of the wave transmission through wave barriers which aids the argument for the integrated design of breakwater wec integrations besides there are some investigations on the performance of wec farms with the affiliated function of coastal protection abanades et al 2015 2018 many design concepts of breakwater wec integrations have been proposed during the past several decades in the earlier stages the pilot breakwater wec integrated systems focused on the bottom mounted breakwaters such as caisson breakwaters takahashi 1988 rubble mound breakwaters margheritini et al 2009 vicinanza et al 2014 di lauro et al 2019 and composite sea walls buccino et al 2015 examples of the bottom mounted breakwater wec integrated system include the sea slot cone generator ssg device margheritini et al 2009 and the overtopping breakwater for energy conversion obrec device musa et al 2017 etc mustapa et al 2017 give a comprehensive review of the bottom mounted hybrid breakwater wec system by introducing those concepts wave energy utilization in coastal areas becomes more attractive due to the sharing of the cost and space between the wecs and the breakwaters it is known that the bottom mounted breakwater becomes uneconomical in the relatively deep water area floating breakwaters are favored for their lower construction cost and the added advantages of being flexible and environmentally friendly mccartney 1985 most of the floating breakwaters are of the form of floating surface piercing structures similarly some wave energy devices are often located at the free surface for example raft type devices point absorbers and floating oscillating water column owc type devices besides the similarity in the configurations the working environment conditions are similar for the wecs and the floating breakwaters they are both employed in sea areas with abundant wave energy resources the similarity in environmental conditions and structural configurations may provide the natural advantages for combining the floating breakwaters and wecs as hybrid systems in recent years there has been a rapid development of floating breakwater wec integrations comprehensive reviews on floating breakwater wec integrations are absent in the literature the objective of the present paper is to present a literature review on the research and development of different types of hybrid floating breakwater wec system furthermore the technical issues and the challenges associated with these hybrid systems are discussed in a detailed manner the advantages and disadvantages of different types of floating breakwater wec systems are also outlined in this review this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the classification of the floating breakwaters and wecs based on their working principles are introduced various approaches to integrate floating breakwaters with wave energy harvesting devices are classified and their characteristics efficiency and survivability are reviewed in section 3 the technology development issues and challenges of the hybrid system are discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 classifications of floating breakwaters and wave energy converters 2 1 floating breakwaters floating breakwaters are favored for the advantageous reasons of relatively low construction costs reduced dependencies on marine geological conditions low environmental impact aesthetic considerations and flexibility mccartney 1985 mccartney 1985 sawaragi 1995 and dai et al 2018 presented comprehensive reviews of the research and development of floating breakwaters according to the configurations traditional floating breakwaters are categorized as follows box type pontoon type frame type mat type tethered floating type and horizontal plate type it is understood that the wave attenuation function of the floating breakwaters is achieved by dissipating incident wave energy or hindering the incident wave propagation hence the wave attenuation principles of the floating breakwaters mainly include reflecting type disturbing type and friction type sawaragi 1995 dai et al 2018 reflecting type breakwaters hinder the wave propagation by partially reflecting incident wave to the weather side of the breakwater which leads directly to the reduction of wave height on the lee side of the structure for the disturbing type breakwater the original wave particle orbit velocity can be disturbed by breakwaters with specific shapes and the resulting induced phenomenon of wave breaking or wave fission may dissipate the incident wave energy consequently the aim of wave attenuation may be achieved in contrast the wave energy is dissipated by producing vortices caused by a particular media such as tires for the friction type breakwaters the classification and wave attenuation principles of each type of floating breakwaters are shown in table 1 dai et al 2018 2 2 wave energy converters wecs are used to convert wave energy into a useful form e g electricity based on the principle of capturing wave energy wecs can be categorized as oscillating body ob type owc type and overtopping type falnes 2007 drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 borthwick 2016 babarit 2017 the sketches of each kind of wecs are shown in figs 1 3 for the ob type wecs the movable bodies floating or submerged are selected as the absorber to capture wave energy wave energy is converted to kinetic energy of the body in the first step generally the movable bodies are connected to the pto system by a transmission mechanism e g mooring line or rigid driving link in this way the body drives the pto system directly and wave energy can be converted to electricity examples of the ob type wecs include oyster renzi et al 2014 powerbuoy hart et al 2012 and seabased ab wec chatzigiannakou et al 2017 etc the owc type wecs comprise a partially submerged structure with an opening below the water surface distinct components termed the air chamber and the water column are formed inside the structure falcão et al 2016 the incident wave excites the motion of the water column which may lead to the fluctuation of the air pressure in the chamber the conversion of wave energy can be realized through an air turbine which is driven by fluctuating air pressure examples of the owc type wecs include limpet heath 2000 and mighty whale hotta et al 1996 etc distinct from the above two devices the overtopping type wecs involve a specific structure named a water reservoir the overspilling of water waves fills the reservoir and in this way the wave kinetic energy is transformed into the potential energy of the stored water mass in the reservoir the potential energy of the stored water can be converted to the electrical energy by using low head hydraulic turbines examples of the overtopping type wecs include the wave dragon device kofoed et al 2006 and the ssg device margheritini et al 2009 etc 3 floating hybrid breakwater wec system as described in section 2 the working principles of conventional floating breakwaters include reflecting type disturbing type and friction type etc that is to say the conventional floating breakwaters work by dissipating or reflecting the wave energy to achieve the aim of attenuating incident waves in this way part of the incident wave energy is transformed into the wasted energy coincidentally wecs work on the principle of converting wave energy into other forms the synergetic effect will be augmented if the floating breakwaters can be designed as wave energy utilizing type structures in which the function of wave energy utilization and wave attenuation can be achieved simultaneously in this section we will present a comprehensive review of floating wave energy utilizing type breakwaters i e hybrid floating breakwater wec systems the hybrid systems are categorized as floating breakwater ob type wec systems floating breakwater owc type wec systems and floating breakwater overtopping type wec systems in contrast to the conventional wecs or breakwaters both conversion efficiency and transmission coefficients shall be examined while evaluating a hybrid system 3 1 floating breakwater ob type wec system the floating breakwater ob type wec system combines the ob type wec and the conventional floating breakwater generally the breakwater acts as the base structure box type breakwaters and pontoon type breakwaters are common in this category the hybrid system can be formed in 2 ways i e 1 adding a pto system on the original breakwater 2 the additional attachment of a complete wec array on the original breakwater the main body of the breakwater is similar to that of the conventional floating breakwater retaining its pontoon shape or box shape box type breakwaters are attractive for their advantages of durability simplicity and easy to construct etc some floating box type breakwaters have reached the stage of engineering application kusaka et al 2015 com 2017 due to the simplicity and ease of modification pile restrained floating breakwaters prfbs are often adapted to form a hybrid system with the dual functions of coastal protection and wave energy utilization previous investigations verified that such kind of breakwater operates effectively in terms of the wave attenuation performance isaacson et al 1998 koutandos et al 2004 2005 diamantoulaki et al 2008 wang et al 2010 the floating pontoon of the prfb moves in heave mode under the restriction of the vertical pile as is shown in fig 4 similarly the energy capturing body of the heaving ob type wec moves in heave mode zang et al 2018 the similarity in motion characteristics may pave a way to integrate the two aspects as one ning et al 2016 proposed a hybrid system as shown in fig 5 by matching a pto system to the prfb similar to the conventional prfb koutandos et al 2004 diamantoulaki et al 2008 the shape of the floating body remaines as a rectangular box zhao et al 2017a b investigated the performance of such kind of hybrid system based on linear potential flow theory the condition of cwr η 20 and transmission coefficient k t 0 5 can be achieved at a certain frequency range a corresponding experimental investigation was conducted by considering the nonlinearity of the pto damping force ning et al 2016 experimental results reveal that the qualified cwr and the effective wave attenuation performance can be achieved simultaneously the disadvantage of this hybrid system is the poor wave attenuation performance when the device is operational in long waves this shortcoming results from the box type breakwater the pto system slightly modifies the transmission coefficient of the hybrid system in long waves in addition the theoretical maximum value of the cwr for the heaving two dimensional pontoon moving in single mode is 50 due to the fluid viscous effect and friction losses the optimal cwr is smaller than 50 in the laboratory test consequently the frequency range satisfying the condition of η 20 and k t 0 5 hereinafter called effective frequency range is narrow comparing with the single pontoon system the dual pontoon type breakwater gives better breakwater performance koutandos et al 2005 the energy conversion performance of wecs consisting of several small buoys is shown to be better than that of a single buoy system with equal total volume garnaud et al 2009 to broaden the effective frequency range of the breakwater wec system proposed in ning et al 2016 ning et al 2017 put forward a dual pontoon pto system consisting of two pontoons and two ptos as shown in fig 6 preliminary analytical investigation revealed that the effective frequency bandwidth i e the width of the effective frequency range of the dual pontoon pto system is broader than that of the single pontoon system with equal total pontoon volume the efficiency of the former case is obviously greater than that of the latter one ning et al 2017 even though the friction losses and viscous effect play an important role in experiments conclusions obtained from experimental research data verifies the advantages of the dual pontoon dual pto system ning et al 2018a b note that two pto systems are needed for the dual pontoon pto system and only one pto system is needed for the single pontoon system this may lead to the increase of installation cost madhi et al 2015 proposed a concept called the berkeley wedge tbw which consists of a floating wedge shaped box and a pto system installed above the floating body as shown in fig 7 the floating body moves in heave mode and drives the pto system to produce power the shape of the floating body described in madhi et al 2015 is different from that in ning et al 2016 specifically the floating wedge shaped box is designed such that the draft of the rear wall is larger than that of the front wall this asymmetrical characteristic is similar to the salter duck device salter 1974 wu et al 2018 comparing the tbw with the conventional symmetrical device the devices with the asymmetrical wedge shaped body is beneficial to the improvement of the energy conversion efficiency madhi et al 2014 this is due to the fact that the radiated waves at the leeside of the device are very small similar mechanisms can also be used to illustrate the high efficiency of the salter duck device mei 1976 evans 1976 consequently the transmitted wave energy at the lee side of the breakwater will be reduced effectively madhi et al 2014 this suggests that the effective coastal protection function can be realized if it acts as a breakwater however for the pontoon type breakwater a tough challenge is to make the transmission coefficient acceptable in longer waves to further improve the competitiveness of the tbw some investigations were conducted from the point view of safety and survivability in both operational and extreme conditions tom et al 2019 madhi and yeung 2018 tom et al 2019 proposed a power to load balancing strategy to maximize power capture while minimizing structural and actuator loads the survivability of the berkeley wedge device in extreme waves was examined using computational fluid dynamics cfd method madhi and yeung 2018 the modification of a pressure relief channel prc is introduced to improve the survivability of the device madhi and yeung 2018 the prc design can be realized by removing part of the device that may experience the large wave pressures due to the slamming phenomenon chen et al 2015 proposed a wave energy system consisting of several floating horizontal cylinders each cylinder moves in heave mode and works independently as shown in fig 8 the size of the cylinders is obviously smaller than that of the floating body in ning et al 2016 and madhi and yeung 2018 chen et al 2016a b thoroughly investigated the performance of the system proposed in chen et al 2015 using a numerical wave flume technique the wave attenuation performance of a single device in chen et al 2015 is not comparable to that in ning et al 2016 and madhi and yeung 2018 they pointed out that the qualified energy conversion performance and breakwater performance can be anticipated by deploying multiple devices waves formed at the front of the breakwater are characterized as the superposition of the incident waves and the reflected waves which may amplify the wave height at the weather side this characteristic may be useful to improve the efficiency of wecs there have been many attempts to combine wecs and floating breakwaters by attaching wecs at the weather side of the breakwaters zingale 2002 martinelli et al 2016 favaretto et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b 2019 ning et al 2018a b zingale 2002 proposed a modular floating breakwater with the additional function of wave energy utilization as shown in fig 9 an array of spherical ob type wecs were arranged at the weather side of the floating breakwater the pto system was arranged at the top of the breakwater which acted as the base structure as described in fig 9 the size of the breakwater is obviously greater than that of many wave energy devices the relative motion of the wec devices and the breakwater drives the pto system to produce power specific data on the efficiency and transmission coefficient of the integrated system are absent from the published results zhao et al 2017a b proposed a hybrid system comprising of an ob type wec arranged in front of a floating pontoon type breakwater see fig 10 the efficiency of the ob type wec arranged in front of the breakwater is greater than that of the isolated case in a wide frequency range the superposition of the incident waves and reflected waves amplify the efficiency of the wecs the corresponding experimental results revealed that the efficiency of the ob type wec arranged in front of the breakwater is obviously greater than that of the isolated case especially for shorter waves zhao et al 2018 as a general extension ning et al 2018a b investigated the effect of the breakwater on the performance of a wec array located at the weather side a significant increment in the efficiency of the wec array can be observed due to the existence of the rear breakwater corresponding experimental results show that the wave forces and heave response of the wecs can be amplified zhao et al 2019 such kind of integrations with significant improvement of the efficiency may pave the way to improve the energy conversion performance of wecs in areas experiencing medium wave conditions it is important to note that zero efficiency occurs at certain frequencies for the devices located at the weather side of a breakwater this is due to the fact that bragg resonance with strong reflections may be triggered for such kind of multi body system ouyang et al 2015 due to the destructive effect on the energy conversion efficiency bragg resonance should be avoided while designing the integrations characterized by the multi body system martinelli et al 2016 proposed a multi functional structure combining a breakwater and an ob type wec namely showed the breakwater moves vertically along an upright pile as shown in fig 11 showed is situated at the weather side of the breakwater experimental results reveal that the energy conversion efficiency can reach 26 this efficiency of 26 is smaller than that presented in zhao and ning 2018 since the two contrasting configurations in martinelli et al 2016 and zhao and ning 2018 are not the same the direct comparison of efficiencies between the two systems is inapplicable the relatively low efficiency indicated that further optimization of the system proposed by martinelli et al 2016 may be necessary to improve its energy conversion efficiency as an extension favaretto et al 2017 proposed a novel integrated system consisting of a catamaran floating breakwater and an ob type wec the aim of generating electrical energy whilst also providing a coastal protection function can be achieved for both of the systems proposed in refs martinelli et al 2016 favaretto et al 2017 for the above mechanisms described in this subsection the energy capture body of the device moves in heave mode in contrast the devices described below belong to the category of multi mode wec the energy capturing body moves in multiple degrees of freedom michailides et al 2011 proposed a flexible floating breakwater consisting of several modules as shown in fig 12 the neighboring modules are connected by the pto system which is driven by the relative motion of the modules this is similar to the raft type wec as mentioned in zheng and zhang 2017 the energy conversion performance and wave attenuation performance of such a system were investigated theoretically michailides and angelides 2012 michailides et al 2013 michailides et al 2015 michailides 2017 results revealed that the system can simultaneously satisfy the effective energy conversion efficiency and qualified wave attenuation performance so far there are no corresponding experimental investigations reported the flexible floating breakwater can be fixed by a mooring system and deployed in the deep water area comparatively it is uneconomic to deploy the pile supported system in deep water a sea location with medium depth may be favorable for the pile supported system 3 2 floating breakwater owc type wec system the floating owc type device is a hollow shaped structure luo et al 2014 elhanafi et al 2017 the hollow shaped structure can be formed by removing the bottom of the conventional floating box pontoon type breakwater generally the displacement of the owc type breakwater is smaller than that of the ob type breakwater this may result in a relatively lower construction cost of the owc type breakwater neelamani et al 2006 proposed a floating owc caisson structure with an air chamber as shown in fig 13 the anchor chain mooring system is adapted to fix the system in location from the experimental data on the pneumatic efficiency of the system it can be deduced that the system can be effectively used as breakwaters and as wecs koo 2009 investigated the wave attenuation performance of a pneumatic type floating breakwater as shown in fig 14 this structure possesses the characteristics of the owc type wave energy device the imposed pneumatic damping is helpful to dissipate wave energy and improve the wave attenuation performance hence the wave attenuation performance of the pneumatic type floating breakwater is better than that of the conventional box type breakwater he and huang 2014 proposed a pile based breakwater with an owc air chamber in appearance the new breakwater design is equivalent to a bottomless box compared with the conventional pile supported box type breakwater the wave attenuation performance of the device is improved due to the energy absorption function of the air chamber furthermore the measured fluctuations in air pressure revealed that this kind of device is suitable for wave energy utilization he et al 2012 proposed a breakwater with double owc air chambers the two owc air chambers are symmetrically located at the front and rear sides of the box additionally this system has the potential to harvest wave energy he et al 2013 and he et al 2017 modified the hybrid system proposed in he et al 2012 by incorporating two asymmetric air chambers as a result of the modifications the pressure fluctuation inside the air chamber arranged asymmetrically are amplified significantly this is beneficial to improve the wave energy conversion efficiency without compromising the coastal protection function through integrating the air chamber into the conventional breakwater the function of wave energy conversion can be achieved more importantly compared with the conventional box type breakwater the wave attenuation performance of the hybrid system is improved this is attributed to the fact that wave energy is dissipated by pneumatic damping which can be observed directly from the fluctuation of the air pressure in the chamber in addition the embedding of the owc air chamber decreases the displacement of the breakwater for floating bodies the displacement roughly indicates the construction cost so the reduction of the construction cost may be achieved adjunctively sundar et al 2010 proposed a novel floating breakwater owc wec system as shown in fig 15 the system combines the u owc device and the floating box type breakwater many theoretical and experimental investigations verified that the u owc is an effective land based owc device boccotti 2007 strati et al 2016 malara et al 2017 so far both the theoretical and experimental investigations that evaluate the performance of this novel floating system are absent since the owc wec has the preliminary function of absorbing wave energy it can serve as a sheltering structure for particular offshore engineering installations hong and hong 2007 and hong et al 2006 applied the concept of using floating owc breakwaters to shelter the very large floating structures vlfs by arranging the wecs at the weather side of the vlfs since part of the incident wave energy is absorbed by the owc breakwater the response of the vlfs can be reduced effectively 3 3 floating breakwater overtopping type wec system erik friis madsen proposed an overtopping type wec called wave dragon which can also serve as a wave damping structure kofoed et al 2006 unlike conventional wecs this device includes two reflection walls as shown in fig 16 which can amplify the wave height substantially this typical design is beneficial to improve the wave energy conversion efficiency of the wave energy harvesting device the main structure of the wave dragon device consists of a curved ramp and a water storage reservoir incident waves can be focused by the reflectors and the overtopping water fills the reservoir the potential energy of the water in the reservoir is converted into electricity through low head hydro turbines small scale laboratory test and offshore test with the scale of 1 4 5 showed that the device operates effectively in terms of the pto performance soerensen et al 2000 hansen et al 2003 frigaard et al 2006 beels et al 2010 investigated the influence of the existence of the wave dragon device on the surrounding wave field due to its excellent wave absorbing performance the wave dragon device has the potential to act as a breakwater nørgaard et al 2011 3 4 wec array with sheltering function the essential purpose of a wave farm i e wec array is to transform wave energy into other useful forms this means that the incident wave energy will be partially absorbed while the waves transmitted through the wec array and consequently the wave height at the lee side of the wec array is mitigated carballo et al 2013 mcnatt et al 2015 flocard et al 2017 abanades et al 2018 rodriguez delgado et al 2018 naturally the wave farm may possess the function of sheltering or providing coastal protection from erosion the conventional coastal protection structures are single functional and no other benefits can be achieved many attempts have been made to realize multiple functionality including wave energy utilization wave attenuation etc wave farms with a coastal protection feature are preferable for their advantageous multiple function cost sharing and space sharing mcnatt et al 2015 presents the wave fields as shown in fig 17 around a wec array consisting of several point absorbers situated by using an analytical method based on linear potential theory it can be directly observed that wave height at the lee side of the wec array is obviously smaller than that at the weather side this may provide intuitive evidence that a wec farm can act as a single synergistic structure with effective wave attenuation performance zanuttigh et al 2010 analyzed the breakwater performance and energy conversion efficiency of a floating wec i e dexa the dexa device is essentially formed by two hinged floating buoys and the relative motion of the hinged buoys drives the pto system using the dexa device energy conversion efficiency of 10 35 can be achieved in laboratory conditions the transmission coefficient for the single device and double devices with staggered configuration are 0 8 and 0 6 respectively zanuttigh et al 2013 from this trend it can be deduced that more effective wave attenuation performance can be obtained for a wec array with many dexa devices since a reduction in wave height is observed behind a wave farm it can be used to protect coastal areas from erosion the role of the wave farm from a perspective of providing coastal protection from erosion is analyzed in refs bergillos et al 2018 abanades et al 2014 2015 as is expected the wave farm induces a wave height reduction at its lee side and significant reduction in erosion of the beach can be achieved it is worth noting that the distance between the coast and the wave farm affects the shelter pattern abanades et al 2015 mendoza et al 2014 investigated the beach response to wave farms consisting of classical wecs such as dexa wave dragon seabreath blow jet etc acting as a coastal defense they pointed out that the farm layout with several lines of wecs is favorable for near shore protection purpose nevertheless the other coastal activities such as aquaculture navigations etc should be taken into account while designing such kinds of wave farm with the function of coastal protection sheltering effect is an important function of a wave farm in addition to the function of coastal protection from erosion wave farm can provide sheltering for other marine operations such as offshore wind farm aquaculture facilities etc weiss et al 2018 many hybrid wave wind farm schemes have been proposed astariz et al 2015a b pérez collazo et al 2015 due to the sheltering effect of the wave farm wave conditions at the proposed areas will be more moderate veigas et al 2014 astariz et al 2015a b astariz et al 2015 onea et al 2016 hence longer design life periods and lower maintenance costs for the offshore wind turbines can be realized similarly offshore renewable energy devices can also provide power for the offshore aquaculture facilities and stimulate the synergies between the two aspects this may provide opportunities for co location of offshore renewable energy devices and aquaculture farms making full use of the function of sheltering and power supply features of wecs may enhance the competitiveness of the ocean wave energy resource 4 issues and challenges the floating breakwater wec hybrid systems possess dual functions i e breakwater function and wave energy utilization the performance indexes of the hybrid systems are different from that of original breakwaters or wecs with single function for the conventional structures only one indicator transmission coefficient or wave energy conversion efficiency may be of concern however for the hybrid systems both the functions of wave energy conversion and coastal protection shall be considered collectively hence the design methods or the test procedures for the conventional breakwaters or wecs may not suitable for the hybrid systems for the hybrid breakwater wec systems the ideal condition is that the incident wave energy is totally absorbed by the wecs and the scattered wave energy is canceled at a wide frequency range previous theoretical investigations reveal that an efficiency of 100 can be achieved for devices with multiple dofs evans 1976 however it is challenging to achieve this ideal condition in reality it is understood that the transmission coefficient is an important indicator while evaluating the wave attenuation performance of the floating breakwater for a specific floating breakwater that meets the engineering application design the transmission coefficient should be maintained below 0 5 hence under the premise of k t 0 5 hybrid systems with higher energy conversion efficiency are more competitive table 2 showed the achievable transmission coefficient and efficiency of some selected hybrid systems it can be observed that the hybrid systems with ob type wecs perform better in terms of the wave energy conversion efficiency improvement of the energy conversion performance of the wecs can be achieved by two methods 1 making full use of the waves reflected from the adjacent structures 2 optimizing the energy capturing buoy performance through methods such as the use of asymmetrical bodies such as the tbw in addition the effective frequency bandwidth with effective efficiency and qualified transmission coefficient is another important indicator that evaluates the performance of the hybrid system hybrid systems with broader effective frequency bandwidth are favorable for most of the floating breakwaters poor wave attenuation performance in long wave conditions may lower their competitiveness for hybrid systems that possess the characteristics of floating breakwater similar issues still exist generally floating breakwaters work effectively in short waves however wave energy devices operate ineffectively with features of low efficiency high efficiency for wec system in short waves is very important for the applications in the sea areas with mild wave conditions such as the east china sea wang et al 2011 hence improving the energy conversion efficiency in short waves and the wave attenuation performance in long waves is necessary to broaden the effective frequency bandwidth of the floating hybrid systems most of the existing investigations were conducted in long crested wave conditions however real ocean waves are multidirectional and coexist with wave currents there are some investigations that evaluate the performance of the conventional wecs in multi directional waves such as göteman et al 2018 however considering the hybrid systems the data indicating the performance of the integrated system in short crested waves and coexisting wave current fields is rare and there is a necessity for further investigations the survivability of the hybrid system in extreme waves determines its prospects in engineering applications tiron et al 2015 saincher et al 2016 the occurrence of extreme wave events accompanies the interaction of breaking waves and structures these are complex phenomenons characterized by flow separation and air entrainment saincher and banerjee 2016 wei et al 2016 chen et al 2018 martin medina et al 2018 fundamentally developing corresponding efficient numerical techniques such as the cfd method and high quality experimental procedures may pave the way to understand this complex hydrodynamic problem saincher and banerjee 2016 windt et al 2018 further exploring the mechanics of the hydrodynamic behavior of floating buoys in breaking waves and proposing advanced protection strategies in extreme conditions are necessary to improve the survivability of the hybrid system so far most of the concepts are in the stage of theoretical study or small scale laboratory test as a design stage that must be completed large scale experiments and sea trial tests with the implementation of the real hydraulic pto systems are urged 5 conclusions in this paper a literature review was presented with a focus on the research and development of various types of hybrid floating breakwater wec systems over the past few years the features and the advantages and disadvantages of different types of floating integrations were described the corresponding challenges and issues were specified from the point view of fundamental hydrodynamics and technical solutions the conventional floating breakwaters and conventional wave energy devices are introduced and categorized based on their working principles as hybrid structures with dual functionality wave energy utilization and wave attenuation the floating breakwater wec systems are categorized as the wave energy utilizing type breakwater the floating breakwater wec systems are divided into four categories floating breakwater ob type wec system floating breakwater owc type wec system floating breakwater overtopping type wec system and floating wec array with sheltering function since such kind of systems were characterized by the cost sharing space sharing and their multiple capabilities the concept of combining the two aspects of coastal protection and wave energy utilization is beneficial to reduce the construction cost of both floating breakwaters and wecs in addition we present some investigations on wave farms with the dual function of coastal protection from erosion and sheltering specific engineering installations such as offshore wind farms the floating breakwaters wec system is an attractive solution to coastal engineering island engineering aquaculture engineering and other massive ocean engineering projects e g vlfs that need power supply and protection against wave action even though many effective concepts have been proposed there remain many untapped research areas the main interesting outstanding challenges include evaluating the performance of the hybrid system in realistic sea states i e multi directional waves wave current coexisting filed etc broadening the effective frequency bandwidth of the hybrid system examining survivability of the hybrid system in extreme waves etc since the marine structures must survive severe storms the new challenges for the hybrid system are how to improve the survivability of the devices and propose further design guidance further studies may also include the fundamental research on wave structure interactions especially for breaking wave structure interactions and protection strategies from extreme sea states to improve the survivability of these installations of course novel designs of the hybrid system with simplicity in configuration high energy conversion efficiency excellent wave attenuation performance and broad effective frequency bandwidth are welcomed acknowledgments this work is being

22666,ocean wave energy is attractive for its large reserves exploitability and low emissions although many wave energy converter wec concepts have been proposed high construction cost hinders the engineering application of wecs similar challenges arise in the applications of floating breakwaters the construction cost can be reduced by combining different structures as one integrated system which has the advantage of cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality this integrated design approach has stimulated the rapid development of the hybrid system combining floating breakwaters and wecs in recent years the novel floating breakwater wec system is often classified as a wave energy utilizing type floating breakwater the different approaches for integrating floating breakwaters and wecs are summarized in this review the hydrodynamic performance and power take off performance of these hybrid floating breakwater wec systems are the focus of this review the insights gained from previous studies of this kind of system and the potential challenges for further developments of this technology are also provided the cost sharing and multi function of the breakwater wec system can help facilitate the engineering application of the floating breakwaters and wecs keywords breakwater wave energy converter hybrid system hydrodynamic performance power take off 1 introduction with the depletion of the traditional energy resources and low carbon requirement ocean renewable energy is attractive for its large reserves and exploitability in many sea areas clément et al 2002 wang et al 2011 lehmann et al 2017 guerra 2018 hemer et al 2018 neill et al 2018 even though the technical solutions of the wave energy utilization are mature to some extent and some devices are in the pre commercial stage the present research and developments indicate that wave energy devices are still far from reaching the stage of real engineering application cruz 2007 drew et al 2009 the high construction cost of the wecs may directly lead to uneconomic price of the electricity converted from ocean wave power therefore these high construction costs of wecs is one of the major obstacles that limits the past and future development of the wave energy utilization device ferro 2006 allan et al 2011 jeffrey et al 2013 astariz et al 2015a b mustapa et al 2017 the competitiveness of wave power extraction in the energy market can be enhanced by reducing the construction cost the cost sharing strategy may be one of the solutions to reduce the construction cost this can be achieved by combining two or more kinds of marine structures into one installation it is worth noting that the marine structures to be combined would be producing the synergistic effect and operating in similar environmental conditions such similarities may pave the way for the integration of the different functional aspects in addition the multi purpose objective of the marine structures can be achieved simultaneously the hybrid systems include breakwater wec integrations mustapa et al 2017 offshore wind turbine wec integrations pérez collazo et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b elginoz et al 2017 offshore platform wec integrations zhang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 and aquaculture cage wec integrations toner et al 2002 vassiliou et al 2015 lopes de almeida 2017 examples of these integrations include floating power plant p80 floating power plant products and services 2019 spar torus combination stc concept muliawan et al 2013 windwavefloat concept peiffer et al 2011 berkeley wedge concept madhi et al 2014 etc through the integration strategy the cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality of the hybrid structures can be achieved consequently the cost per structure can be effectively reduced and the engineering application of wave energy harvesting devices becomes more feasible wecs are used to convert wave energy to other useful forms theoretically a capture width ratio cwr of 100 can be achieved by using a device with special design such as a capturing buoy oscillating in multiple degree of freedoms dofs evans 1976 or an asymmetrical capturing buoy mynett et al 1979 however it is difficult to install a device with a cwr of 100 in the field conditions salter 1974 when incident waves encounter a wec array part of the incident wave energy is absorbed and the remained unabsorbed part is transmitted across the wec array as a result the wave height at the lee side of the wec array is reduced significantly the purpose of breakwaters is to attenuate wave energy and provide sheltering for coastal communities and infrastructure the wave height at the leeside of breakwaters is smaller than that at the weather side this is the common characteristic for the wecs array and breakwaters in terms of the wave transmission through wave barriers which aids the argument for the integrated design of breakwater wec integrations besides there are some investigations on the performance of wec farms with the affiliated function of coastal protection abanades et al 2015 2018 many design concepts of breakwater wec integrations have been proposed during the past several decades in the earlier stages the pilot breakwater wec integrated systems focused on the bottom mounted breakwaters such as caisson breakwaters takahashi 1988 rubble mound breakwaters margheritini et al 2009 vicinanza et al 2014 di lauro et al 2019 and composite sea walls buccino et al 2015 examples of the bottom mounted breakwater wec integrated system include the sea slot cone generator ssg device margheritini et al 2009 and the overtopping breakwater for energy conversion obrec device musa et al 2017 etc mustapa et al 2017 give a comprehensive review of the bottom mounted hybrid breakwater wec system by introducing those concepts wave energy utilization in coastal areas becomes more attractive due to the sharing of the cost and space between the wecs and the breakwaters it is known that the bottom mounted breakwater becomes uneconomical in the relatively deep water area floating breakwaters are favored for their lower construction cost and the added advantages of being flexible and environmentally friendly mccartney 1985 most of the floating breakwaters are of the form of floating surface piercing structures similarly some wave energy devices are often located at the free surface for example raft type devices point absorbers and floating oscillating water column owc type devices besides the similarity in the configurations the working environment conditions are similar for the wecs and the floating breakwaters they are both employed in sea areas with abundant wave energy resources the similarity in environmental conditions and structural configurations may provide the natural advantages for combining the floating breakwaters and wecs as hybrid systems in recent years there has been a rapid development of floating breakwater wec integrations comprehensive reviews on floating breakwater wec integrations are absent in the literature the objective of the present paper is to present a literature review on the research and development of different types of hybrid floating breakwater wec system furthermore the technical issues and the challenges associated with these hybrid systems are discussed in a detailed manner the advantages and disadvantages of different types of floating breakwater wec systems are also outlined in this review this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the classification of the floating breakwaters and wecs based on their working principles are introduced various approaches to integrate floating breakwaters with wave energy harvesting devices are classified and their characteristics efficiency and survivability are reviewed in section 3 the technology development issues and challenges of the hybrid system are discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 classifications of floating breakwaters and wave energy converters 2 1 floating breakwaters floating breakwaters are favored for the advantageous reasons of relatively low construction costs reduced dependencies on marine geological conditions low environmental impact aesthetic considerations and flexibility mccartney 1985 mccartney 1985 sawaragi 1995 and dai et al 2018 presented comprehensive reviews of the research and development of floating breakwaters according to the configurations traditional floating breakwaters are categorized as follows box type pontoon type frame type mat type tethered floating type and horizontal plate type it is understood that the wave attenuation function of the floating breakwaters is achieved by dissipating incident wave energy or hindering the incident wave propagation hence the wave attenuation principles of the floating breakwaters mainly include reflecting type disturbing type and friction type sawaragi 1995 dai et al 2018 reflecting type breakwaters hinder the wave propagation by partially reflecting incident wave to the weather side of the breakwater which leads directly to the reduction of wave height on the lee side of the structure for the disturbing type breakwater the original wave particle orbit velocity can be disturbed by breakwaters with specific shapes and the resulting induced phenomenon of wave breaking or wave fission may dissipate the incident wave energy consequently the aim of wave attenuation may be achieved in contrast the wave energy is dissipated by producing vortices caused by a particular media such as tires for the friction type breakwaters the classification and wave attenuation principles of each type of floating breakwaters are shown in table 1 dai et al 2018 2 2 wave energy converters wecs are used to convert wave energy into a useful form e g electricity based on the principle of capturing wave energy wecs can be categorized as oscillating body ob type owc type and overtopping type falnes 2007 drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 borthwick 2016 babarit 2017 the sketches of each kind of wecs are shown in figs 1 3 for the ob type wecs the movable bodies floating or submerged are selected as the absorber to capture wave energy wave energy is converted to kinetic energy of the body in the first step generally the movable bodies are connected to the pto system by a transmission mechanism e g mooring line or rigid driving link in this way the body drives the pto system directly and wave energy can be converted to electricity examples of the ob type wecs include oyster renzi et al 2014 powerbuoy hart et al 2012 and seabased ab wec chatzigiannakou et al 2017 etc the owc type wecs comprise a partially submerged structure with an opening below the water surface distinct components termed the air chamber and the water column are formed inside the structure falcão et al 2016 the incident wave excites the motion of the water column which may lead to the fluctuation of the air pressure in the chamber the conversion of wave energy can be realized through an air turbine which is driven by fluctuating air pressure examples of the owc type wecs include limpet heath 2000 and mighty whale hotta et al 1996 etc distinct from the above two devices the overtopping type wecs involve a specific structure named a water reservoir the overspilling of water waves fills the reservoir and in this way the wave kinetic energy is transformed into the potential energy of the stored water mass in the reservoir the potential energy of the stored water can be converted to the electrical energy by using low head hydraulic turbines examples of the overtopping type wecs include the wave dragon device kofoed et al 2006 and the ssg device margheritini et al 2009 etc 3 floating hybrid breakwater wec system as described in section 2 the working principles of conventional floating breakwaters include reflecting type disturbing type and friction type etc that is to say the conventional floating breakwaters work by dissipating or reflecting the wave energy to achieve the aim of attenuating incident waves in this way part of the incident wave energy is transformed into the wasted energy coincidentally wecs work on the principle of converting wave energy into other forms the synergetic effect will be augmented if the floating breakwaters can be designed as wave energy utilizing type structures in which the function of wave energy utilization and wave attenuation can be achieved simultaneously in this section we will present a comprehensive review of floating wave energy utilizing type breakwaters i e hybrid floating breakwater wec systems the hybrid systems are categorized as floating breakwater ob type wec systems floating breakwater owc type wec systems and floating breakwater overtopping type wec systems in contrast to the conventional wecs or breakwaters both conversion efficiency and transmission coefficients shall be examined while evaluating a hybrid system 3 1 floating breakwater ob type wec system the floating breakwater ob type wec system combines the ob type wec and the conventional floating breakwater generally the breakwater acts as the base structure box type breakwaters and pontoon type breakwaters are common in this category the hybrid system can be formed in 2 ways i e 1 adding a pto system on the original breakwater 2 the additional attachment of a complete wec array on the original breakwater the main body of the breakwater is similar to that of the conventional floating breakwater retaining its pontoon shape or box shape box type breakwaters are attractive for their advantages of durability simplicity and easy to construct etc some floating box type breakwaters have reached the stage of engineering application kusaka et al 2015 com 2017 due to the simplicity and ease of modification pile restrained floating breakwaters prfbs are often adapted to form a hybrid system with the dual functions of coastal protection and wave energy utilization previous investigations verified that such kind of breakwater operates effectively in terms of the wave attenuation performance isaacson et al 1998 koutandos et al 2004 2005 diamantoulaki et al 2008 wang et al 2010 the floating pontoon of the prfb moves in heave mode under the restriction of the vertical pile as is shown in fig 4 similarly the energy capturing body of the heaving ob type wec moves in heave mode zang et al 2018 the similarity in motion characteristics may pave a way to integrate the two aspects as one ning et al 2016 proposed a hybrid system as shown in fig 5 by matching a pto system to the prfb similar to the conventional prfb koutandos et al 2004 diamantoulaki et al 2008 the shape of the floating body remaines as a rectangular box zhao et al 2017a b investigated the performance of such kind of hybrid system based on linear potential flow theory the condition of cwr η 20 and transmission coefficient k t 0 5 can be achieved at a certain frequency range a corresponding experimental investigation was conducted by considering the nonlinearity of the pto damping force ning et al 2016 experimental results reveal that the qualified cwr and the effective wave attenuation performance can be achieved simultaneously the disadvantage of this hybrid system is the poor wave attenuation performance when the device is operational in long waves this shortcoming results from the box type breakwater the pto system slightly modifies the transmission coefficient of the hybrid system in long waves in addition the theoretical maximum value of the cwr for the heaving two dimensional pontoon moving in single mode is 50 due to the fluid viscous effect and friction losses the optimal cwr is smaller than 50 in the laboratory test consequently the frequency range satisfying the condition of η 20 and k t 0 5 hereinafter called effective frequency range is narrow comparing with the single pontoon system the dual pontoon type breakwater gives better breakwater performance koutandos et al 2005 the energy conversion performance of wecs consisting of several small buoys is shown to be better than that of a single buoy system with equal total volume garnaud et al 2009 to broaden the effective frequency range of the breakwater wec system proposed in ning et al 2016 ning et al 2017 put forward a dual pontoon pto system consisting of two pontoons and two ptos as shown in fig 6 preliminary analytical investigation revealed that the effective frequency bandwidth i e the width of the effective frequency range of the dual pontoon pto system is broader than that of the single pontoon system with equal total pontoon volume the efficiency of the former case is obviously greater than that of the latter one ning et al 2017 even though the friction losses and viscous effect play an important role in experiments conclusions obtained from experimental research data verifies the advantages of the dual pontoon dual pto system ning et al 2018a b note that two pto systems are needed for the dual pontoon pto system and only one pto system is needed for the single pontoon system this may lead to the increase of installation cost madhi et al 2015 proposed a concept called the berkeley wedge tbw which consists of a floating wedge shaped box and a pto system installed above the floating body as shown in fig 7 the floating body moves in heave mode and drives the pto system to produce power the shape of the floating body described in madhi et al 2015 is different from that in ning et al 2016 specifically the floating wedge shaped box is designed such that the draft of the rear wall is larger than that of the front wall this asymmetrical characteristic is similar to the salter duck device salter 1974 wu et al 2018 comparing the tbw with the conventional symmetrical device the devices with the asymmetrical wedge shaped body is beneficial to the improvement of the energy conversion efficiency madhi et al 2014 this is due to the fact that the radiated waves at the leeside of the device are very small similar mechanisms can also be used to illustrate the high efficiency of the salter duck device mei 1976 evans 1976 consequently the transmitted wave energy at the lee side of the breakwater will be reduced effectively madhi et al 2014 this suggests that the effective coastal protection function can be realized if it acts as a breakwater however for the pontoon type breakwater a tough challenge is to make the transmission coefficient acceptable in longer waves to further improve the competitiveness of the tbw some investigations were conducted from the point view of safety and survivability in both operational and extreme conditions tom et al 2019 madhi and yeung 2018 tom et al 2019 proposed a power to load balancing strategy to maximize power capture while minimizing structural and actuator loads the survivability of the berkeley wedge device in extreme waves was examined using computational fluid dynamics cfd method madhi and yeung 2018 the modification of a pressure relief channel prc is introduced to improve the survivability of the device madhi and yeung 2018 the prc design can be realized by removing part of the device that may experience the large wave pressures due to the slamming phenomenon chen et al 2015 proposed a wave energy system consisting of several floating horizontal cylinders each cylinder moves in heave mode and works independently as shown in fig 8 the size of the cylinders is obviously smaller than that of the floating body in ning et al 2016 and madhi and yeung 2018 chen et al 2016a b thoroughly investigated the performance of the system proposed in chen et al 2015 using a numerical wave flume technique the wave attenuation performance of a single device in chen et al 2015 is not comparable to that in ning et al 2016 and madhi and yeung 2018 they pointed out that the qualified energy conversion performance and breakwater performance can be anticipated by deploying multiple devices waves formed at the front of the breakwater are characterized as the superposition of the incident waves and the reflected waves which may amplify the wave height at the weather side this characteristic may be useful to improve the efficiency of wecs there have been many attempts to combine wecs and floating breakwaters by attaching wecs at the weather side of the breakwaters zingale 2002 martinelli et al 2016 favaretto et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b 2019 ning et al 2018a b zingale 2002 proposed a modular floating breakwater with the additional function of wave energy utilization as shown in fig 9 an array of spherical ob type wecs were arranged at the weather side of the floating breakwater the pto system was arranged at the top of the breakwater which acted as the base structure as described in fig 9 the size of the breakwater is obviously greater than that of many wave energy devices the relative motion of the wec devices and the breakwater drives the pto system to produce power specific data on the efficiency and transmission coefficient of the integrated system are absent from the published results zhao et al 2017a b proposed a hybrid system comprising of an ob type wec arranged in front of a floating pontoon type breakwater see fig 10 the efficiency of the ob type wec arranged in front of the breakwater is greater than that of the isolated case in a wide frequency range the superposition of the incident waves and reflected waves amplify the efficiency of the wecs the corresponding experimental results revealed that the efficiency of the ob type wec arranged in front of the breakwater is obviously greater than that of the isolated case especially for shorter waves zhao et al 2018 as a general extension ning et al 2018a b investigated the effect of the breakwater on the performance of a wec array located at the weather side a significant increment in the efficiency of the wec array can be observed due to the existence of the rear breakwater corresponding experimental results show that the wave forces and heave response of the wecs can be amplified zhao et al 2019 such kind of integrations with significant improvement of the efficiency may pave the way to improve the energy conversion performance of wecs in areas experiencing medium wave conditions it is important to note that zero efficiency occurs at certain frequencies for the devices located at the weather side of a breakwater this is due to the fact that bragg resonance with strong reflections may be triggered for such kind of multi body system ouyang et al 2015 due to the destructive effect on the energy conversion efficiency bragg resonance should be avoided while designing the integrations characterized by the multi body system martinelli et al 2016 proposed a multi functional structure combining a breakwater and an ob type wec namely showed the breakwater moves vertically along an upright pile as shown in fig 11 showed is situated at the weather side of the breakwater experimental results reveal that the energy conversion efficiency can reach 26 this efficiency of 26 is smaller than that presented in zhao and ning 2018 since the two contrasting configurations in martinelli et al 2016 and zhao and ning 2018 are not the same the direct comparison of efficiencies between the two systems is inapplicable the relatively low efficiency indicated that further optimization of the system proposed by martinelli et al 2016 may be necessary to improve its energy conversion efficiency as an extension favaretto et al 2017 proposed a novel integrated system consisting of a catamaran floating breakwater and an ob type wec the aim of generating electrical energy whilst also providing a coastal protection function can be achieved for both of the systems proposed in refs martinelli et al 2016 favaretto et al 2017 for the above mechanisms described in this subsection the energy capture body of the device moves in heave mode in contrast the devices described below belong to the category of multi mode wec the energy capturing body moves in multiple degrees of freedom michailides et al 2011 proposed a flexible floating breakwater consisting of several modules as shown in fig 12 the neighboring modules are connected by the pto system which is driven by the relative motion of the modules this is similar to the raft type wec as mentioned in zheng and zhang 2017 the energy conversion performance and wave attenuation performance of such a system were investigated theoretically michailides and angelides 2012 michailides et al 2013 michailides et al 2015 michailides 2017 results revealed that the system can simultaneously satisfy the effective energy conversion efficiency and qualified wave attenuation performance so far there are no corresponding experimental investigations reported the flexible floating breakwater can be fixed by a mooring system and deployed in the deep water area comparatively it is uneconomic to deploy the pile supported system in deep water a sea location with medium depth may be favorable for the pile supported system 3 2 floating breakwater owc type wec system the floating owc type device is a hollow shaped structure luo et al 2014 elhanafi et al 2017 the hollow shaped structure can be formed by removing the bottom of the conventional floating box pontoon type breakwater generally the displacement of the owc type breakwater is smaller than that of the ob type breakwater this may result in a relatively lower construction cost of the owc type breakwater neelamani et al 2006 proposed a floating owc caisson structure with an air chamber as shown in fig 13 the anchor chain mooring system is adapted to fix the system in location from the experimental data on the pneumatic efficiency of the system it can be deduced that the system can be effectively used as breakwaters and as wecs koo 2009 investigated the wave attenuation performance of a pneumatic type floating breakwater as shown in fig 14 this structure possesses the characteristics of the owc type wave energy device the imposed pneumatic damping is helpful to dissipate wave energy and improve the wave attenuation performance hence the wave attenuation performance of the pneumatic type floating breakwater is better than that of the conventional box type breakwater he and huang 2014 proposed a pile based breakwater with an owc air chamber in appearance the new breakwater design is equivalent to a bottomless box compared with the conventional pile supported box type breakwater the wave attenuation performance of the device is improved due to the energy absorption function of the air chamber furthermore the measured fluctuations in air pressure revealed that this kind of device is suitable for wave energy utilization he et al 2012 proposed a breakwater with double owc air chambers the two owc air chambers are symmetrically located at the front and rear sides of the box additionally this system has the potential to harvest wave energy he et al 2013 and he et al 2017 modified the hybrid system proposed in he et al 2012 by incorporating two asymmetric air chambers as a result of the modifications the pressure fluctuation inside the air chamber arranged asymmetrically are amplified significantly this is beneficial to improve the wave energy conversion efficiency without compromising the coastal protection function through integrating the air chamber into the conventional breakwater the function of wave energy conversion can be achieved more importantly compared with the conventional box type breakwater the wave attenuation performance of the hybrid system is improved this is attributed to the fact that wave energy is dissipated by pneumatic damping which can be observed directly from the fluctuation of the air pressure in the chamber in addition the embedding of the owc air chamber decreases the displacement of the breakwater for floating bodies the displacement roughly indicates the construction cost so the reduction of the construction cost may be achieved adjunctively sundar et al 2010 proposed a novel floating breakwater owc wec system as shown in fig 15 the system combines the u owc device and the floating box type breakwater many theoretical and experimental investigations verified that the u owc is an effective land based owc device boccotti 2007 strati et al 2016 malara et al 2017 so far both the theoretical and experimental investigations that evaluate the performance of this novel floating system are absent since the owc wec has the preliminary function of absorbing wave energy it can serve as a sheltering structure for particular offshore engineering installations hong and hong 2007 and hong et al 2006 applied the concept of using floating owc breakwaters to shelter the very large floating structures vlfs by arranging the wecs at the weather side of the vlfs since part of the incident wave energy is absorbed by the owc breakwater the response of the vlfs can be reduced effectively 3 3 floating breakwater overtopping type wec system erik friis madsen proposed an overtopping type wec called wave dragon which can also serve as a wave damping structure kofoed et al 2006 unlike conventional wecs this device includes two reflection walls as shown in fig 16 which can amplify the wave height substantially this typical design is beneficial to improve the wave energy conversion efficiency of the wave energy harvesting device the main structure of the wave dragon device consists of a curved ramp and a water storage reservoir incident waves can be focused by the reflectors and the overtopping water fills the reservoir the potential energy of the water in the reservoir is converted into electricity through low head hydro turbines small scale laboratory test and offshore test with the scale of 1 4 5 showed that the device operates effectively in terms of the pto performance soerensen et al 2000 hansen et al 2003 frigaard et al 2006 beels et al 2010 investigated the influence of the existence of the wave dragon device on the surrounding wave field due to its excellent wave absorbing performance the wave dragon device has the potential to act as a breakwater nørgaard et al 2011 3 4 wec array with sheltering function the essential purpose of a wave farm i e wec array is to transform wave energy into other useful forms this means that the incident wave energy will be partially absorbed while the waves transmitted through the wec array and consequently the wave height at the lee side of the wec array is mitigated carballo et al 2013 mcnatt et al 2015 flocard et al 2017 abanades et al 2018 rodriguez delgado et al 2018 naturally the wave farm may possess the function of sheltering or providing coastal protection from erosion the conventional coastal protection structures are single functional and no other benefits can be achieved many attempts have been made to realize multiple functionality including wave energy utilization wave attenuation etc wave farms with a coastal protection feature are preferable for their advantageous multiple function cost sharing and space sharing mcnatt et al 2015 presents the wave fields as shown in fig 17 around a wec array consisting of several point absorbers situated by using an analytical method based on linear potential theory it can be directly observed that wave height at the lee side of the wec array is obviously smaller than that at the weather side this may provide intuitive evidence that a wec farm can act as a single synergistic structure with effective wave attenuation performance zanuttigh et al 2010 analyzed the breakwater performance and energy conversion efficiency of a floating wec i e dexa the dexa device is essentially formed by two hinged floating buoys and the relative motion of the hinged buoys drives the pto system using the dexa device energy conversion efficiency of 10 35 can be achieved in laboratory conditions the transmission coefficient for the single device and double devices with staggered configuration are 0 8 and 0 6 respectively zanuttigh et al 2013 from this trend it can be deduced that more effective wave attenuation performance can be obtained for a wec array with many dexa devices since a reduction in wave height is observed behind a wave farm it can be used to protect coastal areas from erosion the role of the wave farm from a perspective of providing coastal protection from erosion is analyzed in refs bergillos et al 2018 abanades et al 2014 2015 as is expected the wave farm induces a wave height reduction at its lee side and significant reduction in erosion of the beach can be achieved it is worth noting that the distance between the coast and the wave farm affects the shelter pattern abanades et al 2015 mendoza et al 2014 investigated the beach response to wave farms consisting of classical wecs such as dexa wave dragon seabreath blow jet etc acting as a coastal defense they pointed out that the farm layout with several lines of wecs is favorable for near shore protection purpose nevertheless the other coastal activities such as aquaculture navigations etc should be taken into account while designing such kinds of wave farm with the function of coastal protection sheltering effect is an important function of a wave farm in addition to the function of coastal protection from erosion wave farm can provide sheltering for other marine operations such as offshore wind farm aquaculture facilities etc weiss et al 2018 many hybrid wave wind farm schemes have been proposed astariz et al 2015a b pérez collazo et al 2015 due to the sheltering effect of the wave farm wave conditions at the proposed areas will be more moderate veigas et al 2014 astariz et al 2015a b astariz et al 2015 onea et al 2016 hence longer design life periods and lower maintenance costs for the offshore wind turbines can be realized similarly offshore renewable energy devices can also provide power for the offshore aquaculture facilities and stimulate the synergies between the two aspects this may provide opportunities for co location of offshore renewable energy devices and aquaculture farms making full use of the function of sheltering and power supply features of wecs may enhance the competitiveness of the ocean wave energy resource 4 issues and challenges the floating breakwater wec hybrid systems possess dual functions i e breakwater function and wave energy utilization the performance indexes of the hybrid systems are different from that of original breakwaters or wecs with single function for the conventional structures only one indicator transmission coefficient or wave energy conversion efficiency may be of concern however for the hybrid systems both the functions of wave energy conversion and coastal protection shall be considered collectively hence the design methods or the test procedures for the conventional breakwaters or wecs may not suitable for the hybrid systems for the hybrid breakwater wec systems the ideal condition is that the incident wave energy is totally absorbed by the wecs and the scattered wave energy is canceled at a wide frequency range previous theoretical investigations reveal that an efficiency of 100 can be achieved for devices with multiple dofs evans 1976 however it is challenging to achieve this ideal condition in reality it is understood that the transmission coefficient is an important indicator while evaluating the wave attenuation performance of the floating breakwater for a specific floating breakwater that meets the engineering application design the transmission coefficient should be maintained below 0 5 hence under the premise of k t 0 5 hybrid systems with higher energy conversion efficiency are more competitive table 2 showed the achievable transmission coefficient and efficiency of some selected hybrid systems it can be observed that the hybrid systems with ob type wecs perform better in terms of the wave energy conversion efficiency improvement of the energy conversion performance of the wecs can be achieved by two methods 1 making full use of the waves reflected from the adjacent structures 2 optimizing the energy capturing buoy performance through methods such as the use of asymmetrical bodies such as the tbw in addition the effective frequency bandwidth with effective efficiency and qualified transmission coefficient is another important indicator that evaluates the performance of the hybrid system hybrid systems with broader effective frequency bandwidth are favorable for most of the floating breakwaters poor wave attenuation performance in long wave conditions may lower their competitiveness for hybrid systems that possess the characteristics of floating breakwater similar issues still exist generally floating breakwaters work effectively in short waves however wave energy devices operate ineffectively with features of low efficiency high efficiency for wec system in short waves is very important for the applications in the sea areas with mild wave conditions such as the east china sea wang et al 2011 hence improving the energy conversion efficiency in short waves and the wave attenuation performance in long waves is necessary to broaden the effective frequency bandwidth of the floating hybrid systems most of the existing investigations were conducted in long crested wave conditions however real ocean waves are multidirectional and coexist with wave currents there are some investigations that evaluate the performance of the conventional wecs in multi directional waves such as göteman et al 2018 however considering the hybrid systems the data indicating the performance of the integrated system in short crested waves and coexisting wave current fields is rare and there is a necessity for further investigations the survivability of the hybrid system in extreme waves determines its prospects in engineering applications tiron et al 2015 saincher et al 2016 the occurrence of extreme wave events accompanies the interaction of breaking waves and structures these are complex phenomenons characterized by flow separation and air entrainment saincher and banerjee 2016 wei et al 2016 chen et al 2018 martin medina et al 2018 fundamentally developing corresponding efficient numerical techniques such as the cfd method and high quality experimental procedures may pave the way to understand this complex hydrodynamic problem saincher and banerjee 2016 windt et al 2018 further exploring the mechanics of the hydrodynamic behavior of floating buoys in breaking waves and proposing advanced protection strategies in extreme conditions are necessary to improve the survivability of the hybrid system so far most of the concepts are in the stage of theoretical study or small scale laboratory test as a design stage that must be completed large scale experiments and sea trial tests with the implementation of the real hydraulic pto systems are urged 5 conclusions in this paper a literature review was presented with a focus on the research and development of various types of hybrid floating breakwater wec systems over the past few years the features and the advantages and disadvantages of different types of floating integrations were described the corresponding challenges and issues were specified from the point view of fundamental hydrodynamics and technical solutions the conventional floating breakwaters and conventional wave energy devices are introduced and categorized based on their working principles as hybrid structures with dual functionality wave energy utilization and wave attenuation the floating breakwater wec systems are categorized as the wave energy utilizing type breakwater the floating breakwater wec systems are divided into four categories floating breakwater ob type wec system floating breakwater owc type wec system floating breakwater overtopping type wec system and floating wec array with sheltering function since such kind of systems were characterized by the cost sharing space sharing and their multiple capabilities the concept of combining the two aspects of coastal protection and wave energy utilization is beneficial to reduce the construction cost of both floating breakwaters and wecs in addition we present some investigations on wave farms with the dual function of coastal protection from erosion and sheltering

22667,the pressure decimation and interpolation pdi method is an effective numerical technique to improve the computational efficiency of a non hydrostatic model we carried out an analysis of the wave dispersion relation and quantitative measurements of numerical dissipation and diffusion affected by the pdi scheme in modeling of internal waves the linear analysis on the wave dispersion relation shows that the accuracy in predicting wave dispersion depends highly on how well the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure is represented over depth the accuracy is not only dependent on the resolution of the pressure grid but also on the interpolation method the third order spline interpolation provides a more accurate wave dispersion relation than the lower order linear and quadratic interpolation quantitative measurements of wave energy transfer from the basin scale internal seiche to small scale internal solitary waves as well as numerical dissipation and diffusion in the pdi model were performed in the simulation of internal waves results show that the resolution of the pressure grid has a major effect on the wave dispersion but a negligible effect on the numerical dissipation and diffusion the velocity grid resolution has a significant influence on the numerical diffusion and a minor effect on the numerical dissipation keywords non hydrostatic wave model pressure decimation and interpolation wave dispersion numerical dissipation numerical diffusion 1 introduction non hydrostatic ocean coastal models are usually used to simulate small scale processes such as internal waves e g stashchuk and vlasenko 2009 gravity ocean currents özgökmen et al 2003 stratified channel flows e g zhou et al 2017 as well as small scale features of river plumes e g plant et al 2009 shi et al 2017 yuichi and atsuhiko 2018 different from traditional navier stokes solvers with surface tracking methods hirt and nichols 1981 harlow and welch 1965 a non hydrostatic ocean model uses a lagrangian or semi lagrangian coordinate such as a terrain following coordinate σ coordinate or isopycnal coordinate in the vertical direction to reduce the computational effort in surface tracking this coordinate transformation technique has been widely used in 3d ocean models with the hydrostatic approximation recently non hydrostatic versions of some hydrostatic ocean models have been developed by extending their hydrostatic solvers into non hydrostatic solvers e g berntsen and furnes 2005 lai et al 2010 the extensions were usually made using two distinctive approaches one is the non poisson solver based method the other is the poisson solver based method the non poisson solver based method directly implements the dynamic pressure integrated from the vertical momentum equation into the horizontal pressure gradient terms in the horizontal momentum equations without coupling the mass conservation equation in order to avoid the inversion of a poisson equation however this decoupled scheme which was in the treatment of the incompressibility constraint and the balance of momentum has been identified to be the major deficiency which causes numerical instability see detailed analysis in klingbeil and burchard 2013 therefore the non poisson solver based method has a limited range of applicability that is the weakly dispersive regime assuming that the dominant part of the pressure field is hydrostatic and the non hydrostatic effects represent a small correction it may fail in modeling highly dispersive physical processes which need a tight coupling between mass and momentum conservations in order to ensure the incompressibility the poisson solver based method usually uses the so called two step projection method casulli 1999 ma et al 2012 fang et al 2015a b in which the total pressure is divided into the dynamic pressure more precisely called non hydrostatic pressure and hydrostatic pressure in the first step intermediate values of velocities are computed from the momentum equations with the dynamic pressure term ignored in the second step the continuity equation and momentum equations which are forced by the dynamic pressure only are coupled to form a pressure poisson equation when the dynamic pressure is solved velocities are corrected using the dynamic pressure field this two step procedure is similar to the method used in sophisticated computational fluid dynamics models cfd but the computational efficiency of such a non hydrostatic model is much higher than a traditional cfd model in terms of using σ or isopycnal coordinate the drawback of the σ or isopycnal coordinate models is that the single valued surface or interface cannot represent overturning motions for instance surface wave breaking and the kelvin helmholtz instability especially for isopycnal coordinate models some non hydrostatic models such as swash zijlema et al 2011 and nhwave ma et al 2012 use the shock capturing numerical scheme to treat the wave breaking process as a hydraulic bore highly dispersive wave transformations and breaking in the surf zone are big challenges for numerical modeling zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 the poisson solver based non hydrostatic models have been proved to be accurate for modeling surface waves in a large range of k h value which measures the strength of wave dispersion k and h represent wave number and still water depth respectively with scalar tracers such as salinity and temperature and the baroclinic forcing incorporated in the model it can simulate small scale non hydrostatic processes of stratified flows in the ocean as pointed out by many researchers in the field of the non hydrostatic model development the primary burden of a non hydrostatic model is the three dimensional poisson solver for solving the non hydrostatic pressure which significantly increases the computational cost compared to a hydrostatic model shi et al 2015 pointed out that up to 70 of the total computational cost may be from the pressure poisson solver in cases with a high grid resolution with the increasing demands of applying a non hydrostatic model in a large scale computational domain improving their efficiency has become necessary recently considerable efforts have been made in either simplifying the poisson equation e g berntsen and furnes 2005 cui et al 2014 liu et al 2016 or improving numerical methods e g van reeuwijk 2002 shi et al 2015 rijnsdorp et al 2017 to reduce the computational cost in solving the dynamic pressure field one of the promising methods for reducing computational cost is the pressure decimation which means the use of a small number of vertical layers in solving the pressure poisson equation the idea was from the fact that for modeling of surface waves using a non hydrostatic model only a few vertical layers are required to get accurate wave dispersion characteristics if the dynamic pressure is discretized in an edge based grid system such as the keller box scheme stelling and zijlema 2003 ma et al 2012 based on this idea independent numbers of pressure layers and horizontal velocity layers can be configured with a small number of pressure layers than that of velocity layers although this idea was created independently by different developers van reeuwijk 2002 was the first one to try this method in simulating surface waves shi et al 2015 implemented this method in the model framework of non hydrostatic wave model nhwave with focusing on stratified flow conditions they named this method as pressure decimation and interpolation pdi most recently rijnsdorp et al 2017 solved the pressure field in a coarse grid and velocity field in a subgrid fine grid in a coupled manner referred to as subgrid model although the approaches mentioned above are based on the same idea of pressure decimation some differences in implementation details can be easily identified as described in rijnsdorp et al 2017 their subgrid model does not solve the momentum equation for the subgrid vertical velocity but instead the subgrid vertical velocity is obtained from the subgrid continuity equation this approach can ensure the mass conservation at the subgrid level in contrast shi et al 2015 solves momentum equations in all three directions at the fine grid level but with the decimated pressure values interpolated from the coarse pressure grid to the fine velocity grid the mass conservation is ensured by solving the depth integrated mass conservation equation in the fine grid in addition shi et al found that the cubic spline interpolation provides the best result in comparison to the linear and quadratic interpolations while rijnsdorp et al showed that the linear interpolation gives better dispersive properties than higher order interpolations their analysis indicated that the dispersive properties of the subgrid model are identical to the coarse grid model as the linear interpolation is applied however the high order interpolations provide more reasonable vertical profiles of horizontal velocities as indicated in their tests for modeling stratified flows the vertical resolution of the flow field is even more important than that for surface wave applications the accuracy of the baroclinic forcing depends on how accurately an effective scalar tracer is advected by flow velocities the vertical grid resolution has two impacts on numerical errors one is the numerical dissipation which attributes to the truncation errors in the discretized momentum equations and directly links the grid size in the vertical direction the other is the numerical diffusion which changes the system potential energy due to the numerical diffusion of the effective tracer wadzuk and hodges 2009 pointed out that the vertical grid resolution not only has a great effect on dispersive properties but also the numerical diffusion although it is difficult to measure quantitatively how the numerical diffusion dissipation affects the non hydrostatic process it is clear that in some specific cases such as modeling the solitary wave generation in the internal wave seiche e g wadzuk and hodges 2009 the numerical diffusion dissipation were found to reduce the isopycnal gradient sharpening and thus eliminate soliton generation and change the wave speed the pdi method or the subgrid method by rijnsdorp et al which uses independent grids for the pressure poisson equation and velocity momentum equations provides an opportunity to study the wave dispersive properties and numerical dissipation diffusion separately based on the conclusions drawn from the previous studies mentioned above the accuracy of the linear dispersive behavior is largely determined by the number of the pressure layers and the numerical diffusion dissipation are dominated by the number of velocity tracer layers the interplay between the velocity tracer grid resolution and pressure decimation needs to be justified in simulations of non hydrostatic stratified flows in shi et al 2015 the model configuration associated with the pressure decimation was performed on the basis of trial and error there is no quantitative analysis which measures errors caused by the pressure decimation and the velocity tracer grid resolution in this study we re examine the model accuracy in predicting wave dispersive properties using the linear dispersion analysis on the pressure decimated equations the numerical dissipation and diffusion are measured in the case of horn et al s experiment which has been treated as a benchmark case in several similar studies for testing model performances in simulating nonlinear internal waves for the rest of the paper section 2 briefly reviews the governing equations and the procedures of the pdi algorithm the linear dispersive analysis is carried out for different configurations of the pdi scheme in section 3 we selected two cases of horn et al 2001 to investigate model performances with different pdi configurations wave dispersion properties numerical dissipation and diffusion resulted from different vertical grid resolutions were discussed in section 4 followed by a brief conclusion given in section 5 2 model description 2 1 governing equations nhwave was originally developed to model three dimensional 3 d fully dispersive fully nonlinear surface wave propagation in free surface and terrain following coordinates ma et al 2012 by adding the capabilities of solving salinity and suspended sediment transport and the corresponding baroclinic forcing nhwave was extended to a non hydrostatic ocean coastal model ma et al 2013 shi et al 2015 the extended nhwave was verified validated with a lock exchange density current problem reported in other numerical studies härtel et al 2000 fringer et al 2006 lai et al 2010 laboratory measurements of turbidity density currents garcia 1993 and thermal infrared remote sensing data at the mouth of columbia river shi et al 2017 the complete equations and discrete method can be found in ma et al 2012 2013 the pdi method used in the model can refer to shi et al 2015 here we only show a brief description of governing equations which may help to understand the methodology in the context of the analysis described in later sections the continuity and momentum equations in σ coordinates are written in a compact form as 1 d t d u x d v y ω σ 0 2 u t f x g y h σ s h s q s ρ where d η h is the total water depth in which η is the free surface elevation and h is the still water depth u d u d v d w t in which u v w are velocities in x y z directions ω is the contravariant component of the vertical velocity in the σ coordinate f g h represent fluxes terms defined in ma et al 2012 s h s q s ρ are source terms which include the bottom slope term dynamic pressure gradient and baroclinic forcing derived from the boussinesq approximation respectively turbulent mixing term is intentionally neglected in this study in order to evaluate the numerical dissipation in 2 the baroclinic source term s ρ is given by 3 s ρ g d r 4 r 1 ρ 0 z η ρ d z where ρ 0 is the constant reference density and ρ is equal to the mixture density ρ m minus the reference density ρ ρ m ρ 0 integrating continuity equation 1 over the water column yields an equation to describe the location of the free surface 5 d t x d 0 1 u d σ y d 0 1 v d σ 0 the motion of passive tracers such as water salinity and temperature are solved using the advection and diffusion equation given by 6 ψ c t θ c ψ c s c where ψ c represents a passive tracer scalar s c is the source sink term and neglected in the present study in order to examine the effect of numerical diffusion and θ c ψ c represents the flux of the tracer θ c ψ c d u ψ c i d v ψ c j d ω ψ c k in which i j k are the unit vectors in x y z directions numerically nhwave uses a combined finite volume and finite difference scheme with a godunov type method for the spatial discretization and a two stage second order ssp runge kutta r k scheme gottlieb et al 2001 for time stepping the two step projection method which splits the time integration into a hydrostatic predictor phase and the non hydrostatic corrector phase is used within each r k stage the computational grid is cartesian in the horizontal direction and follows the σ coordinate in the vertical direction all primary variables are defined at the cell center except the dynamic pressure and the contravariant component of the vertical velocity ω which are defined at the cell face in order to use the keller box scheme it should be clarified that in ma et al 2012 the location of ω was not clearly defined which may cause a confusion in the use of the keller box scheme in addition locating both the dynamic pressure and the vertical velocity rather than only the dynamic pressure at the cell face is crucial to get accurate wave dispersion characteristics pieter smit personal communication 2 2 pressure decimation and interpolation pdi method the pdi method is implemented by choosing a subset of vertical grid points from the full velocity grid fine grid and implements the poisson solver for dynamic pressure only on the subset coarse in the two step projection process the intermediate values of velocity field are first evaluated on the full velocity grid by solving the momentum equations without the dynamic pressure and then averaged piecewise on to the coarse grid the dynamic pressure is calculated on the coarse grid by solving the pressure poison equation which is obtained by coupling the vertical momentum equation and the mass conservation equation on the basis of independent variables on the coarse grid after the dynamic pressure is obtained on the coarse grid it is interpolated on to the fine grid using an interpolation method such as linear quadratic cubic or fourth order spline interpolation as described in shi et al 2015 the velocity field is corrected on the fine grid using the horizontal momentum equations with the dynamic pressure only finally the surface elevation is solved using the integrated mass conservation equations 5 the passive tracers are solved using the advection diffusion equation 6 on the fine grid in the two grid systems the incompressible condition is satisfied by the poisson equation on the coarse grid and the mass conservation is guaranteed by using the vertical integrated continuity and the tracer advection diffusion equations 2 3 linear dispersion relation associated with pdi the accuracy of the linear dispersion relation predicted by a non hydrostatic model is largely dependent on the vertical resolution of the model as indicated by semi discrete analysis in smit et al 2014 here we use another semi discrete approach to demonstrate how the linear dispersion behavior of a model is related to the pressure decimation and interpolation strategy without loss of generality we start with a stratified two layer flow system with both surface waves and interfacial waves as shown in fig 1 we assume that both surface and interfacial waves are small amplitude linear waves using the concept of non hydrostatic pressure used in a non hydrostatic wave model the linearized vertical 2d equations of mass and the horizontal momentum conservation can be written as 7 u 1 x w 1 z 0 8 ρ 1 u 1 t ρ 1 g η 1 x q 1 x 0 for the upper layer and 9 u 2 x w 2 z 0 10 ρ 2 u 2 t ρ 1 g η 1 x ρ 2 ρ 1 g η 2 x q 2 x 0 for the lower layer in 7 10 the subscripts 1 2 represent variables for the upper layer and the lower layer respectively u w are horizontal and vertical velocities respectively η represents elevation q is the dynamic pressure and ρ represents flow density integrating 7 and 9 over the layer depths and using the linearized kinematic boundary conditions 11 η 1 t w 1 0 12 η 2 t w 1 h 1 w 2 h 1 13 w h 0 result in the depth integrated mass conservation equations for the two layers 14 η 1 t η 2 t h 1 0 u 1 x d z 0 15 η 2 t h h 1 u 2 x d z 0 introducing plane wave solution as 16 η j u j q j a j z u ˆ j z q ˆ j z e i k x ω t δ j where j 1 2 k ω and δ represent the wave number angular frequency and phase substituting the solution into 14 15 8 and 10 and recognizing the equations by eliminating the velocity variable results in the dispersion relation from the equations for the upper layer we get 17 ω 2 k 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 g h 1 k 2 ρ 1 a 1 a 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 h 1 0 q ˆ 1 d z and for the lower layer 18 ω 2 ρ 1 g k 2 a 1 ρ 2 a 2 h 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 g k 2 h 2 k 2 ρ 2 a 2 h h 1 q ˆ 2 d z it can be proved that 17 and 18 are identical in representing the linear dispersion relation in the two layer system eqs 17 and 18 suggest that the accuracy of the dispersion solutions would be dependent on how well the structures of q ˆ 1 and q ˆ 2 over layer depths are represented to demonstrate how the pressure decimation and interpolation method affect the solution we consider a case of two layers with the rigid lid at the surface by assuming a 1 0 and using a a 2 the dispersion relation can be expressed as 19 ω 2 k 2 ρ 1 a h 1 0 q ˆ 1 d z or 20 ω 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 g k 2 h 2 k 2 ρ 2 a h h 1 q ˆ 2 d z because 19 and 20 are identical we only use 19 to examine the solution of the dispersion relation affected by the pdi method the analytical solutions of q ˆ 1 and the linear dispersion relation for the case of rigid lid are derived in appendix based on 60 the dimensionless of the non hydrostatic pressure q 1 q ˆ 1 ρ 1 g a can be written as 21 q 1 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 coth k h 1 coth k h 2 cosh k h 1 z sinh k h 1 and the analytical solution for the linear dispersion relation for the upper layer is 22 ω 2 g k ρ 1 ρ 2 coth k h 1 coth k h 2 where g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 is the reduced gravity for the discretized solution of the linear dispersion relation its sensitivity to number of layers can be analyzed by constructing trapezoidal integral approximation assuming that the discrete values of the integrand are given by the exact solution the upper layer is divided into n pressure layers with equal thickness δ z h 1 n the discretized form of 19 can be written as 23 ω n 2 g k 2 h 1 2 n j 1 n q 1 z j q 1 z j 1 where z j h 1 j n 1 n as the q 1 is set on the lower interface of the vertical grid eq 23 can be written using the phase speed c n as 24 c n 2 g h 1 2 n j 1 n q 1 z j q 1 z j 1 now we use the pdi technique by dividing each pressure layer into m sub layers the pressure values of which are estimated using an interpolation method such as 25 q 1 i z j i i q 1 z j where q 1 i z j i represents the interpolated pressure value at the sub layer location z j i within the layer j in which i 1 m i represents an interpolation function the phase speed 24 then becomes 26 c n 2 g h 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 m q 1 i z j i q 1 i z j i 1 as the pdi method is used to analyze the influence of vertical layer number on wave dispersion we consider a two layer flow with h 1 h 2 the flow densities are ρ 1 1000 kg m 3 and δ ρ ρ 2 ρ 1 20 kg m 3 which are comparable to the case of horn et al 2001 fig 2 shows the ratio of the discrete solution of the phase speed c n to the theoretical phase speed c e versus the wave dispersive parameter μ k h 1 the results from the full grid models 4 4 16 16 and 64 64 indicate that the increase in the layer numbers improves the accuracy in predicting the phase speed the model results are convergent to the exact solution with increase of the vertical layers to demonstrate the effects of pressure decimation and different interpolation method we used the pdi scheme and decimated the non hydrostatic pressure using 4 and 16 pressure layers on the 64 layer grid such as 64 4 and 64 16 the interpolation method used here are the quadratic q in the figure legend and cubic c in the figure legend spline interpolations as shown in the figure both the quadratic and cubic spline interpolations provide more accurate phase speeds than the low resolution full grid model e g comparing 64 4 to 4 4 or 64 16 to 16 16 the cubic spline interpolation gives more accurate result than the quadratic interpolation note that the linear interpolation gives the same result as the low resolution full grid model indicating no improvement of the dispersion relation from the linear interpolation the benefit of using the pdi method is the higher computational efficiency compared to the full grid model as described in both shi et al 2015 and smit et al 2014 it should be mentioned that the model performances presented in fig 2 are generally worse than that from the numerical tests of standing waves in ma et al 2012 it is probably caused by that the linear analysis used here may not accurately reflect the actual model performance in modeling wave dispersion however this analysis can provide an estimate of how the pdi scheme and interpolation methods affect the model dispersion properties the accuracies of the dispersion relation predicted by different interpolation methods can be explained by how well an interpolation method fits the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure fig 3 shows the vertical distribution of the analytical non hydrostatic pressure dimensionless in comparison to curve fitting using different orders of polynomial functions with the four pressure grid points the cubic spline interpolation shows the best fit to the exact solution 3 numerical experiment the numerical error in modeling wave dispersion numerical diffusion and dissipation are three major error sources in modeling internal waves using a non hydrostatic model for a general non hydrostatic model without a pdi method it is difficult to evaluate the separate effects of the three errors because the three errors are interacted however the pdi scheme provides a tool to separate the numerical dispersion effect from the effects of the numerical dissipation and diffusion to quantitatively examine the effects of the three errors and the model performance with different grid configurations of the pdi scheme we carried out numerical simulations of the laboratory experiment of internal waves conducted by horn et al 2001 the measured dataset has been used for numerical model validations by many researchers horn et al 2001 carried out the experiments of internal solitary wave soliton generation triggered by a large scale internal standing wave in an enclosed tank with a length of 6 m and width of 0 29 m as shown in fig 4 a two layer density fluid is initially filled into the tank with a titled interface the heights of the upper layer h 1 and lower layer h 2 at the center of the tank are 0 087 m and 0 203 m respectively the initial elevations of the interface at the lateral boundaries η 0 vary in different cases in this study we simulate two cases with initial elevations of η 0 0 0261 and 0 0522 m denoted as case 1 and case 2 respectively in the present study the density difference in the experiment is approximate δ ρ 20 2 kg m 3 thus the value of ρ 2 is set to be 1020 5 kg m 3 and the density of the upper layer ρ 1 is equal to the density of freshwater the initial density field can be expressed as 27 ρ x z ρ 1 δ ρ 2 1 tanh z h 0 δ 0 h 0 x η 0 x l 2 l 2 where h 0 is the depth of the interface l is the length of the numerical domain δ 0 1 cm is the thickness of the interface the horizontal grid size is 0 002 m which is based on the convergence tests on horizontal grid refinement the vertical layer numbers are 60 60 60 30 60 20 60 10 and 10 10 representing different grid configurations in the pdi method the interpolation method used in pdi method is the third order spline in addition a hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers was also used for a comparison as mentioned in the previous section the physical viscosity and diffusivity are not included in the model in order to analyze the numerical dissipation and diffusion fig 5 shows the time series of interface displacement at the center of the domain from the measurements the non hydrostatic models with the grid configurations of 60 60 and 60 10 as well as the hydrostatic model the upper and lower panel correspond to case 1 and case 2 respectively the non hydrostatic models with both grid configurations captured general characteristics of the degeneration of the long internal standing wave and the generation of internal solitary waves in particular the nonlinear steepening induces the initial small scale disturbances at t 160 s for case 1 and at t 120 s for case 2 the disturbances further develop into internal solitary wave trains due to the balance between nonlinear steeping and dispersion the non hydrostatic models predicted well both the timing of solitary generation and the wave amplitudes there is no visual difference found in the results between the full grid model 60 60 and the pdi model 60 10 indicating the pdi method works well in both cases the hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers predicted the interface displacement comparable to non hydrostatic cases before the emergence of nonlinear dispersive waves t 160 s in case 1 and t 120 s in case 2 however it completely failed to predict the small scale solitary generation in both cases due to lack of the dispersive mechanism the low resolution full grid model 10 10 predicted incorrect wave speed as well as wave amplitude in both cases which are incomparable to the data not shown in fig 5 the poor performance of the low resolution model will be explained in the following figures fig 6 illustrates the vertical distribution of density at t 140 s in case 2 from the full grid non hydrostatic models with the high grid resolution 60 60 the low grid resolution 10 10 the pdi model 60 10 as well as the hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers the pdi model 60 10 shows the large front wave followed by oscillation tails visually identical to the result from the high resolution full grid model 60 60 in comparison the hydrostatic model predicted a bore like front without tails behind it indicating no small scale solitary generation in the non dispersive model it is interesting to look at the result from the low resolution full grid model 10 10 although small scale waves are generated the phase speed of the front wave is much slower and does not show much steeping as in the other models the slowing down of the phase speed can be explained by the decrease in stratification caused by large numerical diffusion in the coarse grid model which will be discussed in the following section the model performance in modeling dispersive waves can be also examined by how well a model predicts the vertical distribution of non hydrostatic pressure fig 7 shows a snapshot of the vertical distribution of non hydrostatic pressure predicted by the pdi model 60 10 at t 140 s in comparison to the full grid model 60 60 and 10 10 with the high resolution of the velocity grid the pressure decimation did not have an obvious effect on the vertical distribution of the non hydrostatic pressure as shown in the comparison between the pdi model 60 10 and the high grid resolution full grid model 60 60 the low resolution full grid model 10 10 showed incorrect vertical distribution of the non hydrostatic pressure as represented by the phase lag and smaller magnitudes compared to other models the other aspect in evaluating the pdi method is the computational efficiency for this specific application the computational time of the pdi model 60 10 for solving the pressure field sum of poisson solver and interpolation is about 5 times less than the full grid model 60 60 the interpolation step only costs about 10 of the time used for the low resolution poisson solver 4 discussion in a practical application of the pdi method the grid configuration associated with the decimation ratio r p d i n v n p is ad hoc on trial and error basis it is inconvenient for modelers to use such a method in practice even for a full grid model without the pdi technique there is no equivalent quantifiable principal to decide the vertical resolution stewart et al 2017 the determination of the vertical resolution should not only consider the physical processes to be resolved but also the role of numerical errors therefore understanding the effects of grid resolution on energy conservation and re distribution is helpful for choosing an optimal grid configuration to predict correct physics in this section the effect of vertical grid resolution on wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion are analyzed 4 1 effect of the vertical grid configuration a range of model runs with different vertical pressure layers and velocity layers were conducted to investigate how a grid configuration affects non hydrostatic model s performance table 1 lists two groups of cases in group a the number of the pressure layers n p is decreased from 10 to 3 with fixed number of velocity layers n v 60 group b varies the number of velocity layers n v from 60 to 20 with fixed number of pressure layers n p 10 note that the grid configuration 60 10 is well validated case in the last section and thus treated as the baseline case in the following tests fig 8 compares the pycnocline displacements at the central wave gauge from the models in group a to demonstrate the time scale of the nonlinear steeping we followed the approach of wadzuk and hodges 2009 who normalized the time using the steeping time scale t s defined by 28 t s 1 6 η 0 h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 t where t 109 s is the period of the basin scale internal wave in the case the figure shows that the three models predicted the identical pycnocline displacement in the period of t t s before the dispersion takes effect after this period the models with less pressure layers especially for the model of 60 3 in case b starts to derivate from the baseline case the differences can be found in both wave amplitude and phase with more significant difference in wave amplitude the k h value for case b is about 2 9 based on the analysis in section 2 the grid configuration of 60 3 may induce considerable errors in computing the dispersion effect the model tends to weaken the generation of solitary waves and under predict the wave phase speed to further analyze the influence of the pressure grid resolution in the pdi scheme fast fourier transform fft is employed to transform the spatial distribution of the interface displacement into the spectral field the expression of fft is given by 29 w x σ n n 1 n w n k x e i k x x where k x is the wave number w n is the fourier coefficient n is the half number of the grid in the x direction to get the relative importance of the various spectral components we normalize the spectrum by the following equation 30 p n w n 2 σ n n 1 n w n 2 the relative power spectral density p r is shown in fig 9 at t t s 1 the effect of nonlinear wave steeping is unobvious which shows a similar shapes of p r in results of different pressure grid configuration the other two lines show how the energy transfers from the basin scale internal wave to larger wave numbers shorter wavelengths at t t s 5 the peak power shifts to k x 5 8 s 1 and the energy contribution of the basin scale internal wave decreases to 0 22 of the total energy when 60 10 layers are used in contrast the initial basin scale wave still occupies the energy peak in the case with coarser pressure layers the relative wave energy in the basin scale wave is larger than the energy in the case with finer vertical pressure grid which accounts for 38 of the total wave energy however the p r only shows the relative values of the wave energy at different wave numbers the absolute wave energy values of the basin scale wave at t t s 5 is larger in the case with 60 10 layers than the values produced by 60 3 layers which is consistent with the differences of interface displacement in fig 8 the model with 60 3 layers cannot well predict the wave phase speed as well as the wave amplitudes due to the misrepresentation of the vertical non hydrostatic pressure profile in fact the non hydrostatic pressure may not induce extra energy dissipation directly for the evolution of internal wave however the error in simulating non hydrostatic pressure can change the balance between steeping and non hydrostatic dispersion in case with η 0 2 61 cm the model can well represent the wave amplitude with slight wave phase lag but greatly underestimate wave amplitude with increasing η 0 to 5 22 cm thus the model skill highly depends on the importance of the non hydrostatic steeping hodges et al 2006 the influence of the number of velocity layers n v was examined in group b tests fig 10 shows the same plot as fig 8 but compares the baseline case to the grid configurations with reduced velocity layers i e 40 10 and 20 10 the comparison shows that the models with coarser velocity grid under predicted the wave phase speed as represented by phase lags compared to the baseline model the lower grid resolution for tracer transport causes greater numerical diffusion and thus reduces the pycnocline gradient the reduced gravity effect slows down the wave propagation 4 2 viscosity and diffusivity the numerical dissipation represents the error associated with a kinetic energy loss due to the truncation error of a numerical scheme used in the momentum equations so the numerical dissipation can also be considered as a function of numerical viscosity the numerical diffusion represents the diffusive behavior caused by the numerical truncation error from the mass conservation equation and can be regarded as numerical diffusivity in the analysis presented below we followed the approach proposed by hodges et al 2006 and use the concepts of numerical viscosity and diffusivity to measure effects of the pdi scheme the effective numerical viscosity defined by hodges et al 2006 can be written as 31 ν e δ 0 h 1 h 2 t t 0 l n e d t e d t 0 where e d represents the dynamic energy of the whole system including the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the density field displaced from the lowest potential energy state the lowest potential energy state means the minimum possible energy which the density field can return in an adiabatic system the total dynamic energy e d should be constant with time in an inviscid flow system in the calculation of 31 the dynamic energy was integrated over the entire domain at the time interval of t t 0 in which t 0 is the initial time the effective numerical diffusivity is defined by the changes in the background potential energy as 32 κ e δ 0 2 8 t t 0 δ 0 2 8 t t 0 1 24 δ e b a g ρ 2 ρ 1 δ 0 2 1 2 note that e b should be constant with time if no diffusion is involved in the density flow system by using measures expressed in 31 and 32 the effects of the numerical dissipation and diffusion can be considerably separated the detailed description of this method can be found in hodges et al 2006 or wadzuk and hodges 2009 fig 11 shows a time series of ν e calculated from 31 for different pdi grid configurations in simulations of the two cases the numerical viscosity calculated from the two cases shows the similar trend of viscosity accumulation over time but different magnitudes of viscosity value comparing case 1 η 0 2 61 cm case 2 η 0 5 22 cm shows larger numerical viscosity values and more obvious discrepancies between different grid configurations in particular large differences can be found between the models with different numbers of velocity layers decreasing the number of velocity layers results in increased numerical viscosity however the numerical viscosity was not affected by the reduced number of pressure as indicated by the comparison between 60 10 60 5 and 60 3 the effective numerical diffusivity calculated from the same set of models is illustrated in fig 12 the numerical diffusivity values calculated from the three higher resolution velocity grids 60 10 60 5 and 60 3 are small and do not vary much with time on the contrary the models with the lower resolution velocity grid show significantly large values of the numerical diffusivity which decrease with time it is interesting to note that the two cases shown fig 12 basically exhibit the similar pattern in diffusivity distribution meaning that for each grid configuration similar values of the numerical diffusivity were obtained from the two cases this feature can be explained by the numerical diffusion mechanism which may not be largely affected by dynamic processes in different cases it is also indicated that using the numerical viscosity and diffusivity described in 31 and 32 is an effective way to separate the different effects the comparison between figs 11 and 12 suggests that the velocity grid resolution has more significant influence on the numerical diffusivity than the numerical viscosity the values of the numerical viscosity for all tested velocity grid resolutions are close the maximum value is approximately 1 3 1 0 7 m 2 s which is smaller than the molecular viscosity but for the numerical diffusivity decreasing the number of velocity layers from 60 to 20 causes an order of magnitude increase in the numerical diffusivity values the large numerical diffusivity from the coarse velocity grid reduces the flow stratification and thus decreases the wave phase speed consistent with the results shown in fig 10 5 conclusions the present work is a continuing study of the pdi method used in a non hydrostatic model for modeling stratified flows in view of the pdi grid configuration based on trial and error in the previous study some theoretical analysis of wave dispersion property and quantitative measurements of numerical dissipation and diffusion were carried out in this study the linear analysis on the wave dispersion relation shows that the accuracy of wave dispersion in a non hydrostatic model highly depends on how well the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure is represented over depth the effect of the pressure structure on the linear dispersion relation can be described in a form of integrand of the dynamic pressure over depth in the pdi method increasing the number of vertical pressure layers can improve the accuracy in predicting the vertical pressure distribution however the analysis also shows that an appropriate interpolation method is important because a better interpolation method can compensate the errors induced by the pressure decimation for some extent a linear interpolation from a coarse pressure grid to a fine velocity grid does not change the vertical integrand and thus can only predict wave dispersion as accurate as that of the coarse grid higher order spline interpolations such as the cubic spine interpolation provides a better prediction of the wave dispersion relation as indicated by the analysis in both surface wave and internal wave cases to quantitatively examine the effects of the pdi method on wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion the laboratory experiment of horn et al 2001 was simulated with different pdi configurations the option of the hydrostatic model was also used as a non dispersive case for a comparison the results showed that the hydrostatic model only captured the wave steeping process and failed to generate small scale solitary waves the pdi method with a coarse pressure grid resolution and a fine velocity grid resolution can provide a result comparable to a high resolution full grid model as long as the pdi grid configuration is within the predictable range suggested by the linear dispersion analysis the usage of the pdi method provides a possibility to investigate the separate effects of grid resolution on the wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion the vertical resolution of the pressure grid mainly affects the accuracy of wave dispersion the simulation of horn et al 2001 showed that using extremely small number of the pressure layers prevents the energy transfer from the basin scale wave to small scale solitary waves the pressure decimation has a negligible effect on the numerical dissipation and numerical diffusion the velocity grid resolution has a major influence on the numerical diffusion the tests on different velocity grid resolutions showed that a coarser velocity grid causes larger numerical diffusion and thus reduces the pycnocline gradient as a consequence the wave phase speed is under predicted by the coarser velocity grid model the vertical velocity grid resolution only has a minor effect on the numerical dissipation the horizontal grid resolution may have a more significant effect as indicated in the tests of wadzuk and hodges 2009 but the topic is out of the scope of this study as an additional note to the linear dispersion analysis performed in this study we point out that this analysis only provides an estimate of how the pdi scheme and interpolation methods affect the model prediction of wave dispersion this analysis method showed lower model performance in predicting wave dispersion compared to actual numerical tests a further study on model s dispersion

22667,the pressure decimation and interpolation pdi method is an effective numerical technique to improve the computational efficiency of a non hydrostatic model we carried out an analysis of the wave dispersion relation and quantitative measurements of numerical dissipation and diffusion affected by the pdi scheme in modeling of internal waves the linear analysis on the wave dispersion relation shows that the accuracy in predicting wave dispersion depends highly on how well the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure is represented over depth the accuracy is not only dependent on the resolution of the pressure grid but also on the interpolation method the third order spline interpolation provides a more accurate wave dispersion relation than the lower order linear and quadratic interpolation quantitative measurements of wave energy transfer from the basin scale internal seiche to small scale internal solitary waves as well as numerical dissipation and diffusion in the pdi model were performed in the simulation of internal waves results show that the resolution of the pressure grid has a major effect on the wave dispersion but a negligible effect on the numerical dissipation and diffusion the velocity grid resolution has a significant influence on the numerical diffusion and a minor effect on the numerical dissipation keywords non hydrostatic wave model pressure decimation and interpolation wave dispersion numerical dissipation numerical diffusion 1 introduction non hydrostatic ocean coastal models are usually used to simulate small scale processes such as internal waves e g stashchuk and vlasenko 2009 gravity ocean currents özgökmen et al 2003 stratified channel flows e g zhou et al 2017 as well as small scale features of river plumes e g plant et al 2009 shi et al 2017 yuichi and atsuhiko 2018 different from traditional navier stokes solvers with surface tracking methods hirt and nichols 1981 harlow and welch 1965 a non hydrostatic ocean model uses a lagrangian or semi lagrangian coordinate such as a terrain following coordinate σ coordinate or isopycnal coordinate in the vertical direction to reduce the computational effort in surface tracking this coordinate transformation technique has been widely used in 3d ocean models with the hydrostatic approximation recently non hydrostatic versions of some hydrostatic ocean models have been developed by extending their hydrostatic solvers into non hydrostatic solvers e g berntsen and furnes 2005 lai et al 2010 the extensions were usually made using two distinctive approaches one is the non poisson solver based method the other is the poisson solver based method the non poisson solver based method directly implements the dynamic pressure integrated from the vertical momentum equation into the horizontal pressure gradient terms in the horizontal momentum equations without coupling the mass conservation equation in order to avoid the inversion of a poisson equation however this decoupled scheme which was in the treatment of the incompressibility constraint and the balance of momentum has been identified to be the major deficiency which causes numerical instability see detailed analysis in klingbeil and burchard 2013 therefore the non poisson solver based method has a limited range of applicability that is the weakly dispersive regime assuming that the dominant part of the pressure field is hydrostatic and the non hydrostatic effects represent a small correction it may fail in modeling highly dispersive physical processes which need a tight coupling between mass and momentum conservations in order to ensure the incompressibility the poisson solver based method usually uses the so called two step projection method casulli 1999 ma et al 2012 fang et al 2015a b in which the total pressure is divided into the dynamic pressure more precisely called non hydrostatic pressure and hydrostatic pressure in the first step intermediate values of velocities are computed from the momentum equations with the dynamic pressure term ignored in the second step the continuity equation and momentum equations which are forced by the dynamic pressure only are coupled to form a pressure poisson equation when the dynamic pressure is solved velocities are corrected using the dynamic pressure field this two step procedure is similar to the method used in sophisticated computational fluid dynamics models cfd but the computational efficiency of such a non hydrostatic model is much higher than a traditional cfd model in terms of using σ or isopycnal coordinate the drawback of the σ or isopycnal coordinate models is that the single valued surface or interface cannot represent overturning motions for instance surface wave breaking and the kelvin helmholtz instability especially for isopycnal coordinate models some non hydrostatic models such as swash zijlema et al 2011 and nhwave ma et al 2012 use the shock capturing numerical scheme to treat the wave breaking process as a hydraulic bore highly dispersive wave transformations and breaking in the surf zone are big challenges for numerical modeling zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 the poisson solver based non hydrostatic models have been proved to be accurate for modeling surface waves in a large range of k h value which measures the strength of wave dispersion k and h represent wave number and still water depth respectively with scalar tracers such as salinity and temperature and the baroclinic forcing incorporated in the model it can simulate small scale non hydrostatic processes of stratified flows in the ocean as pointed out by many researchers in the field of the non hydrostatic model development the primary burden of a non hydrostatic model is the three dimensional poisson solver for solving the non hydrostatic pressure which significantly increases the computational cost compared to a hydrostatic model shi et al 2015 pointed out that up to 70 of the total computational cost may be from the pressure poisson solver in cases with a high grid resolution with the increasing demands of applying a non hydrostatic model in a large scale computational domain improving their efficiency has become necessary recently considerable efforts have been made in either simplifying the poisson equation e g berntsen and furnes 2005 cui et al 2014 liu et al 2016 or improving numerical methods e g van reeuwijk 2002 shi et al 2015 rijnsdorp et al 2017 to reduce the computational cost in solving the dynamic pressure field one of the promising methods for reducing computational cost is the pressure decimation which means the use of a small number of vertical layers in solving the pressure poisson equation the idea was from the fact that for modeling of surface waves using a non hydrostatic model only a few vertical layers are required to get accurate wave dispersion characteristics if the dynamic pressure is discretized in an edge based grid system such as the keller box scheme stelling and zijlema 2003 ma et al 2012 based on this idea independent numbers of pressure layers and horizontal velocity layers can be configured with a small number of pressure layers than that of velocity layers although this idea was created independently by different developers van reeuwijk 2002 was the first one to try this method in simulating surface waves shi et al 2015 implemented this method in the model framework of non hydrostatic wave model nhwave with focusing on stratified flow conditions they named this method as pressure decimation and interpolation pdi most recently rijnsdorp et al 2017 solved the pressure field in a coarse grid and velocity field in a subgrid fine grid in a coupled manner referred to as subgrid model although the approaches mentioned above are based on the same idea of pressure decimation some differences in implementation details can be easily identified as described in rijnsdorp et al 2017 their subgrid model does not solve the momentum equation for the subgrid vertical velocity but instead the subgrid vertical velocity is obtained from the subgrid continuity equation this approach can ensure the mass conservation at the subgrid level in contrast shi et al 2015 solves momentum equations in all three directions at the fine grid level but with the decimated pressure values interpolated from the coarse pressure grid to the fine velocity grid the mass conservation is ensured by solving the depth integrated mass conservation equation in the fine grid in addition shi et al found that the cubic spline interpolation provides the best result in comparison to the linear and quadratic interpolations while rijnsdorp et al showed that the linear interpolation gives better dispersive properties than higher order interpolations their analysis indicated that the dispersive properties of the subgrid model are identical to the coarse grid model as the linear interpolation is applied however the high order interpolations provide more reasonable vertical profiles of horizontal velocities as indicated in their tests for modeling stratified flows the vertical resolution of the flow field is even more important than that for surface wave applications the accuracy of the baroclinic forcing depends on how accurately an effective scalar tracer is advected by flow velocities the vertical grid resolution has two impacts on numerical errors one is the numerical dissipation which attributes to the truncation errors in the discretized momentum equations and directly links the grid size in the vertical direction the other is the numerical diffusion which changes the system potential energy due to the numerical diffusion of the effective tracer wadzuk and hodges 2009 pointed out that the vertical grid resolution not only has a great effect on dispersive properties but also the numerical diffusion although it is difficult to measure quantitatively how the numerical diffusion dissipation affects the non hydrostatic process it is clear that in some specific cases such as modeling the solitary wave generation in the internal wave seiche e g wadzuk and hodges 2009 the numerical diffusion dissipation were found to reduce the isopycnal gradient sharpening and thus eliminate soliton generation and change the wave speed the pdi method or the subgrid method by rijnsdorp et al which uses independent grids for the pressure poisson equation and velocity momentum equations provides an opportunity to study the wave dispersive properties and numerical dissipation diffusion separately based on the conclusions drawn from the previous studies mentioned above the accuracy of the linear dispersive behavior is largely determined by the number of the pressure layers and the numerical diffusion dissipation are dominated by the number of velocity tracer layers the interplay between the velocity tracer grid resolution and pressure decimation needs to be justified in simulations of non hydrostatic stratified flows in shi et al 2015 the model configuration associated with the pressure decimation was performed on the basis of trial and error there is no quantitative analysis which measures errors caused by the pressure decimation and the velocity tracer grid resolution in this study we re examine the model accuracy in predicting wave dispersive properties using the linear dispersion analysis on the pressure decimated equations the numerical dissipation and diffusion are measured in the case of horn et al s experiment which has been treated as a benchmark case in several similar studies for testing model performances in simulating nonlinear internal waves for the rest of the paper section 2 briefly reviews the governing equations and the procedures of the pdi algorithm the linear dispersive analysis is carried out for different configurations of the pdi scheme in section 3 we selected two cases of horn et al 2001 to investigate model performances with different pdi configurations wave dispersion properties numerical dissipation and diffusion resulted from different vertical grid resolutions were discussed in section 4 followed by a brief conclusion given in section 5 2 model description 2 1 governing equations nhwave was originally developed to model three dimensional 3 d fully dispersive fully nonlinear surface wave propagation in free surface and terrain following coordinates ma et al 2012 by adding the capabilities of solving salinity and suspended sediment transport and the corresponding baroclinic forcing nhwave was extended to a non hydrostatic ocean coastal model ma et al 2013 shi et al 2015 the extended nhwave was verified validated with a lock exchange density current problem reported in other numerical studies härtel et al 2000 fringer et al 2006 lai et al 2010 laboratory measurements of turbidity density currents garcia 1993 and thermal infrared remote sensing data at the mouth of columbia river shi et al 2017 the complete equations and discrete method can be found in ma et al 2012 2013 the pdi method used in the model can refer to shi et al 2015 here we only show a brief description of governing equations which may help to understand the methodology in the context of the analysis described in later sections the continuity and momentum equations in σ coordinates are written in a compact form as 1 d t d u x d v y ω σ 0 2 u t f x g y h σ s h s q s ρ where d η h is the total water depth in which η is the free surface elevation and h is the still water depth u d u d v d w t in which u v w are velocities in x y z directions ω is the contravariant component of the vertical velocity in the σ coordinate f g h represent fluxes terms defined in ma et al 2012 s h s q s ρ are source terms which include the bottom slope term dynamic pressure gradient and baroclinic forcing derived from the boussinesq approximation respectively turbulent mixing term is intentionally neglected in this study in order to evaluate the numerical dissipation in 2 the baroclinic source term s ρ is given by 3 s ρ g d r 4 r 1 ρ 0 z η ρ d z where ρ 0 is the constant reference density and ρ is equal to the mixture density ρ m minus the reference density ρ ρ m ρ 0 integrating continuity equation 1 over the water column yields an equation to describe the location of the free surface 5 d t

the spatial discretization and a two stage second order ssp runge kutta r k scheme gottlieb et al 2001 for time stepping the two step projection method which splits the time integration into a hydrostatic predictor phase and the non hydrostatic corrector phase is used within each r k stage the computational grid is cartesian in the horizontal direction and follows the σ coordinate in the vertical direction all primary variables are defined at the cell center except the dynamic pressure and the contravariant component of the vertical velocity ω which are defined at the cell face in order to use the keller box scheme it should be clarified that in ma et al 2012 the location of ω was not clearly defined which may cause a confusion in the use of the keller box scheme in addition locating both the dynamic pressure and the vertical velocity rather than only the dynamic pressure at the cell face is crucial to get accurate wave dispersion characteristics pieter smit personal communication 2 2 pressure decimation and interpolation pdi method the pdi method is implemented by choosing a subset of vertical grid points from the full velocity grid fine grid and implements the poisson solver for dynamic pressure only on the subset coarse in the two step projection process the intermediate values of velocity field are first evaluated on the full velocity grid by solving the momentum equations without the dynamic pressure and then averaged piecewise on to the coarse grid the dynamic pressure is calculated on the coarse grid by solving the pressure poison equation which is obtained by coupling the vertical momentum equation and the mass conservation equation on the basis of independent variables on the coarse grid after the dynamic pressure is obtained on the coarse grid it is interpolated on to the fine grid using an interpolation method such as linear quadratic cubic or fourth order spline interpolation as described in shi et al 2015 the velocity field is corrected on the fine grid using the horizontal momentum equations with the dynamic pressure only finally the surface elevation is solved using the integrated mass conservation equations 5 the passive tracers are solved using the advection diffusion equation 6 on the fine grid in the two grid systems the incompressible condition is satisfied by the poisson equation on the coarse grid and the mass conservation is guaranteed by using the vertical integrated continuity and the tracer advection diffusion equations 2 3 linear dispersion relation associated with pdi the accuracy of the linear dispersion relation predicted by a non hydrostatic model is largely dependent on the vertical resolution of the model as indicated by semi discrete analysis in smit et al 2014 here we use another semi discrete approach to demonstrate how the linear dispersion behavior of a model is related to the pressure decimation and interpolation strategy without loss of generality we start with a stratified two layer flow system with both surface waves and interfacial waves as shown in fig 1 we assume that both surface and interfacial waves are small amplitude linear waves using the concept of non hydrostatic pressure used in a non hydrostatic wave model the linearized vertical 2d equations of mass and the horizontal momentum conservation can be written as 7 u 1 x w 1 z 0 8 ρ 1 u 1 t ρ 1 g η 1 x q 1 x 0 for the upper layer and 9 u 2 x w 2 z 0 10 ρ 2 u 2 t ρ 1 g η 1 x ρ 2 ρ 1 g η 2 x q 2 x 0 for the lower layer in 7 10 the subscripts 1 2 represent variables for the upper layer and the lower layer respectively u w are horizontal and vertical velocities respectively η represents elevation q is the dynamic pressure and ρ represents flow density integrating 7 and 9 over the layer depths and using the linearized kinematic boundary conditions 11 η 1 t w 1 0 12 η 2 t w 1 h 1 w 2 h 1 13 w h 0 result in the depth integrated mass conservation equations for the two layers 14 η 1 t η 2 t h 1 0 u 1 x d z 0 15 η 2 t h h 1 u 2 x d z 0 introducing plane wave solution as 16 η j u j q j a j z u ˆ j z q ˆ j z e i k x ω t δ j where j 1 2 k ω and δ represent the wave number angular frequency and phase substituting the solution into 14 15 8 and 10 and recognizing the equations by eliminating the velocity variable results in the dispersion relation from the equations for the upper layer we get 17 ω 2 k 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 g h 1 k 2 ρ 1 a 1 a 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 h 1 0 q ˆ 1 d z and for the lower layer 18 ω 2 ρ 1 g k 2 a 1 ρ 2 a 2 h 2 e i δ 2 δ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 g k 2 h 2 k 2 ρ 2 a 2 h h 1 q ˆ 2 d z it can be proved that 17 and 18 are identical in representing the linear dispersion relation in the two layer system eqs 17 and 18 suggest that the accuracy of the dispersion solutions would be dependent on how well the structures of q ˆ 1 and q ˆ 2 over layer depths are represented to demonstrate how the pressure decimation and interpolation method affect the solution we consider a case of two layers with the rigid lid at the surface by assuming a 1 0 and using a a 2 the dispersion relation can be expressed as 19 ω 2 k 2 ρ 1 a h 1 0 q ˆ 1 d z or 20 ω 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 g k 2 h 2 k 2 ρ 2 a h h 1 q ˆ 2 d z because 19 and 20 are identical we only use 19 to examine the solution of the dispersion relation affected by the pdi method the analytical solutions of q ˆ 1 and the linear dispersion relation for the case of rigid lid are derived in appendix based on 60 the dimensionless of the non hydrostatic pressure q 1 q ˆ 1 ρ 1 g a can be written as 21 q 1 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 coth k h 1 coth k h 2 cosh k h 1 z sinh k h 1 and the analytical solution for the linear dispersion relation for the upper layer is 22 ω 2 g k ρ 1 ρ 2 coth k h 1 coth k h 2 where g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 is the reduced gravity for the discretized solution of the linear dispersion relation its sensitivity to number of layers can be analyzed by constructing trapezoidal integral approximation assuming that the discrete values of the integrand are given by the exact solution the upper layer is divided into n pressure layers with equal thickness δ z h 1 n the discretized form of 19 can be written as 23 ω n 2 g k 2 h 1 2 n j 1 n q 1 z j q 1 z j 1 where z j h 1 j n 1 n as the q 1 is set on the lower interface of the vertical grid eq 23 can be written using the phase speed c n as 24 c n 2 g h 1 2 n j 1 n q 1 z j q 1 z j 1 now we use the pdi technique by dividing each pressure layer into m sub layers the pressure values of which are estimated using an interpolation method such as 25 q 1 i z j i i q 1 z j where q 1 i z j i represents the interpolated pressure value at the sub layer location z j i within the layer j in which i 1 m i represents an interpolation function the phase speed 24 then becomes 26 c n 2 g h 1 2 n j 1 n i 1 m q 1 i z j i q 1 i z j i 1 as the pdi method is used to analyze the influence of vertical layer number on wave dispersion we consider a two layer flow with h 1 h 2 the flow densities are ρ 1 1000 kg m 3 and δ ρ ρ 2 ρ 1 20 kg m 3 which are comparable to the case of horn et al 2001 fig 2 shows the ratio of the discrete solution of the phase speed c n to the theoretical phase speed c e versus the wave dispersive parameter μ k h 1 the results from the full grid models 4 4 16 16 and 64 64 indicate that the increase in the layer numbers improves the accuracy in predicting the phase speed the model results are convergent to the exact solution with increase of the vertical layers to demonstrate the effects of pressure decimation and different interpolation method we used the pdi scheme and decimated the non hydrostatic pressure using 4 and 16 pressure layers on the 64 layer grid such as 64 4 and 64 16 the interpolation method used here are the quadratic q in the figure legend and cubic c in the figure legend spline interpolations as shown in the figure both the quadratic and cubic spline interpolations provide more accurate phase speeds than the low resolution full grid model e g comparing 64 4 to 4 4 or 64 16 to 16 16 the cubic spline interpolation gives more accurate result than the quadratic interpolation note that the linear interpolation gives the same result as the low resolution full grid model indicating no improvement of the dispersion relation from the linear interpolation the benefit of using the pdi method is the higher computational efficiency compared to the full grid model as described in both shi et al 2015 and smit et al 2014 it should be mentioned that the model performances presented in fig 2 are generally worse than that from the numerical tests of standing waves in ma et al 2012 it is probably caused by that the linear analysis used here may not accurately reflect the actual model performance in modeling wave dispersion however this analysis can provide an estimate of how the pdi scheme and interpolation methods affect the model dispersion properties the accuracies of the dispersion relation predicted by different interpolation methods can be explained by how well an interpolation method fits the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure fig 3 shows the vertical distribution of the analytical non hydrostatic pressure dimensionless in comparison to curve fitting using different orders of polynomial functions with the four pressure grid points the cubic spline interpolation shows the best fit to the exact solution 3 numerical experiment the numerical error in modeling wave dispersion numerical diffusion and dissipation are three major error sources in modeling internal waves using a non hydrostatic model for a general non hydrostatic model without a pdi method it is difficult to evaluate the separate effects of the three errors because the three errors are interacted however the pdi scheme provides a tool to separate the numerical dispersion effect from the effects of the numerical dissipation and diffusion to quantitatively examine the effects of the three errors and the model performance with different grid configurations of the pdi scheme we carried out numerical simulations of the laboratory experiment of internal waves conducted by horn et al 2001 the measured dataset has been used for numerical model validations by many researchers horn et al 2001 carried out the experiments of internal solitary wave soliton generation triggered by a large scale internal standing wave in an enclosed tank with a length of 6 m and width of 0 29 m as shown in fig 4 a two layer density fluid is initially filled into the tank with a titled interface the heights of the upper layer h 1 and lower layer h 2 at the center of the tank are 0 087 m and 0 203 m respectively the initial elevations of the interface at the lateral boundaries η 0 vary in different cases in this study we simulate two cases with initial elevations of η 0 0 0261 and 0 0522 m denoted as case 1 and case 2 respectively in the present study the density difference in the experiment is approximate δ ρ 20 2 kg m 3 thus the value of ρ 2 is set to be 1020 5 kg m 3 and the density of the upper layer ρ 1 is equal to the density of freshwater the initial density field can be expressed as 27 ρ x z ρ 1 δ ρ 2 1 tanh z h 0 δ 0 h 0 x η 0 x l 2 l 2 where h 0 is the depth of the interface l is the length of the numerical domain δ 0 1 cm is the thickness of the interface the horizontal grid size is 0 002 m which is based on the convergence tests on horizontal grid refinement the vertical layer numbers are 60 60 60 30 60 20 60 10 and 10 10 representing different grid configurations in the pdi method the interpolation method used in pdi method is the third order spline in addition a hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers was also used for a comparison as mentioned in the previous section the physical viscosity and diffusivity are not included in the model in order to analyze the numerical dissipation and diffusion fig 5 shows the time series of interface displacement at the center of the domain from the measurements the non hydrostatic models with the grid configurations of 60 60 and 60 10 as well as the hydrostatic model the upper and lower panel correspond to case 1 and case 2 respectively the non hydrostatic models with both grid configurations captured general characteristics of the degeneration of the long internal standing wave and the generation of internal solitary waves in particular the nonlinear steepening induces the initial small scale disturbances at t 160 s for case 1 and at t 120 s for case 2 the disturbances further develop into internal solitary wave trains due to the balance between nonlinear steeping and dispersion the non hydrostatic models predicted well both the timing of solitary generation and the wave amplitudes there is no visual difference found in the results between the full grid model 60 60 and the pdi model 60 10 indicating the pdi method works well in both cases the hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers predicted the interface displacement comparable to non hydrostatic cases before the emergence of nonlinear dispersive waves t 160 s in case 1 and t 120 s in case 2 however it completely failed to predict the small scale solitary generation in both cases due to lack of the dispersive mechanism the low resolution full grid model 10 10 predicted incorrect wave speed as well as wave amplitude in both cases which are incomparable to the data not shown in fig 5 the poor performance of the low resolution model will be explained in the following figures fig 6 illustrates the vertical distribution of density at t 140 s in case 2 from the full grid non hydrostatic models with the high grid resolution 60 60 the low grid resolution 10 10 the pdi model 60 10 as well as the hydrostatic model with 60 vertical layers the pdi model 60 10 shows the large front wave followed by oscillation tails visually identical to the result from the high resolution full grid model 60 60 in comparison the hydrostatic model predicted a bore like front without tails behind it indicating no small scale solitary generation in the non dispersive model it is interesting to look at the result from the low resolution full grid model 10 10 although small scale waves are generated the phase speed of the front wave is much slower and does not show much steeping as in the other models the slowing down of the phase speed can be explained by the decrease in stratification caused by large numerical diffusion in the coarse grid model which will be discussed in the following section the model performance in modeling dispersive waves can be also examined by how well a model predicts the vertical distribution of non hydrostatic pressure fig 7 shows a snapshot of the vertical distribution of non hydrostatic pressure predicted by the pdi model 60 10 at t 140 s in comparison to the full grid model 60 60 and 10 10 with the high resolution of the velocity grid the pressure decimation did not have an obvious effect on the vertical distribution of the non hydrostatic pressure as shown in the comparison between the pdi model 60 10 and the high grid resolution full grid model 60 60 the low resolution full grid model 10 10 showed incorrect vertical distribution of the non hydrostatic pressure as represented by the phase lag and smaller magnitudes compared to other models the other aspect in evaluating the pdi method is the computational efficiency for this specific application the computational time of the pdi model 60 10 for solving the pressure field sum of poisson solver and interpolation is about 5 times less than the full grid model 60 60 the interpolation step only costs about 10 of the time used for the low resolution poisson solver 4 discussion in a practical application of the pdi method the grid configuration associated with the decimation ratio r p d i n v n p is ad hoc on trial and error basis it is inconvenient for modelers to use such a method in practice even for a full grid model without the pdi technique there is no equivalent quantifiable principal to decide the vertical resolution stewart et al 2017 the determination of the vertical resolution should not only consider the physical processes to be resolved but also the role of numerical errors therefore understanding the effects of grid resolution on energy conservation and re distribution is helpful for choosing an optimal grid configuration to predict correct physics in this section the effect of vertical grid resolution on wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion are analyzed 4 1 effect of the vertical grid configuration a range of model runs with different vertical pressure layers and velocity layers were conducted to investigate how a grid configuration affects non hydrostatic model s performance table 1 lists two groups of cases in group a the number of the pressure layers n p is decreased from 10 to 3 with fixed number of velocity layers n v 60 group b varies the number of velocity layers n v from 60 to 20 with fixed number of pressure layers n p 10 note that the grid configuration 60 10 is well validated case in the last section and thus treated as the baseline case in the following tests fig 8 compares the pycnocline displacements at the central wave gauge from the models in group a to demonstrate the time scale of the nonlinear steeping we followed the approach of wadzuk and hodges 2009 who normalized the time using the steeping time scale t s defined by 28 t s 1 6 η 0 h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 t where t 109 s is the period of the basin scale internal wave in the case the figure shows that the three models predicted the identical pycnocline displacement in the period of t t s before the dispersion takes effect after this period the models with less pressure layers especially for the model of 60 3 in case b starts to derivate from the baseline case the differences can be found in both wave amplitude and phase with more significant difference in wave amplitude the k h value for case b is about 2 9 based on the analysis in section 2 the grid configuration of 60 3 may induce considerable errors in computing the dispersion effect the model tends to weaken the generation of solitary waves and under predict the wave phase speed to further analyze the influence of the pressure grid resolution in the pdi scheme fast fourier transform fft is employed to transform the spatial distribution of the interface displacement into the spectral field the expression of fft is given by 29 w x σ n n 1 n w n k x e i k x x where k x is the wave number w n is the fourier coefficient n is the half number of the grid in the x direction to get the relative importance of the various spectral components we normalize the spectrum by the following equation 30 p n w n 2 σ n n 1 n w n 2 the relative power spectral density p r is shown in fig 9 at t t s 1 the effect of nonlinear wave steeping is unobvious which shows a similar shapes of p r in results of different pressure grid configuration the other two lines show how the energy transfers from the basin scale internal wave to larger wave numbers shorter wavelengths at t t s 5 the peak power shifts to k x 5 8 s 1 and the energy contribution of the basin scale internal wave decreases to 0 22 of the total energy when 60 10 layers are used in contrast the initial basin scale wave still occupies the energy peak in the case with coarser pressure layers the relative wave energy in the basin scale wave is larger than the energy in the case with finer vertical pressure grid which accounts for 38 of the total wave energy however the p r only shows the relative values of the wave energy at different wave numbers the absolute wave energy values of the basin scale wave at t t s 5 is larger in the case with 60 10 layers than the values produced by 60 3 layers which is consistent with the differences of interface displacement in fig 8 the model with 60 3 layers cannot well predict the wave phase speed as well as the wave amplitudes due to the misrepresentation of the vertical non hydrostatic pressure profile in fact the non hydrostatic pressure may not induce extra energy dissipation directly for the evolution of internal wave however the error in simulating non hydrostatic pressure can change the balance between steeping and non hydrostatic dispersion in case with η 0 2 61 cm the model can well represent the wave amplitude with slight wave phase lag but greatly underestimate wave amplitude with increasing η 0 to 5 22 cm thus the model skill highly depends on the importance of the non hydrostatic steeping hodges et al 2006 the influence of the number of velocity layers n v was examined in group b tests fig 10 shows the same plot as fig 8 but compares the baseline case to the grid configurations with reduced velocity layers i e 40 10 and 20 10 the comparison shows that the models with coarser velocity grid under predicted the wave phase speed as represented by phase lags compared to the baseline model the lower grid resolution for tracer transport causes greater numerical diffusion and thus reduces the pycnocline gradient the reduced gravity effect slows down the wave propagation 4 2 viscosity and diffusivity the numerical dissipation represents the error associated with a kinetic energy loss due to the truncation error of a numerical scheme used in the momentum equations so the numerical dissipation can also be considered as a function of numerical viscosity the numerical diffusion represents the diffusive behavior caused by the numerical truncation error from the mass conservation equation and can be regarded as numerical diffusivity in the analysis presented below we followed the approach proposed by hodges et al 2006 and use the concepts of numerical viscosity and diffusivity to measure effects of the pdi scheme the effective numerical viscosity defined by hodges et al 2006 can be written as 31 ν e δ 0 h 1 h 2 t t 0 l n e d t e d t 0 where e d represents the dynamic energy of the whole system including the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the density field displaced from the lowest potential energy state the lowest potential energy state means the minimum possible energy which the density field can return in an adiabatic system the total dynamic energy e d should be constant with time in an inviscid flow system in the calculation of 31 the dynamic energy was integrated over the entire domain at the time interval of t t 0 in which t 0 is the initial time the effective numerical diffusivity is defined by the changes in the background potential energy as 32 κ e δ 0 2 8 t t 0 δ 0 2 8 t t 0 1 24 δ e b a g ρ 2 ρ 1 δ 0 2 1 2 note that e b should be constant with time if no diffusion is involved in the density flow system by using measures expressed in 31 and 32 the effects of the numerical dissipation and diffusion can be considerably separated the detailed description of this method can be found in hodges et al 2006 or wadzuk and hodges 2009 fig 11 shows a time series of ν e calculated from 31 for different pdi grid configurations in simulations of the two cases the numerical viscosity calculated from the two cases shows the similar trend of viscosity accumulation over time but different magnitudes of viscosity value comparing case 1 η 0 2 61 cm case 2 η 0 5 22 cm shows larger numerical viscosity values and more obvious discrepancies between different grid configurations in particular large differences can be found between the models with different numbers of velocity layers decreasing the number of velocity layers results in increased numerical viscosity however the numerical viscosity was not affected by the reduced number of pressure as indicated by the comparison between 60 10 60 5 and 60 3 the effective numerical diffusivity calculated from the same set of models is illustrated in fig 12 the numerical diffusivity values calculated from the three higher resolution velocity grids 60 10 60 5 and 60 3 are small and do not vary much with time on the contrary the models with the lower resolution velocity grid show significantly large values of the numerical diffusivity which decrease with time it is interesting to note that the two cases shown fig 12 basically exhibit the similar pattern in diffusivity distribution meaning that for each grid configuration similar values of the numerical diffusivity were obtained from the two cases this feature can be explained by the numerical diffusion mechanism which may not be largely affected by dynamic processes in different cases it is also indicated that using the numerical viscosity and diffusivity described in 31 and 32 is an effective way to separate the different effects the comparison between figs 11 and 12 suggests that the velocity grid resolution has more significant influence on the numerical diffusivity than the numerical viscosity the values of the numerical viscosity for all tested velocity grid resolutions are close the maximum value is approximately 1 3 1 0 7 m 2 s which is smaller than the molecular viscosity but for the numerical diffusivity decreasing the number of velocity layers from 60 to 20 causes an order of magnitude increase in the numerical diffusivity values the large numerical diffusivity from the coarse velocity grid reduces the flow stratification and thus decreases the wave phase speed consistent with the results shown in fig 10 5 conclusions the present work is a continuing study of the pdi method used in a non hydrostatic model for modeling stratified flows in view of the pdi grid configuration based on trial and error in the previous study some theoretical analysis of wave dispersion property and quantitative measurements of numerical dissipation and diffusion were carried out in this study the linear analysis on the wave dispersion relation shows that the accuracy of wave dispersion in a non hydrostatic model highly depends on how well the vertical structure of the non hydrostatic pressure is represented over depth the effect of the pressure structure on the linear dispersion relation can be described in a form of integrand of the dynamic pressure over depth in the pdi method increasing the number of vertical pressure layers can improve the accuracy in predicting the vertical pressure distribution however the analysis also shows that an appropriate interpolation method is important because a better interpolation method can compensate the errors induced by the pressure decimation for some extent a linear interpolation from a coarse pressure grid to a fine velocity grid does not change the vertical integrand and thus can only predict wave dispersion as accurate as that of the coarse grid higher order spline interpolations such as the cubic spine interpolation provides a better prediction of the wave dispersion relation as indicated by the analysis in both surface wave and internal wave cases to quantitatively examine the effects of the pdi method on wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion the laboratory experiment of horn et al 2001 was simulated with different pdi configurations the option of the hydrostatic model was also used as a non dispersive case for a comparison the results showed that the hydrostatic model only captured the wave steeping process and failed to generate small scale solitary waves the pdi method with a coarse pressure grid resolution and a fine velocity grid resolution can provide a result comparable to a high resolution full grid model as long as the pdi grid configuration is within the predictable range suggested by the linear dispersion analysis the usage of the pdi method provides a possibility to investigate the separate effects of grid resolution on the wave dispersion numerical dissipation and diffusion the vertical resolution of the pressure grid mainly affects the accuracy of wave dispersion the simulation of horn et al 2001 showed that using extremely small number of the pressure layers prevents the energy transfer from the basin scale wave to small scale solitary waves the pressure decimation has a negligible effect on the numerical dissipation and numerical diffusion the velocity grid resolution has a major influence on the numerical diffusion the tests on different velocity grid resolutions showed that a coarser velocity grid causes larger numerical diffusion and thus reduces the pycnocline gradient as a consequence the wave phase speed is under predicted by the coarser velocity grid model the vertical velocity grid resolution only has a minor effect on the numerical dissipation the horizontal grid resolution may have a more significant effect as indicated in the tests of wadzuk and hodges 2009 but the topic is out of the scope of this study as an additional note to the linear dispersion analysis performed in this study we point out that this analysis only provides an estimate of how the pdi scheme and interpolation methods affect the model prediction of wave dispersion this analysis method showed lower model performance in predicting wave dispersion compared to actual numerical tests a further study on model s dispersion properties using other semi discrete analysis methods such as in smit et al 2014 may be necessary acknowledgments shi j and wu g would like to thank the center for applied coastal research of

22668,in this paper a novel output feedback trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed for marine surface vessels msvs a fixed time extended state observer fxeso is developed to estimate unmeasured velocities and lumped disturbances and their estimation errors converge to the origin in fixed time especially the convergence time of the system is independent of the initial states of an msv these lumped disturbances consist of uncertainties and external time varying disturbances considering control accuracy and convergence rate a finite time homogeneity control theory fhc is employed in the controller design the proposed scheme can guarantee the tracking errors to converge to zero in finite time meanwhile the point stabilization is considered as a special case of the trajectory tracking and the superior results can be achieved under the proposed control scheme framework as well finally simulation studies and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme keywords fixed time extended state observer fxeso trajectory tracking point stabilization marine surface vessels msvs finite time homogeneity control fhc 1 introduction in recent times with the exploration and exploitation of marine resources msvs with high autonomy have attracted increasing attention for executing multiple tasks such as pipeline inspection military tasks maritime surveillance etc srensen 2011 fossen 2002 shi et al 2017 in order to manage to accomplish these missions or tasks the autonomous motion control of an msv has become a hot and crucial topic however the designed controllers are challenged by the adverse effects including external disturbances and uncertainties as a consequence it has attracted more and more attention from marine engineering and control community yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 do 2016 qu et al 2018 dai and yu 2018 cui et al 2016a many remarkable control methods have been introduced for marine vessels as an efficient control theory sliding mode control smc has been widely used for practical systems due to its rejection capacity against bounded lumped disturbances including uncertainties and disturbances yan and yu 2018 cui et al 2016b however it is worth noticing that smc based approaches tend to give rise to undesired high frequency oscillation yu et al 2012 tran and kang 2015 consider a chattering free control method backstepping technique can be employed in tracking controller design behal et al 2002 yang et al 2014 it should be pointed out that external disturbances have not been considered in spite of the desirable results being achieved in behal et al 2002 recently to compensate complex unknowns pertaining to an msv system intelligent control algorithms have been developed via adaptive neural networks and fuzzy logic systems cui et al 2017b peng et al 2013 zhang and zhang 2014 yu et al 2017 xiang et al 2017 yan and wang 2012 liu et al 2015 2017 these innovative schemes are mainly motivated by intelligent approximators it is worth noting that only exponential or asymptotic convergence can be guaranteed in the aforementioned schemes consider the convergence rate and robustness against external disturbances and uncertainties the finite time control has been intensively proposed yu et al 2005 yu and long 2015 li et al 2015 hong et al 2002 du and li 2012 in these respects some finite time methods have been also investigated in msvs motion control in wang et al 2017b 2016 2017a b finite time nonsingular terminal smc a finite time adding a power integrator control as well as an fhc are proposed for trajectory tracking of an msv respectively meanwhile their tracking errors can converge to the origin rather than a small region in finite time as known from the above papers all states can be available namely state feedback is allowed sometimes consider weight and cost or sensor failures most velocities are unmeasurable in practical applications fu and yu 2018 therefore it is necessary to propose an output feedback control law that only relies on positions and heading angle according to wang et al 2017b the lumped disturbances are defined as external internal disturbances and anything that is difficult to model or deal with in recent years many researchers have devoted efforts to designing disturbance observers dos such as a new linear do ding et al 2019 an exponential do yang et al 2014 a sliding mode do hall and shtessel 2006 finite time dos wang et al 2017b 2016 2017a a linear eso leso cui et al 2010 2017a a finite time eso fteso zhao et al 2017 etc they have been extensively and widely applied in various industrial fields such as msv systems autonomous underwater vehicle systems reusable launch vehicles etc in spite of finite time dos or esos providing high estimation precision and fast convergence rate the convergence time is dependent on the initial conditions in huang et al 2019 ni et al 2018 basin et al 2017 yu et al 2018 basin et al 2016 and sun et al 2018 the fixed time dos that provide a transition time independent on the initial values are proposed respectively in tian et al 2017 a novel fixed time state observer is presented consider unavailable velocities and lumped disturbances an fxeso zhang et al 2018 is developed however it is emphasized that the gain number and structure of the fxeso need to be improved as such inspired by the above analyses an fxeso needs to be redesigned so as to provide the superior performance additionally to the best of our knowledge there are no results on the fxeso based finite time output feedback control accordingly motivated by these we will intensively solve accurate tracking and stabilization problem of an msv with uncertainties and unknown external disturbances the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows i an fxeso is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances and unmeasured velocities in fixed time compared with basin et al 2016 a discontinuous term ϒ s i g n x is introduced to compensate the bounded lumped disturbances in addition based on the fxeso we also design the controller rather than a single observer compared with wang et al 2016 2017b a and yang et al 2014 the proposed fxeso can simultaneously estimate the lumped disturbances and unmeasured velocities compared with wang et al 2016 2017b a yang et al 2014 cui et al 2010 and zhao et al 2017 the estimation errors are able to converge to the origin in fixed time which is independent on the initial states compared with leso cui et al 2010 and fteso zhao et al 2017 the proposed fxeso s convergence rate and accuracy are superior to both compared with zhang et al 2018 it achieves a more concise structure with much fewer parameters and obtains better performance ii an fxeso based output feedback fhc scheme is applied to trajectory tracking and point stabilization of an msv compared with wang et al 2017a b 2016 in addition to the finite time stability analysis on t t 1 the finite time boundness is also proven on t t 1 that is to say the system states cannot escape to the infinity in t 1 where t 1 is the fixed settling time of fxeso this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents some notations and useful preliminaries section 3 introduces the mathematical models of an msv and the control problem is set up section 4 proposes an fxeso based fhc scheme

derivatives i e η d η d 2 c v and d v are unmodeled dynamics 3 the disturbance vector b imposed on the msvs satisfies b t ε where ε is an unknown nonnegative bounded constant 4 the velocity vector v u υ r t is unavailable in this paper our objective is to design an fxeso based fhc scheme under uncertainties and unknown disturbances so as to track η d and v d accurately in finite time meanwhile under the same control framework an msv can be stabilized to a desired locations and yaw angle 4 fxeso based fhc trajectory tracking and point stabilization control the structure of the msv control system is listed in fig 2 4 1 coordinate transformation coordinate transformation can be considered on v and v d and given by 9 w r ψ v w d r ψ d v d where w w 1 w 2 w 3 t w d w d 1 w d 2 w d 3 t

there exists a bounded constant h n such that χ h n holds 4 2 design of the fxeso in this subsection the fxeso is designed to obtain the exact estimations for the velocities and the lumped disturbances the fxeso can be proposed as follows 13 η ˆ w ˆ μ 1 s i g α 1 η η ˆ ε 1 s i g β 1 η η ˆ w ˆ r ψ m 1 τ χ ˆ μ 2 s i g α 2 η η ˆ ε 2 s i g β 2 η η ˆ χ ˆ μ 3 s i g α 3 η η ˆ ε 3 s i g β 3 η η

hurwitz p 1 μ 1 1 0 μ 2 0 1 μ 3 0 0 p 2 ε 1 1 0 ε 2 0 1 ε 3 0 0 theorem 1 under assumption 2 the fxeso 13 can simultaneously estimate η w χ in fixed time moreover the convergence time is bounded by 14 t 1 λ ϑ max ω 1 γ 1 ϑ 1 γ 2 σ ϖ σ where γ 1 λ min q 1 λ max ω 1 γ 2 λ min q 2 λ max ω 2 ϑ 1 α σ β 1 the positive constant ϖ λ min ω 2 q 1 q 2 ω 1 and ω 2 are nonsingular symmetric as well as positive definite matrices and satisfied by ω 1 p 1 p 1 t ω 1 q 1 ω 2 p 2 p 2 t ω 2 q 2 proof consider the following estimation errors 15 e 1 η η ˆ e 2 w w ˆ e 3 χ χ ˆ differentiating 15 with respect to time yields 16 e 1 e 2 μ 1 s i g α 1 e 1 ε 1 s i g β 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 e 3 χ μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 ϒ s i g n e 1 according to zhang et al 2018 the following proof on the estimation errors converging with zero errors in fixed time is divided into the following two steps 1 we first prove the following error system 17 can converge to zero in fixed time 17 e 1 e 2 μ 1 s i g α 1 e 1 ε 1 s i g β 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 e 3 χ μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 according to theorem 2 in basin et al 2016 the error vector e e 1 e 2 e 3 can converge to the origin in fixed time 2 referring to theorem 1 in zhang et al 2018 once e 1 0 achieves after the time t 1 then e 1 will maintain in e 1 0 in the rest of time accordingly e 1 e 1 0 and e 2 e 3 0 can be obtained hence there is a bounded time t 1 such that e 1 e 2 e 3 0 holds for all t t 1 in view of zhang et al 2018 implying the following identity holds 18 e 3 ϒ s i g n e 1 χ 0 t t 1 for the lumped disturbance it is considered to be an augmented state hence the fxeso is called as an extended state observer remark 1 compared with an fxeso in zhang et al 2018 the gain number of the proposed observer μ 1 ε 1 μ 2 ε 2 μ 3 ε 3 ϒ is less than one η b λ ϒ t u in zhang et al 2018 where t u is switching time by referring to ni et al 2018 the design parameter t u is typically selected through trial and error therefore the selection of t u will affect the estimation performance and it is not prone to adjust note that the proposed fxeso in this paper can achieve a more concise structure with much fewer parameters and obtain better performances according to zhang et al 2018 ϒ tanh x ϒ e x e x e x e x can replace ϒ s i g n x so as to reduce the chattering of the fxeso 4 3 design of the fxeso based fhc in this subsection the fxeso based output feedback fhc is proposed as follows 19 τ m r ψ 1 k 1 s i g γ 1 η e k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 χ ˆ w d where e ˆ 2 w ˆ w d k 1 0 k 2 0 0 γ 1 1 γ 2 2 γ 1 1 γ 1 theorem 2 under assumptions 1 2 the control law 19 can make an msv track the reference trajectory accurately and the tracking errors can converge with zero errors in finite

bounded function is chosen as 20 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i 1 2 η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 where i 1 2 3 represent x y ψ respectively due to w ˆ e i e 2 i w e i η e i and χ i h n ϒ computing the derivative of 20 we have 21 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i η e i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i e 3 i η e i w ˆ e i e 2 i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i e 3 i in the light of e 2 i e 3 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i χ i μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i ϒ s i g n e 1 i therefore 21 is rewritten as follows 22 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i w ˆ e i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i χ i μ 3 s i g

e 1 i e 3 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i let 24 h e 2 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i e 2 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 i e 3 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i since e 1 i e 2 i e 3 i can converge with zero errors in fixed time then e 1 i e 2 i e 3 i are bounded respectively that is h l 2 considering the mean inequality we obtain 25 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i 1 2 η e i 2 1 2 w ˆ 2 e i 1 2 η e i 2 1 2 e 2 i 2 1 2 e 2 i 2 1 2 e 3 i 2 2 ϒ 2 1 2 e 3 i 2 l 2 η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 1 2 w ˆ 2 e i 2 ϒ 2 l 2 since w ˆ e i is also bounded that is to say w ˆ e i l 3 therefore 26 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 1 2 l 3 2 2 ϒ 2 l 2 let l 1 2 l 3 2 2 ϒ 2 l 2 hence we have 27 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 l 2 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i l then the above inequality is solved as 28 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i b η e i 0 e 2 i 0 e 3 i 0 l 2 e 2 t l 2 as shown from 28 for t t 1 η e i e 2 i and e 3 i are bounded therefore we can conclude that the system states do not escape to the infinity for t t 1 substituting the control law 19 into the tracking errors 12 and together with e ˆ 1 η ˆ η d η η d and e ˆ 2 w ˆ w d the following formula can be obtained 29 e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 e ˆ 2 k 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ 1 k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 the following lyapunov function is constructed as 30 v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 i 3 k 1 0 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 μ d μ 1 2 e ˆ 2 i 2 where i 1 2 3 we can obtain the following derivative of 30 along the system 29 31 v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 k 1 i n s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 i n e ˆ i 2 k 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 k 2 i n e ˆ i 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 k 2 i n e ˆ i 2 1 γ 2 31 implies v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 is monotonically decreasing that is v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 v e ˆ 1 0 e ˆ 2 0 then e ˆ 1 t and e ˆ 2 t are bounded note that v k 2 1 γ 2 e ˆ 2 t s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 is also bounded then v is uniformly continuous taking advantage of barbalat s lemma we obtain lim t v 0 that is lim t e ˆ 2 0 the derivative of e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 along the system 29 is given by 32 d d t e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 k 1 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 k 2 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 e ˆ i 2 2 let h 1 k 2 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 e ˆ i 2 2 h 2 k 1 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 taking the time derivative of h 2 yields 33 h 2 k 1 e ˆ i 2 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 γ 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 from 33 h 2 is bounded hence we can conclude h 2 is uniformly continuous together with lim t e ˆ 2 0 then lim t h 1 0 according to lemma 2 in du and li 2012 lim t h 2 0 so lim t e ˆ 1 0 hence the system 29 is gas it is worth noticing that a negative degree k γ 1 1 2 0 with respect to the dilation r 1 r 2 1 1 γ 1 2 the system 29 can be rewritten as 34 f 1 ε r 1 e ˆ i 1 ε r 2 e ˆ i 2 ε

schemes such as wang et al 2017a b 2016 the proposed scheme s stability analysis in t t 1 is proven additionally the point stabilization is considered as a special case of the trajectory tracking so the desired η d is a constant value i e η d w d 0 hence the following point stabilization control law can be obtained 35 τ m r ψ 1 k 1 s i g γ 1 η e k 2 s i g γ 2 w ˆ χ ˆ 5 simulation and comparison

figs 3 8 meanwhile their quantitative analyses are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the performance of the proposed fxeso is obviously superior to fteso 36 leso 37 and fxeso 38 in zhang et al

locations and yaw angle tracking errors are represented in fig 11 as can be seen from figs 9 11 the tracking performance of the proposed scheme is superior to the asymptotic scheme in convergence rate and control accuracy the control inputs as shown in fig 12 reveal that the force and torque acting on cybership ii are smooth and reasonable from fig 13 it is further observed that the proposed scheme can make fast the vessel track the reference trajectory the quantitative analyses are listed in table 2 where τ r o b is originated from the proposed scheme without the estimated lumped disturbances χ ˆ to show the robustness as shown in table 2 the proposed control law τ 35 under uncertainties and disturbance has better transient and steady state performance than τ a s y meanwhile the robustness is greatly enhanced due to the introduction of the fxeso in table 2 for the trajectory tracking the settling time means the response curve reaching and staying within a range of certain percentage

parameters gains and lumped disturbances for the observer and controller are same as the counterparts in the first case of section 5 1 simulation comparison results are shown in figs 14 19 as depicted in figs 14 16 the proposed control law 35 guarantees the msv can converge to the origin in a better transient performance which is critical for the entire control system in comparison with the control inputs in figs 17 and 18 the proposed scheme does not consume too much energy and not easily give rise to the input saturation in the initial phase the two motion trajectories in xy plane are depicted in fig 19 6 conclusions in this paper a novel output feedback control scheme has been proposed for an msv by virtue of the fxeso and fhc methods the proposed scheme can guarantee an msv to precisely track the desired trajectory subject to uncertainties unknown external disturbances and unmeasured velocities by comparing with the fteso and leso the proposed fxeso can achieve desirable performance as shown in the simulations and tables 1 2 the proposed scheme is superior to the asymptotic one in convergence rate and accuracy meanwhile under the same control framework the point stabilization can also make the remarkable performance in the future works an underactuated msv and actuator saturation will be considered into the proposed scheme based on sampling step small delays and sampling noise

22668,in this paper a novel output feedback trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed for marine surface vessels msvs a fixed time extended state observer fxeso is developed to estimate unmeasured velocities and lumped disturbances and their estimation errors converge to the origin in fixed time especially the convergence time of the system is independent of the initial states of an msv these lumped disturbances consist of uncertainties and external time varying disturbances considering control accuracy and convergence rate a finite time homogeneity control theory fhc is employed in the controller design the proposed scheme can guarantee the tracking errors to converge to zero in finite time meanwhile the point stabilization is considered as a special case of the trajectory tracking and the superior results can be achieved under the proposed control scheme framework as well finally simulation studies and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme keywords fixed time extended state observer fxeso trajectory tracking point stabilization marine surface vessels msvs finite time homogeneity control fhc 1 introduction in recent times with the exploration and exploitation of marine resources msvs with high autonomy have attracted increasing attention for executing multiple tasks such as pipeline inspection military tasks maritime surveillance etc srensen 2011 fossen 2002 shi et al 2017 in order to manage to accomplish these missions or tasks the autonomous motion control of an msv has become a hot and crucial topic however the designed controllers are challenged by the adverse effects including external disturbances and uncertainties as a consequence it has attracted more and more attention from marine engineering and control community yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 do 2016 qu et al 2018 dai and yu 2018 cui et al 2016a many remarkable control methods have been introduced for marine vessels as an efficient control theory sliding mode control smc has been widely used for practical systems due to its rejection capacity against bounded lumped disturbances including uncertainties and disturbances yan and yu 2018 cui et al 2016b however it is worth noticing that smc based approaches tend to give rise to undesired high frequency oscillation yu et al 2012 tran and kang 2015 consider a chattering free control method backstepping technique can be employed in tracking controller design behal et al 2002 yang et al 2014 it should be pointed out that external disturbances have not been considered in spite of the desirable results being achieved in behal et al 2002 recently to compensate complex unknowns pertaining to an msv system intelligent control algorithms have been developed via adaptive neural networks and fuzzy logic systems cui et al 2017b peng et al 2013 zhang and zhang 2014 yu et al 2017 xiang et al 2017 yan and wang 2012 liu et al 2015 2017 these innovative schemes are mainly motivated by intelligent approximators it is worth noting that only exponential or asymptotic convergence can be guaranteed in the aforementioned schemes consider the convergence rate and robustness against external disturbances and uncertainties the finite time control has been intensively proposed yu et al 2005 yu and long 2015 li et al 2015 hong et al 2002 du and li 2012 in these respects some finite time methods have been also investigated in msvs motion control in wang et al 2017b 2016 2017a b finite time nonsingular terminal smc a finite time adding a power integrator control as well as an fhc are proposed for trajectory tracking of an msv respectively meanwhile their tracking errors can converge to the origin rather than a small region in finite time as known from the above papers all states can be available namely state feedback is allowed sometimes consider weight and cost or sensor failures most velocities are unmeasurable in practical applications fu and yu 2018 therefore it is necessary to propose an output feedback control law that only relies on positions and heading angle according to wang et al 2017b the lumped disturbances are defined as external internal disturbances and anything that is difficult to model or deal with in recent years many researchers have devoted efforts to designing disturbance observers dos such as a new linear do ding et al 2019 an exponential do yang et al 2014 a sliding mode do hall and shtessel 2006 finite time dos wang et al 2017b 2016 2017a a linear eso leso cui et al 2010 2017a a finite time eso fteso zhao et al 2017 etc they have been extensively and widely applied in various industrial fields such as msv systems autonomous underwater vehicle systems reusable launch vehicles etc in spite of finite time dos or esos providing high estimation precision and fast convergence rate the convergence time is dependent on the initial conditions in huang et al 2019 ni et al 2018 basin et al 2017 yu et al 2018 basin et al 2016 and sun et al 2018 the fixed time dos that provide a transition time independent on the initial values are proposed respectively in tian et al 2017 a novel fixed time state observer is presented consider unavailable velocities and lumped disturbances an fxeso zhang et al 2018 is developed however it is emphasized that the gain number and structure of the fxeso need to be improved as such inspired by the above analyses an fxeso needs to be redesigned so as to provide the superior performance additionally to the best of our knowledge there are no results on the fxeso based finite time output feedback control accordingly motivated by these we will intensively solve accurate tracking and stabilization problem of an msv with uncertainties and unknown external disturbances the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows i an fxeso is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances and unmeasured velocities in fixed time compared with basin et al 2016 a discontinuous term ϒ s i g n x is introduced to compensate the bounded lumped disturbances in addition based on the fxeso we also design the controller rather than a single observer compared with wang et al 2016 2017b a and yang et al 2014 the proposed fxeso can simultaneously estimate the lumped disturbances and unmeasured velocities compared with wang et al 2016 2017b a yang et al 2014 cui et al 2010 and zhao et al 2017 the estimation errors are able to converge to the origin in fixed time which is independent on the initial states compared with leso cui et al 2010 and fteso zhao et al 2017 the proposed fxeso s convergence rate and accuracy are superior to both compared with zhang et al 2018 it achieves a more concise structure with much fewer parameters and obtains better performance ii an fxeso based output feedback fhc scheme is applied to trajectory tracking and point stabilization of an msv compared with wang et al 2017a b 2016 in addition to the finite time stability analysis on t t 1 the finite time boundness is also proven on t t 1 that is to say the system states cannot escape to the infinity in t 1 where t 1 is the fixed settling time of fxeso this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents some notations and useful preliminaries section 3 introduces the mathematical models of an msv and the control problem is set up section 4 proposes an fxeso based fhc scheme

υ r t is unavailable in this paper our objective is to design an fxeso based fhc scheme under uncertainties and unknown disturbances so as to track η d and v d accurately in finite time meanwhile under the same control framework an msv can be stabilized to a desired locations and yaw angle 4 fxeso based fhc trajectory tracking and point stabilization control the structure of the msv control system is listed in fig 2 4 1 coordinate transformation coordinate transformation can be considered on v and v d and given by 9 w r ψ v w d r ψ d v d where w w 1 w 2 w 3 t w d w d 1 w d 2 w d 3 t

following tracking errors 11 η e η η d w e w w d accordingly computing the time derivative of 11 we obtain 12 η e η η d w w d w e w e w w d r ψ m 1 τ χ w d assumption 2 according to wang et al 2017b there exists a bounded constant h n such that χ h n holds 4 2 design of the fxeso in this subsection the fxeso is designed to obtain the exact estimations for the velocities and the lumped disturbances the fxeso can be proposed as follows 13 η ˆ w ˆ μ 1 s i g α 1 η η ˆ ε 1 s i g β 1 η η ˆ w ˆ r ψ m 1 τ χ ˆ μ 2 s i g α 2 η η ˆ ε 2 s i g β 2 η η ˆ χ ˆ μ 3 s i g α 3 η η ˆ ε 3 s i g β 3 η η

hurwitz p 1 μ 1 1 0 μ 2 0 1 μ 3 0 0 p 2 ε 1 1 0 ε 2 0 1 ε 3 0 0 theorem 1 under assumption 2 the fxeso 13 can simultaneously estimate η w χ in fixed time moreover the convergence time is bounded by 14 t 1 λ ϑ max ω 1 γ 1 ϑ 1 γ 2 σ ϖ σ where γ 1 λ min q 1 λ max ω 1 γ 2 λ min q 2 λ max ω 2 ϑ 1 α σ β 1 the positive constant ϖ λ min ω 2 q 1 q 2 ω 1 and ω 2 are nonsingular symmetric as well as positive definite matrices and satisfied by ω 1 p 1 p 1 t ω 1 q 1 ω 2 p 2 p 2 t ω 2 q 2 proof consider the following estimation errors 15 e 1 η η ˆ e 2 w w ˆ e 3 χ χ ˆ differentiating 15 with respect to time yields 16 e 1 e 2 μ 1 s i g α 1 e 1 ε 1 s i g β 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 e 3 χ μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 ϒ s i g n e 1 according to zhang et al 2018 the following proof on the estimation errors converging with zero errors in fixed time is divided into the following two steps 1 we first prove the following error system 17 can converge to zero in fixed time 17 e 1 e 2 μ 1 s i g α 1 e 1 ε 1 s i g β 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 e 3 χ μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 according to theorem 2 in basin et al 2016 the error vector e e 1 e 2 e 3 can converge to the origin in fixed time 2 referring to theorem 1 in zhang et al 2018 once e 1 0 achieves after the time t 1 then e 1 will maintain in e 1 0 in the rest of time accordingly e 1 e 1 0 and e 2 e 3 0 can be obtained hence there is a bounded time t 1 such that e 1 e 2 e 3 0 holds for all t t 1 in view of zhang et al 2018 implying the following identity holds 18 e 3 ϒ s i g n e 1 χ 0 t t 1 for the lumped disturbance it is considered to be an augmented state hence the fxeso is called as an extended state observer remark 1 compared with an fxeso in zhang et al 2018 the gain number of the proposed observer μ 1 ε 1 μ 2 ε 2 μ 3 ε 3 ϒ is less than one η b λ ϒ t u in zhang et al 2018 where t u is switching time by referring to ni et al 2018 the design parameter t u is typically selected through trial and error therefore the selection of t u will affect the estimation performance and it is not prone to adjust note that the proposed fxeso in this paper can achieve a more concise structure with much fewer parameters and obtain better performances according to zhang et al 2018 ϒ tanh x ϒ e x e x e x e x can replace ϒ s i g n x so as to reduce the chattering of the fxeso 4 3 design of the fxeso based fhc in this subsection the fxeso based output feedback fhc is proposed as follows 19 τ m r ψ 1 k 1 s i g γ 1 η e k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 χ ˆ w d where e ˆ 2 w ˆ w d k 1 0 k 2 0 0 γ 1 1 γ 2 2 γ 1 1 γ 1 theorem 2 under assumptions 1 2 the control law 19 can make an msv track the reference trajectory accurately and the tracking errors can converge with zero errors in finite time after the exact estimations for the velocities and lumped disturbances i e η ˆ t η t η d t w ˆ t w d t proof firstly we will prove η e i e 2 i and e 3 i do not escape to the infinity on 0 t 1 a bounded function is chosen as 20 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i 1 2 η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 where i 1 2 3 represent x y ψ respectively due to w ˆ e i e 2 i w e i η e i and χ i h n ϒ computing the derivative of 20 we have 21 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i η e i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i e 3 i η e i w ˆ e i e 2 i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i e 3 i in the light of e 2 i e 3 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i χ i μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i ϒ s i g n e 1 i therefore 21 is rewritten as follows 22 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i w ˆ e i e 2 i e 2 i e 3 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i χ i μ 3 s i g

e 1 i e 3 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i let 24 h e 2 i μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1 i e 2 i ε 2 s i g β 2 e 1 i e 3 i μ 3 s i g α 3 e 1 i e 3 i ε 3 s i g β 3 e 1 i since e 1 i e 2 i e 3 i can converge with zero errors in fixed time then e 1 i e 2 i e 3 i are bounded respectively that is h l 2 considering the mean inequality we obtain 25 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i 1 2 η e i 2 1 2 w ˆ 2 e i 1 2 η e i 2 1 2 e 2 i 2 1 2 e 2 i 2 1 2 e 3 i 2 2 ϒ 2 1 2 e 3 i 2 l 2 η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 1 2 w ˆ 2 e i 2 ϒ 2 l 2 since w ˆ e i is also bounded that is to say w ˆ e i l 3 therefore 26 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 1 2 l 3 2 2 ϒ 2 l 2 let l 1 2 l 3 2 2 ϒ 2 l 2 hence we have 27 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i η e i 2 e 2 i 2 e 3 i 2 l 2 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i l then the above inequality is solved as 28 b η e i e 2 i e 3 i b η e i 0 e 2 i 0 e 3 i 0 l 2 e 2 t l 2 as shown from 28 for t t 1 η e i e 2 i and e 3 i are bounded therefore we can conclude that the system states do not escape to the infinity for t t 1 substituting the control law 19 into the tracking errors 12 and together with e ˆ 1 η ˆ η d η η d and e ˆ 2 w ˆ w d the following formula can be obtained 29 e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 e ˆ 2 k 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ 1 k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 the following lyapunov function is constructed as 30 v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 i 3 k 1 0 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 μ d μ 1 2 e ˆ 2 i 2 where i 1 2 3 we can obtain the following derivative of 30 along the system 29 31 v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 k 1 i n s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 i n e ˆ i 2 k 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 k 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 k 2 i n e ˆ i 2 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 k 2 i n e ˆ i 2 1 γ 2 31 implies v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 is monotonically decreasing that is v e ˆ 1 e ˆ 2 v e ˆ 1 0 e ˆ 2 0 then e ˆ 1 t and e ˆ 2 t are bounded note that v k 2 1 γ 2 e ˆ 2 t s i g γ 2 e ˆ 2 is also bounded then v is uniformly continuous taking advantage of barbalat s lemma we obtain lim t v 0 that is lim t e ˆ 2 0 the derivative of e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 along the system 29 is given by 32 d d t e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 k 1 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 k 2 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 e ˆ i 2 2 let h 1 k 2 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 2 e ˆ i 2 e ˆ i 2 2 h 2 k 1 e ˆ i 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 taking the time derivative of h 2 yields 33 h 2 k 1 e ˆ i 2 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 γ 1 s i g γ 1 e ˆ i 1 e ˆ i 2 from 33 h 2 is bounded hence we can conclude h 2 is uniformly continuous together with lim t e ˆ 2 0 then lim t h 1 0 according to lemma 2 in du and li 2012 lim t h 2 0 so lim t e ˆ 1 0 hence the system 29 is gas it is worth noticing that a negative degree k γ 1 1 2 0 with respect to the dilation r 1 r 2 1 1 γ 1 2 the system 29 can be rewritten as 34 f 1 ε r 1 e ˆ i 1 ε r 2 e ˆ i 2 ε

schemes such as wang et al 2017a b 2016 the proposed scheme s stability analysis in t t 1 is proven additionally the point stabilization is considered as a special case of the trajectory tracking so the desired η d is a constant value i e η d w d 0 hence the following point stabilization control law can be obtained 35 τ m r ψ 1 k 1 s i g γ 1 η e k 2 s i g γ 2 w ˆ χ ˆ 5 simulation and comparison

figs 3 8 meanwhile their quantitative analyses are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the performance of the proposed fxeso is obviously superior to fteso 36 leso 37 and fxeso 38 in zhang et al

locations and yaw angle tracking errors are represented in fig 11 as can be seen from figs 9 11 the tracking performance of the proposed scheme is superior to the asymptotic scheme in convergence rate and control accuracy the control inputs as shown in fig 12 reveal that the force and torque acting on cybership ii are smooth and reasonable from fig 13 it is further observed that the proposed scheme can make fast the vessel track the reference trajectory the quantitative analyses are listed in table 2 where τ r o b is originated from the proposed scheme without the estimated lumped disturbances χ

is greatly enhanced due to the introduction of the fxeso in table 2 for the trajectory tracking the settling time means the response curve reaching and staying within a range of certain percentage usually 5 or 2 of the final value tay et al 1998 in this paper the 2 error bounds can be selected so as to verify the superiority and effectiveness 5 2 the point stabilization performance comparisons in the simulations the point stabilization control law 35 will be taken into account the initial and desired values are respectively selected as η 0 20 m 20 m π 18 rad t η d 0 m 0 m 0 rad t the design parameters gains and lumped disturbances for the observer and controller are same as the counterparts in the first case of section 5 1 simulation comparison results are shown in figs 14 19 as depicted in figs 14 16 the proposed control law 35 guarantees the msv can converge to the origin in a better transient performance which is critical for the entire control system in comparison with the control inputs in figs 17 and 18 the proposed scheme does not consume too much energy and not easily give rise to the input saturation in the initial phase the two motion trajectories in xy plane are depicted in fig 19 6 conclusions in this paper a novel output feedback control scheme has been proposed for an msv by virtue of the fxeso and fhc methods the proposed scheme can guarantee an msv to precisely track the desired trajectory subject to uncertainties unknown external disturbances and unmeasured velocities by comparing with the fteso and leso the proposed fxeso can achieve desirable performance as shown in the simulations and tables 1 2 the proposed scheme is superior to the asymptotic one in convergence rate and accuracy meanwhile under the same control framework the point stabilization can also make the remarkable performance in the future works an underactuated msv and actuator saturation will be considered into the proposed scheme based on sampling step small delays and sampling noise

22669,the side wall effect was normally tackled by potential flow based numerical methods it is well known that due to the existence of the resonance frequency in the wave tank the numerical methods over predict the hydrodynamic forces when comparing with model experiments furthermore in most of the previous studies on the effects of the side walls the model was located at the centre of the tank the disturbances on both sides of the model are symmetric and the resonances of some of the responses such as wave surface elevation and motions may not be excited at the tank natural frequencies in the present study a rankine source panel method is used to tackle the effects of the side walls and artificial damping is introduced in the free surface boundary condition to account for the viscous damping effect model experiments are carried out for a lifeboat model located at various positions in a wave flume numerical results of the wave forces free surface elevations and motions of the model are compared with the model test measurements and good agreement is found it is shown that the inclusion of the artificial damping in the free surface boundary condition is effective in particular for the model at off centre position of the tank keywords side wall effect 3d rankine method numerical prediction model test artificial damping 1 introduction the wave model testing facilities wave basin towing tank and wave flume always have a limited width due to the existence of the side walls the measured loads and responses would present some discrepancies compared to the open sea results e g kashiwagi and ohkusu 1989 ittc has a recommended procedure for seakeeping model experiments to avoid the tank wall interference in head waves in towing tank ittc 2002 the recommended maximum frequency at which tank wall interference occurs depends on froude number of the model which means for model tests at low and zero speeds the side wall interference is inevitable therefore there will be a strong interest to assess the side wall effects when extrapolating the experimental results to open sea condition in full scale the side wall effects also present for a floating structure in a channel in this case the floating structure may located on off central position of the channel to avoid the passing vehicles another situation where the wall effect is relevant is for a launch and recovery operation at sea when a lifeboat or rov is in between two large vessels mothership and rescue support vessel where the mothership rescue vessels are considerably large than the lifeboat rov and when considering the hydrodynamic interactions they are replaced as infinitely long walls the side wall effect was tackled numerically by means of the free surface green function method based on potential flow theory the free surface green function in the open sea satisfies the laplace equation linearized free surface condition sea bottom condition and radiation condition at the far field but not the boundary condition on the two parallel side walls one way to tackle the problem is to consider the side wall as an independent fixed very large body so that the singularity is distributed on the wetted body surface cf duan et al 2007 and peng et al 2015 mciver 1993 presented a theoretical model for diffraction and radiation solutions on truncated vertical cylinders including side wall effects through the multipoles expansion method this method is limited to bodies of simple geometry such as vertical cylinders for general 3d problem a green function satisfying the boundary condition on the side walls should be defined linton 1993 proposed a free surface green functions with tank walls kashiwagi 1991 divided the green function involved in the side wall effects into an open sea green function and another term and the slowly convergent term was replaced by a double integral over a semi infinite domain chen 1994 presented the tank green function as the sum of two parts based on the convergence due to the slow convergence of the green function xia 2001 divided it into three parts in the near middle and far fields respectively newman 2016 developed the image green function igf method which is composed of a series of open sea green functions satisfying the free surface condition chen et al 2018 investigated hydrodynamics of side wall effects through the igf based on taylor expansion boundary element method the rankine source panel method is an alternative approach for tackling the wave body interaction problem the rankine source is easy to calculate numerically but it does not satisfy the linearized free surface boundary condition and the radiation condition in the far field early efforts can be seen from works of yeung 1982 for 2d and liapis and beck 1985 for 3d problems for the wave body interaction problem in open sea the rankine singularity needs to be distributed on both the hull surface and the free surface and the radiation condition should be implemented properly in the frequency domain nakos 1989 cao et al 1989 bertram and thiart 1998 bunnik 1999 xie and vassalos 2012 or in time domain watai et al 2015 2016 it can also be applied for hydrodynamics analysis of a hydrofoil under free surface xie and vassalos 2007 the rankine panel method has the flexibility of altering the free surface boundary condition to tackle higher order or nonlinear problems boo 2002 ning et al 2018 more recently resonance of wave surface motion in the gap between a fpso and an lng tanker has attracted much interest in the hydrodynamics research community soares et al 2015 sun et al 2015 pessoa et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the potential flow based panel method was used for the numerical prediction model experimental results had to be used to tune the artificial damping coefficients in the free surface boundary condition to achieve good agreements yuan et al 2018 investigated side wall effects on ship model testing in a towing tank in calm water and in waves using the rankine source panel method it was found that the side wall effect on the experiments in waves is more complicated than that in calm water due to the complexity of the wave systems the hydrodynamic coefficients radiation forces fluctuated wildly away from the open sea results the reflected and radiated waves were trapped within the towing tank and resulting side wall effects become significant in most of the research into the side wall effect the model was positioned at the centre of the tank in the present study side wall effects are investigated both numerically and experimentally and the model was located at various distances from the side wall in the numerical study the rankine source panel method was used to solve wave field the singularities were distributed on the hull surface free surface side walls and far field control surface and an artificial damping term was added to the free surface boundary condition model experiments were carried out in a wave flume for a lifeboat model wave loading on the hull free surface elevations and model motions were predicted and compared with those of the model experiments comparison of the numerical prediction and the model experiments shows good agreement it was found that adding the artificial damping in the free surface boundary condition leads to better agreement between the numerical results and the measurements in particular for the model at off central positions of the flume 2 numerical methods it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and that the motion is irrotational velocity potentials exist and satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain the right handed cartesian coordinate system is defined with xoy plane on the undisturbed free surface while xoz plane is the symmetric vertical plane of the ship model ox axis pointing to the bow and oz is positive upwards and through the centre of gravity cg of the model fig 1 a complex velocity potential provides a description of the velocity potential as 1 φ x y z t r e φ 0 x y z φ 7 x y z j 1 6 u j φ j x y z e i ω t where φ 0 and φ 7 are complex spatial velocity potentials for the incident and diffraction waves respectively u j j 1 2 6 are the complex velocity amplitudes of motions of the 6 degree of freedom for the body u 1 surge u 2 sway u 3 heave u 4 roll u 5 pitch u 6 yaw φ j j 1 2 6 are the spatial radiation potentials the boundary value problems for the velocity potentials are described in appendix a the boundaries of the fluid domain consist of the wetted hull surface s h free surface s f damping zone free surface s d port side wall s p starboard side wall s s the far field control surface at both ends of the flume s o and the bottom s b the green function is selected as 2 g x y z ξ η ζ 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z 2 d ζ 2 where x y z is the field point ξ η ζ is the source point and d is the water depth since the green function in 2 satisfies the bottom boundary condition a 16 source distribution on the bottom boundary will not be required 3 φ j x y z s g x y z ξ η ζ σ j ξ η ζ d s where σ j j 1 2 7 are the source densities on the boundary surfaces and s s h s f s d s p s s s o see fig 1 in order to surpass the irregular frequency the water plane of the model is also panelised and zero normal velocity was applied malenica and chen 1998 the free surface boundary condition with artificial damping is see appendix a 4 g φ j z ω 2 1 ν 2 i 2 ν ω 2 φ j 0 on z 0 j 1 2 7 where ν is the non dimensional artificial damping coefficient the modified free surface condition also used by chen 2004 and faltinsen and timokha 2015 in the recent works of guo et al 2018a 2018b a 2d time domain green function was developed and implemented numerically to account for the viscous effects in the free surface boundary condition in body wave interaction problems in their method viscous damping is taken into account in the dynamic free surface boundary condition in the same manner as in the current study equation a 20 however the addition of the viscous damping in the kinematic free surface boundary condition is slightly different in that the wave surface elevation was eliminated before the addition of the viscous damping in the works of guo et al in the present method the overall free surface condition has an additional ν 2 term since ν is usually a small number the effect of the difference in the modified free surface boundary condition between the present method and that of guo et al s on the hydrodynamic loads and motions is likely to be insignificant the free surface boundary condition with viscous effect can also be derived from linearization of ns equation chen and dias 2010 when ν 0 eq 4 becomes the undamped linearized free surface boundary condition 5 g φ j z ω 2 φ j 0 on z 0 the radiation condition is satisfied by applying an approximated sommerfeld radiation condition a 18 at the outer boundary s o this was enhanced by setting up the damping zone on the free surface further away from the vessel model where size of the panel increases gradually see fig 2 and an artificial damping coefficient was applied for the free surface boundary condition in the damping zone equation 3 indicates that the velocity potentials at a field point x y z in the fluid domain including at the domain boundary can be represented by a source distribution over the domain boundary surfaces in order to solve the unknown source strength in equation 3 the domain boundaries are discretized into a number of quadrilateral panels with constant source density by applying the boundary conditions at the control point of each panel for every boundary of the fluid domain one equation for the unknown source density will be obtained for each panel and the equations for the unknown source strength are closed and can be solved by a standard routine once the unknown source distributions and the velocity

the university of plymouth the flume was equipped with a piston type wave maker with active absorption capabilities and a foam beach at the opposite end tests were carried out at still water depth of 0 75 m a lifeboat model was manufactured from carbon composite main particulars of the lifeboat model are shown in table 1 the body plan of the lifeboat is shown in fig 3 before the tests the model was calibrated for its centre of gravity cog and radius of gyration in each component direction gyradii the experiments consist of model fixed and free floating tests for the fixed experiments a 6 axis load cell was used to measure the wave load components acting on the model the capacities of the load cell are 125 n for f x and f y and 250 n for f z capacity of m x m y and m z are all 25 n m accuracy of the load cell is 0 1 more specifications about the load cell are listed in table 2 the model was fixed in place using a vertical column connected via the load cell at the model cog position see fig 4 the load cell is water proof ip67 and is placed on a platform at the level of cog of the model to reduce the uncertainty of the measurement due attention should be taken to ensure accurate alignments between the axes of the model and the load cell as well as the model with the wave flume wave probes were installed at various locations to register free surface elevations during the experiments see figs 5 and 6 the separation gap s is defined as the distance between the starboard of the model and the flume wall see fig 6 locations of wave gauges p3 p4 p5 and p7 were also shown in the figure for the free floating experiments the lifeboat model can move freely in waves but with two springs and wires attached at bow and stern of the model horizontally through pulleys see fig 7 the connecting wires and the springs are in the longitudinal central plane of the model the rate of the spring is 2 06 n m the 6dof motions of the model were measured by an optical tracking system qualisys motion measurement system 4 results and discussions sensitivity and convergence analysis have been carried out for the numerical calculation considering domain size boundary surface discretization scheme and the artificial damping coefficient in the damping zone free surface for the results presented in the following sections the longitudinal range of the free surface boundary s f is one wave length ahead of the bow and one wave length after the stern of the model the range of the damping zone free surfaces at both ends of the flume is five times the wave length in the numerical calculations 5772 panels are distributed on the domain boundaries 1475 panels on the body surface 896 panels on each of the side walls 1862 panels on the free surface 340 panels on the damping zone 112 panels on the outer surface and 191 panels on the water plane see fig 2 the length of the panels on the lifeboat model is about 1 40th of the boat length there are 34 panels in the girth direction on the free surface s f for panels between the bow and stern of the model length of the panel is 1 16th of model length for the panels in front of the bow of the model or behind the stern of the model the panel length is 1 20th of wave length the maximum width of a free surface panel is 1 24th of the flume width 2 5 cm the lengths of panels on the damping zone expand with a ratio of 1 20 the computational time for each frequency is about 45 min on a desktop using intel core i7 2600 cpu 3 40 ghz and 64 bit operating system model experiments were conducted in regular waves in analysing the data recorded during the experiments time series of the raw data were selected after initial transient values had passed the sampling frequency for the wave loads is 1613 hz and for waves and motions of the lifeboat model the sampling frequencies are 128 hz any static offset was removed to yield oscillating responses only band pass filtering was applied to the recorded signals to obtain first order responses loads and motions 4 1 wave loads all the wave loads were measured for the fixed lifeboat model cases the model was held at 3 different distances from the side wall given the separation gap s1 22 5 cm s2 15 cm and s3 7 5 cm where s1 22 5 cm represents the model at the central position of the flume the experiments were carried out in linear regular waves the force and moment amplitudes were non dimensionalised by ρ g l b a and ρ g l b 2 a respectively where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity l and b are the length and beam of the lifeboat model respectively and a is the amplitude of the incident waves the wave frequency was non dimensionalised with ω ω l g fig 8 10 show the wave loads on the model for the separation gap s s1 where the model is positioned at the centre of the flume the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is satisfactory it is noticed that the wave loads are not sensitive to the artificial damping coefficient ν there is very little difference among the wave loads for the three artificial damping coefficients ν 0 00 0 01 and 0 025 except at the higher frequency region where ν 0 025 has a better agreement with the experiment fig 11 13 are the sway heave forces and pitch moment for the separation gap s s2 the predicted heave force and pitch moment are in good agreement with the measurement for the sway force the largest peak for the numerical prediction is at a frequency corresponding to the first resonance mode of the flume width wave length λ 1 2 m which is over predicted by the numerical method the measured data shows a peak at the second resonance mode wave length λ 0 6 m but the peak in the numerical prediction is much smaller the second largest peak of the numerical prediction is at a wave length close to the third flume width resonance frequency λ 0 4 m overall except for the second flume width resonance frequency λ 0 6 m the numerical results with the free surface artificial damping coefficient ν 0 025 show good agreement with the model experimental measurements 4 2 free surface elevation the free surface elevations for the fixed model tests at the selected positions were calculated by the numerical method and compared with the model experiment measurements the wave amplitudes are non dimensionalised by the amplitude of the incident wave fig 14 shows the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauge locations p3 and p5 against wave length λ for the separation gap s s1 model at the centre of the flume results of four artificial free surface damping coefficients ν 0 0 01 0 025 0 05 for the numerical results are shown the agreement between the numerical and model experimental results is satisfactory it can be seen that the effect of the damping coefficient on the numerical results is minor wave amplitudes with the undamped free surface boundary condition show small spikes at the second and third flume width resonance frequencies λ 0 6 m 0 4 m fig 15 shows comparison of waves at p5 and p7 for the gap separation s s2 model at off central position at the short wave length range the numerical results with undamped free surface condition change sharply at the first three flume width resonance frequencies due to the interaction and lack of damping in the numerical model the numerical results with the artificial damping for the free surface boundary condition are smooth and agree well with the experimental results fig 17 is a snapshot of the diffraction wave field incident and diffraction waves for the separation gap s s2 it is interesting to note the substantial differences between the wave elevations at the port and starboard sides of model when the wave length is close to the first and second resonance modes of the flume width λ 1 2 m 0 6 m in fig 16 the wave elevations at p3 and p4 for the gap separation s s3 is plotted the numerical results show more peaks indicating more resonances at the high frequency short length wave range it seems that setting the artificial damping coefficient equal 0 01 leads to better agreement between the measured and numerical results the wave elevations at the starboard side p3 closer to the wall are much larger than the port side p4 due to the side wall effect there is a peak at wave length λ 0 43 m in the numerical prediction which is close to the third resonance frequency of the flume width 4 3 model motions some of the hydrodynamic coefficients of radiation added mass and damping coefficient were selected and shown in fig 18 21 the non dimensional added masses are defined as a 33 a 33 m a 22 a 22 m where m is the mass of the model and the non dimensional damping coefficient is defined as b 55 b 55 m l g l fig 18 is the heave added mass at the separation gap s s1 with the model in the centre of the flume a peak at the second flume width resonance frequency λ 0 6 m is clearly seen as the artificial damping increases the added mass is smooth fig 19 shows the sway added mass for s s2 in which the model is at an off centre position the peaks at the first and second resonances were observed the magnitudes at the peaks decrease as the artificial damping increases as expected fig 20 is the heave added mass for the separation gap s s2 substantial difference from the heave added mass with s s1 fig 18 can be seen due to the wall effect a large peak at the third resonance λ 0 4 m can be observed from the pitch damping coefficient in fig 21 the motion raos of the model for separation gap s s1 model at centre of the flume are shown in fig 22 24 the amplitudes of surge sway and heave are non dimensionalised with the amplitude of the incident wave a pitch amplitude was non dimensionalised with the amplitude of slope of the incident wave k 0 a where k 0 is the wave number it can be seen that the agreement between the numerical prediction and model experiment are generally good for the numerical prediction with undamped free surface boundary condition there are troughs in the high frequency range due to the resonance the troughs disappear when the artificial damping applied in the free surface condition for separation gap s s2 the comparisons are shown in fig 25 28 the model is on off central position of the flume in this case the effect of the walls on the model is stronger as can be seen from heave motion in fig 27 where resonance at the first mode of the flume width occurs even when a higher artificial damping coefficient was applied in the free surface boundary condition than for the s s1 case fig 23 the sway motion is over predicted by the numerical model due to non consideration of viscosity in the potential flow theory overall the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is reasonably satisfactory when the artificial damping was introduced 5 conclusions the side wall effect was traditionally tackled with potential flow based methods it is well known that due to the existence of the resonance frequencies in the wave tank the numerical methods over predict the hydrodynamic forces furthermore in most of the previous studies on the effect of the side wall the model was located at the centre of the wave tanks due to the symmetry of the disturbance on both sides of the model resonances of some of the responses such as wave surface elevations motions of the model in waves may not be excited at the natural frequencies however these resonances will be excited when the model is located off central position of the tank in the present paper the effect of the side walls in a lifeboat model tests in a wave flume was investigated numerically and experimentally a boundary element method based on the rankine green function was developed where an artificial damping was introduced in the free surface boundary condition to account for the viscous effect sources were also distributed on the side walls hull surface and far field control surface three separation gaps between the side of the model and the flume side wall were investigated the predicted wave forces free surface elevations around the model and model motions were compared with the experimental measurements and good agreement was found due to the existence of the resonance frequencies of the flume width and the non consideration of viscosity in the potential flow model numerical results consistently over predict loads and responses in waves comparing that with the model test measurements the numerical results with an artificial damping ν 0 01 0 025 applied to the free surface boundary condition agree well with the experimental measurements in particular in the case with the model at an off central location in the flume when the model is at the central position of the flume resonances of some responses wave elevation forces and motions of the hull are not excited the wave field is symmetric about the central plane variations of wave loads and motions are smooth with the model located at an off central position the resonances for wave surface elevations forces and motions are excited and the viscous effect becomes evident it should be mentioned that although viscous damping was introduced in the free surface boundary condition the governing equation in the model remains that of an ideal inviscid fluid due to the lack of viscous damping the transverse motions sway and roll are still over predicted the present numerical method may also be applied for the assessment of the side wall effect for model experiments in a towing tank or wave tank based on the tank

the disturbances on both sides of the model are symmetric and the resonances of some of the responses such as wave surface elevation and motions may not be excited at the tank natural frequencies in the present study a rankine source panel method is used to tackle the effects of the side walls and artificial damping is introduced in the free surface boundary condition to account for the viscous damping effect model experiments are carried out for a lifeboat model located at various positions in a wave flume numerical results of the wave forces free surface elevations and motions of the model are compared with the model test measurements and good agreement is found it is shown that the inclusion of the artificial damping in the free surface boundary condition is effective in particular for the model at off centre position of the tank keywords side wall effect 3d rankine method numerical prediction model test artificial damping 1 introduction the wave model testing facilities wave basin towing tank and wave flume always have a limited width due to the existence of the side walls the measured loads and responses would present some discrepancies compared to the open sea results e g kashiwagi and ohkusu 1989 ittc has a recommended procedure for seakeeping model experiments to avoid the tank wall interference in head waves in towing tank ittc 2002 the recommended maximum frequency at which tank wall interference occurs depends on froude number of the model which means for model tests at low and zero speeds the side wall interference is inevitable therefore there will be a strong interest to assess the side wall effects when extrapolating the experimental results to open sea condition in full scale the side wall effects also present for a floating structure in a channel in this case the floating structure may located on off central position of the channel to avoid the passing vehicles another situation where the wall effect is relevant is for a launch and recovery operation at sea when a lifeboat or rov is in between two large vessels mothership and rescue support vessel where the mothership rescue vessels are considerably large than the lifeboat rov and when considering the hydrodynamic interactions they are replaced as infinitely long walls the side wall effect was tackled numerically by means of the free surface green function method based on potential flow theory the free surface green function in the open sea satisfies the laplace equation linearized free surface condition sea bottom condition and radiation condition at the far field but not the boundary condition on the two parallel side walls one way to tackle the problem is to consider the side wall as an independent fixed very large body so that the singularity is distributed on the wetted body surface cf duan et al 2007 and peng et al 2015 mciver 1993 presented a theoretical model for diffraction and radiation solutions on truncated vertical cylinders including side wall effects through the multipoles expansion method this method is limited to bodies of simple geometry such as vertical cylinders for general 3d problem a green function satisfying the boundary condition on the side walls should be defined linton 1993 proposed a free surface green functions with tank walls kashiwagi 1991 divided the green function involved in the side wall effects into an open sea green function and another term and the slowly convergent term was replaced by a double integral over a semi infinite domain chen 1994 presented the tank green function as the sum of two parts based on the convergence due to the slow convergence of the green function xia 2001 divided it into three parts in the near middle and far fields respectively newman 2016 developed the image green function igf method which is composed of a series of open sea green functions satisfying the free surface condition chen et al 2018 investigated hydrodynamics of side wall effects through the igf based on taylor expansion boundary element method the rankine source panel method is an alternative approach for tackling the wave body interaction problem the rankine source is easy to calculate numerically but it does not satisfy the linearized free surface boundary condition and the radiation condition in the far field early efforts can be seen from works of yeung 1982 for 2d and liapis and beck 1985 for 3d problems for the wave body interaction problem in open sea the rankine singularity needs to be distributed on both the hull surface and the free surface and the radiation condition should be implemented properly in the frequency domain nakos 1989 cao et al 1989 bertram and thiart 1998 bunnik 1999 xie and vassalos 2012 or in time domain watai et al 2015 2016 it can also be applied for hydrodynamics analysis of a hydrofoil under free surface xie and vassalos 2007 the rankine panel method has the flexibility of altering the free surface boundary condition to tackle higher order or nonlinear problems boo 2002 ning et al 2018 more recently resonance of wave surface motion in the gap between a fpso and an lng tanker has attracted much interest in the hydrodynamics research community soares et al 2015 sun et al 2015 pessoa et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the potential flow based panel method was used for the numerical prediction model experimental results had to be used to tune the artificial damping coefficients in the free surface boundary condition to achieve good agreements yuan et al 2018 investigated side wall effects on ship model testing in a towing tank in calm water and in waves using the rankine source panel method it was found that the side wall effect on the experiments in waves is more complicated than that in calm water due to the complexity of the wave systems the hydrodynamic coefficients radiation forces fluctuated wildly away from the open sea results the reflected and radiated waves were trapped within the towing tank and resulting side wall effects become significant in most of the research into the side wall effect the model was positioned at the centre of the tank in the present study side wall effects are investigated both numerically and experimentally and the model was located at various distances from the side wall in the numerical study the rankine source panel method was used to solve wave field the singularities were distributed on the hull surface free surface side walls and far field control surface and an artificial damping term was added to the free surface boundary condition model experiments were carried out in a wave flume for a lifeboat model wave loading on the hull free surface elevations and model motions were predicted and compared with those of the model experiments comparison of the numerical prediction and the model experiments shows good agreement it was found that adding the artificial damping in the free surface boundary condition leads to better agreement between the numerical results and the measurements in particular for the model at off central positions of the flume 2 numerical methods it is assumed that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and that the motion is irrotational velocity potentials exist and satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain the right handed cartesian coordinate system is defined with xoy plane on the undisturbed free surface while xoz plane is the symmetric vertical plane of the ship model ox axis pointing to the bow and oz is positive upwards and through the centre of gravity cg of the model fig 1 a complex velocity potential provides a description of the velocity potential as 1 φ x y z t r e φ 0 x y z φ 7 x y z j 1 6 u j φ j x y z e i ω t where φ 0 and φ 7 are complex spatial velocity potentials for the incident and diffraction waves respectively u j j 1 2 6 are the complex velocity amplitudes of motions of the 6 degree of freedom for the body u 1 surge u 2 sway u 3 heave u 4 roll u 5 pitch u 6 yaw φ

s h free surface s f damping zone free surface s d port side wall s p starboard side wall s s the far field control surface at both ends of the flume s o and the bottom s b the green function is selected as 2 g x y z ξ η ζ 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z 2 d ζ 2 where x y z is the field point ξ η ζ is the source point and d is the water depth since the green function in 2 satisfies the bottom boundary condition a 16 source distribution on the bottom boundary will not be required 3 φ j x y z s g x y z ξ η ζ σ j ξ η ζ d s where σ j j 1 2 7 are the source densities on the boundary surfaces and s s h s f s d s p s s s o see fig 1 in order to surpass the irregular frequency the water plane of the model is also panelised and zero normal velocity was applied malenica and chen 1998 the free surface boundary condition with artificial damping is see appendix a 4 g φ j z ω 2 1 ν 2 i 2 ν ω 2 φ j 0 on z 0 j 1 2 7 where ν is the non dimensional artificial damping coefficient the modified free surface condition also used by chen 2004 and faltinsen and timokha 2015 in the recent works of guo et al 2018a 2018b a 2d time domain green function was developed and implemented numerically to account for the viscous effects in the free surface boundary condition in body wave interaction problems in their method viscous damping is taken into account in the dynamic free surface boundary condition in the same manner as in the current study equation a 20 however the addition of the viscous damping in the kinematic free surface boundary condition is slightly different in that the wave surface elevation was eliminated before the addition of the viscous damping in the works of guo et al in the present method the overall free surface condition has an additional ν 2 term since ν is usually a small number the effect of the difference in the modified free surface boundary condition between the present method and that of guo et al s on the hydrodynamic loads and motions is likely to be insignificant the free surface boundary condition with viscous effect can also be derived from linearization of ns equation chen and dias 2010 when ν 0 eq 4 becomes the undamped linearized free surface boundary condition 5 g φ j z ω 2 φ j 0 on z 0 the radiation condition is satisfied by applying an approximated sommerfeld radiation condition a 18 at the outer boundary s o this was enhanced by setting up the damping zone on the free surface further away from the vessel model where size of the panel increases gradually see fig 2 and an artificial damping coefficient was applied for the free surface boundary condition in the damping zone equation 3 indicates that the velocity potentials at a field point x y z in the fluid domain including at the domain boundary can be represented by a source distribution over the domain boundary surfaces in order to solve the unknown source strength in equation 3 the domain boundaries are discretized into a number of quadrilateral panels with constant source density by applying the boundary conditions at the control point of each panel for every boundary of the fluid domain one equation for the unknown source density will be obtained for each panel and the equations for the unknown source strength are closed and can be solved by a standard routine once the unknown source distributions and the velocity potentials are solved the complex amplitude of the spatial pressure distribution can be calculated as 6 p j x y z i ρ ω φ j x y z j 0 1 7 the complex amplitudes of wave exciting forces moments are 7 f

the university of plymouth the flume was equipped with a piston type wave maker with active absorption capabilities and a foam beach at the opposite end tests were carried out at still water depth of 0 75 m a lifeboat model was manufactured from carbon composite main particulars of the lifeboat model are shown in table 1 the body plan of the lifeboat is shown in fig 3 before the tests the model was calibrated for its centre of gravity cog and radius of gyration in each component direction gyradii the experiments consist of model fixed and free floating tests for the fixed experiments a 6 axis load cell was used to measure the wave load components acting on the model the capacities of the load cell are 125 n for f x and f y and 250 n for f z capacity of m x m y and m z are all 25 n m accuracy of the load cell is 0 1 more specifications about the load cell are listed in table 2 the model was fixed in place using a vertical column connected via the load cell at the model cog position see fig 4 the load cell is water proof ip67 and is placed on a platform at the level of cog of the model to reduce the uncertainty of the measurement due attention should be taken to ensure accurate alignments between the axes of the model and the load cell as well as the model with the wave flume wave probes were installed at various locations to register free surface elevations during the experiments see figs 5 and 6 the separation gap s is defined as the distance between the starboard of the model and the flume wall see fig 6 locations of wave gauges p3 p4 p5 and p7 were also shown in the figure for the free floating experiments the lifeboat model can move freely in waves but with two springs and wires attached at bow and stern of the model horizontally through pulleys see fig 7 the connecting wires and the springs are in the longitudinal central plane of the model the rate of the spring is 2 06 n m the 6dof motions of the model were measured by an optical tracking system qualisys motion measurement system 4 results and discussions sensitivity and convergence analysis have been carried out for the numerical calculation considering domain size boundary surface discretization scheme and the artificial damping coefficient in the damping zone free surface for the results presented in the following sections the longitudinal range of the free surface boundary s f is one wave length ahead of the bow and one wave length after the stern of the model the range of the damping zone free surfaces at both ends of the flume is five times the wave length in the numerical calculations 5772 panels are distributed on the domain boundaries 1475 panels on the body surface 896 panels on each of the side walls 1862 panels on the free surface 340 panels on the damping zone 112 panels on the outer surface and 191 panels on the water plane see fig 2 the length of the panels on the lifeboat model is about 1 40th of the boat length there are 34 panels in the girth direction on the free surface s f for panels between the bow and stern of the model length of the panel is 1 16th of model length for the panels in front of the bow of the model or behind the stern of the model the panel length is 1 20th of wave length the maximum width of a free surface panel is 1 24th of the flume width 2 5 cm the lengths of panels on the damping zone expand with a ratio of 1 20 the computational time for each frequency is about 45 min on a desktop using intel core i7 2600 cpu 3 40 ghz and 64 bit operating system model experiments were conducted in regular waves in analysing the data recorded during the experiments time series of the raw data were selected after initial transient values had passed the sampling frequency for the wave loads is 1613 hz and for waves and motions of the lifeboat model the sampling frequencies are 128 hz any static offset was removed to yield oscillating responses only band pass filtering was applied to the recorded signals to obtain first order responses loads and motions 4 1 wave loads all the wave loads were measured for the fixed lifeboat model cases the model was held at 3 different distances from the side wall given the separation gap s1 22 5 cm s2 15 cm and s3 7 5 cm where s1 22 5 cm represents the model at the central position of the flume the experiments were carried out in linear regular waves the force and moment amplitudes were non dimensionalised by ρ g l b a and ρ g l b 2 a respectively where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity l and b are the length and beam of the lifeboat model respectively and a is the amplitude of the incident waves the wave frequency was non dimensionalised with ω ω l g fig 8 10 show the wave loads on the model for the separation gap s s1 where the model is positioned at the centre of the flume the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is satisfactory it is noticed that the wave loads are not sensitive to the artificial damping coefficient ν there is very little difference among the wave loads for the three artificial damping coefficients ν 0 00 0 01 and 0 025 except at the higher frequency region where ν 0 025 has a better agreement with the experiment fig 11 13 are the sway heave forces and pitch moment for the separation gap s s2 the predicted heave force and pitch moment are in good agreement with the measurement for the sway force the largest peak for the numerical prediction is at a frequency corresponding to the first resonance mode of the flume width wave length λ 1 2 m which is over predicted by the numerical method the measured data shows a peak at the second resonance mode wave length λ 0 6 m but the peak in the numerical prediction is much smaller the second largest peak of the numerical prediction is at a wave length close to the third flume width resonance frequency λ 0 4 m overall except for the second flume width resonance frequency λ 0 6 m the numerical results with the free surface artificial damping coefficient ν 0 025 show good agreement with the model experimental measurements 4 2 free surface elevation the free surface elevations for the fixed model tests at the selected positions were calculated by the numerical method and compared with the model experiment measurements the wave amplitudes are non dimensionalised by the amplitude of the incident wave fig 14 shows the comparison of wave amplitudes at wave gauge locations p3 and p5 against wave length λ for the separation gap s s1 model at the centre of the flume results of four artificial free surface damping coefficients ν 0 0 01 0 025 0 05 for the numerical results are shown the agreement between the numerical and model experimental results is satisfactory it can be seen that the effect of the damping coefficient on the numerical results is minor wave amplitudes with the undamped free surface boundary condition show small spikes at the second and third flume width resonance frequencies λ 0 6 m 0 4 m fig 15 shows comparison of waves at p5 and p7 for the gap separation s s2 model at off central position at the short wave length range the numerical results with undamped free surface condition change sharply at the first three flume width resonance frequencies due to the interaction and lack of damping in the numerical model the numerical results with the artificial damping for the free surface boundary condition are smooth and agree well with the experimental results fig 17 is a snapshot of the diffraction wave field incident and diffraction waves for the separation gap s s2 it is interesting to note the substantial differences between the wave elevations at the port and starboard sides of model when the wave length is close to the first and second resonance modes of the flume width λ 1 2 m 0 6 m in fig 16 the wave elevations at p3 and p4 for the gap separation s s3 is plotted the numerical results show more peaks indicating more resonances at the high frequency short length wave range it seems that setting the artificial damping coefficient equal 0 01 leads to better agreement between the measured and numerical results the wave elevations at the starboard side p3 closer to the wall are much larger than the port side p4 due to the side wall effect there is a peak at wave length λ 0 43 m in the numerical prediction which is close to the third resonance frequency of the flume width 4 3 model motions some of the hydrodynamic coefficients of radiation added mass and damping coefficient were selected and shown in fig 18 21 the non dimensional added masses are defined as a 33 a 33 m a 22 a 22 m where m is the mass of the model and the non dimensional damping coefficient is defined as b 55 b 55 m l g l fig 18 is the heave added mass at the separation gap s s1 with the model in the centre of the flume a peak at the second flume width resonance frequency λ 0 6 m is clearly seen as the artificial damping increases the added mass is smooth fig 19 shows the sway added mass for s s2 in which the model is at an off centre position the peaks at the first and second resonances were observed the magnitudes at the peaks decrease as the artificial damping increases as expected fig 20 is the heave added mass for the separation gap s s2 substantial difference from the heave added mass with s s1 fig 18 can be seen due to the wall effect a large peak at the third resonance λ 0 4 m can be observed from the pitch damping coefficient in fig 21 the motion raos of the model for separation gap s s1 model at centre of the flume are shown in fig 22 24 the amplitudes of surge sway and heave are non dimensionalised with the amplitude of the incident wave a pitch amplitude was non dimensionalised with the amplitude of slope of the incident wave k 0 a where k 0 is the wave number it can be seen that the agreement between the numerical prediction and model experiment are generally good for the numerical prediction with undamped free surface boundary condition there are troughs in the high frequency range due to the resonance the troughs disappear when the artificial damping applied in the free surface condition for separation gap s s2 the comparisons are shown in fig 25 28 the model is on off central position of the flume in this case the effect of the walls on the model is stronger as can be seen from heave motion in fig 27 where resonance at the first mode of the flume width occurs even when a higher artificial damping coefficient was applied in the free surface boundary condition than for the s s1 case fig 23 the sway motion is over predicted by the numerical model due to non consideration of viscosity in the potential flow theory overall the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is reasonably satisfactory when the artificial damping was introduced 5 conclusions the side wall effect was traditionally tackled with potential flow based methods it is well known that due to the existence of the resonance frequencies in the wave tank the numerical methods over predict the hydrodynamic forces furthermore in most of the previous studies on the effect of the side wall the model was located at the centre of the wave tanks due to the symmetry of the disturbance on both sides of the model resonances of some of the responses such as wave surface elevations motions of the model in waves may not be excited at the natural frequencies however these resonances will be excited when the model is located off central position of the tank in the present paper the effect of the side walls in a lifeboat model tests in a wave flume was investigated numerically and experimentally a boundary element method based on the rankine green function was developed where an artificial damping was introduced in the free surface boundary condition to account for the viscous effect sources were also distributed on the side walls hull surface and far field control surface three separation gaps between the side of the model and the flume side wall were investigated the predicted wave forces free surface elevations around the model and model motions were compared with the experimental measurements and good agreement was found due to the existence of the resonance frequencies of the flume width and the non consideration of viscosity in the potential flow model numerical results consistently over predict loads and responses in waves comparing that with the model test measurements the numerical results with an artificial damping ν 0 01 0 025 applied to the free surface boundary condition agree well with the experimental measurements in particular in the case with the model at an off central location in the flume when the model is at the central position of the flume resonances of some responses wave elevation forces and motions of the hull are not excited the wave field is symmetric about the central plane variations of wave loads and motions are smooth with the model located at an off central position the resonances for wave surface elevations forces and motions are excited and the viscous effect becomes evident it should be mentioned that although viscous damping was introduced in the free surface boundary condition the governing equation in the model remains that of an ideal inviscid fluid due to the lack of viscous damping the transverse motions sway and roll are still over predicted the present numerical method may also be applied for the assessment of the side wall effect for model experiments in a towing tank or wave tank based on the tank
