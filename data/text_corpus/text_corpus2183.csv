10915,the performance assessments of aquacrop model using long term field measured data are rare in this study the model was evaluated relative to maize growth yield and water use parameters variables under different water stress conditions over six years 2005 2010 in nebraska usa the model was calibrated and validated for full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 50 60 and 75 of fit and rainfed model default parameters provided very poor estimates for mostly all variables after calibration the model adequately simulated daily canopy cover cc for both 2009 and 2010 nrmses 15 6 except for slight discrepancies in 2010 however the model overestimated the final biomass in 2009 due to overestimation of biomass development in the late growth stages the simulation of final biomass was better in 2010 nrmse 5 3 than in 2009 nrmse 31 the model simulated grain yield quite well nrmse of 7 7 and 12 1 ef of 0 8 and 0 7 during both calibration and validation respectively except for rainfed treatments in most years the model was not able to simulate total soil water accurately in most cases except for 2009 growing season the crop evapotranspiration etc was simulated with good accuracy during 2007 2009 and 2010 and the higher prediction error up to 16 5 was observed for dry years 2005 and 2006 and wet year 2008 the model performance declined substantially in conditions of water stress excess water and high evaporative demand in conclusion the aquacrop simulated yield and etc with slight underestimation quite well in some cases but encountered substantial difficulties in simulating biomass and soil water especially during years of low precipitation and high evaporative demand as well as in wet year further evaluation of the model is needed using field measured evaporation and transpiration data to determine the accuracy of etc partition by the model to better simulate soil water and etc which are critical for the estimation of in season irrigation requirements biomass production and yield keywords aquacrop calibration validation canopy cover biomass soil water evapotranspiration limited irrigation maize yield model performance 1 introduction globally agriculture accounts for 70 75 of total freshwater withdrawals food production has increased by more than 100 in the last 30 years and about 60 more food will be needed by year 2050 to meet the food fiber feed and energy demands of the rapidly growing population according to fao projections food production in irrigated land area will need to be increased by more than 50 by 2050 but only a 10 increase in water withdrawal by agriculture will be possible fao 2017 based on current global water supply and demand analyses and projections therefore increase in water and food demand with limited resources especially water necessitates improving the efficiency of water use in crop production which has been and will continue to be a significant challenge for agriculture declining worldwide irrigation water resources and uncertainty in precipitation due to its inter and intra annual variability has increased the risk of failure for crop production under such circumstances deficit or limited irrigation can provide important strategic options for enhancing crop water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 crop water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of economic yield of a crop or biomass produced per unit of crop evapotranspiration etc irmak 2015a b crop models that can accurately estimate various crop growth parameters soil water dynamics crop water use and expected yield under different irrigation levels can provide vital assistance to successfully implementing limited and full irrigation management practices in terms of meeting global food demand maize zea mays l plays an important role as a grain crop accounting for nearly 30 of the total global grain production and is used in numerous industrial applications including human food and fiber needs animal feed and energy production it is a major irrigated and rainfed crop globally and in the u s including in midwestern states maize yield is affected by several factors such as planting date type of hybrid planting density weather conditions soil fertility management strategies and soil water availability water stress is one of the most important factors affecting maize yield and it is very sensitive to water stress especially during tasseling silking and grain fill periods resulting in significant yield reduction otegui et al 1995 several studies have reported the impacts of water deficits on maize to vary depending on the development growth stage at which the stress occurs ghooshchi et al 2008 reported that water deficit before silking during silking and during grain fill growth stage decreased yield by 12 5 42 0 and 22 5 respectively irmak 2015a b reported that no significant grain yield difference was observed between full irrigation treatment fit and 75 fit indicating limited irrigation as viable practice for increasing crop water productivity in south central nebraska conditions this is in agreement with findings by stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 field experiments are critically important and effective ways to investigate management options to improve yield under limited water availability and provide understanding of plant soil water atmosphere interactions and their impacts on grain yield and other important plant phenological and physiological responses data and information generated from such field experiments are critical in development calibration and validation of simulation models that are designed to study the behavior of a system these models are considered as a possibility to investigate a wide range of management strategies with reduced efforts and low cost and can provide invaluable information and data for scenarios for which conducting fields experiments may not be even possible various crop models of different complexity have been developed such as crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic cavero et al 2000 ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 wofost boogaard et al 1998 and stics brisson et al 1998 2002 most of these models are quite sophisticated and require substantial input parameters variables and may not always be feasible or amenable for general use the simulation of crop development and growth parameters is based on complex interactions between climate crop and soil parameters and management practices majority of the models require highly detailed input data and information about crop growth that might not be available for most locations moreover the applicability of most of the models is also limited by the unavailability of open access source code however a recently developed fao aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 is a user friendly model that attempts to balance simplicity accuracy and robustness the aquacrop model simulates water limited yield under different management conditions using smaller number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters as compared with other crop models as it has been suggested that most of the parameters are conservative and do not change with location raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2012 the aquacrop has been successfully applied to multiple crops across wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions in addition the open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os is also available that can be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems foster et al 2016 the model performance has been evaluated for several crops including maize soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 potato razzaghi et al 2017 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 hsiao et al 2009 parameterized and tested the model for maize using datasets from 6 years of field experiments at davis ca usa that included varying plant densities planting dates hybrids and atmospheric evaporative demand under different irrigation amounts they discussed the usefulness and limitations of aquacrop model in simulating canopy cover cc biomass water content and water use efficiency a set of conservative parameters were developed for maize in the aforementioned study and they were validated in a later study by heng et al 2009 for locations with diverse environments they reported that model performance was more satisfactory under non water stress and mild stress treatments as compared with severe water stress treatments similar finding was reported by abedinpour et al 2012 indicating that aquacrop model predicted maize yield more accurately for full irrigation and 75 of the field capacity fc treatments as compared with rainfed and 50 of fc treatment when assessing maize response under varying irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a semi arid region they reported that the prediction error in simulation of grain yield and biomass under all treatments ranged from 1 35 to 9 9 and from 0 84 to 17 5 respectively mebane et al 2013 evaluated the model performance in simulating grain yield biomass and soil water content of rainfed maize in pennsylvania u s a and reported accurate simulation of progression of cumulative biomass and grain yield with time with index of agreement d ranging from 0 96 to 0 99 in contrast katerji et al 2013 highlighted the limitations of aquacrop model in simulating the effects of water stress on maize yield biomass and etc they reported that the model overestimated maize yield and biomass and underestimated etc resulting in overestimation of water use efficiency paredes et al 2014 suggested that when appropriate parametrization is adopted aquacrop can simulate maize biomass and yield under deficit conditions adequately aforementioned findings indicate the necessity to appropriately calibrate and validate the model for specific regions to improve the model performance in estimating crop yield water use and crop growth parameters and evaluate limited irrigation strategies to develop effective management strategies considering the limitations and the need for better parameterization of the model referred in the aforementioned literature the current study was conducted to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for maize grown in a transition zone between sub humid and semiarid environment of nebraska there is no or very limited literature available for use of aquacrop in nebraska or greater midwestern corn belt region of the u s a and most of the available studies for maize consider validation using short term field data mostly 2 or 3 growing seasons or less in which the long term inter annual variability in environmental conditions affecting maize response to water and other variables may not be considered therefore to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first long term validation work of aquacrop model for maize in nebraska and midwestern region the specific objective of this study was to calibrate the aquacrop model for estimating maize growth and development including cc response to water soil water content total soil water etc biomass and yield and to validate the model using long term field observed datasets and evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model in estimating the aforementioned variables under full and various levels of limited irrigation and rainfed production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field measured datasets from long term and extensive research conducted and published by irmak 2015a b were used as the primary data source for this study as described in irmak 2015a b the experimental data used in this study were obtained from a long term research project conducted from 2005 to 2010 growing seasons at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska south central nebraska is characterized as being in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid zones with strong winds and high air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit vpd the long term average growing season precipitation at the site is 437 mm but the timing and magnitude of precipitation vary significantly from year to year and within the growing season the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day with a maize rooting depth of 1 50 m total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 300 mm irmak 2015a 2 2 agronomic and field management practices as described in irmak 2015a b the field experiment was designed as a completely randomized block design with three replications of each treatment each replication plot was 1 ha in size and the sampling area for field measurements was eight rows wide with 0 76 m row spacing and 15 2 m long the field was planted with the same hybrids with planting population density of 73 000 plants ha and planting depth of 0 05 m with north south planting direction during all six growing seasons the 16 5 ha field was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system tl irrigation co hastings nebraska usa the christiansen s coefficient of uniformity of the irrigation water application of the system was 95 therefore the net irrigation depths were calculated based on the uniformity coefficient and were used in the model during simulation of final results four irrigation treatments were imposed fully irrigated treatment fit 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and rainfed control treatment during all years except in 2005 when only fit and rainfed treatments were imposed irrigation for fit was initiated at times when soil water depletion was approximately 40 45 of the total available water irrigation timings for all treatments were determined based on the soil water content of the fit the volumetric soil water content was measured using a troxler model 4300 neutron probe troxler electronics laboratories research triangle park nc at 0 30 0 60 0 90 1 20 1 50 and 1 80 m of soil depths on a weekly or biweekly basis in all treatments in all seasons the soil water content measurements were used in irrigation management and soil water balance calculations the entire field received uniform application of fertilizers and pesticides when needed various soil and plant measurements including leaf area index lai plant height and biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and phenological stage observations and soil water content measurements were done in all seasons brief information of agronomic properties is presented in table 1 additional detailed information on agronomic field management practices are provided in irmak 2015a b 2 3 estimation of crop evapotranspiration seasonal etc was calculated using the following soil water balance equation 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil water flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface r is surface run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws is change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season the surface run off from each treatment was quantified separately using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service curve number method usda nrcs 1985 based on the experimental site s hydrologic soil group land use treatment and other condition the curve number of 75 was used deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 inputs to the program include weather variables of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial soil water at emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters and maximum crop rooting depth 2 4 fao aquacrop model and data input aquacrop model successively simulates the crop development stages and production processes on a daily basis in four steps i crop development ii crop transpiration iii above ground biomass and iv yield the model separates etc into transpiration and evaporation components to avoid the effect of non productive consumptive use of water evaporation by developing a canopy growth and senescence model to estimate transpiration and final biomass which is then translated into yield through harvest index value steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2012 therefore the water driven growth module allows simulation of attainable yields as a function of water consumption under full irrigation deficit limited irrigation and rainfed conditions the model computes crop transpiration tc mm day soil evaporation es mm day and final grain yield y ton ha using the following equations raes et al 2012 2 tc cc kctr x eto 3 es kr 1 cc kex eto 4 y fhi hio b where cc is the actual canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects kctr x is the maximum standard crop transpiration coefficient dimensionless eto is the grass reference evapotranspiration mm day kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient to adjust for the effect of insufficient water in the top soil layer kex is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient fhi is the adjustment factor for water stresses hio is the reference harvest index and b is the aboveground dry biomass ton ha the effects of water stress are accounted for through four factors i leaf and canopy growth ii stomatal opening and transpiration iii canopy senescence and iv harvest index the water stress coefficient ks describes the effect of water stress on the above mentioned crop growth processes and is used to compute the actual crop transpiration ta ta ks tc the model describes the canopy development in terms of canopy cover cc curve an accurate simulation of cc is very important given its critical role in modelling transpiration and evaporation there are six parameters that determine the cc curve i initial cc which is a function of plant density and initial cc per seedling ii canopy growth coefficient cgc iii maximum cc ccx iv canopy decline coefficient cdc v days to emergence and vi days to senescence maturity the cc curve can be parameterized using field measured lai values user can compute the cc values from lai data using the equation developed by hsiao et al 2009 and this equation was used in this study for conversion of lai measurements to cc values as 5 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6lai 1 2 the inputs to the aquacrop model include climate crop soil and management files which can be modified specified by the user the model contains a set of default parameters for different soil or crop types that can be used when they are not available through field research for local specific cases climate data required by aquacrop include minimum and maximum air temperature eto and precipitation eto was calculated from the weather data using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on a daily basis the weather data for this study were measured using a bowen ratio energy balance system brebs that was installed in the experimental field as part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network irmak 2010 that operates 11 brebss and eddy covariance system for various vegetation surfaces additional principles and assumptions of the software are described in detail by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 2 5 aquacrop parameters and calibration aquacrop model provides default crop parameters for maize that are non location specific as parameterized by hsiao et al 2009 however the user needs to provide additional cultivar user specific crop parameters and may need to calibrate the model including conservative parameters to obtain accurate results for a given condition in this study the model first run using default maize parameters and the poor results were obtained which indicated the need for calibration of the model therefore the model was calibrated using crop soil water and climate variables parameters as were observed from the field experiment during 2009 growing season the procedures to obtain the calibrated parameters are briefly discussed here the same set of conservative and calibrated parameters were used for all years and no separate calibration was performed for different years comprehensive evaluation of the model with such a wide range of field observed dataset is essential in understanding the behavior of model and the temporal variation introduced by diverse climatic irrigation and crop and soil management conditions in addition to other factors crop development and phenology is affected by the cultivar characteristics and air temperature the model can be run in either growing degree day gdd or calendar day mode and in this study the gdd option was used the parameters determining cc curve were quantified iteratively using trial and error approach until the simulated values were close to the field observed values next the parameters affecting soil water dynamics were calibrated followed by calibration of biomass and yield by adjusting the water productivity and the transpiration crop coefficient kctr x the simulations of final yield were fine tuned by adjustment of harvest index to match the measured yields the calibration procedure was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 crop yield response to water steduto et al 2012 timing of crop phenological stages is crucial for accurate estimation of crop development in this study the initial estimates of the growth stages were based on the field observed values and they were further adjusted slightly to simulate canopy development accurately the reproductive growth period is controlled by the time to flowering and yield formation duration for building up harvest index and duration of flowering the flowering stage was initiated when the crop attained full cc the rooting depth at the site was taken as 1 5 m and the maximum rooting depth was considered to be achieved just before the start of the senescence the default value of 1 05 was used for maximum kctr x the calibrated value of water productivity was 31 7 g m2 which was in the range recommended for the c4 crops the above mentioned crop parameters were calibrated under conditions of no water stress i e fit for conditions of water stressed treatments i e rainfed and limited irrigation treatments stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to obtain close match between simulated and observed values crop response to salinity and fertility stresses was not considered during calibration pertaining to optimum growth conditions as the research site did not have salinity issue 2 6 management irrigation management in aquacrop model is specified through the type of irrigation method used and the timing and amounts of irrigation events that occurred during the growing season for simulations sprinkler irrigation method was selected and irrigation scheduling was specified by inputting the dates and amounts of the irrigation water applied for each irrigation treatment for each growing season the field management file in the model also requires the data about soil fertility crop residue and surface properties for which field observed values were used no mulching practice was considered 2 7 model validation the calibrated parameters were used to simulate grain yield biomass production cc etc and soil water the model was validated by using field observed data from 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons canopy cover and seasonal biomass data were available for 2010 growing season and were utilized to validate the aforementioned variables to assess the goodness of fit of the model both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used the qualitative approach consisted of graphical interpretation of results through basic understanding of plant processes and field observations to evaluate and understand the trends in the data the quantitative approach consisted of using statistical indicators including prediction simulation error or percent deviation pe root mean squared error rmse normalized root mean squared error nrmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef willmott s index of agreement d and coefficient of determination r2 the pe was used to assess deviation between observed and simulated yield relative to the observed values with pe approaching zero indicating better model performance and is calculated as 6 p e s i o i o i 100 where o i is the field measured observed value and s i represent simulated value rmse measures the magnitude of difference between simulated and observed values and ranges from 0 to positive infinity with 0 indicating good and infinity indicating poor model performance jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 7 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 8 n r m s e r m s e o x 100 where o is the mean of measured values the validation is considered excellent if nrmse is 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 acceptable if it is between 20 and 30 and poor for values 30 jamieson et al 1991 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared with the variance of observations indicating how well the observed vs simulated data fit the 1 1 line nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 ef ranges from minus infinity to 1 where 1 indicates perfect match between the model estimates and the observations the ef and d values are calculated by the following equations 9 e f 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 d 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 the value of d ranges from 0 to 1 and the model performance improves as d approaches 1 the r2 and ef were used to quantify the predictive power of the model while rmse indicates the error in the model prediction in addition the actual difference in the values of variables between calibrated and simulated values are also provided for evaluation of model results also two sample student s t test was conducted for alpha value of 0 05 after testing the data for homogeneity of variance using a fisher s f test to estimate if there were significant differences between model simulated and field observed data for final aboveground biomass etc and yield table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions daily seasonal precipitation and irrigation amounts in the fit treatments for each growing season are presented in fig 1 the cumulative growing season precipitation was 306 388 588 692 487 and 566 mm in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively the seasonal precipitation varied not only in total amounts between six seasons but also within each growing season the timing of precipitation plays an important role in crop development as some crop stages are more water stress sensitive than others and can have a considerable effect on crop yield quantity and quality the 2007 and 2008 seasons were the wettest years receiving lower irrigation amounts of 132 and 51 mm respectively while 2005 and 2006 were the driest years fig 1 with highest irrigation water applications 280 mm in 2005 and 241 mm in 2006 in the fit treatments in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons the irrigation amounts applied to fit treatments were 178 and 127 mm respectively most of these irrigation events occurred in june july and august and coincided with the most water stress sensitive stages and highest atmospheric demand vpd periods the maximum monthly average vpd occurred in july 2005 followed by june 2006 2007 and 2008 and august 2009 and 2010 irmak 2015a 3 2 canopy cover appropriate parameterization of cc curve is critical for the model to provide accurate estimates of soil evaporation crop transpiration biomass and yield first the cc was simulated using default values provided in the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 resulting in poor model performance as indicated by high estimation errors rmse 18 9 and very low negative ef values for both 2009 and 2010 this indicates the need for calibration of the default cc curve relative to the site specific crop soil climate and management conditions thus the model was calibrated using experimental data from 2009 and validated using the data from 2010 to determine foliage development and simulate the cc curve the calibrated and validated cc values under different irrigation and rainfed treatments for both years are presented in figs 2 and 3 the statistical parameters indicating the model performance relative to cc curves using both default and calibrated parameters are presented in table 3 the progression of cc was similar in all treatments in both years and the calibrated model closely simulated this seasonal trend in general the calibration results showed good agreement between simulated and observed data for the cc development in all treatments with high r2 values 0 86 high ef 0 83 low estimation errors rmse ranging from only 4 8 to 6 2 and high d values 0 96 low rmse values indicate the robustness of model in simulating cc under all treatments after calibration the lowest accuracy in determination of cc in 2009 was observed for 50 fit followed by 60 fit in these treatments the decline in cc from 119 days after planting dap to 140 dap was higher than the simulated values the effect of water stress in field observed data became evident after 113 dap in water stressed treatments 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed indicating faster decline in cc however the model predicted a slightly higher cc in the crop senescence stage for 50 fit and 60 fit in this aspect the starting time of canopy senescence is considered to be critical according to steduto et al 2012 canopy senescence should be started at the time when leaf senescence yellowing becomes significant and lai is no more than 3 to 4 in this study the visual observations indicated that all the leaves were green and senescence did not start until at least 135 dap in fit therefore for significant yellowing of leaves the visual and calibrated value for start of canopy senescence was considered to be 140 dap however water stress is considered to induce early senescence in plants which could be the reason for more declines in field observed cc in 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed treatments this water stress induced early senescence was captured more effectively by the model in the rainfed treatment in general the simulation of cc can be considered to be good and acceptable during calibration during validation the model was able to accurately simulate the trend of cc development although cc was underestimated during the early development stages leading to a slower establishment of the crop in all treatments fig 3 however the cc simulation can still be considered acceptable due to higher variation large values of standard deviation observed in the field measured cc during crop establishment stage the highest error in simulation of cc was observed in rainfed treatment where it was highly underestimated during the late crop development stage for the rainfed treatment p 0 05 indicating that the model tends to calculate the inhibiting effect of water stress higher than that observed in the field irrigation treatments especially fit were simulated more accurately by the model with r2 of 0 96 rmse 8 4 nrmse 9 7 d 0 95 and ef in the range of 0 73 to 0 74 as compared with the rainfed treatment r2 0 85 rmse 13 4 nrmse 15 6 d 0 89 and low ef of 0 31 the results of cc in this study are in agreement with those reported by heng et al 2009 for irrigated and water deficit maize at three locations in texas florida and spain with diverse environmental conditions they obtained rmses and ef values in the range of 5 1 34 5 and 2 0 and 0 98 respectively and reported slight mismatch in the last senesced cc with faster decline for texas site and slower decline for florida site as compared with observed cc similarly paredes et al 2014 reported overall r2 rmse and ef of 0 97 6 6 and 0 96 respectively for alpiarca site and 0 92 5 1 and 0 91 respectively for sorraia valley coruche site in central portugal and concluding good predictions of cc by the model hsiao et al 2009 pointed out the models limitation in simulating the accelerated senescence of the canopy due to water stress they reported rmses in the range of 4 8 13 6 and d 95 considering both water stressed and non stressed treatments in davis california greaves and wang 2016 assessed aquacrop model for a tropical environment in taiwan and reported that the model predicted slower crop development and underestimated cc during early vegetative stages in all treatments and model performance declined when water stress was induced resulting in r2 rmse d and ef in the range of 0 92 to 0 98 6 4 16 0 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 60 to 0 94 respectively katerji et al 2013 also showed that the aquacrop simulated cc more accurately in non stressed conditions than in water stressed environments contrarily abedinpour et al 2012 reported better simulations of cc as compared with observed data with r2 rmse and ef in the range of 0 89 to 0 98 0 66 to 0 89 and 0 81 to 0 95 respectively for a semi arid environment in new delhi india these results indicate that the model tends to simulate the mid season cc well in most cases while it tends to underestimate or overestimate cc during development and senescence stage and vice versa 3 3 soil water for a water driven model such as aquacrop it is important to evaluate its effectiveness in simulating swc and hence total soil water tsw in the crop root zone as compared with the measured data the field measured tsw that was calculated from the observed swc using neutron probe measurements were compared with simulated values for all measurement days fig 4 during calibration 2009 the model simulated the tsw with good accuracy including in the rainfall treatment except for slight underestimation in 60 fit treatment this could be due to simulation of higher cc in 60 fit as discussed earlier resulting in more water uptake by the plant and thus reduced the swc in the soil profile with higher amount than those observed in the field in other years except for only a few cases the model was not able to simulate the tsw accurately even though the simulated tsw followed the trend of observed tsw values in a number of treatments the simulations were first initiated by using default model parameters which resulted in poor estimates of tsw data not presented the estimates improved when calibrated parameters were used but they were still unsatisfactory except in 2009 and in some cases in other years as shown by statistical indicators table 4 the simulated tsw was close to the observed values during calibration 2009 for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 88 to 0 96 rmses varying from 14 2 to 24 7 mm nrmse in range of 3 to 5 2 d varying from 0 91 to 0 97 and ef ranging from 0 61 to 0 87 the model performed very well in simulating tsw for rainfed treatments in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons however the validation results indicated poor performance of model in simulating tsw for most of the treatments 0 00 r2 0 88 18 4 rmse 109 4 mm 21 9 ef 0 84 there was no consistent trend of underestimation or overestimation of tsw simulations in dry 2005 and 2006 growing seasons with seasonal precipitation of only 306 and 388 mm respectively the model overestimated the tsw in all treatments that was more pronounced in 2005 growing season indicating that model performance declined substantially in conditions of water stress and high evaporative demand however in 2008 with highest seasonal precipitation of 692 mm the simulated tsw was highly underestimated as mentioned earlier the model performance is substantially affected under conditions of very low and high extreme evaporative demands conditions the best results of model estimated and field observed tsw were obtained for 2009 growing season where simulated tsw closely matched the observed values for fit limited irrigation as well as for rainfed treatment and also for rainfed treatments in 2006 and 2010 growing seasons there are evidences in the literature towards the poor performance in simulating tsw or swc by the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 reported that the simulated tsw declined less with time as compared with observed data resulting in overestimation of tsw by as much 80 mm they also mentioned that some bias could be introduced by the random errors in the measurements such as neutron probe readings are taken few days after the irrigation that may miss the peaks of swc nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 observed that the simulated tsw was overestimated by the model with rmse values of 11 5 and 17 2 mm and very low ef values of 0 78 and 0 04 in another study paredes et al 2014 reported that aquacrop could not simulate swc accurately 0 59 r2 0 88 8 4 rmse 11 7 vol 0 03 ef 0 72 despite careful parameterization and cannot be used for irrigation scheduling purposes they observed a trend of overestimation of swc and concluded that inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation by the model contributed towards the bias in estimates of swc they suggested that the simulation of tsw can improve if the model used classical crop coefficient curve to adjust basal crop coefficient for transpiration instead of the cc curve concluding that the kctr x and cc curve proportionality should be revised as the cc curve is not impacted by the daily changes in water content and is only impacted by water stress during the vegetative stage this might be valid in this current study as well because the amount of water stress impacted swc and tsw estimations by the model contrarily despite slight overestimations ahmadi et al 2015 obtained good estimates of swc it is usually considered that most water uptake by roots take place from top soil surface i e 0 0 30 m and assumed to decrease gradually with depth which makes it necessary to accurately simulate swc in this zone for proper understanding of root density and soil water extraction patterns for the silt loam soil at the same location of this study djaman and irmak 2012 reported that under water stress conditions greater soil water extraction can occur in deeper soil layers they also found that in general the soil water extraction decreased with soil depth and the water extraction from the top soil 0 0 30 m accounted for the largest portion of the seasonal total water extraction as 39 42 48 48 and 51 of the seasonal total extraction under rainfed 50 fit 60 fit 75 fit and fit respectively the rainfed treatment extracted more water from the 0 60 0 90 m and 0 90 1 2 m soil layers 19 and 17 of the total respectively than all other treatments in general the deepest soil layer 1 5 1 8 m contributed 5 to 8 to the seasonal total water extraction mebane et al 2013 reported that largest error in simulation of swc occurred in the top 0 50 and 0 80 m soil layers followed by 0 20 m concluding that greater concentration of roots in these layers influenced the simulation errors they also reported underestimation of swc for rainfed maize especially in dry years there is also a possibility of inaccurate simulation of run off and drainage by the model which requires careful calibration of soil and field surface properties such as curve number readily evaporable water etc thus it is suggested that if the model is revised relative to the above mentioned parameters its performance to simulate soil water dynamics especially under water stressed conditions and for non water stressed conditions may be improved considerably 3 4 evapotranspiration the comparison of observed irmak 2015a b and simulated seasonal total etc values for all 6 years are presented in fig 5 and tabulated in tables 5 and 6 the etc values predicted by the model using default parameters for all years are also presented in the tables the model performed unsatisfactorily when simulations were conducted using default parameters as indicated by low r2 of 0 19 high rmse of 62 6 mm nrmse of 10 4 and ef of 0 10 table 6 also when using default parameters the model was not able to differentiate etc among different irrigation treatments except for the rainfed treatment as the model simulated similar default etc values in almost all years for different treatments therefore using the default parameters for maize in the aquacrop model for the site that has similar characteristics to those presented in this study is not recommended when careful parameterization was conducted etc values simulated by the model during calibration 2009 improved with percent difference ranging from 0 3 1 6 mm to 4 6 29 3 mm with the highest difference observed for the fit the model performance for 2009 was good r2 of 0 97 low rmse of 19 mm and average ef value of 0 80 table 6 fig 5a the underestimation of etc could be linked to slight underestimation of tsw in 2009 as well as overestimation of cc in the canopy senescence stage besides the field measured etc was calculated using soil water balance approach which can sometimes introduce some level of errors in et calculations unless evaporation and transpiration is measured directly in the field which in most cases is not feasible in the field experiments these results are comparatively better than those reported by araya et al 2017 as they predicted percent difference in etc values ranging from 7 to 20 difference in the range of 45 to 148 mm with r2 of 0 42 indicating a weak correlation they attributed this weak correlation to incomplete inputs in soil physical properties limited lai measurements and variation in planting density across irrigation treatments during the validation a trend of underestimation of etc by the model was observed except for the rainfed treatments in some of the years fig 5b however in general the best etc predictions were obtained for 2010 with simulated and observed etc difference in the range of only 2 0 to 6 9 mm except for the rainfed treatment where difference was 23 5 mm the rmses in simulation of etc for 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons were calculated as 73 31 64 and 11 mm respectively indicating highest and lowest rmse values for 2006 and 2010 respectively the overall validation results of aquacrop model for pooled data from all years indicated fair performance in etc estimations with r2 of 0 6 rmse of 52 9 mm nrmse of 8 7 mm ef value of 0 4 and percent difference in the range of 0 3 to 16 5 table 6 the best results of etc were obtained for 2010 growing season the total growing season rainfall in 2010 563 mm was greater than in 2009 426 mm and was more uniformly distributed in 2010 resulting in lesser irrigation demands 127 mm for fit as compared with 2009 177 8 mm for fit also higher wind speeds and solar radiation in 2010 may have resulted in higher evaporation from the soil surface higher biomass and yield in rainfed treatment reducing the effects of water stress this might be one of the reasons for better simulation of etc in 2010 as compared with 2009 by the model as the model performance improved in conditions of optimum water availability this is also evident from the results of etc estimated by the model in 2005 and 2006 in which highest bias was observed and these two years were the driest years resulting in higher water stress the availability of evaporation and transpiration data measured in field can shed light on the model simulation pattern of these variables contrary to the results obtained in this study paredes et al 2014 reported better accuracy of the aquacrop model in predicting seasonal etc with overall r2 of 0 81 rmse of 5 7 mm and ef value of 0 81 with no trend of over or underestimation however they highlighted the tendency of model to overestimate transpiration and underestimate evaporation component that moderated the errors in etc estimates which results in moderate accuracy in etc estimates and with unreliable values katerji et al 2013 reported that the quality of etc simulation by the model was poor similar to the etc values in this study they also reported that the model underestimated etc with a high percent difference between simulated and observed values of up to 36 they noticed that the model overestimated the effect of drought on daily etc and underestimated etc right after the irrigation events they also confirmed the finding of paredes et al 2014 that aquacrop tends to underestimate the seasonal etc in assessing the model under deficit irrigation for tropical environment greaves and wang 2016 further confirmed the tendency of model to underestimate etc with deviations ranging from 6 5 to 22 2 which increased as plant water stress intensified similar results of higher deviation of simulated etc in dry years in 2005 and 2006 were observed in this study table 5 heng et al 2009 reported that aquacrop was able to simulate etc for very high etc and windy conditions of bushland texas with moderate degree of accuracy with difference in simulated and observed values in the range of 9 to 74 mm however up to 74 mm of water can be a significant portion of seasonal total etc in water limiting semi arid environments such as bushland indicating the model s poor performance in dry hot and advective environments maize was irrigated using center pivot irrigation system in this study which should result in higher evaporation in more irrigated treatments as compared with limited irrigation treatments and the effect of reduced cc might be small in reduction of etc however simulations in this study indicated that the aquacrop model tends to calculate highest evaporation under rainfed treatment that declines with further increase in irrigation amounts this is evident from the higher simulated etc values as compared with the observed etc in some years table 5 this can be attributed to the fact that the model simulation of water stress is tied strongly to cc curve which in some cases may not be affected by daily changes in swc through kctr x and this proportionality between the two variables leads to inaccurate simulation of etc moreover the inaccuracy in simulation of etc is strongly linked to simulation of swc that was also not simulated with sufficient accuracy by the model in most cases the availability of partitioned etc into evaporation and transpiration can provide further insights into the model prediction behavior of etc ran et al 2017 3 5 in season biomass production when using default model parameters table 7 high nrmse 14 5 to 34 9 values indicated the bias in simulated aboveground biomass values as compared with field measured values thereby indicating the need for calibration the model simulated and observed aboveground biomass using calibrated parameters for all treatments for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons is presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively and the overall trend for all treatments is presented in fig 8 the standard deviation for field measured biomass for the 2009 growing season was in the range of 0 09 to 0 57 ton ha for fit 0 07 to 0 39 ton ha for 75 fit 0 12 to 0 30 ton ha for 60 fit 0 05 to 0 35 ton ha for 50 fit and 0 07 to 0 40 ton ha for rainfed treatment similarly in 2010 the standard deviation ranged from 0 18 to 0 38 ton ha for fit 0 18 to 0 43 ton ha for 75 fit 0 34 to 0 55 ton ha for 60 fit 0 32 to 0 46 ton ha for 50 fit and 0 10 to 0 34 ton ha for rainfed treatment biomass simulations resulted in improved accuracy in 2009 with rmse in the range of 1 3 to 2 8 ton ha nrmse in range of 12 5 to 26 2 higher ef 0 84 to 0 96 d 0 97 to 0 99 and r2 0 90 under all treatments however the model simulated in season biomass development did not improve in 2010 as indicated by high values of nrmse 18 2 to 30 and rmse 2 1 to 2 5 ton ha these rmses are in the range 0 58 to 6 18 ton ha of those reported by hsiao et al 2009 for seasonal progression of biomass under all treatments and nyakudyaa and stroosnijder 2014 who reported high rmse of 2 0 ton ha for rainfed maize in semi arid conditions on the other hand lower rmses in the range of 0 11 to 1 42 ton ha were reported by abedinpour et al 2012 under variable irrigation and nitrogen levels the model predictions of biomass development during 2009 were close to the observed values except during the late growth stages when the model overestimated the significant differences p 0 05 between simulated and observed values became apparent after 113 dap around r4 dough stage and this trend is evident in all treatments similarly katerji et al 2013 also reported that the aquacrop overestimated the biomass development during the second half of the maize growth stage in control treatments the overestimation of biomass after 113 dap resulted from a slight overestimation of cc at that stage fig 2 which is more pronounced in limited irrigation treatments 60 fit and 50 fit as discussed in section 3 2 the measured data indicate that the biomass development slows down after 135 dap near senescence stage in fit and may become constant in water stressed treatments however the model highly overestimated the biomass after 114 dap and indicated that biomass increased constantly until maturity which was not the case in the field measured data geerts et al 2009 reported that soil water depletion thresholds of canopy expansion and senescence maximum cc swc and cgc were the major parameters affecting canopy growth and biomass simulations lower cgc of 13 7 day obtained in this study as compared to the reference cgc of 16 3 day which contributes to a slower canopy development heng et al 2009 confirmed that aquacrop is insensitive in terms of biomass production due to some inaccuracy in simulating canopy senescence phase during validation 2010 growing season the biomass development was overestimated during most of the crop growth and development cycle in all treatments fig 7 the overestimation of biomass increased with increase in water stress as indicated by increased nrmse in the range of 24 4 30 for water stressed limited irrigation and rainfed treatments as compared with fit nrmse 18 2 overall the trend of biomass development was captured well by the model however the range of simulation errors was high 18 these results are consistent with findings of heng et al 2009 that aquacrop overestimated maize biomass under water stress conditions ahmadi et al 2015 reported that aquacrop has tendency to overestimate biomass during early maize growth stages nevertheless there is no consistency in the literature to conclude whether aquacrop consistently overestimates or underestimates maize biomass overall the model predicted the progression of aboveground biomass with high ef 0 90 and rmses of 2 25 and 2 40 ton ha in the calibration year 2009 and validation year 2010 respectively with high r2 of 0 95 discrepancies in simulation of biomass may not only be related to simulation of cc by the model but also to the calculation of transpiration although the kctr x during simulation was taken as 1 05 and was not increased the biomass simulation was still high one of the reasons could be inaccuracy in simulation of transpiration by the model due to more dependency of kctr x on cc curve paredes et al 2014 reported that in aquacrop model the impacts of water stress on transpiration are minimized due to this dependency of transpiration on cc curve this might have caused errors in simulating the late season biomass as the cc curve is more affected by water stress during vegetative stages in the aquacrop model moreover to test if the biomass simulations improve when days to senescence are reduced the model estimated biomass was evaluated for reduced days for senescence however even the model estimated biomass in that case was reduced it was still too high and hence other factors caused this over simulation it is possible that the model calculated lesser evaporation and higher transpiration but again field measured data on transpiration and evaporation are required to evaluate these relationships 3 6 final biomass production and grain yield final biomass measurements were available for 2009 and 2010 growing seasons therefore the model was calibrated for 2009 and validated for 2010 for biomass the yield data were available for each treatment and replication for all growing seasons therefore the model was calibrated for 2009 and validated for 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 datasets for yield the performance of aquacrop in simulating the final biomass is presented in fig 9 and the statistical indicators for model accuracy are given in table 8 final biomass was first simulated using model s default parameters which resulted in poor performance with high rmse 4 5 ton ha and negative model ef value 4 1 without calibration therefore calibrated parameters were used to predict biomass however the model performance did not improve for 2009 growing season as simulated values were significantly different p 0 05 than the measured values with high rmse of 6 8 ton ha nrmse of 31 and negative ef of 4 1 actual values of simulated and observed biomass are given in table 8 which showed overestimation of biomass in all treatments in 2009 which is due to overestimation of cc during late growth stage and seasonal biomass development contrarily the biomass prediction was improved for 2010 growing season with smaller rmse of 1 4 ton ha nrmse of 5 3 fair ef of 0 40 and high d value of 0 99 indicating no trend of over or under estimation table 6 fig 9 paredes et al 2014 reported similar rmse of 3 49 ton ha but high ef of 0 81 for final biomass of full and deficit irrigation treatments differences in the final biomass between the observed and simulated values during 2009 indicate overestimation of 4 4 8 0 ton ha and percent deviation of 21 6 36 3 which is considered to be quite high in 2010 these differences were reduced to 0 4 1 8 ton ha and model performance improved pe 7 3 highest accuracy in simulation of final biomass was obtained in fit in 2009 and 75 fit in 2010 and lowest was obtained for 60 fit in 2009 and rainfed treatment in 2010 contrary to the results of this study abedinpour et al 2012 reported that aquacrop was able to predict biomass with good accuracy 0 42 rmse 0 75 ton ha ef 0 95 the comparison of final biomass between 2009 and 2010 growing seasons shows that all treatments had percent difference less than 7 3 in 2010 as compared with higher percent difference of up to 36 3 in 2009 the reason for lower percent difference in 2010 might be due to abundant rainfall during this growing season and hence the crop experienced less water stress higher biomass simulation towards the late growth stages is the major reason for overestimation of final aboveground biomass in 2009 which might be due to higher transpiration calculated by the model as explained in the previous sections the grain yield simulated by the model is presented in table 9 and the statistical indicators for model accuracy are given in table 6 the model predicted grain yield unsatisfactorily rmse 2 6 ton ha nrmse 19 5 ef 0 20 and d 0 97 when default parameters were used table 6 yield simulations improved for all treatments when using calibrated parameters as indicated by lower rmses of 1 1 and 1 6 ton ha and higher ef values of 0 8 and 0 7 for calibration and validation respectively table 6 but the improvement is still considered to be minimal with high errors e g up to 1 6 ton ha error during calibration yield estimates were close to the observed values for all treatments with differences of 0 5 ton ha except for the rainfed treatment that exhibited high deviation 25 4 from the field observed yield fig 10 likewise during validation highest differences between simulated and observed yields were observed in rainfed treatments during 2005 11 2 2006 88 7 2007 40 5 and 2008 10 6 that were highly overestimated by model and are considered to be unacceptable table 9 this was attributed to the fact that the model performance declined in conditions of high water stress especially during 2005 and 2006 growing seasons that were very hot and dry with high vpd resulting in high deviations from the observed values nevertheless while unsatisfactory after calibration the rmses obtained in this study for simulated biomass and grain yield under all treatments are within the range of those reported in the literature for instance the values reported for rmses were 3 5 and 1 73 ton ha under full and deficit irrigation trials for a mediterranean regions in portugal paredes et al 2014 1 77 and 2 21 ton ha for a semi arid climate in iran ahmadi et al 2015 1 53 and 1 03 ton ha under rainfed conditions in pennsylvania mebane et al 2013 and 0 86 2 9 and 0 65 1 57 ton ha under full and deficit irrigation in california usa heng et al 2009 for biomass and grain yield respectively the inaccuracy in yield simulation by aquacrop under severe water stress conditions points towards models less adequate procedure s algorithm s for simulation of both the magnitude and timing and duration of water stress especially during the senescence stage heng et al 2009 additionally inaccuracy in simulation of total soil water and etc partition might contribute towards the bias in simulation of yield however katerji et al 2013 attributed the poor performance of the model in simulating yield under water stress to inadequate simulation of cc suggesting reevaluation of canopy expansion coefficients in the model it is noteworthy that even though the crop growth parameters were parameterized based on the field observed data deviations between simulated and measured swc and in turn etc might influence the estimation of yield under water stress as well katerji et al 2013 4 conclusions six years 2005 2010 of data collected through extensive field experiments were used to calibrate and validate aquacrop model in a transition zone between semi arid and sub humid region in south central nebraska crop growth parameters including cc in season biomass development final biomass water use parameters including swc tsw and etc and final grain yields were estimated and compared with the field observed data after careful parameterization of the model although all the experiments were conducted at the same location there were differences in weather conditions such as in season and seasonal total precipitation air temperature and vpd the results of model performance pertaining to cc were acceptable during both 2009 and 2010 with r2 0 85 nrmses in the range of 5 6 to 15 6 and ef in the range of 0 31 to 0 91 with lowest accuracy consistently occurring for the water stressed treatments biomass development was simulated well by the model during both 2009 and 2010 except for the overestimation during senescence stage in 2009 the trend of simulated biomass development during the season can be considered acceptable owing to high r2 0 90 high ef values 84 and high d 0 97 although nrmses were also high ranging from 12 5 to 30 the overestimation of biomass development in the late crop stages resulted in higher end season biomass than the observed values with high percent deviations ranging from 21 6 to 36 3 the final grain yield was simulated fairly well with prediction error in the range of 0 04 to 8 21 except for rainfed treatments where the maximum prediction error was 88 7 in dry year in 2006 etc was predicted with moderate degree of accuracy with prediction error ranging from 0 31 to 16 5 the model performance relative to simulation of tsw was acceptable in 2009 and for rainfed treatments in 2006 and 2010 however when all other years and treatments are considered the model was not able to simulate the tsw or etc accurately it is noteworthy that swc and tsw and etc simulations were satisfactory for rainfed treatments in some years as opposed to what is usually reported in the literature the results of this study and those reported in the literature indicate that the model performance declines in conditions of water stress adjustment of stress thresholds in the model improved the simulations considerably under water stress conditions the appropriate calibration of cgc cdc and crop growth stages has significant effect on simulation of all crop parameters also there is a possibility of variation in water productivity among cultivars therefore modifying this value based on different cultivars and validating for diverse locations could improve model estimates the inaccurate simulation of tsw and etc points towards inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation by the model contributing towards the bias in estimates of tsw and etc which are the major components of soil water balance and water management the evaporation and transpiration estimates of the model need to be tested against field measured variables precise simulations of these variables are essential for prediction of future crop growth water use and water balance variables therefore further evaluation of the model using these datasets is encouraged for future testing of the model and to determine the applicability of model furthermore using default parameters to simulate crop growth and water variables does not provide appropriate results suggesting the necessity of careful calibration of the model for the conditions where its use is intended which presents additional and substantial challenges as calibration requires carefully measured field research data which are rarely available and this can be an impediment for the use of the model if the model is revised and recalibrated considering the aforementioned limitations it can serve as a useful tool for research community acknowledgements this study is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of food and agriculture u s department of agriculture dr

10915,the performance assessments of aquacrop model using long term field measured data are rare in this study the model was evaluated relative to maize growth yield and water use parameters variables under different water stress conditions over six years 2005 2010 in nebraska usa the model was calibrated and validated for full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 50 60 and 75 of fit and rainfed model default parameters provided very poor estimates for mostly all variables after calibration the model adequately simulated daily canopy cover cc for both 2009 and 2010 nrmses 15 6 except for slight discrepancies in 2010 however the model overestimated the final biomass in 2009 due to overestimation of biomass development in the late growth stages the simulation of final biomass was better in 2010 nrmse 5 3 than in 2009 nrmse 31 the model simulated grain yield quite well nrmse of 7 7 and 12 1 ef of 0 8 and 0 7 during both calibration and validation respectively except for rainfed treatments in most years the model was not able to simulate total soil water accurately in most cases except for 2009 growing season the crop evapotranspiration etc was simulated with good accuracy during 2007 2009 and 2010 and the higher prediction error up to 16 5 was observed for dry years 2005 and 2006 and wet year 2008 the model performance declined substantially in conditions of water stress excess water and high evaporative demand in conclusion the aquacrop simulated yield and etc with slight underestimation quite well in some cases but encountered substantial difficulties in simulating biomass and soil water especially during years of low precipitation and high evaporative demand as well as in wet year further evaluation of the model is needed using field measured evaporation and transpiration data to determine the accuracy of etc partition by the model to better simulate soil water and etc which are critical for the estimation of in season irrigation requirements biomass production and yield keywords aquacrop calibration validation canopy cover biomass soil water evapotranspiration limited irrigation maize yield model performance 1 introduction globally agriculture accounts for 70 75 of total freshwater withdrawals food production has increased by more than 100 in the last 30 years and about 60 more food will be needed by year 2050 to meet the food fiber feed and energy demands of the rapidly growing population according to fao projections food production in irrigated land area will need to be increased by more than 50 by 2050 but only a 10 increase in water withdrawal by agriculture will be possible fao 2017 based on current global water supply and demand analyses and projections therefore increase in water and food demand with limited resources especially water necessitates improving the efficiency of water use in crop production which has been and will continue to be a significant challenge for agriculture declining worldwide irrigation water resources and uncertainty in precipitation due to its inter and intra annual variability has increased the risk of failure for crop production under such circumstances deficit or limited irrigation can provide important strategic options for enhancing crop water use efficiency fereres and soriano 2007 crop water use efficiency is defined as the ratio of economic yield of a crop or biomass produced per unit of crop evapotranspiration etc irmak 2015a b crop models that can accurately estimate various crop growth parameters soil water dynamics crop water use and expected yield under different irrigation levels can provide vital assistance to successfully implementing limited and full irrigation management practices in terms of meeting global food demand maize zea mays l plays an important role as a grain crop accounting for nearly 30 of the total global grain production and is used in numerous industrial applications including human food and fiber needs animal feed and energy production it is a major irrigated and rainfed crop globally and in the u s including in midwestern states maize yield is affected by several factors such as planting date type of hybrid planting density weather conditions soil fertility management strategies and soil water availability water stress is one of the most important factors affecting maize yield and it is very sensitive to water stress especially during tasseling silking and grain fill periods resulting in significant yield reduction otegui et al 1995 several studies have reported the impacts of water deficits on maize to vary depending on the development growth stage at which the stress occurs ghooshchi et al 2008 reported that water deficit before silking during silking and during grain fill growth stage decreased yield by 12 5 42 0 and 22 5 respectively irmak 2015a b reported that no significant grain yield difference was observed between full irrigation treatment fit and 75 fit indicating limited irrigation as viable practice for increasing crop water productivity in south central nebraska conditions this is in agreement with findings by stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 field experiments are critically important and effective ways to investigate management options to improve yield under limited water availability and provide understanding of plant soil water atmosphere interactions and their impacts on grain yield and other important plant phenological and physiological responses data and information generated from such field experiments are critical in development calibration and validation of simulation models that are designed to study the behavior of a system these models are considered as a possibility to investigate a wide range of management strategies with reduced efforts and low cost and can provide invaluable information and data for scenarios for which conducting fields experiments may not be even possible various crop models of different complexity have been developed such as crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic cavero et al 2000 ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 wofost boogaard et al 1998 and stics brisson et al 1998 2002 most of these models are quite sophisticated and require substantial input parameters variables and may not always be feasible or amenable for general use the simulation of crop development and growth parameters is based on complex interactions between climate crop and soil parameters and management practices majority of the models require highly detailed input data and information about crop growth that might not be available for most locations moreover the applicability of most of the models is also limited by the unavailability of open access source code however a recently developed fao aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 is a user friendly model that attempts to balance simplicity accuracy and robustness the aquacrop model simulates water limited yield under different management conditions using smaller number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters as compared with other crop models as it has been suggested that most of the parameters are conservative and do not change with location raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2012 the aquacrop has been successfully applied to multiple crops across wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions in addition the open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os is also available that can be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems foster et al 2016 the model performance has been evaluated for several crops including maize soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 potato razzaghi et al 2017 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 hsiao et al 2009 parameterized and tested the model for maize using datasets from 6 years of field experiments at davis ca usa that included varying plant densities planting dates hybrids and atmospheric evaporative demand under different irrigation amounts they discussed the usefulness and limitations of aquacrop model in simulating canopy cover cc biomass water content and water use efficiency a set of conservative parameters were developed for maize in the aforementioned study and they were validated in a later study by heng et al 2009 for locations with diverse environments they reported that model performance was more satisfactory under non water stress and mild stress treatments as compared with severe water stress treatments similar finding was reported by abedinpour et al 2012 indicating that aquacrop model predicted maize yield more accurately for full irrigation and 75 of the field capacity fc treatments as compared with rainfed and 50 of fc treatment when assessing maize response under varying irrigation and nitrogen regimes in a semi arid region they reported that the prediction error in simulation of grain yield and biomass under all treatments ranged from 1 35 to 9 9 and from 0 84 to 17 5 respectively mebane et al 2013 evaluated the model performance in simulating grain yield biomass and soil water content of rainfed maize in pennsylvania u s a and reported accurate simulation of progression of cumulative biomass and grain yield with time with index of agreement d ranging from 0 96 to 0 99 in contrast katerji et al 2013 highlighted the limitations of aquacrop model in simulating the effects of water stress on maize yield biomass and etc they reported that the model overestimated maize yield and biomass and underestimated etc resulting in overestimation of water use efficiency paredes et al 2014 suggested that when appropriate parametrization is adopted aquacrop can simulate maize biomass and yield under deficit conditions adequately aforementioned findings indicate the necessity to appropriately calibrate and validate the model for specific regions to improve the model performance in estimating crop yield water use and crop growth parameters and evaluate limited irrigation strategies to develop effective management strategies considering the limitations and the need for better parameterization of the model referred in the aforementioned literature the current study was conducted to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for maize grown in a transition zone between sub humid and semiarid environment of nebraska there is no or very limited literature available for use of aquacrop in nebraska or greater midwestern corn belt region of the u s a and most of the available studies for maize consider validation using short term field data mostly 2 or 3 growing seasons or less in which the long term inter annual variability in environmental conditions affecting maize response to water and other variables may not be considered therefore to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first long term validation work of aquacrop model for maize in nebraska and midwestern region the specific objective of this study was to calibrate the aquacrop model for estimating maize growth and development including cc response to water soil water content total soil water etc biomass and yield and to validate the model using long term field observed datasets and evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model in estimating the aforementioned variables under full and various levels of limited irrigation and rainfed production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field measured datasets from long term and extensive research conducted and published by irmak 2015a b were used as the primary data source for this study as described in irmak 2015a b the experimental data used in this study were obtained from a long term research project conducted from 2005 to 2010 growing seasons at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska south central nebraska is characterized as being in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid zones with strong winds and high air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit vpd the long term average growing season precipitation at the site is 437 mm but the timing and magnitude of precipitation vary significantly from year to year and within the growing season the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day with a maize rooting depth of 1 50 m total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 300 mm irmak 2015a 2 2 agronomic and field management practices as described in irmak 2015a b the field experiment was designed as a completely randomized block design with three replications of each treatment each replication plot was 1 ha in size and the sampling area for field measurements was eight rows wide with 0 76 m row spacing and 15 2 m long the field was planted with the same hybrids with planting population density of 73 000 plants ha and planting depth of 0 05 m with north south planting direction during all six growing seasons the 16 5 ha field was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system tl irrigation co hastings nebraska usa the christiansen s coefficient of uniformity of the irrigation water application of the system was 95 therefore the net irrigation depths were calculated based on the uniformity coefficient and were used in the model during simulation of final results four irrigation treatments were imposed fully irrigated treatment fit 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit and rainfed control treatment during all years except in 2005 when only fit and rainfed treatments were imposed irrigation for fit was initiated at times when soil water depletion was approximately 40 45 of the total available water irrigation timings for all treatments were determined based on the soil water content of the fit the volumetric soil water content was measured using a troxler model 4300 neutron

content measurements were used in irrigation management and soil water balance calculations the entire field received uniform application of fertilizers and pesticides when needed various soil and plant measurements including leaf area index lai plant height and biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and phenological stage observations and soil water content measurements were done in all seasons brief information of agronomic properties is presented in table 1 additional detailed information on agronomic field management practices are provided in irmak 2015a b 2 3 estimation of crop evapotranspiration seasonal etc was calculated using the following soil water balance equation 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil water flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface r is surface run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws is change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season the surface run off from each treatment was quantified separately using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service curve number method usda nrcs 1985 based on the experimental site s hydrologic soil group land use treatment and other condition the curve number of 75 was used deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 inputs to the program include weather variables of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial soil water at emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters and maximum crop rooting depth 2 4 fao aquacrop model and data input aquacrop model successively simulates the crop development stages and production processes on a daily basis in four steps i crop development ii crop transpiration iii above ground biomass and iv yield the model separates etc into transpiration and evaporation components to avoid the effect of non productive consumptive use of water evaporation by developing a canopy growth and senescence model to estimate transpiration and final biomass which is then translated into yield through harvest index value steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2012 therefore the water driven growth module allows simulation of attainable yields as a function of water consumption under full irrigation deficit limited irrigation and rainfed conditions the model computes crop transpiration tc mm day soil evaporation es mm day and final grain yield y ton ha using the following equations raes et al 2012 2 tc cc kctr x eto 3 es kr 1 cc kex eto 4 y fhi hio b where cc is the actual canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects kctr x is the maximum standard crop

water stress are accounted for through four factors i leaf and canopy growth ii stomatal opening and transpiration iii canopy senescence and iv harvest index the water stress coefficient ks describes the effect of water stress on the above mentioned crop growth processes and is used to compute the actual crop transpiration ta ta ks tc the model describes the canopy development in terms of canopy cover cc curve an accurate simulation of cc is very important given its critical role in modelling transpiration and evaporation there are six parameters that determine the cc curve i initial cc which is a function of plant density and initial cc per seedling ii canopy growth coefficient cgc iii maximum cc ccx iv canopy decline coefficient cdc v days to emergence and vi days to senescence maturity the cc curve can be parameterized using field measured lai values user can compute the cc values from lai data using the equation developed by hsiao et al 2009 and this equation was used in this study for conversion of lai measurements to cc values as 5 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6lai 1 2 the inputs to the aquacrop model include climate crop soil and management files which can be modified specified by the user the model contains a set of default parameters for different soil or crop types that can be used when they are not available through field research for local specific cases climate data required by aquacrop include minimum and maximum air temperature eto and precipitation eto was calculated from the weather data using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on a daily basis the weather data for this study were measured using a bowen ratio energy balance system brebs that was installed in the experimental field as part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network irmak 2010 that operates 11 brebss and eddy covariance system for various vegetation surfaces additional principles and assumptions of the software are described in detail by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 2 5 aquacrop parameters and calibration aquacrop model provides default crop parameters for maize that are non location specific as parameterized by hsiao et al 2009 however the user needs to provide additional cultivar user specific crop parameters and may need to calibrate the model including conservative parameters to obtain accurate results for a given condition in this study the model first run using default maize parameters and the poor results were obtained which indicated the need for calibration of the model therefore the model was calibrated using crop soil water and climate variables parameters as were observed from the field experiment during 2009 growing season the procedures to obtain the calibrated parameters are briefly discussed here the same set of conservative and calibrated parameters were used for all years and no separate calibration was performed for different years comprehensive evaluation of the model with such a wide range of field observed dataset is essential in understanding the behavior of model and the temporal variation introduced by diverse climatic irrigation and crop and soil management conditions in addition to other factors crop development and phenology is affected by the cultivar characteristics and air temperature the model can be run in either growing degree day gdd or calendar day mode and in this study the gdd option was used the parameters determining cc curve were quantified iteratively using trial and error approach until the simulated values were close to the field observed values next the parameters affecting soil water dynamics were calibrated followed by calibration of biomass and yield by adjusting the water productivity and the transpiration crop coefficient kctr x the simulations of final yield were fine tuned by adjustment of harvest index to match the measured yields the calibration procedure was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 crop yield response to water steduto et al 2012 timing of crop phenological stages is crucial for accurate estimation of crop development in this study the initial estimates of the growth stages were based on the field observed values and they were further adjusted slightly to simulate canopy development accurately the reproductive growth period is controlled by the time to flowering and yield formation duration for building up harvest index and duration of flowering the flowering stage was initiated when the crop attained full cc the rooting depth at the site was taken as 1 5 m and the maximum rooting depth was considered to be achieved just before the start of the senescence the default value of 1 05 was used for maximum kctr x the calibrated value of water productivity was 31 7 g m2 which was in the range recommended for the c4 crops the above mentioned crop parameters were calibrated under conditions of no water stress i e fit for conditions of water stressed treatments i e rainfed and limited irrigation treatments stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to obtain close match between simulated and observed values crop response to salinity and fertility stresses was not considered during calibration pertaining to optimum growth conditions as the research site did not have salinity issue 2 6 management irrigation management in aquacrop model is specified through the type of irrigation method used and the timing and amounts of irrigation events that occurred during the growing season for simulations sprinkler irrigation method was selected and irrigation scheduling was specified by inputting the dates and amounts of the irrigation water applied for each irrigation treatment for each growing season the field management file in the model also requires the data about soil fertility crop residue and surface properties for which field observed values were used no mulching practice was considered 2 7 model validation the calibrated parameters were used to simulate grain yield biomass production cc etc and soil water the model was validated by using field observed data from 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons canopy cover and seasonal biomass data were available for 2010 growing season and were utilized to validate the aforementioned variables to assess the goodness of fit of the model both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used the qualitative approach consisted of graphical interpretation of results through basic understanding of plant processes and field observations to evaluate and understand the trends in the data the quantitative approach consisted of using statistical indicators including prediction simulation error or percent deviation pe root mean squared error rmse normalized root mean squared error nrmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef willmott s index of agreement d and coefficient of determination r2 the pe was used to assess deviation between observed and simulated yield relative to the observed values with pe approaching zero indicating better model performance and is calculated as 6 p e s i o i o i 100 where o i is the field measured observed value and s i represent simulated value rmse measures the magnitude of difference between simulated and observed values and ranges from 0 to positive infinity with 0 indicating good and infinity indicating poor model performance jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 7 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 8 n r m s e r m s e o x 100 where o is the mean of measured values the validation is considered excellent if nrmse is 10 good if it is between 10 and 20 acceptable if it is between 20 and 30 and poor for values 30 jamieson et al 1991 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance as compared with the variance of observations indicating how well the observed vs simulated data fit the 1 1 line nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 ef ranges from minus infinity to 1 where 1 indicates perfect match between the model estimates and the observations the ef and d values are calculated by the following equations 9 e f 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 d 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 the value of d ranges from 0 to 1 and the model performance improves as d approaches 1 the r2 and ef were used to quantify the predictive power of the model while rmse indicates the error in the model prediction in addition the actual difference in the values of variables between calibrated and simulated values are also provided for evaluation of model results also two sample student s t test was conducted for alpha value of 0 05 after testing the data for homogeneity of variance using a fisher s f test to estimate if there were significant differences between model simulated and field observed data for final aboveground biomass etc and yield table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions daily seasonal precipitation and irrigation amounts in the fit treatments for each growing season are presented in fig 1 the cumulative growing season precipitation was 306 388 588 692 487 and 566 mm in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively the seasonal precipitation varied not only in total amounts between six seasons but also within each growing season the timing of precipitation plays an important role in crop development as some crop stages are more water stress sensitive than others and can have a considerable effect on crop yield quantity and quality the 2007 and 2008 seasons were the wettest years receiving lower irrigation amounts of 132 and 51 mm respectively while 2005 and 2006 were the driest years fig 1 with highest irrigation water applications 280 mm in 2005 and 241 mm in 2006 in the fit treatments in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons the irrigation amounts applied to fit treatments were 178 and 127 mm respectively most of these irrigation events occurred in june july and august and coincided with the most water stress sensitive stages and highest atmospheric demand vpd periods the maximum monthly average vpd occurred in july 2005 followed by june 2006 2007 and 2008 and august 2009 and 2010 irmak 2015a 3 2 canopy cover appropriate parameterization of cc curve is critical for the model to provide accurate estimates of soil evaporation crop transpiration biomass and yield first the cc was simulated using default values provided in the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 resulting in poor model performance as indicated by high estimation errors rmse 18 9 and very low negative ef values for both 2009 and 2010 this indicates the need for calibration of the default cc curve relative to the site specific crop soil climate and management conditions thus the model was calibrated using experimental data from 2009 and validated using the data from 2010 to determine foliage development and simulate the cc curve the calibrated and validated cc values under different irrigation and rainfed treatments for both years are presented in figs 2 and 3 the statistical parameters indicating the model performance relative to cc curves using both default and calibrated parameters are presented in table 3 the progression of cc was similar in all treatments in both years and the calibrated model closely simulated this seasonal trend in general the calibration results showed good agreement between simulated and observed data for the cc development in all treatments with high r2 values 0 86 high ef 0 83 low estimation errors rmse ranging from only 4 8 to 6 2 and high d values 0 96 low rmse values indicate the robustness of model in simulating cc under all treatments after calibration the lowest accuracy in determination of cc in 2009 was observed for 50 fit followed by 60 fit in these treatments the decline in cc from 119 days after planting dap to 140 dap was higher than the simulated values the effect of water stress in field observed data became evident after 113 dap in water stressed treatments 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed indicating faster decline in cc however the model predicted a slightly higher cc in the crop senescence stage for 50 fit and 60 fit in this aspect the starting time of canopy senescence is considered to be critical according to steduto et al 2012 canopy senescence should be started at the time when leaf senescence yellowing becomes significant and lai is no more than 3 to 4 in this study the visual observations indicated that all the leaves were green and senescence did not start until at least 135 dap in fit therefore for significant yellowing of leaves the visual and calibrated value for start of canopy senescence was considered to be 140 dap however water stress is considered to induce early senescence in plants which could be the reason for more declines in field observed cc in 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed treatments this water stress induced early senescence was captured more effectively by the model in the rainfed treatment in general the simulation of cc can be considered to be good and acceptable during calibration during validation the model was able to accurately simulate the trend of cc development although cc was underestimated during the early development stages leading to a slower establishment of the crop in all treatments fig 3 however the cc simulation can still be considered acceptable due to higher variation large values of standard deviation observed in the field measured cc during crop establishment stage the highest error in simulation of cc was observed in rainfed treatment where it was highly underestimated during the late crop development stage for the rainfed treatment p 0 05 indicating that the model tends to calculate the inhibiting effect of water stress higher than that observed in the field irrigation treatments especially fit were simulated more accurately by the model with r2 of 0 96 rmse 8 4 nrmse 9 7 d 0 95 and ef in the range of 0 73 to 0 74 as compared with the rainfed treatment r2 0 85 rmse 13 4 nrmse 15 6 d 0 89 and low ef of 0 31 the results of cc in this study are in agreement with those reported by heng et al 2009 for irrigated and water deficit maize at three locations in texas florida and spain with diverse environmental conditions they obtained rmses and ef values in the range of 5 1 34 5 and 2 0 and 0 98 respectively and reported slight mismatch in the last senesced cc with faster decline for texas site and slower decline for florida site as compared with observed cc similarly paredes et al 2014 reported overall r2 rmse and ef of 0 97 6 6 and 0 96 respectively for alpiarca site and 0 92 5 1 and 0 91 respectively for sorraia valley coruche site in central portugal and concluding good predictions of cc by the model hsiao et al 2009 pointed out the models limitation in simulating the accelerated senescence of the canopy due to water stress they reported rmses in the range of 4 8 13 6 and d 95 considering both water stressed and non stressed treatments in davis california greaves and wang 2016 assessed aquacrop model for a tropical environment in taiwan and reported that the model predicted slower crop development and underestimated cc during early vegetative stages in all treatments and model performance declined when water stress was induced resulting in r2 rmse d and ef in the range of 0 92 to 0 98 6 4 16 0 0 92 to 0 99 and 0 60 to 0 94 respectively katerji et al 2013 also showed that the aquacrop simulated cc more accurately in non stressed conditions than in water stressed environments contrarily abedinpour et al 2012 reported better simulations of cc as compared with observed data with r2 rmse and ef in the range of 0 89 to 0 98 0 66 to 0 89 and 0 81 to 0 95 respectively for a semi arid environment in new delhi india these results indicate that the model tends to simulate the mid season cc well in most cases while it tends to underestimate or overestimate cc during development and senescence stage and vice versa 3 3 soil water for a water driven model such as aquacrop it is important to evaluate its effectiveness in simulating swc and hence total soil water tsw in the crop root zone as compared with the measured data the field measured tsw that was calculated from the observed swc using neutron probe measurements were compared with simulated values for all measurement days fig 4 during calibration 2009 the model simulated the tsw with good accuracy including in the rainfall treatment except for slight underestimation in 60 fit treatment this could be due to simulation of higher cc in 60 fit as discussed earlier resulting in more water uptake by the plant and thus reduced the swc in the soil profile with higher amount than those observed in the field in other years except for only a few cases the model was not able to simulate the tsw accurately even though the simulated tsw followed the trend of observed tsw values in a number of treatments the simulations were first initiated by using default model parameters which resulted in poor estimates of tsw data not presented the estimates improved when calibrated parameters were used but they were still unsatisfactory except in 2009 and in some cases in other years as shown by statistical indicators table 4 the simulated tsw was close to the observed values during calibration 2009 for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 88 to 0 96 rmses varying from 14 2 to 24 7 mm nrmse in range of 3 to 5 2 d varying from 0 91 to 0 97 and ef ranging from 0 61 to 0 87 the model performed very well in simulating tsw for rainfed treatments in 2009 and 2010 growing seasons however the validation results indicated poor performance of model in simulating tsw for most of the treatments 0 00 r2 0 88 18 4 rmse 109 4 mm 21 9 ef 0 84 there was no consistent trend of underestimation or overestimation of tsw simulations in dry 2005 and 2006 growing seasons with seasonal precipitation of only 306 and 388 mm respectively the model overestimated the tsw in all treatments that was more pronounced in 2005 growing season indicating that model performance declined substantially in conditions of water stress and high evaporative demand however in 2008 with highest seasonal precipitation of 692 mm the simulated tsw was highly underestimated as mentioned earlier the model performance is substantially affected under conditions of very low and high extreme evaporative demands conditions the best results of model estimated and field observed tsw were obtained for 2009 growing season where simulated tsw closely matched the observed values for fit limited irrigation as well as for rainfed treatment and also for rainfed treatments in 2006 and 2010 growing seasons there are evidences in the literature towards the poor performance in simulating tsw or swc by the aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 reported that the simulated tsw declined less with time as compared with observed data resulting in overestimation of tsw by as much 80 mm they also mentioned that some bias could be introduced by the random errors in the measurements such as neutron probe readings are taken few days after the irrigation that may miss the peaks of swc nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 observed that the simulated tsw was overestimated by the model with rmse values of 11 5 and 17 2 mm and very low ef values of 0 78 and 0 04 in another study paredes et al 2014 reported that aquacrop could not simulate swc accurately 0 59 r2 0 88 8 4 rmse 11 7 vol 0 03 ef 0 72 despite careful parameterization and cannot be used for irrigation scheduling purposes they observed a trend of overestimation of swc and concluded that inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation by the model contributed towards the bias in estimates of swc they suggested that the simulation of tsw can improve if the model used classical crop coefficient curve to adjust basal crop coefficient for transpiration instead of the cc curve concluding that the kctr x and cc curve proportionality should be revised as the cc curve is not impacted by the daily changes in water content and is only impacted by water stress during the vegetative stage this might be valid in this current study as well because the amount of water stress impacted swc and tsw estimations by the model contrarily despite slight overestimations ahmadi et al 2015 obtained good estimates of swc it is usually considered that most water uptake by roots take place from top soil surface i e 0 0 30 m and assumed to decrease gradually with depth which makes it necessary to accurately simulate swc in this zone for proper understanding of root density and soil water extraction patterns for the silt loam soil at the same location of this study djaman and irmak 2012 reported that under water stress conditions greater soil water extraction can occur in deeper soil layers they also found that in general the soil water extraction decreased with soil depth and the water extraction from the top soil 0 0 30 m accounted for the largest portion of the seasonal total water extraction as 39 42 48 48 and 51 of the seasonal total extraction under rainfed 50 fit 60 fit 75 fit and fit respectively the rainfed treatment extracted more water from the 0 60 0 90 m and 0 90 1 2 m soil layers 19 and 17 of the total respectively than all other treatments in general the deepest soil layer 1 5 1 8 m contributed 5 to 8 to the seasonal total water extraction mebane et al 2013 reported that largest error in simulation of swc occurred in the top 0 50 and 0 80 m soil layers followed by 0 20 m concluding that greater concentration of roots in these layers influenced the simulation errors they also reported underestimation of swc for rainfed maize especially in dry years there is also a possibility of inaccurate simulation of run off and drainage by the model which requires careful calibration of soil and field surface properties such as curve number readily evaporable water etc thus it is suggested that if the model is revised relative to the above mentioned parameters its performance to simulate soil water dynamics especially under water stressed conditions and for non water stressed conditions may be improved considerably 3 4 evapotranspiration the comparison of observed irmak 2015a b and simulated seasonal total etc values for all 6 years are presented in fig 5 and tabulated in tables 5 and 6 the etc values predicted by the model using default parameters for all years are also presented in the tables the model performed unsatisfactorily when simulations were conducted using default parameters as indicated by low r2 of 0 19 high rmse of 62 6 mm nrmse of 10 4 and ef of 0 10 table 6 also when using default parameters the model was not able to differentiate etc among different irrigation treatments except for the rainfed treatment as the model simulated similar default etc values in almost all years for different treatments therefore using the default parameters for maize in the aquacrop model for the site that has similar characteristics to those presented in this study is not recommended when careful parameterization was conducted etc values simulated by the model during calibration 2009 improved with percent difference ranging from 0 3 1 6 mm to 4 6 29 3 mm with the highest difference observed for the fit the model performance for 2009 was good r2 of 0 97 low rmse of 19 mm and average ef value of 0 80 table 6 fig 5a the underestimation of etc could be linked to slight underestimation of tsw in 2009 as well as overestimation of cc in the canopy senescence stage besides the field measured etc was calculated using soil water balance approach which can sometimes introduce some level of errors in et calculations unless evaporation and transpiration is measured directly in the field which in most cases is not feasible in the field experiments these results are comparatively better than those reported by araya et al 2017 as they predicted percent difference in etc values ranging from 7 to 20 difference in the range of 45 to 148 mm with r2 of 0 42 indicating a weak correlation they attributed this weak correlation to incomplete inputs in soil physical properties limited lai measurements and variation in planting density across irrigation treatments during the validation a trend of underestimation of etc by the model was observed except for the rainfed treatments in some of the years fig 5b however in general the best etc predictions were obtained for 2010 with simulated and observed etc difference in the range of only 2 0 to 6 9 mm except for the rainfed treatment where difference was 23 5 mm the rmses in simulation of etc for 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons were calculated as 73 31 64 and 11 mm respectively indicating highest and lowest rmse values for 2006 and 2010 respectively the overall validation results of aquacrop model for pooled data from all years indicated fair performance in etc estimations with r2 of 0 6 rmse of 52 9 mm nrmse of 8 7 mm ef value of 0 4 and percent difference in the range of 0 3 to 16 5 table 6 the best results of etc were obtained for 2010 growing season the total growing season rainfall in 2010 563 mm was greater than in 2009 426 mm and was more uniformly distributed in 2010 resulting in lesser irrigation demands 127 mm for fit as compared with 2009 177 8 mm for fit also higher wind speeds and solar radiation in 2010 may have resulted in higher evaporation from the soil surface higher biomass and yield in rainfed treatment reducing the effects of water stress this might be one of the reasons for better simulation of etc in 2010 as compared with 2009 by the model as the model performance improved in conditions of optimum water availability this is also evident from the results of etc estimated by the model in 2005 and 2006 in which highest bias was observed and these two years were the driest years resulting in higher water stress the availability of evaporation and transpiration data measured in field can shed light on the model simulation pattern of these variables contrary to the results obtained in this study paredes et al 2014 reported better accuracy of the aquacrop model in predicting seasonal etc with overall r2 of 0 81 rmse of 5 7 mm and ef value of 0 81 with no trend of over or underestimation however they highlighted the tendency of model to overestimate transpiration and underestimate evaporation component that moderated the errors in etc estimates which results in moderate accuracy in etc estimates and with unreliable values katerji et al 2013 reported that the quality of etc simulation by the model was poor similar to the etc values in this study they also reported that the model underestimated etc with a high percent difference between simulated and observed values of up to 36 they noticed that the model overestimated the effect of drought on daily etc and underestimated etc right after the irrigation events they also confirmed the finding of paredes et al 2014 that aquacrop tends to underestimate the seasonal etc in assessing the model under deficit irrigation for tropical environment greaves and wang 2016 further confirmed the tendency of model to underestimate etc with deviations ranging from 6 5 to 22 2 which increased as plant water stress intensified similar results of higher deviation of simulated etc in dry years in 2005 and 2006 were observed in this study table 5 heng et al 2009 reported that aquacrop was able to simulate etc for very high etc and windy conditions of bushland texas with moderate degree of accuracy with difference in simulated and observed values in the range of 9 to 74 mm however up to 74 mm of water can be a significant portion of seasonal total etc in water limiting semi arid environments such as bushland indicating the model s poor performance in dry hot and advective environments maize was irrigated using center pivot irrigation system in this study which should result in higher evaporation in more irrigated treatments as compared with limited irrigation treatments and the effect of reduced cc might be small in reduction of etc however simulations in this study indicated that the aquacrop model tends to calculate highest evaporation under rainfed treatment that declines with further increase in irrigation amounts this is evident from the higher simulated etc values as compared with the observed etc in some years table 5 this can be attributed to the fact that the model simulation of water stress is tied strongly to cc curve which in some cases may not be affected by daily changes in swc through kctr x and this proportionality between the two variables leads to inaccurate simulation of etc moreover the inaccuracy in simulation of etc is strongly linked to simulation of swc that was also not simulated with sufficient accuracy by the model in most cases the availability of partitioned etc into evaporation and transpiration can provide further insights into the model prediction behavior of etc ran et al 2017 3 5 in season biomass production when using default model parameters table 7 high nrmse 14 5 to 34 9 values indicated the bias in simulated aboveground biomass values as compared with field measured values thereby indicating the need for calibration the model simulated and observed aboveground biomass using calibrated parameters for all treatments for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons is presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively and the overall trend for all treatments is presented in fig 8 the standard deviation for field measured biomass for the 2009 growing season was in the range of 0 09 to 0 57 ton ha for fit 0 07 to 0 39 ton ha for 75 fit 0 12 to 0 30 ton ha for 60 fit 0 05 to 0 35 ton ha for 50 fit and 0 07 to 0 40 ton ha for rainfed treatment similarly in 2010 the standard deviation ranged from 0 18 to 0 38 ton ha for fit 0 18 to 0 43 ton ha for 75 fit 0 34 to 0 55 ton ha for 60 fit 0 32 to 0 46 ton ha for 50 fit and 0 10 to 0 34 ton ha for rainfed treatment biomass simulations resulted in improved accuracy in 2009 with rmse in the range of 1 3 to 2 8 ton ha nrmse in range of 12 5 to 26 2 higher ef 0 84 to 0 96 d 0 97 to 0 99 and r2 0 90 under all treatments however the model simulated in season biomass development did not improve in 2010 as indicated by high values of nrmse 18 2 to 30 and rmse 2 1 to 2 5 ton ha these rmses are in the range 0 58 to 6 18 ton ha of those reported by hsiao et al 2009 for seasonal progression of biomass under all treatments and nyakudyaa and stroosnijder 2014 who reported high rmse of 2 0 ton ha for rainfed maize in semi arid conditions on the other hand lower rmses in the range of 0 11 to 1 42 ton ha were reported by abedinpour et al 2012 under variable irrigation and nitrogen levels the model predictions of biomass development during 2009 were close to the observed values except during the late growth stages when the model overestimated the significant differences p 0 05 between simulated and observed values became apparent after 113 dap around r4 dough stage and this trend is evident in all treatments similarly katerji et al 2013 also reported that the aquacrop overestimated the biomass development during the second half of the maize growth stage in control treatments the overestimation of biomass after 113 dap resulted from a slight overestimation of cc at that stage fig 2 which is more pronounced in limited irrigation treatments 60 fit and 50 fit as discussed in section 3 2 the measured data indicate that the biomass development slows down after 135 dap near senescence stage in fit and may become constant in water stressed treatments however the model highly overestimated the biomass after 114 dap and indicated that biomass increased constantly until maturity which was not the case in the field measured data geerts et al 2009 reported that soil water depletion thresholds of canopy expansion and senescence maximum cc swc and cgc were the major parameters affecting canopy growth and biomass simulations lower cgc of 13 7 day obtained in this study as compared to the reference cgc of 16 3 day which contributes to a slower canopy development heng et al 2009 confirmed that aquacrop is insensitive in terms of biomass production due to some inaccuracy in simulating canopy senescence phase during validation 2010 growing season the biomass development was overestimated during most of the crop growth and development cycle in all treatments fig 7 the overestimation of biomass increased with increase in water stress as indicated by increased nrmse in the range of 24 4 30 for water stressed limited irrigation and rainfed treatments as compared with fit nrmse 18 2 overall the trend of biomass development was captured well by the model however the range of simulation errors was high 18 these results are consistent with findings of heng et al 2009 that aquacrop overestimated maize biomass under water stress conditions ahmadi et al 2015 reported that aquacrop has tendency to overestimate biomass during early maize growth stages nevertheless there is no consistency in the literature to conclude whether aquacrop consistently overestimates or underestimates maize biomass overall the model predicted the progression of aboveground biomass with high ef 0 90 and rmses of 2 25 and 2 40 ton ha in the calibration year 2009 and validation year 2010 respectively with high r2 of 0 95 discrepancies in simulation of biomass may not only be related to simulation of cc by the model but also to the calculation of transpiration although the kctr x during simulation was taken as 1 05 and was not increased the biomass simulation was still high one of the reasons could be inaccuracy in simulation of transpiration by the model due to more dependency of kctr x on cc curve paredes et al 2014 reported that in aquacrop model the impacts of water stress on transpiration are minimized due to this dependency of transpiration on cc curve this might have caused errors in simulating the late season biomass as the cc curve is more affected by water stress during vegetative stages in the aquacrop model moreover to test if the biomass simulations improve when days to senescence are reduced the model estimated biomass was evaluated for reduced days for senescence however even the model estimated biomass in that case was reduced it was still too high and hence other factors caused this over simulation it is possible that the model calculated lesser evaporation and higher transpiration but again field measured data on transpiration and evaporation are required to evaluate these relationships 3 6 final biomass production and grain yield final biomass measurements were available for 2009 and 2010 growing seasons therefore the model was calibrated for 2009 and validated for 2010 for biomass the yield data were available for each treatment and replication for all growing seasons therefore the model was calibrated for 2009 and validated for 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 datasets for yield the performance of aquacrop in simulating the final biomass is presented in fig 9 and the statistical indicators for model accuracy are given in table 8 final biomass was first simulated using model s default parameters which resulted in poor performance with high rmse 4 5 ton ha and negative model ef value 4 1 without calibration therefore calibrated parameters were used to predict biomass however the model performance did not improve for 2009 growing season as simulated values were significantly different p 0 05 than the measured values with high rmse of 6 8 ton ha nrmse of 31 and negative ef of 4 1 actual values of simulated and observed biomass are given in table 8 which showed overestimation of biomass in all treatments in 2009 which is due to overestimation of cc during late growth stage and seasonal biomass development contrarily the biomass prediction was improved for 2010 growing season with smaller rmse of 1 4 ton ha nrmse of 5 3 fair ef of 0 40 and high d value of 0 99 indicating no trend of over or under estimation table 6 fig 9 paredes et al 2014 reported similar rmse of 3 49 ton ha but high ef of 0 81 for final biomass of full and deficit irrigation treatments differences in the final biomass between the observed and simulated values during 2009 indicate overestimation of 4 4 8 0 ton ha and percent deviation of 21 6 36 3 which is considered to be quite high in 2010 these differences were reduced to 0 4 1 8 ton ha and model performance improved pe 7 3 highest accuracy in simulation of final biomass was obtained in fit in 2009 and 75 fit in 2010 and lowest was obtained for 60 fit in 2009 and rainfed treatment in 2010 contrary to the results of this study abedinpour et al 2012 reported that aquacrop was able to predict biomass with good accuracy 0 42 rmse 0 75 ton ha ef 0 95 the comparison of final biomass between 2009 and 2010 growing seasons shows that all treatments had percent difference less than 7 3 in 2010 as compared with higher percent difference of up to 36 3 in 2009 the reason for lower percent difference in 2010 might be due to abundant rainfall during this growing season and hence the crop experienced less water stress higher biomass simulation towards the late growth stages is the major reason for overestimation of final aboveground biomass in 2009 which might be due to higher transpiration calculated by the model as explained in the previous sections the grain yield simulated by the model is presented in table 9 and the statistical indicators for model accuracy are given in table 6 the model predicted grain yield unsatisfactorily rmse 2 6 ton ha nrmse 19 5 ef 0 20 and d 0 97 when default parameters were used table 6 yield simulations improved for all treatments when using calibrated parameters as indicated by lower rmses of 1 1 and 1 6 ton ha and higher ef values of 0 8 and 0 7 for calibration and validation respectively table 6 but the improvement is still considered to be minimal with high errors e g up to 1 6 ton ha error during calibration yield estimates were close to the observed values for all treatments with differences of 0 5 ton ha except for the rainfed treatment that exhibited high deviation 25 4 from the field observed yield fig 10 likewise during validation highest differences between simulated and observed yields were observed in rainfed treatments during 2005 11 2 2006 88 7 2007 40 5 and 2008 10 6 that were highly overestimated by model and are considered to be unacceptable table 9 this was attributed to the fact that the model performance declined in conditions of high water stress especially during 2005 and 2006 growing seasons that were very hot and dry with high vpd resulting in high deviations from the observed values nevertheless while unsatisfactory after calibration the rmses obtained in this study for simulated biomass and grain yield under all treatments are within the range of those reported in the literature for instance the values reported for rmses were 3 5 and 1 73 ton ha under full and deficit irrigation trials for a mediterranean regions in portugal paredes et al 2014 1 77 and 2 21 ton ha for a semi arid climate in iran ahmadi et al 2015 1 53 and 1 03 ton ha under rainfed conditions in pennsylvania mebane et al 2013 and 0 86 2 9 and 0 65 1 57 ton ha under full and deficit irrigation in california usa heng et al 2009 for biomass and grain yield respectively the inaccuracy in yield simulation by aquacrop under severe water stress conditions points towards models less adequate procedure s algorithm s for simulation of both the magnitude and timing and duration of water stress especially during the senescence stage heng et al 2009 additionally inaccuracy in simulation of total soil water and etc partition might contribute towards the bias in simulation of yield however katerji et al 2013 attributed the poor performance of the model in simulating yield under water stress to inadequate simulation of cc suggesting reevaluation of canopy expansion coefficients in the model it is noteworthy that even though the crop growth parameters were parameterized based on the field observed data deviations between simulated and measured swc and in turn etc might influence the estimation of yield under water stress as well katerji et al 2013 4 conclusions six years 2005 2010 of data collected through extensive field experiments were used to calibrate and validate aquacrop model in a transition zone between semi arid and sub humid region in south central nebraska crop growth parameters including cc in season biomass development final biomass water use parameters including swc tsw and etc and final grain yields were estimated and compared with the field observed data after careful parameterization of the model although all the experiments were conducted at the same location there were differences in weather conditions such as in season and seasonal total precipitation air temperature and vpd the results of model performance pertaining to cc were acceptable during both 2009 and 2010 with r2 0 85 nrmses in the range of 5 6 to 15 6 and ef in the range of 0 31 to 0 91 with lowest accuracy consistently occurring for the water stressed treatments biomass development was simulated well by the model during both 2009 and 2010 except for the overestimation during senescence stage in 2009 the trend of simulated biomass development during the season can be considered acceptable owing to high r2 0 90 high ef values 84 and high d 0 97 although nrmses were also high ranging from 12 5 to 30 the overestimation of biomass development in the late crop stages resulted in higher end season biomass than the observed values with high percent deviations ranging from 21 6 to 36 3 the final grain yield was simulated fairly well with prediction error in the range of 0 04 to 8 21 except for rainfed treatments where the maximum prediction error was 88 7 in dry year in 2006 etc was predicted with moderate degree of accuracy with prediction error ranging from 0 31 to 16 5 the model performance relative to simulation of tsw was acceptable in 2009 and for rainfed treatments in 2006 and 2010 however when all other years and treatments are considered the model was not able to simulate the tsw or etc accurately it is noteworthy that swc and tsw and etc simulations were satisfactory for rainfed treatments in some years as opposed to what is usually reported in the literature the results of this study and those reported in the literature indicate that the model performance declines in conditions of water stress adjustment of stress thresholds in the model improved the simulations considerably under water stress conditions the appropriate calibration of cgc cdc and crop growth stages has significant effect on simulation of all crop parameters also there is a possibility of variation in water productivity among cultivars therefore modifying this value based on different cultivars and validating for diverse locations could improve model estimates the inaccurate simulation of tsw and etc points towards inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation by the model contributing towards the bias in estimates of tsw and etc which are the major components of soil water balance and water management the evaporation and transpiration estimates of the model need to be tested against field measured variables precise simulations of these variables are essential for prediction of future crop growth water use and water balance variables therefore further evaluation of the model using these datasets is encouraged for future testing of the model and to determine the applicability of model furthermore using default parameters to simulate crop growth and water variables does not provide appropriate results suggesting the necessity of careful calibration of the model for the conditions where its use is intended which presents additional and substantial challenges as calibration requires carefully measured field research data which are rarely available and this can be an impediment for the use of the model if the model is revised and recalibrated considering the aforementioned limitations it can serve as a useful tool for research community acknowledgements this study is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of food and agriculture u s department of agriculture dr

10916,sand media filters are those that achieve a higher retention of organic and inorganic solids which is why they are usually recommended when reclaimed effluents are used in drip irrigation systems sand filters usually differ on the design of their underdrain where an important pressure drop is produced however the effect of the design of sand filter underdrain on emitter clogging has not been widely studied three sand media filters with different underdrain designs collector arms inserted domes and drainage with porous media were used for filtering a reclaimed effluent in a surface drip irrigation system pressure compensating emitters with 2 3 l h nominal emitter discharge were placed every 40 cm in 4 irrigation laterals each measuring 90 m in length effluents were chlorinated after being filtered the filters operated for 1000 h with sand media heights of 20 and 30 cm and filtration velocities of 30 and 60 m h at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment the emitter discharge of each one of the 2712 emitters that were installed was experimentally measured under field conditions on average there was a statistically significant reduction p 0 05 on emitter discharge regarding the initial value of 8 03 at 500 h and 10 84 at 1000 h emitter clogging was primarily affected by the interactions between underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time differences on emitter discharge due to underdrain design were only observed at 1000 h showing a significantly higher flow rate p 0 05 those emitters protected with the filter with a collector arm underdrain despite the fact that this filter did not achieve the highest turbidity removals emitter location had also a significant effect after 500 h of operation being discharge significantly lower p 0 05 only in the last 2 m of the laterals with the minimum values found for the final two drippers the three filters used in the experiment did not show a significant effect on the percentage of completely clogged emitters which mainly depended on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location keywords wastewater microirrigation media filter filtration plugging 1 introduction the use of reclaimed wastewater in agriculture has become a viable stable and economic alternative to confront the issue of water scarcity on our planet asano et al 2007 because municipal and industrial wastewater may be used for irrigating a large variety of crops hamilton et al 2007 thus releasing water of higher quality for other uses lazarova and asano 2005 the best irrigation technique for using wastewater from the public health and environmental points of view is drip irrigation bucks et al 1979 world health organization 2006 however the main problem using drip irrigation with reclaimed effluents is emitter clogging bucks et al 1979 ravina et al 1992 emitter clogging depends on factors such as wastewater characteristics emitter type system operation maintenance and filtration capra and scicolone 2007 duran ros et al 2009 as clogging is related to the quality of water used bucks et al 1979 derived a hazard rating depending on the values of different physical chemical and biological quality parameters according to bucks et al 1979 an irrigation water with suspended solids below 50 mg l a ph below 7 and bacterial number smaller than 10 000 cfu ml should pose a minor clogging hazard however capra and scicolone 1998 suggest higher clogging hazard thresholds when emitters with higher discharge rates are used pressure compensating emitters puig bargués et al 2010a pei et al 2015 integrated emitters pei et al 2014 and high discharge emitters ravina et al 1992 trooien et al 2000 are more resistant to clogging some authors analyzed flow and particle movements within emitter components aiming to suggest designs that could prevent clogging development wei et al 2008 al muhammad et al 2016 feng et al 2018b clogging could also be reduced with lower irrigation frequencies zhou et al 2015 and lateral flushing puig bargués et al 2010a 2010b tripathi et al 2014 feng et al 2017 several authors have studied how biofilm and chemical precipitation which are the most common clogging causes when reclaimed effluents are reused affect emitter performance gamri et al 2014 green et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 chlorination has also resulted in being effective in reducing emitter clogging and it has been widely used to prevent biological clogging hills and brenes 2001 dehghanisanij et al 2005 cararo et al 2006 as the strong oxidation of chlorine inhibits the reproduction and growth of microorganisms and the formation of biofilms li et al 2010 as well as if combined with acidification the precipitation of solid particles

organic compounds phosphorus and microorganisms dalahmeh et al 2012 and consequently prevent emitter clogging capra and scicolone 2007 in sand media filters the pressure loss is mainly located at filtration media and auxiliary elements such as the underdrain arbat et al 2013 several authors have studied the influence of underdrain designs on pressure loss mesquita et al 2012 bové et al 2015 pujol et al 2016 but none of them have analyzed how filter design affects emitter clogging on the other hand sand filters have to be periodically backwashed for releasing those particles retained in the media which increase pressure loss across filtration time backwashing is an important procedure for an effective filter performance nakayama et al 2007 but the media cleaning pattern depends on the underdrain design burt 2010 usually filter backwashing is carried out at pre set pressure loss nevertheless daily backwashing has been also verified to be a good practice for assuring good emitter performance enciso medina et al 2011 even though filter and backwashing operations in drip irrigation systems have been studied elbana et al 2012 there are few studies which try to improve the design and performance of sand media filters with this in mind bové et al 2017 designed a new underdrain aiming to reduce pressure loss across sand filters for improving both water and energy use efficiency the main objective of this study was to analyse the effect of three sand filters with different underdrain designs the prototype designed by bové et al 2017 and two commercial ones on emitter clogging when a reclaimed effluent is used 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup reclaimed effluent from the celrà girona spain wastewater treatment plant wwtp which treats urban and industrial effluents using a sludge process was used in the experiment the experimental irrigation system consisted of three sand filters with three underdrain different designs fig 1 a sand filter model fa1m lama sevilla spain a sand filter model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain and an experimental sand filter built with an underdrain designed by bové et al 2017 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the different sand filters used the underdrain of the filter model fa1m lama sevilla spain consisted of 7 parts with slots which overlapped each other forming striated tubes converging in a central tube which worked as a manifold this contained a total of 10 striated tubes with 5 tubes on each side of the manifold in model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain the underdrain consisted of 12 inserted domes on a back plate these domes were pyramidally shaped with vertical slots mounted on a manifold finally the underdrain designed by bové et al 2017 consisted of a cylinder that occupied the entire surface of filtration of the filter this cylinder was confined by two 0 75 mm meshes one at the top and one at the bottom and was filled with silica sand sieved to 0 63 0 75 mm grain size with an equivalent diameter of 0 71 mm bulk density of 1 478 kg m3 real density of 2 573 kg m3 and a porosity of 42 2 bové et al 2017 all the filters were filled with silica sand ca 07ms sibelco minerales sa bilbao spain with an effective diameter de size opening which will pass 10 by dry weight of a representative sample of the filter material of 0 48 mm and a coefficient of uniformity ratio of the size opening which will pass 60 of the sand through the size opening which will pass 10 through of 1 73 each filter had an irrigation subunit associated which consisted of four laterals each with a total length of 90 m fig 2 each lateral had 226 emitters so for each emitter location there were 4 replications per subunit however for location 226 only there were 3 emitters per subunit commercial integrated and pressure compensating emitters uniram as 16010 netafim tel aviv israel with 2 3 l h of nominal flow discharge a distance between emitters of 0 4 m a nominal working pressure of 50 400 kpa and a manufacturing coefficient of variation of 0 03 were used this emitter was selected since its design improves clogging resistance and its pressure compensation allows to use it in a wide range of topographical conditions the reclaimed effluent was pumped from the wwtp to the filters using a multicellular centrifugal pump model cr 15 4 grundfos bjerringbro denmark governed by a frequency variator model frn 4 fuji electric cerdanyola del vallès spain the inlet flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter isomag ms2500 isoil industria spa cinisello balsamo italy with a pulse transmitter the experimental setup allowed that only one filter was operating at a time after being filtered the reclaimed effluent was carried to the drip irrigation subunits since the filtrated flow was higher than which was needed for the irrigation subunits a proportional electrohydraulic actuator skd32 siemens munich germany operated a three way valve vxg41 siemens munich germany so that the excess flow was brought to a water storage tank of 3000 l aquablock shütz selters germany that was used for filter backwashing a chlorine deposit of 200 l was installed to continuously inject chlorine for achieving a concentration of 2 ppm in the water after being filtered using a dostec ac1 2 membrane pump itc sta perpètua demogoda spain when sand filters were backwashed backwashing water entering the filters was chlorinated to reach a 4 ppm chlorine concentration several effluent quality parameters before and after being filtered were measured and recorded every minute in a supervisory control and data acquisition system scada previously developed duran ros et al 2008 the parameters measured before filtration were the electrical conductivity using a transmitter liquisys m clm253 cd0010 and a sensor cls21 c1e4a the ph and the temperature using a transmitter liquisys m cpm253 mr0010 and a sensor cps11d 7ba21 the parameters measured before and after filtration were turbidity using a transmitter liquisys m cum253 tu0005 with and a sensor cus31 a2e and dissolved oxygen with a transmitter liquisys m com253 wx0015 and a sensor cos 61 a1f0 all the transmitters and sensors used were manufactured by endress hauser gerlingen germany the filters were washed automatically when the total pressure drop across them measured by pressure transducers reached 50 kpa ravina et al 1992 the backwashing time was 3 min throughout the entire test and during that time backwashing water did not reach the laterals the water used for the backwashing came from the filtered water storage tank 2 2 operational procedure the experiment lasted 1000 h for each filter taking place uninterruptedly between march and november 2018 except for the month of june where the installation did not work due to a breakdown of turbidity sensors whenever possible six daily irrigation sessions of 4 h each i e two daily sessions of 4 h per filter were carried out in practice it was attempted to establish irrigation sessions as homogeneous as possible which was not always possible due to small breakdowns that prevented the use of a filter for a certain period of time when these breakdowns were solved the operation time of the affected filter was increased to equalize the hours of operation during the 1000 h that the experiment lasted two different media heights were tested 20 and 30 cm and two different filtration velocities 30 and 60 m h for each one which made a total of four different operating conditions the operating conditions were the same for each filter with each being tested for 250 h working pressure was set to 172 kpa at drip irrigation subunit inlet no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment 2 3 assessment of filter and emitter performance filter performance for removing turbidity and dissolved oxygen was assessed through the removal efficiency e achieved in the filters which was calculated as 1 e n o n n o 100 where n0 and n are the values of turbidity and dissolved oxygen at filter inlet and outlet respectively flow discharge for all the emitters of all the laterals i e a total of 2712 emitters was measured in the experimental field at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment 1000 h the flow of each dripper was collected for 5 min in collection dishes and then transferred to a 500 ml graduated cylinder to measure its discharge the experimental determination of emitter discharge lasted for about 20 h after the target time 0 500 and 1000 h due to the number of emitters being measured in addition the percentage of completely clogged emitters i e emitters that had 0 l h discharge was also computed at each control time during the emitter discharge measurements pressure was also determined in four positions on each lateral at the beginning one third of the lateral length two thirds of the lateral length and at the end using a digital manometer leo 2 keller winterhur switzerland with a precision of 0 07 that was placed at a pressure intake ein tal or akiva israel pressure uniformity of pressures uplq bliesner 1976 was calculated according to the formula 2 u p l q p 25 p x 100 where p25 is the average pressure of 25 of the positions with the lowest pressure kpa p is the average pressure of all the tested positions kpa and x is the emitter flow exponent which was considered 0 05 at the end of the experiment emitters from the locations 1 224 225 and 226 of the first and second lateral for each irrigation subunit were analysed for visual evidence of clogging these emitters were cut and opened for external and internal inspection pictures were taken with a dmc fz150 panasonic corporation osaka japan camera 2 4 characterization of inlet water the main water quality parameters for each filter were recorded each minute as was explained in section 2 1 since the filters did not operate simultaneously it was necessary to assess if effluent characteristics were different during the experiment table 2 presents the mean values of the ph temperature electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and turbidity values recorded through the 1000 h the experiment lasted significant differences p 0 05 were observed for ph temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen for the reclaimed effluents available at each filter inlet reclaimed effluent used during the experiment with the dome underdrain filter had a ph significantly higher p 0 05 than that for both porous media and arm collector underdrain filters according to bucks et al 1979 classification there was a moderate chemical clogging hazard regarding the ph for all the filters water inlet temperatures when the porous media underdrain was tested were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the arm collector underdrain but not for those of the dome underdrain these differences between temperatures may have helped the formation and growth of biofilms which are closely related to emitter clogging li et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 electrical conductivity when porous media and collector arm filters were used was significantly higher p 0 05 than that with the dome underdrain effluent used during the operation of dome underdrain filter had a dissolved oxygen level significantly higher p 0 05 than those for both porous media and arm collector filters this means that microorganism levels should be smaller when an inserted dome filter was used no significant differences were observed in turbidity values in inlet water for any of the tested filters meaning that the risk of physical clogging was the same all these variations are due to the usual variability present when reclaimed effluents are treated in the wwtp 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses carried out using spss statistics 25 software ibm new york usa in order to analyze pressure uniformity emitter discharge and percentage of completely clogged emitters an analysis of the variance was carried out the model that was used included as fixed effects the filter underdrain design the time of measurement and the position of the emitters for uplq it was lateral position as well as the double interactions between the filter and time filter and position and time and position triple interactions were initially assessed but as they were not significant p 0 05 they were excluded from the final analyses to differentiate the averages that were significantly different with a probability of 0 05 or less the tukey s pairwise comparison test was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance variations caused by the different underdrain designs on the quality of the reclaimed effluents were characterized table 3 presents the percentages of oxygen and turbidity removals computed using the eq 1 for the different underdrain designs the porous media underdrain filter showed turbidity removals of 26 29 significantly higher p 0 05 than those reached by dome 18 53 and arm collector 13 45 underdrain filters which were not significantly different from each other previous experiments with effluents of the same wwtp and using a dome underdrain sand filter with a filtration media height of 50 cm achieved turbidity removals of 57 57 with an inlet 6 76 ftu duran ros et al 2009 and 70 6 with an inlet 9 78 ftu elbana et al 2012 tripathi et al 2014 observed turbidity reductions of 51 1 using effluents with inlet 55 ftu wu et al 2015 obtained reduction efficiencies of suspended solids from 11 4 to 48 0 using a sand filter filled with different media with equivalent diameters ranging between 2 1 and 0 45 mm no details about sand filter design were provided in either of the two previous papers the smaller turbidity removal observed in the present experiment 19 4 on average for all of these three underdrain designs may be due to the smaller inlet levels of turbidity of the effluent used 6 15 ftu on average and to the reduced height of sand media bed in the filters which was between 40 and 60 lower than the heights used by duran ros et al 2009 and elbana et al 2012 with a dome underdrain filter lower media heights used in the present experiment are explained by the limitation caused by reduced maximum height of arm collector underdrain filter 40 cm and the need to carry out the experiment under the same experimental conditions for each filter the increase of dissolved oxygen achieved by the porous media 11 20 and arm collector underdrain 11 03 filters were greater than that observed with the dome underdrain filter 6 68 although no significant differences were noted between these values the smaller increases in dissolved oxygen achieved by the dome underdrain filter might be explained by the significantly p 0 05 higher values of this parameter at this filter inlet table 2 dissolved oxygen increases in the dome underdrain filter were higher than those observed by duran ros et al 2009 0 49 for inlet do values of 2 80 mg l and working with an effective sand size of 0 40 mm and elbana et al 2012 3 75 for inlet do values of 4 00 mg l and using an effective sand size of 0 48 mm which were obtained in an experiment without any chlorination treatment although do increase can be attributed to minor imperfections that result in air intrusions maestre valero and martínez álvarez 2010 the main reason is related to chlorination of backwashing water which reduced microbial population li et al 2010 that consumes oxygen 3 2 pressure distribution across laterals table 4 shows the average pressure uniformity coefficient uplq for the 4 driplines placed after each different filter in the three periods where emitter discharge was assessed under field conditions for all the irrigation subunits uplq was above 98 during the whole experiment so the pressure distribution for the driplines can be considered uniform since the emitter manufacturing coefficient of variation was low 3 discharge reductions can mainly be explained by emitter clogging however slightly smaller pressure values were observed on the irrigation subunit after the dome underdrain filter the reason was a clogged screen located inside the volume meter placed at the beginning of these laterals that was discovered after 800 h however since pressure compensating emitters were used the effect of this smaller pressures on emitter discharge should have been minimum since pressure across the whole lateral was always within the acceptable pressure range for the tested emitter 50 400 kpa in order to assess if there were a possible effect of uplq on results a statistical treatment was carried out analyzing uplq of each dripine no significant p 0 05 effects were observed either for the different laterals or for the different assessment times the position of the four driplines and for any interaction between these factors these results confirmed that values of uplq did not have any differential effect on any of the laterals of the experimental setup 3 3 emitter performance emitter discharge values were treated statistically and there was table 5 a significant effect p 0 05 of each fixed factor time emitter position and filter underdrain design as well as the interactions of underdrain design and time underdrain design and emitter location and time and emitter location each interaction will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections overall there was a significant reduction p 0 05 of emitter discharge which gradually decreased from an average measured discharge of 2 49 l h at the beginning of the experiment to 2 29 l h at 500 h and 2 22 l h at 1000 h globally there has been a 10 8 reduction of emitter discharge from the beginning to the end of the experiment this emitter discharge reduction throughout irrigation time due to clogging incidence has been widely observed ravina et al 1992 duran ros et al 2009 tripathi et al 2014 wu et al 2015 pei et al 2014 3 3 1 effect of the underdrain design and irrigation time emitter discharge with regard to filter underdrain design and irrigation time is shown in fig 3 there was a significant reduction in emitter discharge over time for all the filter designs emitters protected by an arm collector underdrain sand filter showed a discharge reduction of 7 6 at 500 h and 9 6 at 1000 h from the initial value these discharge diminutions were smaller than those observed for those emitters protected by the porous media and dome underdrain filters 8 76 and 8 06 at 500 h and 12 35 and 11 29 at 1000 h respectively most of discharge rate reductions took place during the first 500 h compared with those from 500 to 1000 h 3 93 for the porous media 3 51 for the dome and 2 16 for the arm collector underdrain wu et al 2015 also observed major emitter discharge reductions in first testing stages from 0 to 150 h compared to reductions in final testing stages from 150 to 300 h however in an experiment operated for 540 h with pressure compensating emitters pei et al 2014 the relative average emitter discharge reduced 4 1 13 1 during the first period 0 204 h but reduced 37 5 67 3 at the end of the experiment 204 540 h at the beginning of the experiment no differences in emitter discharge between underdrain designs were found fig 3 after 500 h the average discharge of emitters protected by an arm collector design 2 31 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than with the dome underdrain 2 28 l h but not with the porous media design 2 29 l h after 1000 h the average discharge of emitters protected by the arm collector design 2 26 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than those from both dome and porous media 2 20 l h underdrain filters however these differences were only about 3 of emitter discharge on average further research on the hydrodynamics conditions under filtration and especially backwashing since the last has an important effect on filter performance burt 2010 enciso medina et al 2011 for each underdrain design should be carried out in order to identify different patterns on particle removal that may have an effect on emitter clogging 3 3 2 effect of the underdrain design and emitter location emitter discharges related to filter underdrain design and emitter location are shown in fig 4 for each underdrain sand filter design significant differences p 0 05 in emitter discharge were found but only for emitters placed at the end of each lateral in addition slight variations were observed between filter designs thus for both porous media and dome underdrain designs emitter discharge of the three last emitters last 1 2 m of the dripline was significantly p 0 05 lower than the discharge of emitters located at the first 88 8 m of the lateral i e emitters 1 222 for the arm collector underdrain the smallest emitter discharge was only observed in the two last emitters last 0 8 m regarding emitter discharge of emitters 1 223 for all the underdrain designs last emitter had clearly the lowest emitter average discharge 1 09 l h for the porous media 1 31 l h for the dome and 1 57 l h for arm collector designs for each emitter position differences in emitter discharge between underdrain designs were only found in 11 emitters which accounted for only 5 of the emitters on each dripline the distribution of these emitters did not follow any pattern since they were emitter number 20 31 43 105 110 111 112 153 156 160 and 217 in 27 of these emitters emitters number 105 111 and 112 discharge achieved with porous media underdrain sand filter was significantly higher than with arm collector filter while just the opposite happened with 18 of the emitters emitters 20 and 217 for another 18 of these emitters emitters 31 and 110 dome underdrain sand filter achieved more emitter discharge than arm collector but for emitters 156 and 160 the results was exactly the opposite these differences might be explained by the randomness that is commonly observed in emitter clogging feng et al 2018a 3 3 3 effect of time and emitter location the interaction between time and location on emitter performance was also significant table 5 at the beginning of the experiment there were no significant differences among locations although after 500 and 1000 h significant differences p 0 05 appeared fig 5 with smaller discharges observed in the emitters at the end of the 90 m long driplines after 500 h the three last emitters positions 224 225 and 226 had significantly lower p 0 05 discharges than the rest of emitters with average values of 1 83 1 83 and 1 49 l h respectively after 1000 h the last four emitters locations 223 224 225 and 226 had a lower discharge p 0 05 than the 222 previous ones with values of 1 45 1 22 0 61 and 0 00 l h respectively this means that all the final emitters were completely clogged at the end of the experiment whatever the filter was in addition the emitter located in position 221 showed also a smaller discharge than that of the previous 220 emitters with the exception of emitters 213 and 218 after 1000 h there was a flow discharge reduction in almost all the emitters compared with 500 h emitter flow rates with this reduction accentuated along the lateral greater discharge reductions at the end of laterals have been widely observed by many authors e g ravina et al 1992 ravina et al 1997 trooien et al 2000 puig bargués et al 2010a wu et al 2015 moreover significant differences p 0 05 in discharges between different times were found in almost all emitter locations with the following combinations for emitter discharges 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h and 0 h 500 h and 500 h 1000 h but 0 h 1000 h a total of 77 68 of the emitter discharges were significantly higher p 0 05 at 0 h but not between 500 h and 1000 h and 11 61 were significantly different for all the measured times in 5 80 of the emitters discharge at 0 h was significantly different from that at 1000 h but there were neither differences between 0 h and 500 h nor between 500 h and 1000 h for 4 02 of the emitters discharge at 0 h and 500 h was significantly higher than at 1000 h finally 0 89 of emitters did not show any significant difference in discharge over time table 6 3 4 completely clogged emitters the total number of totally clogged emitters after 500 h was 5 emitters 0 56 of the total for the laterals protected by the porous media underdrain filter and 2 0 22 of the total for the dome underdrain filter no clogged emitters for the arm collector underdrain filter were found after 1000 h the total number of clogged emitters was 10 for the porous media filter 1 13 of the total 8 for the dome 0 91 of the total and 6 for the arm collector underdrain filter 0 68 of the total the emitter protected with dome underdrain in location 223 recovered from total clogging after 500 h to a flow rate of 0 36 l h after 1000 h some authors had observed the recovery of clogged emitters and attributed this fact to a release of the material that plugged the emitter ravina et al 1992 duran ros et al 2009 due to pressure variations or deformation of organic particles although the filter with porous media underdrain had turbidity removals significant higher than the other two designs it presented a higher percentage of completely clogged emitters a possible explanation could be that other particles such as small sized sand released from the filter might have clogged the emitter but this was not observed and it will be discussed on section 3 5 thus the randomness observed in clogging feng et al 2018a might also explain this observation the percentage of totally clogged emitters for each location was treated statistically and there was a significant effect of time emitter location and the interaction of both table 7 either the effect of underdrain sand filter design or its interaction between time and emitter location were found to be significant p 0 05 these means that the different underdrain designs tested in the present experiment did not explain the percentage of completely clogged emitters regarding experiment time after 500 h of irrigation significant differences p 0 05 of the percentage of completely clogged emitters among locations were found with locations 224 and 225 each one with 16 66 of completely clogged emitters being significantly different from the rest except emitter number 223 8 33 of totally clogged emitters and emitter 226 22 22 of completely clogged emitters completely clogged emitters for location 226 were significantly higher than those observed in locations 1 223 after 1000 h location 226 had a significantly higher percentage of completely clogged emitters than the rest of emitter locations at this time emitter 225 also had a significantly higher percentage of completely clogged emitters 58 33 than the emitters placed before and emitters 223 and 224 had at the same time a higher percentage of totally clogged emitters 25 and 33 33 respectively than that observed for the first 222 emitters fig 6 all the clogged emitters were located at the end of the lateral several studies show this same clogging emitter tendency trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009 puig bargués et al 2010a oliver et al 2014 which can be attributed to a reduction flow rate at the end of the lateral shannon et al 1982 and a greater concentration of particles wu et al 2015 despite the fact that reclaimed effluent was chlorinated after being filtered at the end of laterals emitter discharges were lower sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 and more emitters became fully clogged some qualitative measurements of chlorine at the emitter outlet at the end of the lateral were made using chlorine test strips and as it may be anticipated the chlorine level was very low at this point since injection was carried out at a long distance away from the filters free chlorine levels between 1 5 2 5 mg l at the end of the laterals effectively reduced emitter clogging li et al 2010 song et al 2017 it should be pointed out that no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment in order to have more clogging incidence flushing reduces sediment deposition within driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2018 as well as biofilm formation oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 however the number of completely clogged emitters was relatively small for each emitter location only significant differences in the percentage of completely clogged emitters table 8 were found at position 224 being the percentage at 1000 h higher than at 0 h but not than at 500 h and 226 being the percentage of 1000 h higher than the other two times 3 5 emitter observation emitters from the beginning and the end of the laterals were taken for observation after 1000 h while there were not visually appreciable deposits on the emitters placed at the beginning of the laterals fig 7 a for any irrigation subunit biofilm growth was observed in those emitters located at the end of the laterals especially at the final position fig 7b where biofilm covered the total surface of the emitter and the dripline the amount of deposits increased along the ending locations and it was formed mainly of biofilm and sludge particles these observations were in accordance with the findings of ravina et al 1992 trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009 and puig bargués et al 2010a no visual differences in the amount of deposits were observed between irrigation subunits being the emitter of the last location completely covered in all the samples observed no sand particles which might be released from the sand filters were visually observed in any of the emitters that were cut and opened on the other hand the observation of emitter labyrinths of the final locations fig 7c show an important biofilm growth near the water outlet biofilm composition was not analyzed since it was out of the scope of the paper and emitter sampling was carried out under conditions that not allowed to have representative biofilm results for each treatment however further research should be undertaken in order to characterize the features of the biofilm formed 4 conclusions the present study was carried out to determine the effect of three different underdrain designs used for sand media filters on emitter clogging when using a chlorinated reclaimed effluent with an average turbidity of 6 15 ftu and dissolved oxygen of 3 17 mg l during 1000 irrigation hours of 90 m length laterals that were not flushed during the whole experiment emitter clogging was affected by the interactions between underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time emitter location had a significant effect only after 500 h of operation with significant differences among emitter discharge p 0 05 in the last three emitters last 1 2 m of the lateral and after 1000 h for those emitters located at the last 2 m of the laterals there was also a significant reduction in emitter discharge that ranged from 9 6 to 12 35 depending on the filter design after 1000 h of irrigation a significantly higher emitter discharge p 0 05 was observed in those emitters protected by a sand filter with arm collector underdrain although this filter did not achieve the highest turbidity removals there was also a location effect on emitter discharge among underdrain designs the emitter discharge values were significantly lower from the final 4 3 and 2 emitters when sand filter with a porous media dome and arm collector underdrains respectively were used on the other hand the percentage of completely clogged emitters depended on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location without any significant effect of any of the three different sand filter underdrain designs based on the results a sand filter with an arm collector underdrain design showed less emitter clogging when reclaimed effluent was used but only after 1000 h of irrigation for shorter times clogging protection between the different tested filters was not different however emitter clogging which is a complex process depended also on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location further research should be carried out to analyse if different sand filter designs have a specific effect on any of the emitter clogging agents acknowledgements the authors would like to

10916,sand media filters are those that achieve a higher retention of organic and inorganic solids which is why they are usually recommended when reclaimed effluents are used in drip irrigation systems sand filters usually differ on the design of their underdrain where an important pressure drop is produced however the effect of the design of sand filter underdrain on emitter clogging has not been widely studied three sand media filters with different underdrain designs collector arms inserted domes and drainage with porous media were used for filtering a reclaimed effluent in a surface drip irrigation system pressure compensating emitters with 2 3 l h nominal emitter discharge were placed every 40 cm in 4 irrigation laterals each measuring 90 m in length effluents were chlorinated after being filtered the filters operated for 1000 h with sand media heights of 20 and 30 cm and filtration velocities of 30 and 60 m h at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment the emitter discharge of each one of the 2712 emitters that were installed was experimentally measured under field conditions on average there was a statistically significant reduction p 0 05 on emitter discharge regarding the initial value of 8 03 at 500 h and 10 84 at 1000 h emitter clogging was primarily affected by the interactions between underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time differences on emitter discharge due to underdrain design were only observed at 1000 h showing a significantly higher flow rate p 0 05 those emitters protected with the filter with a collector arm underdrain despite the fact that this filter did not achieve the highest turbidity removals emitter location had also a significant effect after 500 h of operation being discharge significantly lower p 0 05 only in the last 2 m of the laterals with the minimum values found for the final two drippers the three filters used in the experiment did not show a significant effect on the percentage of completely clogged emitters which mainly depended on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location keywords wastewater microirrigation media filter filtration plugging 1 introduction the use of reclaimed wastewater in agriculture has become a viable stable and economic alternative to confront the issue of water scarcity on our planet asano et al 2007 because municipal and industrial wastewater may be used for irrigating a large variety of crops hamilton et al 2007 thus releasing water of higher quality for other uses lazarova and asano 2005 the best irrigation technique for using wastewater from the public health and environmental points of view is drip irrigation bucks et al 1979 world health organization 2006 however the main problem using drip irrigation with reclaimed effluents is emitter clogging bucks et al 1979 ravina et al 1992 emitter clogging depends on factors such as wastewater characteristics emitter type system operation maintenance and filtration capra and scicolone 2007 duran ros et al 2009 as clogging is related to the quality of water used bucks et al 1979 derived a hazard rating depending on the values of different physical chemical and biological quality parameters according to bucks et al 1979 an irrigation water with suspended solids below 50 mg l a ph below 7 and bacterial number smaller than 10 000 cfu ml should pose a minor clogging hazard however capra and scicolone 1998 suggest higher clogging hazard thresholds when emitters with higher discharge rates are used pressure compensating emitters puig bargués et al 2010a pei et al 2015 integrated emitters pei et al 2014 and high discharge emitters ravina et al 1992 trooien et al 2000 are more resistant to clogging some authors analyzed flow and particle movements within emitter components aiming to suggest designs that could prevent clogging development wei et al 2008 al muhammad et al 2016 feng et al 2018b clogging could also be reduced with lower irrigation frequencies zhou et al 2015 and lateral flushing puig bargués et al 2010a 2010b tripathi et al 2014 feng et al 2017 several authors have studied how biofilm and chemical precipitation which are the most common clogging causes when reclaimed effluents are reused affect emitter performance gamri et al 2014 green et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 chlorination has also resulted in being effective in reducing emitter clogging and it has been widely used to prevent biological clogging hills and brenes 2001 dehghanisanij et al 2005 cararo et al 2006 as the strong oxidation of chlorine inhibits the reproduction and growth of microorganisms and the formation of biofilms li et al 2010 as well as if combined with acidification the precipitation of solid particles

organic compounds phosphorus and microorganisms dalahmeh et al 2012 and consequently prevent emitter clogging capra and scicolone 2007 in sand media filters the pressure loss is mainly located at filtration media and auxiliary elements such as the underdrain arbat et al 2013 several authors have studied the influence of underdrain designs on pressure loss mesquita et al 2012 bové et al 2015 pujol et al 2016 but none of them have analyzed how filter design affects emitter clogging on the other hand sand filters have to be periodically backwashed for releasing those particles retained in the media which increase pressure loss across filtration time backwashing is an important procedure for an effective filter performance nakayama et al 2007 but the media cleaning pattern depends on the underdrain design burt 2010 usually filter backwashing is carried out at pre set pressure loss nevertheless daily backwashing has been also verified to be a good practice for assuring good emitter performance enciso medina et al 2011 even though filter and backwashing operations in drip irrigation systems have been studied elbana et al 2012 there are few studies which try to improve the design and performance of sand media filters with this in mind bové et al 2017 designed a new underdrain aiming to reduce pressure loss across sand filters for improving both water and energy use efficiency the main objective of this study was to analyse the effect of three sand filters with different underdrain designs the prototype designed by bové et al 2017 and two commercial ones on emitter clogging when a reclaimed effluent is used 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup reclaimed effluent from the celrà girona spain wastewater treatment plant wwtp which treats urban and industrial effluents using a sludge process was used in the experiment the experimental irrigation system consisted of three sand filters with three underdrain different designs fig 1 a sand filter model fa1m lama sevilla spain a sand filter model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain and an experimental sand filter built with an underdrain designed by bové et al 2017 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the different sand filters used the underdrain of the filter model fa1m lama sevilla spain consisted of 7 parts with slots which overlapped each other forming striated tubes converging in a central tube which worked as a manifold this contained a total of 10 striated tubes with 5 tubes on each side of the manifold in model fa f2 188 regaber parets del vallès spain the underdrain consisted of 12 inserted domes on a back plate these domes were pyramidally shaped with vertical slots mounted on a manifold finally the underdrain designed by bové et al 2017 consisted of a cylinder that occupied the entire surface of filtration of the filter this cylinder was confined by two 0 75 mm meshes one at the top and one at the bottom and was filled with silica sand sieved to 0 63 0 75 mm grain size with an equivalent diameter of 0 71 mm bulk density of 1 478 kg m3 real density of 2 573 kg m3 and a porosity of 42 2 bové et al 2017 all the filters were filled with silica sand ca 07ms sibelco minerales sa bilbao spain with an effective diameter de size opening which will pass 10 by dry weight of a representative sample of the filter material of 0 48 mm and a coefficient of uniformity ratio of the size opening which will pass 60 of the sand through the size opening which will pass 10 through of 1 73 each filter had an irrigation subunit associated which consisted of four laterals each with a total length of 90 m fig 2 each lateral had 226 emitters so for each emitter location there were 4 replications per subunit however for location 226 only there were 3 emitters per subunit commercial integrated and pressure compensating emitters uniram as 16010 netafim tel aviv israel with 2 3 l h of nominal flow discharge a distance between emitters of 0 4 m a nominal working pressure of 50 400 kpa and a manufacturing coefficient of variation of 0 03 were used this emitter was selected since its design improves clogging resistance and its pressure compensation allows to use it in a wide range of topographical conditions the reclaimed effluent was pumped from the wwtp to the filters using a multicellular centrifugal pump model cr 15 4 grundfos bjerringbro denmark governed by a frequency variator model frn 4 fuji electric cerdanyola del vallès spain the inlet flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter isomag ms2500 isoil industria spa cinisello balsamo italy with a pulse transmitter the experimental setup allowed that only one filter was operating at a time after being filtered the reclaimed effluent was carried to the drip irrigation subunits since the filtrated flow was higher than which was needed for the irrigation subunits a proportional electrohydraulic actuator skd32 siemens munich germany operated a three way valve vxg41 siemens munich germany so that the excess flow was brought to a water storage tank of 3000 l aquablock shütz selters germany that was used for filter backwashing a chlorine deposit of 200 l was installed to continuously inject chlorine for achieving a concentration of 2 ppm in the water after being filtered using a dostec ac1 2 membrane pump itc sta perpètua demogoda spain when sand filters were backwashed backwashing water entering the filters was chlorinated to reach a 4 ppm chlorine concentration several effluent quality parameters before and after being filtered were measured and recorded every minute in a supervisory control and data acquisition system scada previously developed duran ros et al 2008 the parameters measured before filtration were the electrical conductivity using a transmitter liquisys m clm253 cd0010 and a sensor cls21 c1e4a the ph and the temperature using a transmitter liquisys m cpm253 mr0010 and a sensor cps11d 7ba21 the parameters measured before and after filtration were turbidity using a transmitter liquisys m cum253 tu0005 with and a sensor cus31 a2e and dissolved oxygen with a transmitter liquisys m com253 wx0015 and a sensor cos 61 a1f0 all the transmitters and sensors used were manufactured by endress hauser gerlingen germany the filters were washed automatically when the total pressure drop across them measured by pressure transducers reached 50 kpa ravina et al 1992 the backwashing time was 3 min throughout the entire test and during that time backwashing water did not reach the laterals the water used for the backwashing came from the filtered water storage tank 2 2 operational procedure the experiment lasted 1000 h for each filter taking place uninterruptedly between march and november 2018 except for the month of june where the installation did not work due to a breakdown of turbidity sensors whenever possible six daily irrigation sessions of 4 h each i e two daily sessions of 4 h per filter were carried out in practice it was attempted to establish irrigation sessions as homogeneous as possible which was not always possible due to small breakdowns that prevented the use of a filter for a certain period of time when these breakdowns were solved the operation time of the affected filter was increased to equalize the hours of operation during the 1000 h that the experiment lasted two different media heights were tested 20 and 30 cm and two different filtration velocities 30 and 60 m h for each one which made a total of four different operating conditions the operating conditions were the same for each filter with each being tested for 250 h working pressure was set to 172 kpa at drip irrigation subunit inlet no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment 2 3 assessment of filter and emitter performance filter performance for removing turbidity and dissolved oxygen was assessed through the removal efficiency e achieved in the filters which was calculated as 1 e n o n n o 100 where n0 and n are the values of turbidity and dissolved oxygen at filter inlet and outlet respectively flow discharge for all the emitters of all the laterals i e a total of 2712 emitters was measured in the experimental field at the beginning after 500 h and at the end of the experiment 1000 h the flow of each dripper was collected for 5 min in collection dishes and then transferred to a 500 ml graduated cylinder to measure its discharge the experimental determination of emitter discharge lasted for about 20 h after the target time 0 500 and 1000 h due to the number of emitters being measured in addition the percentage of completely clogged emitters i e emitters that had 0 l h discharge was also computed at each control time during the emitter discharge measurements pressure was also determined in four positions on each lateral at the beginning one third of the lateral length two thirds of the lateral length and at the end using a digital manometer leo 2 keller winterhur switzerland with a precision of 0 07 that was placed at a pressure intake ein tal or akiva israel pressure uniformity of pressures uplq bliesner 1976 was calculated according to the formula 2 u p l q p 25 p x 100 where p25 is the average pressure of 25 of the positions with the lowest pressure kpa p is the average pressure of all the tested positions kpa and x is the emitter flow exponent which was considered 0 05 at the end of the experiment emitters from the locations 1 224 225 and 226 of the first and second lateral for each irrigation subunit were analysed for visual evidence of clogging these emitters were cut and opened for external and internal inspection pictures were taken with a dmc fz150 panasonic corporation osaka japan camera 2 4 characterization of inlet water the main water quality parameters for each filter were recorded each minute as was explained in section 2 1 since the filters did not operate simultaneously it was necessary to assess if effluent characteristics were different during the experiment table 2 presents the mean values of the ph temperature electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and turbidity values recorded through the 1000 h the experiment lasted significant differences p 0 05 were observed for ph temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen for the reclaimed effluents available at each filter inlet reclaimed effluent used during the experiment with the dome underdrain filter had a ph significantly higher p 0 05 than that for both porous media and arm collector underdrain filters according to bucks et al 1979 classification there was a moderate chemical clogging hazard regarding the ph for all the filters water inlet temperatures when the porous media underdrain was tested were significantly higher p 0 05 than those for the arm collector underdrain but not for those of the dome underdrain these differences between temperatures may have helped the formation and growth of biofilms which are closely related to emitter clogging li et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 electrical conductivity when porous media and collector arm filters were used was significantly higher p 0 05 than that with the dome underdrain effluent used during the operation of dome underdrain filter had a dissolved oxygen level significantly higher p 0 05 than those for both porous media and arm collector filters this means that microorganism levels should be smaller when an inserted dome filter was used no significant differences were observed in turbidity values in inlet water for any of the tested filters meaning that the risk of physical clogging was the same all these variations are due to the usual variability present when reclaimed effluents are treated in the wwtp 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses carried out using spss statistics 25 software ibm new york usa in order to analyze pressure uniformity emitter discharge and percentage of completely clogged emitters an analysis of the variance was carried out the model that was used included as fixed effects the filter underdrain design the time of measurement and the position of the emitters for uplq it was lateral position as well as the double interactions between the filter and time filter and position and time and position triple interactions were initially assessed but as they were not significant p 0 05 they were excluded from the final analyses to differentiate the averages that were significantly different with a probability of 0 05 or less the tukey s pairwise comparison test was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter performance variations caused by the different underdrain designs on the quality of the reclaimed effluents were characterized table 3 presents the percentages of oxygen and turbidity removals computed using the eq 1 for the different underdrain designs the porous media underdrain filter showed turbidity removals of 26 29 significantly higher p 0 05 than those reached by dome 18 53 and arm collector 13 45 underdrain filters which were not significantly different from each other previous experiments with effluents of the same wwtp and using a dome underdrain sand filter with a filtration media height of 50 cm achieved turbidity removals of 57 57 with an inlet 6 76 ftu duran ros et al 2009 and 70 6 with an inlet 9 78 ftu elbana et al 2012 tripathi et al 2014 observed turbidity reductions of 51 1 using effluents with inlet 55 ftu wu et al 2015 obtained reduction efficiencies of suspended solids from 11 4 to 48 0 using a sand filter filled with different media with equivalent diameters ranging between 2 1 and 0 45 mm no details about sand filter design were provided in either of the two previous papers the smaller turbidity removal observed in the present experiment 19 4 on average for all of these three underdrain designs may be due to the smaller inlet levels of turbidity of the effluent used 6 15 ftu on average and to the reduced height of sand media bed in the filters which was between 40 and 60 lower than the heights used by duran ros et al 2009 and elbana et al 2012 with a dome underdrain filter lower media heights used in the present experiment are explained by the limitation caused by reduced maximum height of arm collector underdrain filter 40 cm and the need to carry out the experiment under the same experimental conditions for each filter the increase of dissolved oxygen achieved by the porous media 11 20 and arm collector underdrain 11 03 filters were greater than that observed with the dome underdrain filter 6 68 although no significant differences were noted between these values the smaller increases in dissolved oxygen achieved by the dome underdrain filter might be explained by the significantly p 0 05 higher values of this parameter at this filter inlet table 2 dissolved oxygen increases in the dome underdrain filter were higher than those observed by duran ros et al 2009 0 49 for inlet do values of 2 80 mg l and working with an effective sand size of 0 40 mm and elbana et al 2012 3 75 for inlet do values of 4 00 mg l and using an effective sand size of 0 48 mm which were obtained in an experiment without any chlorination treatment although do increase can be attributed to minor imperfections that result in air intrusions maestre valero and martínez álvarez 2010 the main reason is related to chlorination of backwashing water which reduced microbial population li et al 2010 that consumes oxygen 3 2 pressure distribution across laterals table 4 shows the average pressure uniformity coefficient uplq for the 4 driplines placed after each different filter in the three periods where emitter discharge was assessed under field conditions for all the irrigation subunits uplq was above 98 during the whole experiment so the pressure distribution for the driplines can be considered uniform since the emitter manufacturing coefficient of variation was low 3 discharge reductions can mainly be explained by emitter clogging however slightly smaller pressure values were observed on the irrigation subunit after the dome underdrain filter the reason was a clogged screen located inside the volume meter placed at the beginning of these laterals that was discovered after 800 h however since pressure compensating emitters were used the effect of this smaller pressures on emitter discharge should have been minimum since pressure across the whole lateral was always within the acceptable pressure range for the tested emitter 50 400 kpa in order to assess if there were a possible effect of uplq on results a statistical treatment was carried out analyzing uplq of each dripine no significant p 0 05 effects were observed either for the different laterals or for the different assessment times the position of the four driplines and for any interaction between these factors these results confirmed that values of uplq did not have any differential effect on any of the laterals of the experimental setup 3 3 emitter performance emitter discharge values were treated statistically and there was table 5 a significant effect p 0 05 of each fixed factor time emitter position and filter underdrain design as well as the interactions of underdrain design and time underdrain design and emitter location and time and emitter location each interaction will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections overall there was a significant reduction p 0 05 of emitter discharge which gradually decreased from an average measured discharge of 2 49 l h at the beginning of the experiment to 2 29 l h at 500 h and 2 22 l h at 1000 h globally there has been a 10 8 reduction of emitter discharge from the beginning to the end of the experiment this emitter discharge reduction throughout irrigation time due to clogging incidence has been widely observed ravina et al 1992 duran ros et al 2009 tripathi et al 2014 wu et al 2015 pei et al 2014 3 3 1 effect of the underdrain design and irrigation time emitter discharge with regard to filter underdrain design and irrigation time is shown in fig 3 there was a significant reduction in emitter discharge over time for all the filter designs emitters protected by an arm collector underdrain sand filter showed a discharge reduction of 7 6 at 500 h and 9 6 at 1000 h from the initial value these discharge diminutions were smaller than those observed for those emitters protected by the porous media and dome underdrain filters 8 76 and 8 06 at 500 h and 12 35 and 11 29 at 1000 h respectively most of discharge rate reductions took place during the first 500 h compared with those from 500 to 1000 h 3 93 for the porous media 3 51 for the dome and 2 16 for the arm collector underdrain wu et al 2015 also observed major emitter discharge reductions in first testing stages from 0 to 150 h compared to reductions in final testing stages from 150 to 300 h however in an experiment operated for 540 h with pressure compensating emitters pei et al 2014 the relative average emitter discharge reduced 4 1 13 1 during the first period 0 204 h but reduced 37 5 67 3 at the end of the experiment 204 540 h at the beginning of the experiment no differences in emitter discharge between underdrain designs were found fig 3 after 500 h the average discharge of emitters protected by an arm collector design 2 31 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than with the dome underdrain 2 28 l h but not with the porous media design 2 29 l h after 1000 h the average discharge of emitters protected by the arm collector design 2 26 l h was significantly higher p 0 05 than those from both dome and porous media 2 20 l h underdrain filters however these differences were only about 3 of emitter discharge on average further research on the hydrodynamics conditions under filtration and especially backwashing since the last has an important effect on filter performance burt 2010 enciso medina et al 2011 for each underdrain design should be carried out in order to identify different patterns on particle removal that may have an effect on emitter clogging 3 3 2 effect of the underdrain design and emitter location emitter discharges related to filter underdrain design and emitter location are shown in fig 4 for each underdrain sand filter design significant differences p 0 05 in emitter discharge were found but only for emitters placed at the end of each lateral in addition slight variations were observed between filter designs thus for both porous media and dome underdrain designs emitter discharge of the three last emitters last 1 2 m of the dripline was significantly p 0 05 lower than the discharge of emitters located at the first 88 8 m of the lateral i e emitters 1 222 for the arm collector underdrain the smallest emitter discharge was only observed in the two last emitters last 0 8 m regarding emitter discharge of emitters 1 223 for all the underdrain designs last emitter had clearly the lowest emitter average discharge 1 09 l h for the porous media 1 31 l h for the dome and 1 57 l h for arm collector designs for each emitter position differences in emitter discharge between underdrain designs were only found in 11 emitters which accounted for only 5 of the emitters on each dripline the distribution of these emitters did not follow any pattern since they were emitter number 20 31 43 105 110 111 112 153 156 160 and 217 in 27 of these emitters emitters number 105 111 and 112 discharge achieved with porous media underdrain sand filter was significantly higher than with arm collector filter while just the opposite happened with 18 of the emitters emitters 20 and 217 for another 18 of these emitters emitters 31 and 110 dome underdrain sand filter achieved more emitter discharge than arm collector but for emitters 156 and 160 the results was exactly the opposite these differences might be explained by the randomness that is commonly observed in emitter clogging feng et al 2018a 3 3 3 effect of time and emitter location the interaction between time and location on emitter performance was also significant table 5 at the beginning of the experiment there were no significant differences among locations although after 500 and 1000 h significant differences p 0 05 appeared fig 5 with smaller discharges observed in the emitters at the end of the 90 m long driplines after 500 h the three last emitters positions 224 225 and 226 had significantly lower p 0 05 discharges than the rest of emitters with average values of 1 83 1 83 and 1 49 l h respectively after 1000 h the last four emitters locations 223 224 225 and 226 had a lower discharge p 0 05 than the 222 previous ones with values of 1 45 1 22 0 61 and 0 00 l h respectively this means that all the final emitters were completely clogged at the end of the experiment whatever the filter was in addition the emitter located in position 221 showed also a smaller discharge than that of the previous 220 emitters with the exception of emitters 213 and 218 after 1000 h there was a flow discharge reduction in almost all the emitters compared with 500 h emitter flow rates with this reduction accentuated along the lateral greater discharge reductions at the end of laterals have been widely observed by many authors e g ravina et al 1992 ravina et al 1997 trooien et al 2000 puig bargués et al 2010a wu et al 2015 moreover significant differences p 0 05 in discharges between different times were found in almost all emitter locations with the following combinations for emitter discharges 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h 0 h 500 h 1000 h and 0 h 500 h and 500 h 1000 h but 0 h 1000 h a total of 77 68 of the emitter discharges were significantly higher p 0 05 at 0 h but not between 500 h and 1000 h and 11 61 were significantly different for all the measured times in 5 80 of the emitters discharge at 0 h was significantly different from that at 1000 h but there were neither differences between 0 h and 500 h nor between 500 h and 1000 h for 4 02 of the emitters discharge at 0 h and 500 h was significantly higher than at 1000 h finally 0 89 of emitters did not show any significant difference in discharge over time table 6 3 4 completely clogged emitters the total number of totally clogged emitters after 500 h was 5 emitters 0 56 of the total for the laterals protected by the porous media underdrain filter and 2 0 22 of the total for the dome underdrain filter no clogged emitters for the arm collector underdrain filter were found after 1000 h the total number of clogged emitters was 10 for the porous media filter 1 13 of the total 8 for the dome 0 91 of the total and 6 for the arm collector underdrain filter 0 68 of the total the emitter protected with dome underdrain in location 223 recovered from total clogging after 500 h to a flow rate of 0 36 l h after 1000 h some authors had observed the recovery of clogged emitters and attributed this fact to a release of the material that plugged the emitter ravina et al 1992 duran ros et al 2009 due to pressure variations or deformation of organic particles although the filter with porous media underdrain had turbidity removals significant higher than the other two designs it presented a higher percentage of completely clogged emitters a possible explanation could be that other particles such as small sized sand released from the filter might have clogged the emitter but this was not observed and it will be discussed on section 3 5 thus the randomness observed in clogging feng et al 2018a might also explain this observation the percentage of totally clogged emitters for each location was treated statistically and there was a significant effect of time emitter location and the interaction of both table 7 either the effect of underdrain sand filter design or its interaction between time and emitter location were found to be significant p 0 05 these means that the different underdrain designs tested in the present experiment did not explain the percentage of completely clogged emitters regarding experiment time after 500 h of irrigation significant differences p 0 05 of the percentage of completely clogged emitters among locations were found with locations 224 and 225 each one with 16 66 of completely clogged emitters being significantly different from the rest except emitter number 223 8 33 of totally clogged emitters and emitter 226 22 22 of completely clogged emitters completely clogged emitters for location 226 were significantly higher than those observed in locations 1 223 after 1000 h location 226 had a significantly higher percentage of completely clogged emitters than the rest of emitter locations at this time emitter 225 also had a significantly higher percentage of completely clogged emitters 58 33 than the emitters placed before and emitters 223 and 224 had at the same time a higher percentage of totally clogged emitters 25 and 33 33 respectively than that observed for the first 222 emitters fig 6 all the clogged emitters were located at the end of the lateral several studies show this same clogging emitter tendency trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009 puig bargués et al 2010a oliver et al 2014 which can be attributed to a reduction flow rate at the end of the lateral shannon et al 1982 and a greater concentration of particles wu et al 2015 despite the fact that reclaimed effluent was chlorinated after being filtered at the end of laterals emitter discharges were lower sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 and more emitters became fully clogged some qualitative measurements of chlorine at the emitter outlet at the end of the lateral were made using chlorine test strips and as it may be anticipated the chlorine level was very low at this point since injection was carried out at a long distance away from the filters free chlorine levels between 1 5 2 5 mg l at the end of the laterals effectively reduced emitter clogging li et al 2010 song et al 2017 it should be pointed out that no lateral flushing was carried out during the experiment in order to have more clogging incidence flushing reduces sediment deposition within driplines puig bargués et al 2010b li et al 2018 as well as biofilm formation oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 however the number of completely clogged emitters was relatively small for each emitter location only significant differences in the percentage of completely clogged emitters table 8 were found at position 224 being the percentage at 1000 h higher than at 0 h but not than at 500 h and 226 being the percentage of 1000 h higher than the other two times 3 5 emitter observation emitters from the beginning and the end of the laterals were taken for observation after 1000 h while there were not visually appreciable deposits on the emitters placed at the beginning of the laterals fig 7 a for any irrigation subunit biofilm growth was observed in those emitters located at the end of the laterals especially at the final position fig 7b where biofilm covered the total surface of the emitter and the dripline the amount of deposits increased along the ending locations and it was formed mainly of biofilm and sludge particles these observations were in accordance with the findings of ravina et al 1992 trooien et al 2000 duran ros et al 2009 and puig bargués et al 2010a no visual differences in the amount of deposits were observed between irrigation subunits being the emitter of the last location completely covered in all the samples observed no sand particles which might be released from the sand filters were visually observed in any of the emitters that were cut and opened on the other hand the observation of emitter labyrinths of the final locations fig 7c show an important biofilm growth near the water outlet biofilm composition was not analyzed since it was out of the scope of the paper and emitter sampling was carried out under conditions that not allowed to have representative biofilm results for each treatment however further research should be undertaken in order to characterize the features of the biofilm formed 4 conclusions the present study was carried out to determine the effect of three different underdrain designs used for sand media filters on emitter clogging when using a chlorinated reclaimed effluent with an average turbidity of 6 15 ftu and dissolved oxygen of 3 17 mg l during 1000 irrigation hours of 90 m length laterals that were not flushed during the whole experiment emitter clogging was affected by the interactions between underdrain design emitter location and irrigation time emitter location had a significant effect only after 500 h of operation with significant differences among emitter discharge p 0 05 in the last three emitters last 1 2 m of the lateral and after 1000 h for those emitters located at the last 2 m of the laterals there was also a significant reduction in emitter discharge that ranged from 9 6 to 12 35 depending on the filter design after 1000 h of irrigation a significantly higher emitter discharge p 0 05 was observed in those emitters protected by a sand filter with arm collector underdrain although this filter did not achieve the highest turbidity removals there was also a location effect on emitter discharge among underdrain designs the emitter discharge values were significantly lower from the final 4 3 and 2 emitters when sand filter with a porous media dome and arm collector underdrains respectively were used on the other hand the percentage of completely clogged emitters depended on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location without any significant effect of any of the three different sand filter underdrain designs based on the results a sand filter with an arm collector underdrain design showed less emitter clogging when reclaimed effluent was used but only after 1000 h of irrigation for shorter times clogging protection between the different tested filters was not different however emitter clogging which is a complex process depended also on the interaction between irrigation time and emitter location further research should be carried out to analyse if different sand filter designs have a specific effect on any of the emitter clogging agents acknowledgements the authors would like to

10917,deficit irrigation is commonly used to improve crop yields in arid land our study evaluated the response of physiology and yield of sugar beet beta vulgaris l cv beta 356 to deficit irrigation via applying three irrigation treatments 30 50 and 70 of field capacity fc during canopy development stage the results showed that deficit irrigation significantly increased the dry matter of sugar beet taproot the dry matter for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment 50 fc was more than that for the severe deficit irrigation treatment 30 fc only severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly reduced the yield of sugar beet photosynthetic parameters of sugar beet reduced with water deficit increasing however the moderate deficit irrigation treatment significantly increased instantaneous water use efficiency wuei and water use efficiency for yield wuey leaf 13c was negatively correlated with the wuey of sugar beet after rehydration more photosynthate was allocated to taproot for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment which increased the yield while more photosynthate was allocated to the aboveground part for the severe deficit irrigation treatment short term gas exchange measurement was used to indicate the dry matter accumulation and the result was used to formulate deficit irrigation management strategies for sugar beet abbreviations pn photosynthesis rate gs stomatal conductance e evaporation tr transpiration keywords sugar beet carbon isotope photosynthate allocation water use efficiency 1 introduction water deficit is a major factor decreasing crop production around the world tognetti et al 2003 monreal et al 2007 the estimated yield loss of sugar beets in central europe is 15 30 due to the insufﬁcient water supply shrestha et al 2010 study have shown that deﬁcit irrigation can save water and improve water use efficiency wue resolving the contradiction of water needs and supply in semi arid regions cui et al 2009 however haghverdi et al 2017 reported that deficit irrigation with 75 and 50 evapotranspiration caused 9 and 11 yield reduction of sugar beet respectively but fabeiro et al 2003 reported that deficit irrigation enabled to achieve high sugar beet yield with moderate water supply sugar beet is capable of growing an extensive root system to use water from deep soil layer when it is subjected to drought stress fabeiro et al 2003 thus understanding the response of sugar beet to water deficit has gained great attention as water resources for crop production have become more and more limited and more knowledge is needed to understand how deficit irrigation affects the growth and yield of sugar beet in different conditions photosynthesis playing an important role in crop production can be influenced by water deficit the growth restriction of crop caused by water deficit is always attributed to the changes in photosynthesis leaf area and photosynthate allocation chartzoulakis et al 1993 osório et al 1997 the decrease in photosynthesis rate for plants under water deficit can be attributed to a reduction in light interception as leaf expansion reduced or leaf senescence accelerated but it can also be attributed to the reduction in c fixation per unit leaf area as stomatal closure or photo oxidation bloch et al 2006 generally the severity of water deficit appears to be important in determining whether non stomatal factors affect photosynthesis as inhibition of mesophyll activity non stomatal inhibition of photosynthesis in addition to stomatal closure occurs only under severe or prolonged drought stress meanwhile monti et al 2010 reported that the decrease of photosynthesis rate caused by an early water deficit was irreversible however to what extent the photosynthesis rate is reversible after rehydration is still debatable understanding the response of photosynthesis to water deficit and rehydration is therefore strongly desirable for the cultivation of economically important crops including sugar beet therefore one of the main purposes of this study is to clarify how the photosynthesis of individual leaf of sugar beet responds to deficit irrigation and whether the negative effects caused by water deficit can change reversibly after rehydration and how deficit irrigation stimulates the mechanism that contributes to improve drought tolerance of crops influencing dry matter production and allocation bloch et al 2006 improvement of wue through deficit irrigation has been successfully affirmed in maize geerts and raes 2009 and wheat production ma et al 2015 the wue includes wuei at leaf level and wuey at individual or yield level cui et al 2009 the wuei photosynthesis rate transpiration rate is associated with the ability of a plant to absorb high concentration of carbon which implies that high wuei helps maintain high photosynthetic rate it can also limit water loss through controlling stomatal aperture and opening closing flexas et al 2013 de santana et al 2015 furthermore the wuei is strongly related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency which may be related to the irrigation wei et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation alternate partial root zone irrigation increased tomato wuei significantly compared with conventional irrigation improving wuey the ratio of dry matter produced to water used can potentially increase yield in water limited environments rajabi et al 2008 kisekka et al 2017 topak et al 2011 reported that sugar beet with drip irrigation at 75 of full irrigation had signiﬁcant beneﬁts in saving water and increasing wuey showing an obvious advantage of deﬁcit irrigation under limited water supply ma et al 2015 reported that the wuey increased under water deficit except under severe water deficit during the reviving jointing stage the wuei measured by gas exchange method can justify the short term responses to environmental factors of crops and the wuey can indicate plant productivity and physiological responses over a long growth period in addition there are different correlations between 13c and wuey in different organs of crop numerous studies have shown that there is a negative correlation between 13c and wuey in crop leaf anyia et al 2007 cabrera bosquet et al 2007 souza et al 2005 yin et al 2005 while some studies also have shown that there is a positive correlation between 13c and wuey andrea et al 2006 philippe et al 2005 2007 in short regardless of the correlation between them 13c provides important information for effective irrigation under different water conditions grattan et al 2006 therefore 13c is considered as a direct and effective index for evaluating crop water use efficiency under different water conditions however the relationship between 13c and wuey of sugar beet under regulated deficit drip irrigation is not clear generally water deficit influences the dry matter allocation more dry matter is allocated to root with water deficit increasing but the total amount is constant in grain crops photosynthate is transferred directly to grains or stored in vegetative parts that can contribute to grain yields and there is also a relocation of photosynthate which may reduce grain sedimentation and yield decrease caused by unfavorable conditions ma et al 2015 however the factors affecting sugar beet yield under water deficit remain unclear such as photosynthate allocation and transportation the purpose of this study was to 1 investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on dry matter accumulation water use efficiency photosynthetic characteristics 13c distribution of sugar beet and relationship between 13c and wuey 2 evaluate the effect of deficit irrigation on sugar beet yield under water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and agronomic managements pot trials were conducted at agricultural college of shihezi university in xinjiang china in 2017 and 2018 fig 1 the climate is an arid continental climate with mean daily eto and precipitation of 4 8 mm and 0 8 mm respectively in order to obtain uniform plants after emergence seedlings were transplanted from paper tube to 75 l plastic pot 60 cm in height and 40 cm in diameter containing 80 kg of calcaric fluvisol soil table 1 sugar beets cv beta 356 were transplanted on 28th may in 2017 and on 9th may in 2018 and harvested on 20th november in2017 and on 1 st november in 2018 pots were placed outdoors when there was no rain and shelters were built when it rains to prevent rainwater from entering the pots each treatment had eight replications 2 2 deficit irrigation management sieved soil 80 kg 3 mm in diameter was filled into each pot 10 cm soil layer was filled each time 60 cm and irrigation was conducted to make the soil subside for 1 day fertilizers 5 kg organic fertilizers 10 g n 12 g p2o5 and 8 7 g k2so4 were applied to the top 20 cm soil layer without irrigation and subsidence soil water content in pots was 17 soil water content of the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were determined and then the average value was calculated soil water capacity was 19 the method is same as the calculation method of soil water content soil saturated water content was 26 and dry soil weight in each pot was calculated to be 68 kg during the experiment irrigation amount was controlled by weighing daily and drip irrigation was employed three field capacity treatments were set up during canopy development stage 77 110 days in 2017 and 75 105 days in 2018 after transplantation which were 70 fc for the control group 50 fc for moderate deficit irrigation treatment and 30 fc for severe deficit irrigation treatment as canopy development stage finished normal irrigation 70 fc was applied until harvest during the deficit irrigation stage when the soil water content dropped to the lower limit of the target fc the pots were then irrigated to saturated water content during the normal irrigation stage the lower limit of target fc for all pots was 70 fc the amount of irrigation water applied to each pot was recorded and used to calculate total water consumption in this study the 70 fc treatment was used as the control on the one hand 70 fc was the most suitable soil water content for most crops chai et al 2016 on the other hand sugar beet was a drought resistant crop rytter 2005 therefore the 70 fc treatment was used as the control in this experiment and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were set up on this basis the soil weight of a pot corresponding to the target field capacity fc the dry soil weight in the pot the dry soil weight in the pot the target soil water content therefore the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 70 fc 68 68 19 0 7 76 8 kg the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 50 fc 68 68 19 0 5 74 8 kg and the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 30 fc 68 68 19 0 3 72 1 kg during the first rehydration the soil irrigated to the saturated water content of 26 and the soil weight for each pot was 85 7 kg then when the soil weight for the 70 fc treatment decreased to 76 8 kg 8 9 kg 85 7 76 8 water was irrigated when the soil weight for the 50 fc treatment decreased to 74 8 kg 10 9 kg 85 7 74 8 water was irrigated and when the soil weight for the 30 fc treatment decreased to 72 1 kg 13 6 kg 85 7 72 1 water was irrigated considering the increasing weight of sugar beet plants over time the linear relationship between the leaf number and the plant weight under different treatments was fitted fig 2 to simulate the plant weight in each pot the plant weight was subtracted during weighing in 2017 the total irrigation amounts during deficit irrigation stage for the 70 50 and 30 fc treatments were 0 0375 0 0225 and 0 02 m3 plant respectively and in 2018 the total irrigation amounts during deficit irrigation stage for the 70 50 and 30 fc treatments was 0 0445 0 0327 and 0 0272 m3 plant respectively the change of soil water content in 3 treatments during the growth period in 2018 was shown in fig 3 2 3 dry matter and yield dry matter was determined after the completion of isotope labeling in sugar beet yield was determined at the 177th d and the 180th d after transplantation in 2017 and 2018 respectively formula for yield calculation yield weight per plant plant number emergence rate the plant weight was the average value of five sugar beets the number of sugar beets was determined by the planting density of the experimental area xinjiang china and the seedling emergence rate was an average value of 5 years in xinjiang 80 2 4 measurements gas exchange parameters were determined before and after rehydration during water regulation the 70 fc treatment was irrigated 4 times the 50 fc treatment was irrigated 3 times and the 30 fc treatment was irrigated 2 times because of the inconsistency of rehydration time and times for the three treatments in order to avoid the errors caused by plant growth the closest rehydration time was chosen to determine gas exchange parameters i e the gas exchange parameters for the 70 fc treatment were determined before and after the third rehydration 10th august and 14th august those for the 50 fc treatment were determined before and after the second rehydration 19th august and 22th august and those for the 30 fc treatment were determined before and after the

30 fc treatment significantly decreased by 35 1 and 22 6 in 2017 and 2018 respectively compared with that for the control and there was no significant difference between the 50 fc treatment and the control table 2 yield and the dry matter accumulation of taproot petiole and leaf for the 30 fc treatment decreased significantly compared with those for the control the 30 fc treatment significantly decreased taproot dry matter accumulation by 31 7 and 28 0 respectively while the 50 fc treatment increased taproot dry matter accumulation by 13 1 and 2 6 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared with the control the 30 fc treatment significantly decreased leaf dry matter accumulation by 35 1 and 18 0 respectively while the 50 fc treatment decreased leaf dry matter 3 1 and 6 8 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared with the control yield data for 2017 and 2018 showed that the yields for the control and 50 fc treatment were significantly higher than those for the 30 fc treatment but there was no significant difference between the control and the 50 fc treatment 3 2 gas exchange photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and internal co2 pressure after rehydration were higher than those before rehydration in 2017 photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and internal co2 pressure decreased with water deficit increasing before and after rehydration fig 4 similarly transpiration rate decreased with water deficit increasing before rehydration except for the 50 fc treatment transpiration rate decreased only after rehydration after rehydration the transpiration rate for the control decreased by 38 while that for the 50 and 30 fc treatments increased by 38 1 and 101 9 respectively the wuei for the 50 and 30 fc treatments significantly increased by 48 1 and 37 7 before rehydration respectively compared with that for the control the wuei for the control after rehydration was the highest and the wuei for the 50 and 30 fc treatments decreased by 23 0 and 18 0 respectively compared with that for the control the effects of deficit irrigation treatments on the y ii before and after rehydration were non significant results of the photosynthesis rate in 2018 were similar to that in 2017 and the y ii remained stable in the two years however the stomatal conductance internal co2 pressure and transpiration rate for the 50 fc treatment before rehydration were the highest among the three treatments in 2018 3 3 13c content the determination of the 13c content was conducted in 2017 before rehydration the 13c content in taproot and petiole for the 30 fc treatment were the highest whereas the 13c content in leaf decreased with water deficit increasing table 3 the 13c content in taproot for the 30 and 50 fc treatments increased by 76 and 30 respectively compared with that for the control after rehydration the 13c content in taproot for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 37 16 and 4 respectively the 13c content in petiole for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 68 19 and 79 respectively and the 13c content in leaf for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 41 7 and 108 respectively compared with those before rehydration before rehydration the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot increased with water deficit increasing and that fixed by petiole and leaf decreased with water deficit increasing table 4 the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot for the 30 fc treatment were 29 2 and 4 6 more than that for the control and the 50 fc treatment before rehydration respectively after rehydration the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot for the 50 fc treatment was the higher than that for the other two treatments but the opposite trend was observed in that of petiole and leaf the percentage of 13c content fixed by sugar beet decreased with water deficit increasing 3 4 water use efficiency and the relationship between δ13c and water use efficiency the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the total dry matter for the 50 fc treatment were higher than those for the control and the 30 fc treatment in 2017 fig 5 the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the dry matter for the 50 fc treatment increased by 88 6 33 9 61 3 and 73 9 respectively compared with those for the control in 2017 and increased by 30 3 17 9 7 9 and 15 3 respectively compared with those for the control in 2018 the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the total dry matter for the 30 fc treatment increased by 27 7 7 22 1 and 21 9 respectively compared with those for the control in 2017 and increased by 20 0 68 4 11 9 and 17 6 respectively compared with those for the control in 2018 the correlations between δ13c of taproot petiole and leaf and wuey were negative fig 6 there was a significant negative correlation between leaf δ13c and wuey r2 0 3405 p 0 05 but the negative correlations between δ13c and wuey of taproot and petiole were not significant for different organs of sugar beet the correlation coefficient of taproot was the highest 0 0274 while that of leaf was the lowest 0 0165 4 discussion 4 1 dry matter and yield varying degrees of water deficit at different growth stages influenced the dry matter allocation in winter wheat and further the grain yield zhang et al 2012 for sugar beet the taproot is the main part for yield determination the leaf is the major source and sink organ of photosynthate and the petiole connects the taproot and leaf liu et al 2016 reported that moderate deficit irrigation treatment could improve dry matter translocation and mild deficit irrigation treatment improved the canopy structure thus increasing winter wheat yields however wang and wang 1994 showed that deficit irrigation treatment could not improve the allocation of photosynthate to grains hazrati et al 2017 reported that severe water deficit treatment inhibited plant growth and decreased leaf yield in this study varying degrees of water deficit induced different effects on dry matter accumulation moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased total dry matter by 4 3 p 0 5 while severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly decreased total dry matter by 35 1 compared with the control in 2017 moderate deficit irrigation treatment decreased total dry matter by 0 9 p 0 5 and severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly decreased total dry matter by 22 6 compared with the control in 2018 moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased sugar beet yield by 0 3 and 15 3 compared with the control in 2017 and 2018 respectively severe deficit irrigation treatment decreased yield by 25 7 and 20 3 compared with the control in 2017 and 2018 respectively dry matter allocation was different among the three treatments the amount and proportion of photosynthate allocated to taproot were the highest for moderate deficit irrigation treatment and were the lowest for severe deficit irrigation treatment the highest yield was observed under moderate deficit irrigation treatment and the lowest yield was observed under severe deficit irrigation treatment thus moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased dry matter accumulation and increased the dry matter allocated to taproot thereby increasing the yield chartzoulakis et al 1993 reported that water deficit increased the dry matter allocated to the root and the dry matter allocated to root increased with water deficit increasing but the total dry matter did not change this is not entirely consistent with our findings it maybe because sugar beet is a plant with a deep tuberous root system thus having complex responses to water deficit fabeiro et al 2003 4 2 plant photosynthesis and fluorescence the dry matter accumulation was associated with the changes in various parameters of photosynthesis because water deficit and rehydration clearly disturbed the natural course of photosynthesis of individual leaf ma et al 2015 reported that the deficit irrigation at different growth stages reduced photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance gs and transpiration and the reduce of photosynthesis rate was mainly due to the reduced stomatal conductance which reduced intercellular co2 concentration in this study the net photosynthesis rate continuously reduced with water deficit increasing before and after rehydration for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments but rehydration increased net photosynthesis rate this indicated that the reduced photosynthesis rate caused by the two degrees of water deficit can be recovered by rehydration the decrease of net photosynthesis rate before rehydration could be explained by the reduction in stomatal conductance due to the reduced co2 diffusion and internal co2 concentration which implied that the reduce of co2 concentration and water supply photosynthesis needs caused by water deficit was the cause of reduce in photosynthesis rate after rehydration stomatal conductance and internal co2 concentration were similar to those before rehydration however there was no significant difference between the control and moderate deficit irrigation treatment in transpiration rate only the transpiration rate for severe deficit irrigation treatment decreased in general transpiration rate showed a better resilience after water deficit than net photosynthesis rate internal co2 concentration and stomatal conductance miyashita et al 2005 found that water deficit reduced photosynthesis rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance but the speed of recovery of photosynthesis rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance after rehydration were different photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate recovered synchronously while stomatal conductance recovered relatively slowly miyashita et al 2005 held that this might be related to the change of leaf water potential caused by the decrease of soil water content our results were consistent with those of miyashita et al 2005 therefore the transpiration rate recovered quicker than stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate was mainly restricted by stomatal conductance which could also be proved by the effective quantum yield of photosynthesis because there was no significant difference in the effective quantum yield between the moderate and severe water deficit treatments and the control it indicated that moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments did not damage the photosynthetic pathways in other words moderate deficit irrigation could improve the photosynthetic characteristics of sugar beet which was consistent with the results of ali et al 2018 on wheat photosynthesis evaluation paves a way to determine the effect of water deficit on crop yield furthermore understanding the response of leaf to deficit irrigation or assessing the negative effect of water deficit serves to predict the extent to which plants can tolerate water deficit and the damages caused by water deficit vomáčka and pospíšilová 2003 reported that water deficit significantly decreased parameters of gas exchange but they started to recover soon after rehydration in agreement with the previous findings monti et al 2006 2010 our results also showed that the negative effect of transient water deficit on sugar beet growth was reversible 4 3 water use efficiency the wuei obtained by short term gas exchange measurement indicates the plant s ability to adapt to the arid environment in this study the wuei for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments significantly increased by 47 3 and 37 0 respectively compared with that for the control this indicated that the sugar beet under moderate and severe deficit treatments had stronger adaptability to the environment than the control which was an adaptive response to water deficit in sugar beet that can be explained by the fact that the high wuei of plants under water deficit are more susceptible to wilting than well watered plants and wilting invariably occurs only when the degree of water deficit is high ma et al 2015 only when water deficit is low plants lose less water with each carbon molecule fixed clover et al 2001 liu et al 2016 in general dry matter accumulation and water use of crops are closely related the relationship between cumulative water consumption and yield can be characterized by the wuey ehlers et al 2003 the increase of wuey under water deficit also have been reported by bloch et al 2006 and rytter 2005 our results affirmed their findings the average wuey of total dry matter for the control and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were 3 2 5 6 and 3 9 g m 3 respectively which was similar to the study results of hazrati et al 2017 who reported that the highest water use efficiency was observed in the 60 fc treatment the increase of wuey can be achieved through two ways one is to increase the dry matter accumulation and the other is to decrease the water use desantana et al 2015 this study showed that moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased dry matter accumulation but reduced water use while severe deficit irrigation treatment reduced dry matter accumulation and water consumption moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased wuey without yield loss which might because the stress memory effect enabled sugar beet to maintain vitality during water deficit leufen et al 2016 there are many studies on the relationship between δ13c and different organs of crops researchers agree that δ13c of different organs of crops can be used to compare the responses of crops to water deficit cui et al 2009 anyia et al 2007 showed that δ13c of barley had significant negative correlation with wuey bloch et al 2006 showed that there was a significant negative correlation between leaf δ13c and wue but the positive correlation between root δ13c and wue was insignificant our results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between δ13c and wuey in sugar beet leaf but the negative correlation between δ13c and wuey in taproot was insignificant which was different from the results of bloch et al 2006 the reason might be due to the different deficit irrigation methods and different growth stages cui et al 2009 the water deficit treatments were to maintain 100 50 and 20 water holding capacity in the study of bloch et al 2006 while 70 50 and 30 fc were employed in water deficit treatments in our study therefore even under different water deficit conditions leaf δ13c could be used as an effective indicator of wuey in sugar beet 4 4 13c distribution quantifying the flow of root deposited photosynthate is of great importance because of its profound influence on the nutrient supply for plant growth jessica et al 2003 dai et al 2007 reported that the relocation of photoassimilates from the above ground to root caused by the water uptake in a deeper soil layer of root under water deficit should be advantageous to maintain root growth and increase the tolerance to water deficit after rehydration one day lags occurred for the carbon fixation rate and export capacity to recover to the previous level in this study we found that more photoassimilates were allocated to taproot under moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments leaving less photoassimilates allocated to leaf and petiole after rehydration photoassimilates were mainly allocated to taproot for moderate deficit irrigation treatment by contrast the photoassimilates allocated to leaf for severe deficit irrigation treatment increased compared with that for moderate deficit irrigation treatment we found that all the three treatments increased the aboveground and underground dry matter concurrently moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased the underground dry matter based on the decrease of the aboveground dry matter severe deficit irrigation treatment increased the aboveground and underground dry matter uniformly therefore we found that moderate deficit irrigation treatment was conducive to the allocation of dry matter to taproot severe deficit irrigation treatment also increased the dry matter allocated to taproot but it significantly decreased the total amount of dry matter accumulated and seriously damaged sugar beet leaf rehydration promoted the flow of dry matter to leaf to decrease the damage to leaf kuzyakov and domanski 2000 found that on average 50 of plant assimilated c was transferred to the above ground in pasture plants of this 50 half 25 of total assimilated was remained in roots butler et al 2004 nevertheless we found that before rehydration sugar beet fixed 56 67 65 03 and 36 08 13co2 for the control and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments respectively and fixed 2 86 2 26 9 76 more than those before rehydration respectively after rehydration meanwhile 53 19 70 57 of the assimilated c was translocated to taproot 22 79 37 8 was translocated to leaf and 6 45 9 38 was translocated to petiole this may be due to the difference in the harvested organs between pasture plants and sugar beet the aboveground part is harvested for pasture plants while the taproot is harvested for sugar beet but the same thing they have is that they translocated most of their carbon to the organ that determines economic performance severe deficit irrigation treatment had the lowest percentage of 13c content fixed before and after rehydration which was consistent with the results of photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation this indicated that severe water deficit not only significantly decreased the photosynthetic rate of sugar beet but also disturbed the allocation rule of assimilates in sugar beet resulting in yield decrease 5 conclusions the dry matter accumulation yield photosynthetic characteristics water use efficiency and 13c allocation of sugar beet were found to be affected by different degrees of water deficit the negative effects of transient water deficit on growth were reversible moderate and severe water deficit increased sugar beet water use efficiency significantly moderate water deficit helps sugar beet increase drought tolerance and leaf photosynthesis rate after rehydration moderate water deficit also increased photosynthates allocated to taproot which finally increased yield severe water deficit decreased photosynthesis rate dry matter accumulation yield and percentage of fixed 13c content the major cause of the reduction of photosynthesis rate was the reduction of stomatal conductance thus the effect of water deficit on photosynthesis has to be attributed to co2 diffusion factors the wue for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were higher than that for the control the wue can be used as an indicator of high photosynthesis leaf δ13c could be used as an effective indicator of wue of sugar beet although the limiting factors were found in this research the reasons for limitations were still unclear therefore the future research can focus on the carbon metabolic pathways using molecular techniques acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 31771720 and 31660360

10917,deficit irrigation is commonly used to improve crop yields in arid land our study evaluated the response of physiology and yield of sugar beet beta vulgaris l cv beta 356 to deficit irrigation via applying three irrigation treatments 30 50 and 70 of field capacity fc during canopy development stage the results showed that deficit irrigation significantly increased the dry matter of sugar beet taproot the dry matter for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment 50 fc was more than that for the severe deficit irrigation treatment 30 fc only severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly reduced the yield of sugar beet photosynthetic parameters of sugar beet reduced with water deficit increasing however the moderate deficit irrigation treatment significantly increased instantaneous water use efficiency wuei and water use efficiency for yield wuey leaf 13c was negatively correlated with the wuey of sugar beet after rehydration more photosynthate was allocated to taproot for the moderate deficit irrigation treatment which increased the yield while more photosynthate was allocated to the aboveground part for the severe deficit irrigation treatment short term gas exchange measurement was used to indicate the dry matter accumulation and the result was used to formulate deficit irrigation management strategies for sugar beet abbreviations pn photosynthesis rate gs stomatal conductance e evaporation tr transpiration keywords sugar beet carbon isotope photosynthate allocation water use efficiency 1 introduction water deficit is a major factor decreasing crop production around the world tognetti et al 2003 monreal et al 2007 the estimated yield loss of sugar beets in central europe is 15 30 due to the insufﬁcient water supply shrestha et al 2010 study have shown that deﬁcit irrigation can save water and improve water use efficiency wue resolving the contradiction of water needs and supply in semi arid regions cui et al 2009 however haghverdi et al 2017 reported that deficit irrigation with 75 and 50 evapotranspiration caused 9 and 11 yield reduction of sugar beet respectively but fabeiro et al 2003 reported that deficit irrigation enabled to achieve high sugar beet yield with moderate water supply sugar beet is capable of growing an extensive root system to use water from deep soil layer when it is subjected to drought stress fabeiro et al 2003 thus understanding the response of sugar beet to water deficit has gained great attention as water resources for crop production have become more and more limited and more knowledge is needed to understand how deficit irrigation affects the growth and yield of sugar beet in different conditions photosynthesis playing an important role in crop production can be influenced by water deficit the growth restriction of crop caused by water deficit is always attributed to the changes in photosynthesis leaf area and photosynthate allocation chartzoulakis et al 1993 osório et al 1997 the decrease in photosynthesis rate for plants under water deficit can be attributed to a reduction in light interception as leaf expansion reduced or leaf senescence accelerated but it can also be attributed to the reduction in c fixation per unit leaf area as stomatal closure or photo oxidation bloch et al 2006 generally the severity of water deficit appears to be important in determining whether non stomatal factors affect photosynthesis as inhibition of mesophyll activity non stomatal inhibition of photosynthesis in addition to stomatal closure occurs only under severe or prolonged drought stress meanwhile monti et al 2010 reported that the decrease of photosynthesis rate caused by an early water deficit was irreversible however to what extent the photosynthesis rate is reversible after rehydration is still debatable understanding the response of photosynthesis to water deficit and rehydration is therefore strongly desirable for the cultivation of economically important crops including sugar beet therefore one of the main purposes of this study is to clarify how the photosynthesis of individual leaf of sugar beet responds to deficit irrigation and whether the negative effects caused by water deficit can change reversibly after rehydration and how deficit irrigation stimulates the mechanism that contributes to improve drought tolerance of crops influencing dry matter production and allocation bloch et al 2006 improvement of wue through deficit irrigation has been successfully affirmed in maize geerts and raes 2009 and wheat production ma et al 2015 the wue includes wuei at leaf level and wuey at individual or yield level cui et al 2009 the wuei photosynthesis rate transpiration rate is associated with the ability of a plant to absorb high concentration of carbon which implies that high wuei helps maintain high photosynthetic rate it can also limit water loss through controlling stomatal aperture and opening closing flexas et al 2013 de santana et al 2015 furthermore the wuei is strongly related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency which may be related to the irrigation wei et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation alternate partial root zone irrigation increased tomato wuei significantly compared with conventional irrigation improving wuey the ratio of dry matter produced to water used can potentially increase yield in water limited environments rajabi et al 2008 kisekka et al 2017 topak et al 2011 reported that sugar beet with drip irrigation at 75 of full irrigation had signiﬁcant beneﬁts in saving water and increasing wuey showing an obvious advantage of deﬁcit irrigation under limited water supply ma et al 2015 reported that the wuey increased under water deficit except under severe water deficit during the reviving jointing stage the wuei measured by gas exchange method can justify the short term responses to environmental factors of crops and the wuey can indicate plant productivity and physiological responses over a long growth period in addition there are different correlations between 13c and wuey in different organs of crop numerous studies have shown that there is a negative correlation between 13c and wuey in crop leaf anyia et al 2007 cabrera bosquet et al 2007 souza et al 2005 yin et al 2005 while some studies also have shown that there is a positive correlation between 13c and wuey andrea et al 2006 philippe et al 2005 2007 in short regardless of the correlation between them 13c provides important information for effective irrigation under different water conditions grattan et al 2006 therefore 13c is considered as a direct and effective index for evaluating crop water use efficiency under different water conditions however the relationship between 13c and wuey of sugar beet under regulated deficit drip irrigation is not clear generally water deficit influences the dry matter allocation more dry matter is allocated to root with water deficit increasing but the total amount is constant in grain crops photosynthate is transferred directly to grains or stored in vegetative parts that can contribute to grain yields and there is also a relocation of photosynthate which may reduce grain sedimentation and yield decrease caused by unfavorable conditions ma et al 2015 however the factors affecting sugar beet yield under water deficit remain unclear such as photosynthate allocation and transportation the purpose of this study was to 1 investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on dry matter accumulation water use efficiency photosynthetic characteristics 13c distribution of sugar beet and relationship between 13c and wuey 2 evaluate the effect of deficit irrigation on sugar beet yield under water deficit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and agronomic managements pot trials were conducted at agricultural college of shihezi university in xinjiang china in 2017 and 2018 fig 1 the climate is an arid continental climate with mean daily eto and precipitation of 4 8 mm and 0 8 mm respectively in order to obtain uniform plants after emergence seedlings were transplanted from paper tube to 75 l plastic pot 60 cm in height and 40 cm in diameter containing 80 kg of calcaric fluvisol soil table 1 sugar beets cv beta 356 were transplanted on 28th may in 2017 and on 9th may in 2018 and harvested on 20th november in2017 and on 1 st november in 2018 pots were placed outdoors when there was no rain and shelters were built when it rains to prevent rainwater from entering the pots each treatment had eight replications 2 2 deficit irrigation management sieved soil 80 kg 3 mm in diameter was filled into each pot 10 cm soil layer was filled each time 60 cm and irrigation was conducted to make the soil subside for 1 day fertilizers 5 kg organic fertilizers 10 g n 12 g p2o5 and 8 7 g k2so4 were applied to the top 20 cm soil layer without irrigation and subsidence soil water content in pots was 17 soil water content of the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers were determined and then the average value was calculated soil water capacity was 19 the method is same as the calculation method of soil water content soil saturated water content was 26 and dry soil weight in each pot was calculated to be 68 kg during the experiment irrigation amount was controlled by weighing daily and drip irrigation was employed three field capacity treatments were set up during canopy development stage 77 110 days in 2017 and 75 105 days in 2018 after transplantation which were 70 fc for the control group 50 fc for moderate deficit irrigation treatment and 30 fc for severe deficit irrigation treatment as canopy development stage finished normal irrigation 70 fc was applied until harvest during the deficit irrigation stage when the soil water content dropped to the lower limit of the target fc the pots were then irrigated to saturated water content during the normal irrigation stage the lower limit of target fc for all pots was 70 fc the amount of irrigation water applied to each pot was recorded and used to calculate total water consumption in this study the 70 fc treatment was used as the control on the one hand 70 fc was the most suitable soil water content for most crops chai et al 2016 on the other hand sugar beet was a drought resistant crop rytter 2005 therefore the 70 fc treatment was used as the control in this experiment and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were set up on this basis the soil weight of a pot corresponding to the target field capacity fc the dry soil weight in the pot the dry soil weight in the pot the target soil water content therefore the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 70 fc 68 68 19 0 7 76 8 kg the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 50 fc 68 68 19 0 5 74 8 kg and the soil weight of the pots corresponding to 30 fc 68 68 19 0 3 72 1 kg during the first rehydration the soil irrigated to the saturated water content of 26 and the soil weight for each pot was 85 7 kg then when the soil weight for the 70 fc treatment decreased to 76 8 kg 8 9 kg 85 7 76 8 water was irrigated when the soil weight for the 50 fc treatment decreased to 74 8 kg 10 9 kg 85 7 74 8 water was irrigated and when the soil weight for the 30 fc treatment decreased to 72 1 kg 13 6 kg 85 7 72 1 water was irrigated considering the increasing weight of sugar beet plants over time the linear relationship between the leaf number and the plant weight under different treatments was fitted fig 2 to simulate the plant weight in each pot the plant weight was subtracted during weighing in 2017 the total irrigation amounts during deficit irrigation stage for the 70 50 and 30 fc treatments were 0 0375 0 0225 and 0 02 m3 plant respectively and in 2018 the total irrigation amounts during deficit irrigation stage for the 70 50 and 30 fc treatments was 0 0445 0 0327 and 0 0272 m3 plant respectively the change of soil water content in 3 treatments during the growth period in 2018 was shown in fig 3 2 3 dry matter and yield dry matter was determined after the completion of isotope labeling in sugar beet yield was determined at the 177th d and the 180th d after transplantation in 2017 and 2018 respectively formula for yield calculation yield weight per plant plant number emergence rate the plant weight was the average value of five sugar beets the number of sugar beets was determined by the planting density of the experimental area xinjiang china and the seedling emergence rate was an average value of 5 years in xinjiang 80 2 4 measurements gas exchange parameters were determined before and after rehydration during water regulation the 70 fc treatment was irrigated 4 times the 50 fc treatment was irrigated 3 times and the 30 fc treatment was irrigated 2 times because of the inconsistency of rehydration time and times for the three treatments in order to avoid the errors caused by plant growth the closest rehydration time was chosen to determine gas exchange parameters i e the gas exchange parameters for the 70 fc treatment were determined before and after the third rehydration 10th august and 14th august those for the 50 fc treatment were determined before and after the second rehydration 19th august and 22th august and those for the 30 fc treatment were determined before and after the first rehydration 15th august and 19th august net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance intercellular co2 concentration and transpiration rate were determined on the upper surface of recent full

30 fc treatment significantly decreased by 35 1 and 22 6 in 2017 and 2018 respectively compared with that for the control and there was no significant difference between the 50 fc treatment and the control table 2 yield and the dry matter accumulation of taproot petiole and leaf for the 30 fc treatment decreased significantly compared with those for the control the 30 fc treatment significantly decreased taproot dry matter accumulation by 31 7 and 28 0 respectively while the 50 fc treatment increased taproot dry matter accumulation by 13 1 and 2 6 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared with the control the 30 fc treatment significantly decreased leaf dry matter accumulation by 35 1 and 18 0 respectively while the 50 fc treatment decreased leaf dry matter 3 1 and 6 8 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared with the control yield data for 2017 and 2018 showed that the yields for the control and 50 fc treatment were significantly higher than those for the 30 fc treatment but there was no significant difference between the control and the 50 fc treatment 3 2 gas exchange photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and internal co2 pressure after rehydration were higher than those before rehydration in 2017 photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and internal co2 pressure decreased with water deficit increasing before and after rehydration fig 4 similarly transpiration rate decreased with water deficit increasing before rehydration except for the 50 fc treatment transpiration rate decreased only after rehydration after rehydration the transpiration rate for the control decreased by 38 while that for the 50 and 30 fc treatments increased by 38 1 and 101 9 respectively the wuei for the 50 and 30 fc treatments significantly increased by 48 1 and 37 7 before rehydration respectively compared with that for the control the wuei for the control after rehydration was the highest and the wuei for the 50 and 30 fc treatments decreased by 23 0 and 18 0 respectively compared with that for the control the effects of deficit irrigation treatments on the y ii before and after rehydration were non significant results of the photosynthesis rate in 2018 were similar to that in 2017 and the y ii remained stable in the two years however the stomatal conductance internal co2 pressure and transpiration rate for the 50 fc treatment before rehydration were the highest among the three treatments in 2018 3 3 13c content the determination of the 13c content was conducted in 2017 before rehydration the 13c content in taproot and petiole for the 30 fc treatment were the highest whereas the 13c content in leaf decreased with water deficit increasing table 3 the 13c content in taproot for the 30 and 50 fc treatments increased by 76 and 30 respectively compared with that for the control after rehydration the 13c content in taproot for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 37 16 and 4 respectively the 13c content in petiole for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 68 19 and 79 respectively and the 13c content in leaf for the 30 fc and 50 fc treatments and the control increased by 41 7 and 108 respectively compared with those before rehydration before rehydration the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot increased with water deficit increasing and that fixed by petiole and leaf decreased with water deficit increasing table 4 the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot for the 30 fc treatment were 29 2 and 4 6 more than that for the control and the 50 fc treatment before rehydration respectively after rehydration the percentage of 13c content fixed by taproot for the 50 fc treatment was the higher than that for the other two treatments but the opposite trend was observed in that of petiole and leaf the percentage of 13c content fixed by sugar beet decreased with water deficit increasing 3 4 water use efficiency and the relationship between δ13c and water use efficiency the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the total dry matter for the 50 fc treatment were higher than those for the control and the 30 fc treatment in 2017 fig 5 the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the dry matter for the 50 fc treatment increased by 88 6 33 9 61 3 and 73 9 respectively compared with those for the control in 2017 and increased by 30 3 17 9 7 9 and 15 3 respectively compared with those for the control in 2018 the wuey of taproot petiole and leaf and the total dry matter for the 30 fc treatment increased by 27 7 7 22 1 and 21 9 respectively compared with those for the control in 2017 and increased by 20 0 68 4 11 9 and 17 6 respectively compared with those for the control in 2018 the correlations between δ13c of taproot petiole and leaf and wuey were negative fig 6 there was a significant negative correlation between leaf δ13c and wuey r2 0 3405 p 0 05 but the negative correlations between δ13c and wuey of taproot and petiole were not significant for different organs of sugar beet the correlation coefficient of taproot was the highest 0 0274 while that of leaf was the lowest 0 0165 4 discussion 4 1 dry matter and yield varying degrees of water deficit at different growth stages influenced the dry matter allocation in winter wheat and further the grain yield zhang et al 2012 for sugar beet the taproot is the main part for yield determination the leaf is the major source and sink organ of photosynthate and the petiole connects the taproot and leaf liu et al 2016 reported that moderate deficit irrigation treatment could improve dry matter translocation and mild deficit irrigation treatment improved the canopy structure thus increasing winter wheat yields however wang and wang 1994 showed that deficit irrigation treatment could not improve the allocation of photosynthate to grains hazrati et al 2017 reported that severe water deficit treatment inhibited plant growth and decreased leaf yield in this study varying degrees of water deficit induced different effects on dry matter accumulation moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased total dry matter by 4 3 p 0 5 while severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly decreased total dry matter by 35 1 compared with the control in 2017 moderate deficit irrigation treatment decreased total dry matter by 0 9 p 0 5 and severe deficit irrigation treatment significantly decreased total dry matter by 22 6 compared with the control in 2018 moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased sugar beet yield by 0 3 and 15 3 compared with the control in 2017 and 2018 respectively severe deficit irrigation treatment decreased yield by 25 7 and 20 3 compared with the control in 2017 and 2018 respectively dry matter allocation was different among the three treatments the amount and proportion of photosynthate allocated to taproot were the highest for moderate deficit irrigation treatment and were the lowest for severe deficit irrigation treatment the highest yield was observed under moderate deficit irrigation treatment and the lowest yield was observed under severe deficit irrigation treatment thus moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased dry matter accumulation and increased the dry matter allocated to taproot thereby increasing the yield chartzoulakis et al 1993 reported that water deficit increased the dry matter allocated to the root and the dry matter allocated to root increased with water deficit increasing but the total dry matter did not change this is not entirely consistent with our findings it maybe because sugar beet is a plant with a deep tuberous root system thus having complex responses to water deficit fabeiro et al 2003 4 2 plant photosynthesis and fluorescence the dry matter accumulation was associated with the changes in various parameters of photosynthesis because water deficit and rehydration clearly disturbed the natural course of photosynthesis of individual leaf ma et al 2015 reported that the deficit irrigation at different growth stages reduced photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance gs and transpiration and the reduce of photosynthesis rate was mainly due to the reduced stomatal conductance which reduced intercellular co2 concentration in this study the net photosynthesis rate continuously reduced with water deficit increasing before and after rehydration for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments but rehydration increased net photosynthesis rate this indicated that the reduced photosynthesis rate caused by the two degrees of water deficit can be recovered by rehydration the decrease of net photosynthesis rate before rehydration could be explained by the reduction in stomatal conductance due to the reduced co2 diffusion and internal co2 concentration which implied that the reduce of co2 concentration and water supply photosynthesis needs caused by water deficit was the cause of reduce in photosynthesis rate after rehydration stomatal conductance and internal co2 concentration were similar to those before rehydration however there was no significant difference between the control and moderate deficit irrigation treatment in transpiration rate only the transpiration rate for severe deficit irrigation treatment decreased in general transpiration rate showed a better resilience after water deficit than net photosynthesis rate internal co2 concentration and stomatal conductance miyashita et al 2005 found that water deficit reduced photosynthesis rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance but the speed of recovery of photosynthesis rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance after rehydration were different photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate recovered synchronously while stomatal conductance recovered relatively slowly miyashita et al 2005 held that this might be related to the change of leaf water potential caused by the decrease of soil water content our results were consistent with those of miyashita et al 2005 therefore the transpiration rate recovered quicker than stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate was mainly restricted by stomatal conductance which could also be proved by the effective quantum yield of photosynthesis because there was no significant difference in the effective quantum yield between the moderate and severe water deficit treatments and the control it indicated that moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments did not damage the photosynthetic pathways in other words moderate deficit irrigation could improve the photosynthetic characteristics of sugar beet which was consistent with the results of ali et al 2018 on wheat photosynthesis evaluation paves a way to determine the effect of water deficit on crop yield furthermore understanding the response of leaf to deficit irrigation or assessing the negative effect of water deficit serves to predict the extent to which plants can tolerate water deficit and the damages caused by water deficit vomáčka and pospíšilová 2003 reported that water deficit significantly decreased parameters of gas exchange but they started to recover soon after rehydration in agreement with the previous findings monti et al 2006 2010 our results also showed that the negative effect of transient water deficit on sugar beet growth was reversible 4 3 water use efficiency the wuei obtained by short term gas exchange measurement indicates the plant s ability to adapt to the arid environment in this study the wuei for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments significantly increased by 47 3 and 37 0 respectively compared with that for the control this indicated that the sugar beet under moderate and severe deficit treatments had stronger adaptability to the environment than the control which was an adaptive response to water deficit in sugar beet that can be explained by the fact that the high wuei of plants under water deficit are more susceptible to wilting than well watered plants and wilting invariably occurs only when the degree of water deficit is high ma et al 2015 only when water deficit is low plants lose less water with each carbon molecule fixed clover et al 2001 liu et al 2016 in general dry matter accumulation and water use of crops are closely related the relationship between cumulative water consumption and yield can be characterized by the wuey ehlers et al 2003 the increase of wuey under water deficit also have been reported by bloch et al 2006 and rytter 2005 our results affirmed their findings the average wuey of total dry matter for the control and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were 3 2 5 6 and 3 9 g m 3 respectively which was similar to the study results of hazrati et al 2017 who reported that the highest water use efficiency was observed in the 60 fc treatment the increase of wuey can be achieved through two ways one is to increase the dry matter accumulation and the other is to decrease the water use desantana et al 2015 this study showed that moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased dry matter accumulation but reduced water use while severe deficit irrigation treatment reduced dry matter accumulation and water consumption moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased wuey without yield loss which might because the stress memory effect enabled sugar beet to maintain vitality during water deficit leufen et al 2016 there are many studies on the relationship between δ13c and different organs of crops researchers agree that δ13c of different organs of crops can be used to compare the responses of crops to water deficit cui et al 2009 anyia et al 2007 showed that δ13c of barley had significant negative correlation with wuey bloch et al 2006 showed that there was a significant negative correlation between leaf δ13c and wue but the positive correlation between root δ13c and wue was insignificant our results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between δ13c and wuey in sugar beet leaf but the negative correlation between δ13c and wuey in taproot was insignificant which was different from the results of bloch et al 2006 the reason might be due to the different deficit irrigation methods and different growth stages cui et al 2009 the water deficit treatments were to maintain 100 50 and 20 water holding capacity in the study of bloch et al 2006 while 70 50 and 30 fc were employed in water deficit treatments in our study therefore even under different water deficit conditions leaf δ13c could be used as an effective indicator of wuey in sugar beet 4 4 13c distribution quantifying the flow of root deposited photosynthate is of great importance because of its profound influence on the nutrient supply for plant growth jessica et al 2003 dai et al 2007 reported that the relocation of photoassimilates from the above ground to root caused by the water uptake in a deeper soil layer of root under water deficit should be advantageous to maintain root growth and increase the tolerance to water deficit after rehydration one day lags occurred for the carbon fixation rate and export capacity to recover to the previous level in this study we found that more photoassimilates were allocated to taproot under moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments leaving less photoassimilates allocated to leaf and petiole after rehydration photoassimilates were mainly allocated to taproot for moderate deficit irrigation treatment by contrast the photoassimilates allocated to leaf for severe deficit irrigation treatment increased compared with that for moderate deficit irrigation treatment we found that all the three treatments increased the aboveground and underground dry matter concurrently moderate deficit irrigation treatment increased the underground dry matter based on the decrease of the aboveground dry matter severe deficit irrigation treatment increased the aboveground and underground dry matter uniformly therefore we found that moderate deficit irrigation treatment was conducive to the allocation of dry matter to taproot severe deficit irrigation treatment also increased the dry matter allocated to taproot but it significantly decreased the total amount of dry matter accumulated and seriously damaged sugar beet leaf rehydration promoted the flow of dry matter to leaf to decrease the damage to leaf kuzyakov and domanski 2000 found that on average 50 of plant assimilated c was transferred to the above ground in pasture plants of this 50 half 25 of total assimilated was remained in roots butler et al 2004 nevertheless we found that before rehydration sugar beet fixed 56 67 65 03 and 36 08 13co2 for the control and moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments respectively and fixed 2 86 2 26 9 76 more than those before rehydration respectively after rehydration meanwhile 53 19 70 57 of the assimilated c was translocated to taproot 22 79 37 8 was translocated to leaf and 6 45 9 38 was translocated to petiole this may be due to the difference in the harvested organs between pasture plants and sugar beet the aboveground part is harvested for pasture plants while the taproot is harvested for sugar beet but the same thing they have is that they translocated most of their carbon to the organ that determines economic performance severe deficit irrigation treatment had the lowest percentage of 13c content fixed before and after rehydration which was consistent with the results of photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation this indicated that severe water deficit not only significantly decreased the photosynthetic rate of sugar beet but also disturbed the allocation rule of assimilates in sugar beet resulting in yield decrease 5 conclusions the dry matter accumulation yield photosynthetic characteristics water use efficiency and 13c allocation of sugar beet were found to be affected by different degrees of water deficit the negative effects of transient water deficit on growth were reversible moderate and severe water deficit increased sugar beet water use efficiency significantly moderate water deficit helps sugar beet increase drought tolerance and leaf photosynthesis rate after rehydration moderate water deficit also increased photosynthates allocated to taproot which finally increased yield severe water deficit decreased photosynthesis rate dry matter accumulation yield and percentage of fixed 13c content the major cause of the reduction of photosynthesis rate was the reduction of stomatal conductance thus the effect of water deficit on photosynthesis has to be attributed to co2 diffusion factors the wue for moderate and severe deficit irrigation treatments were higher than that for the control the wue can be used as an indicator of high photosynthesis leaf δ13c could be used as an effective indicator of wue of sugar beet although the limiting factors were found in this research the reasons for limitations were still unclear therefore the future research can focus on the carbon metabolic pathways using molecular techniques acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 31771720 and 31660360

10918,spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and falker chlorophyll index fci are valuable tools for estimating crop yield however there remains a need to define the best phenological stages for the evaluation and identification of the indices critical limits to achieve better agricultural management practices we aimed to compare the level of accuracy in estimating grain and biomass yield of white oats avena sativa l as a function of ndvi and fci at four phenological stages and to define the critical limits of the two indices five experimental treatments were performed in four replicates each treatment received a different irrigation level 11 31 60 87 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration volume respectively the critical ranges of ndvi and fci were set when the relative grain yield was between 90 and 110 the mean ndvi and fci values in each plot were determined at four phenological stages which correlated to grain and biomass yield active sensors were used and the measured values were later used in regression analysis the grain and biomass yield of white oats can be estimated with high accuracy the ndvi presents greater accuracy of grain and biomass yield estimates of white oats than fci the critical ranges of the spectral indices for the average class of oat grain yield as a function of the ndvi were 0 71 0 77 0 66 0 73 and 0 63 0 71 for the phenological stages 8 10 and 10 5 4 respectively and of fci were 58 4 60 2 and 58 2 61 3 for phenological stages 10 and 10 5 4 respectively keywords avenasatival biomass yield chlorophyll meter grain yield ndvi phenological stage 1 introduction crop yield is commonly dependent of the conditions under which the plants were cultivated during the whole cycle grohs et al 2009 this creates a difficulty in estimating the potential yield of a crop during development since several of the events occurring from emergence to physiological maturity impact the plant cycle consequently altering the expected yield in this sense spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the falker chlorophyll index fci are being used to estimate crop yield saleem et al 2010 due to the relation between the reflectance spectra absorbance values and the physiological parameters of the plants wang et al 2012 both indices could be valuable in detecting the spatial yield variability due to their low cost high practicality sensor portability and non invasiveness ndvi can be measured using the greenseeker handheld device and the reading represents red band reflectance 650 nm and near infrared 770 nm values fci measured using the falker clorofilog 1030 chlorophyllometer is based on chlorophyll absorbance at three wavelengths two within the red band 635 and 660 nm and one at the near infrared 880 nm ndvi has an advantage over fci because its multispectral sensors can be coupled to drones automatically generating spatial variability whereas fci requires manual measurement of individual plant leaves the accuracy of the models generated from these indices is influenced by the phenological stages at which the measurements are collected bredemeier et al 2013 bolton and friedl 2013 requiring the correct identification of the appropriate phenological stage based on which the estimation models are later generated in addition the definition of the crop specific critical limits for these indices is of paramount importance as they result in low medium and high yield ranges which inform the establishment of phase specific management areas and in the recommendation of agricultural practices including fertilization and irrigation ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 vian et al 2018 the minimum and maximum critical indices have been associated with a relative production of 90 and 110 respectively vian et al 2018 however the parameters for ndvi and icf are unknown for some crops such as white oats avena sativa l which hinders the intensive use of these technologies the aim of this study is to compare the estimation accuracy of grain and biomass yield of white oat gy and by respectively as a function of the ndvi and fci spectral indices across four phenological stages and to define the critical limits of the two indices for crop productivity for each class 2 materials and methods the experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of the

raij et al 2001 white oat seeds of cultivar iac 7 at 95 germination were sown on may 2 2018 at a density of 80 kg ha 1 and 0 17 m spacing between rows the experimental field was a lie fallow since august 2017 where white oats were grown between may and august 2017 liming was performed 30 days prior to seeding at a rate of 1 5 t ha 1 limestone using prnt relative power of total neutralization equal to 80 fertilization at sowing was 20 kg ha 1 of n 160 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 160 kg ha 1 of k2o top dressing fertilization was carried out using n urea at 100 kg ha 1 and was divided over two rounds the first one in the stage of oat tiller 60 of the total amount and the second in the rubber phase 40 of the total amount an experimental design of the line source type was used this type of design allows for the distributing of irrigation water in variable application levels as the treatment moves away from the sprinkler center line lauer 1983 in the field test the fraction distribution of sprinkler precipitation was also defined fig 1 in this test collectors spaced 1 m apart were placed along the length of the sprinkler system in a line perpendicular to the irrigation line the test was performed in four replicates senninger model 3023 2 sprinklers and nozzles ¾ m 08qx05were used on the centerline and were spaced at 6 m intervals the sprinklers water application intensity was measured in the field obtaining a rate of 12 mm hour 1 the coefficient of application uniformity cuc and water distribution cud of the irrigation system were determined obtaining values equal to 89 and 84 respectively the treatments consisted of five irrigation levels l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 that received 11 31 60 87 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc respectively the treatments were distributed in a band block design experimental design with four replicates the experimental plots were 5 m long and 2 4 m wide with a total area of 240 m2 24 m 10 m the initial 0 50 m on each side of the plot was treated as borders irrigation management was carried out based on crop water demand according to the fao method which utilizes daily climatic data obtained from the automated agrometeorological station of fcav unesp reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated daily by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 evapotranspiration of white oat etc was calculated as the product of eto and the crop coefficients kc according to allen et al 1998 irrigation was performed whenever the soil water deficit was equal to 23 mm this depth was calculated as a function of crop coefficients kc and soil physical properties based on soil retention limits table 1 in order to define the evapotranspiration water depth a 0 40 m root depth and 50 soil water availability factor were used allen et al 1998 the average maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the mean temperature for the experimental period were 28 2 c 14 2 c and 20 6 c respectively fig 2 a the accumulated precipitation and etc for the oat cycle were 50 9 mm and 170 6 mm respectively fig 2b the irrigation depth for the treatment with 100 etc l5 was 140 mm with values varying in the same proportion of the water application rate for the other treatments the terrestrial sensor used to measure ndvi was the portable greenseeker handheldtm this sensor is active and automatically generates readings eq 1 based on the spectral response of the red 650 nm and near infrared 770 nm bands measurements with the greenseeker were performed manually by passing the sensor over the crops the readings in all treatments were obtained from a mean height of 0 5 to 0 8 m between the sensor and the target and were performed in 5 9 m2 9 8 m linear displacement on the experimental unit multiplied by the useful width of 0 6 m captured by the sensor averaging at 20 to 30 measurements for each plot and phenological stage 1 ndvi ρnir ρr ρnir ρr of which ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ρnir near infrared reflectance 770 nm ρr red reflectance 650 nm for the measurement of fci the falker clorofilog 1030 portable chlorophyll meter was used the chlorophyll index measured by this device is fci falker chlorophyll index which is a dimensionless index fci is proportional to values measured in the laboratory such as grams of chlorophyll per gram leaf however the proportionality varies according to the species in which it is measured fci was measured in five leaves per plot using flag leaf 1 fb 1 coelho et al 2018 one measurement was collected per leaf by pointing the reader at their center totaling in five readings per plot ndvi and fci readings were performed once on each of the three phenological stages rubbery 8 flag leaf sheath appearance 10 and kernel watery ripe 10 5 4 these stages are defined according to the phenology scale for winter cereals by feeks large large 1954 the stages correspond to days 42 55 and 71 after sowing das each of the four replicates of each treatment represents the mean value of the ndvi and fci readings correlated to grain and biomass yield of each plot for regression analysis models of first second and third degree equations were tested choosing the one with the best fit to verify the accuracy the grain yield gy was calculated by harvesting an area of 2 m2 in each plot grain moisture was standardized at 0 14 g g 1 of yield to obtain the biomass yield by a 0 5 m2 section of each useful plot was harvested and forced in a forced circulation oven at 65 c for 72 h to obtain the dry matter for by the grain yield was excluded to investigate the response ranges for the white oat yield indices an analysis following the method of vian et al 2018 was performed in this analysis ndvi and fci values were plotted as a function of the relative grain yield rgy for each of the phenological stage evaluated the rgy was calculated as a function of the average grain yield for the twenty plots and from these values three ranges of management zones were defined the critical ranges of ndvi and fci for definition of the low average or high yield potential classes were obtained through those indices lower than 90 between 90 and 110 and more than 110 of the rgy respectively the values 90 and 110 suggested by vian et al 2018 were well adjusted to the models found in the present study and therefore were adopted being that the probability of response was high up to 90 of rgy and low after 110 of rgy the models goodness of fit was evaluated by the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 cornell and berger 1987 root mean squared error rmse eq 2 and mean bias error mbe

stage the highest mean values of ndvi and fci were obtained at phenological stage 8 and 10 respectively the standard deviation and amplitude for ndvi were close for all stages for fci the variation between readings was lower for stage 8 compared to the others fig 3 presents the behavior of the spectral indices as a function of the treatments under the application of irrigation levels the measured fci values at phenological stage 8 could not be modeled as a function of the irrigation level fig 3b according to the regression model the maximum points of the irrigation level were higher as a function of the ndvi varying between 92 and 96 of the etc between the phenological stages than in function of the fci in which it varied between 82 and 87 of the etc the results of modeling the estimation of grain gy and biomass by yield as a function of the spectral indices for the phenological rubbery stage 8 are presented in fig 4 the models for fci were found to be insignificant whereas for the ndvi they presented significant r2 and probability values p 0 01 this indicates that it is not possible to model the grain and biomass yields of white oats as a function of fci at this phenological stage for the ndvi the precision of the models r2 for the estimation of the by and gy were of equal significance while the percentages of the error rmse in relation to the averages observed was higher for the estimation of biomass yield with value of 19 while for gy it was 13 for the phenological stage 10 all the models with ndvi and fci as predictors were significant at a probability level of 1 fig 5 in this case the model accuracy and the error percentage in relation to the mean were better for the estimation of the gy compared to that of by between the two indices using ndvi as a predictor resulted in higher accuracy and lower error compared to fci with accuracy of 9 and 18 higher and error 25 and 17 in the estimation of gy and by respectively for the phenological stage 10 5 4 all generated models were significant at a level of 1 fig 6 in this case the model accuracy and error percentage in relation to the average varied between the estimation of gy and by according to the index used fci was a more accurate predictor for gy compared to by while ndvi predicted both with equal accuracy between the two indices using ndvi as a predictor resulted in higher accuracy and lower error compared to fci with accuracy of 15 and 35 higher and error 24 and 35 lower than those obtained for the fci in the estimation of gy and by respectively from the models generated for the estimation of gy the three critical ranges yield response were defined from the spectral indices fig 7 for the phenological stage 8 no critical limit could be defined for fci since it could not be used to model the yield as shown in fig 7 for ndvi the minimum limit for the class of high decreased as the phenological stage advanced for fci the effect was the opposite since the minimum value for the class high was bigger for the phenological stage 10 5 4 in relation to 10 according to grohs et al 2011 the two indices presents lower spatial and interannual variability at the flowering stage of winter cereals thus the indices values for the phenological stage 10 5 4 are considered more accurate in evaluating gy classes this is confirmed by the precision of the models where the highest determination coefficient values are observed at the phenological stage 10 5 4 the spectral indices critical ranges for the average class of oat grain yield as a function of the ndvi were 0 71 0 77 0 66 0 73 and 0 63 0 71 in the phenological stages 8 10 and 10 5 4 respectively for fci these ranges were 58 4 60 2 and 58 2 61 3 for the phenological stages 10 and 10 5 4 respectively 4 discussion as spectral indices show a high correlation with crop yield bégué et al 2010 klem et al 2018 they can indirectly indicate the optimal irrigation level to be used for maximum yield assuming a mean maximum point between phenological stages as a function of ndvi 94 7 of etc and fci 84 6 of etc it was observed that a small water deficit can be tolerated by white oats without affecting crop yield fig 3 the difference between the optimal irrigation values for the two indices with fci correlating to lower values is probably due to the fact that a slight water deficit does not interfere with the nutrient and chlorophyll content in the leaves gonzalez dugo et al 2010 since fci indirectly measures leaf chlorophyll content no significant differences were observed in its values between treatments l3 l4 and l5 the maximum value on the curve representing irrigation level as a function of fci was closest to that applied in treatment l4 which was 87 of etc ndvi was shown to have a greater sensitivity to water deficit exhibiting direct correlation to irrigation level up to 95 of etc for winter cereals such as wheat and barley grohs et al 2009 reported the minimum critical index of ndvi for the class of high yield to be 0 75 at the sixth stage of leaf development in both crops a phenological stage corresponding to stage 8 in the present study according to the authors there were no differences between the two species the reported ndvi value is very close to that observed in the present study for phenological stage 8 and 10 confirming that for winter cereals the gy response rate as a function of ndvi is similar among different grain species establishing phenological stages and correlating them to yield based on the values of their spectral indices following the method of the present study can be used to define different management zones within an agricultural area a method that can be valid for different types of grain crops as the spectral indices indirectly present the physiological state of the crops irrigation management and nitrogen fertilization can be performed based on these indices for the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l for example the use of chlorophyll indices in the management of nitrogen fertilization indicated that the use of top dressing fertilization did not improve grain yield above that obtained by using the recommended standard fertilization rate maia et al 2017 a similar evaluation of the effect of variable fertilization rate on white oat yield could have been carried out at the present study using n top dressing during stage 8 day 42 however this would have produced suboptimal results as this type of management in white oats is recommended between phenological stages 4 5 day 25 35 silva et al 2016 since the highest accuracy in spectral index based definition of management zones occurs at more advanced phenological stages due to the lower variability in the values of those indices casa and castrignanò 2008 therefore this type of management is commonly utilized at later crop stages failing to model gy and by as a function of fci for stage 8 can be explained by the small variation in the index values during this stage as observed by the standard deviation and amplitude presented in table 3 that is for this stage fci failed to identify the treatment effect on yield despite accurately measuring the chlorophyll and nitrogen content in the leaves schlichting et al 2015 at this phenological stage white oats were still at an early developmental phase 42 das presenting a low demand for water and nutrients fig 2b compared to the more advanced stages therefore due to this low demand the small variation in fci values between treatments can be explained by the adequate provision of moisture and nutrients by the soil contrarily it was possible to model oat yield at this phenological stage 8 as a function of ndvi this occurs because in addition to the nutrition and chlorophyll in the leaves ndvi is also influenced by the leaf area index lai pateel et al 2017 yang et al 2017 a parameter that was not shown to impact fci values the described disparity of lai contribution to the two indices can be explained by the mode of measurement ndvi readings are carried out throughout the canopy whereas for the fci individual leaves are used some studies suggested that water deficiency does not lead to nutrient deficiency in leaves gonzalez dugo et al 2010 it was suggested however that it may cause a lower plant density in the case of winter cereals thus reducing lai li et al 2015 and consequently ndvi values therefore the standard deviation and amplitude was similar for ndvi distribution across table 3 for by estimation ndvi was a better predictor than fci regardless of the phenological stage as discussed earlier unlike ndvi fci is not sensitive to lai and since lai is affected by plant density and correlates directly with biomass accumulation chen et al 2011 ndvi becomes a more accurate predictor of by the same pattern of correlation was observed for gy as ndvi predicted gy levels more successfully and accurately across all phenological stages compared to fci therefore ndvi is a comprehensive index that is more sensitive to nutrient and chlorophyll leaf content as well as lai whereas fci is only superior in its sensitivity to leaf nutrient and chlorophyll content pateel et al 2017 saleem et al 2010 reported similar results to those of the current study when estimating wheat gy as a function of ndvi and fci where higher accuracy was observed in the ndvi generated model when comparing the evaluation stages our results show an equally accurate performance for the two indices as predictors of gy at the phenological stages 10 and 10 5 4 for by the prediction accuracy varied according to the stage index combination in the case of fci both the correlation accuracy r2 and error rmse were similar between stages 10 and 10 5 4 while for ndvi the highest accuracy for by estimation was observed at stage 10 5 4 kernel watery ripe generally studies have shown the prediction of crop gy and by to be more accurate at the advanced phenological stages notably during the reproductive stage liu and wiatrak 2011 bredemeier et al 2013 shaver et al 2011 the reason behind this patter is that the different measurements taken at the early stages usually do not reflect developmental differences because the plants water light and nutrients requirements are small and adequately fulfilled by the uniform access to light and the available soil moisture and nutrients thus the spectral indices cannot capture the difference between treatments due to the growth of the plants between treatments conversely at later phenological stages the plants light moisture and nutrition requirements increase leading to retarded growth where resources are scarcer which reflects in the indices values gonzalez dugo et al 2010 in addition index readings at the early developmental stages have the disadvantage of not capturing the impact of pest attacks and diseases as well as other biotic factors that reduce crop yield evaluating the correlation of chlorophyll indices and ndvi to the gy in maize liu and wiatrak 2011 and shaver et al 2011 observed higher correlation accuracy for ndvi at later phenological stages in accordance with our findings an additional advantage for using ndvi over fci in measuring cy is the methodical ease fci measurements are performed manually for individual leaves whereas for the ndvi multispectral sensors can be coupled in drones to automatically generate the spatial variability of the index over an area the identification of the best index stage combination for the evaluation of each crop is essential as it will facilitate the mapping of spatial yield variability presenting greater accuracy than simple field observations the resulting management plans will be more precise better tailored for each crop and will allow for increased resource optimization 5 conclusions the grains and biomass yield of white oats can be estimated with high accuracy using the spectral indices ndvi and fci for that purpose ndvi achieves greater accuracy compared to fci biomass yield in white oats could be estimated at a higher accuracy at the reproductive phenological stage acknowledgments the authors thank the the

10918,spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and falker chlorophyll index fci are valuable tools for estimating crop yield however there remains a need to define the best phenological stages for the evaluation and identification of the indices critical limits to achieve better agricultural management practices we aimed to compare the level of accuracy in estimating grain and biomass yield of white oats avena sativa l as a function of ndvi and fci at four phenological stages and to define the critical limits of the two indices five experimental treatments were performed in four replicates each treatment received a different irrigation level 11 31 60 87 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration volume respectively the critical ranges of ndvi and fci were set when the relative grain yield was between 90 and 110 the mean ndvi and fci values in each plot were determined at four phenological stages which correlated to grain and biomass yield active sensors were used and the measured values were later used in regression analysis the grain and biomass yield of white oats can be estimated with high accuracy the ndvi presents greater accuracy of grain and biomass yield estimates of white oats than fci the critical ranges of the spectral indices for the average class of oat grain yield as a function of the ndvi were 0 71 0 77 0 66 0 73 and 0 63 0 71 for the phenological stages 8 10 and 10 5 4 respectively and of fci were 58 4 60 2 and 58 2 61 3 for phenological stages 10 and 10 5 4 respectively keywords avenasatival biomass yield chlorophyll meter grain yield ndvi phenological stage 1 introduction crop yield is commonly dependent of the conditions under which the plants were cultivated during the whole cycle grohs et al 2009 this creates a difficulty in estimating the potential yield of a crop during development since several of the events occurring from emergence to physiological maturity impact the plant cycle consequently altering the expected yield in this sense spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the falker chlorophyll index fci are being used to estimate crop yield saleem et al 2010 due to the relation between the reflectance spectra absorbance values and the physiological parameters of the plants wang et al 2012 both indices could be valuable in detecting the spatial yield variability due to their low cost high practicality sensor portability and non invasiveness ndvi can be measured using the greenseeker handheld device and the reading represents red band reflectance 650 nm and near infrared 770 nm values fci measured using the falker clorofilog 1030 chlorophyllometer is based on chlorophyll absorbance at three wavelengths two within the red band 635 and 660 nm and one at the near infrared 880 nm ndvi has an advantage over fci because its multispectral sensors can be coupled to drones automatically generating spatial variability whereas fci requires manual measurement of individual plant leaves the accuracy of the models generated from these indices is influenced by the phenological stages at which the measurements are collected bredemeier et al 2013 bolton and friedl 2013 requiring the correct identification of the appropriate phenological stage based on which the estimation models are later generated in addition the definition of the crop specific critical limits for these indices is of paramount importance as they result in low medium and high yield ranges which inform the establishment of phase specific management areas and in the recommendation of agricultural practices including fertilization and irrigation ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 vian et al 2018 the minimum and maximum critical indices have been associated with a relative production of 90 and 110 respectively vian et al 2018 however the parameters for ndvi and icf are unknown for some crops such as white oats avena sativa l which hinders the intensive use of these technologies the aim of this study is to compare the estimation accuracy of grain and biomass yield of white oat gy and by respectively as a function of the ndvi and fci spectral indices across four phenological stages and to define the critical limits of the two indices for crop productivity for each class 2 materials and methods the experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of the

raij et al 2001 white oat seeds of cultivar iac 7 at 95 germination were sown on may 2 2018 at a density of 80 kg ha 1 and 0 17 m spacing between rows the experimental field was a lie fallow since august 2017 where white oats were grown between may and august 2017 liming was performed 30 days prior to seeding at a rate of 1 5 t ha 1 limestone using prnt relative power of total neutralization equal to 80 fertilization at sowing was 20 kg ha 1 of n 160 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 160 kg ha 1 of k2o top dressing fertilization was carried out using n urea at 100 kg ha 1 and was divided over two rounds the first one in the stage of oat tiller 60 of the total amount and the second in the rubber phase 40 of the total amount an experimental design of the line source type was used this type of design allows for the distributing of irrigation water in variable application levels as the treatment moves away from the sprinkler center line lauer 1983 in the field test the fraction distribution of sprinkler precipitation was also defined fig 1 in this test collectors spaced 1 m apart were placed along the length of the sprinkler system in a line perpendicular to the irrigation line the test was performed in four replicates senninger model 3023 2 sprinklers and nozzles ¾ m 08qx05were used on the centerline and were spaced at 6 m intervals the sprinklers water application intensity was measured in the field obtaining a rate of 12 mm hour 1 the coefficient of application uniformity cuc and water distribution cud of the irrigation system were determined obtaining values equal to 89

in a band block design experimental design with four replicates the experimental plots were 5 m long and 2 4 m wide with a total area of 240 m2 24 m 10 m the initial 0 50 m on each side of the plot

station of fcav unesp reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated daily by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 evapotranspiration of white oat etc was calculated as the product of eto and the crop coefficients kc according to allen et al 1998 irrigation was performed whenever the soil water deficit was equal to 23 mm this depth was calculated as a function of crop coefficients kc and soil physical properties based on soil retention limits table 1 in order to define the evapotranspiration water depth a 0 40 m root depth and 50 soil water availability factor were used allen et al 1998 the average maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the mean temperature for the experimental period were 28 2 c 14 2 c and 20 6 c respectively fig 2 a the accumulated precipitation and etc for the oat cycle were 50 9 mm and 170 6 mm respectively fig 2b the irrigation depth for the treatment with 100 etc l5 was 140 mm with values varying in the same proportion of the water application rate for the other treatments the terrestrial sensor used to measure ndvi was the portable greenseeker handheldtm this sensor is active and automatically generates readings eq 1 based on the spectral response of the red 650 nm and near infrared 770 nm bands measurements with the greenseeker were performed manually by passing the sensor over the crops the readings in all treatments were obtained from a mean height of 0 5 to 0 8 m between the sensor and the target and were performed in 5 9 m2 9 8 m linear displacement on the experimental unit multiplied by the useful width of 0 6 m captured by the sensor averaging at 20 to 30 measurements for each plot and phenological stage 1 ndvi ρnir ρr ρnir ρr of which ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ρnir near infrared reflectance 770 nm ρr red reflectance 650 nm for the measurement of fci the falker clorofilog 1030 portable chlorophyll meter was used the chlorophyll index measured by this device is fci falker chlorophyll index which is a dimensionless index fci is proportional to values measured in the laboratory such as grams of chlorophyll per gram leaf however the proportionality varies according to the species in which it is measured fci was measured in five leaves per plot using flag leaf 1 fb 1 coelho et al 2018 one measurement was collected per leaf by pointing the reader at their center totaling in five readings per plot ndvi and fci readings were performed once on each of the three phenological stages rubbery 8 flag leaf sheath appearance 10 and kernel watery ripe 10 5 4 these stages are defined according to the phenology scale for winter cereals by feeks large large 1954 the stages correspond to days 42 55 and 71 after sowing das each of the four replicates of each treatment represents the mean value of the ndvi and fci readings correlated to grain and biomass yield of each plot for regression analysis models of first second and third degree equations were tested choosing the one with the best fit to verify the accuracy the grain yield gy was calculated by harvesting an area of 2 m2 in each plot grain moisture was standardized at 0 14 g g 1 of yield to obtain the biomass yield by a 0 5 m2 section of each useful plot was harvested and forced in a forced circulation oven at 65 c for 72 h to obtain the dry matter for by the grain yield was excluded to investigate the response ranges for the white oat yield indices an analysis following the method of vian et al 2018 was performed in this analysis ndvi and fci values were plotted as a function of the relative grain yield rgy for each of the phenological stage evaluated the rgy was calculated as a function of the average grain yield for the twenty plots and from these values three ranges of management zones were defined the critical ranges of ndvi and fci for definition of the low average or high yield potential classes were obtained through those indices lower than 90 between 90 and 110 and more than 110 of the rgy respectively the values 90 and 110 suggested by vian et al 2018 were well adjusted to the models found in the present study and therefore were adopted being that the probability of response was high up to 90 of rgy and low after 110 of rgy the models goodness of fit was evaluated by the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 cornell and berger 1987 root mean squared error rmse eq 2 and mean bias error mbe

stage the highest mean values of ndvi and fci were obtained at phenological stage 8 and 10 respectively the standard deviation and amplitude for ndvi were close for all stages for fci the variation between readings was lower for stage 8 compared to the others fig 3 presents the behavior of the spectral indices as a function of the treatments under the application of irrigation levels the measured fci values at phenological stage 8 could not be modeled as a function of the irrigation level fig 3b according to the regression model the maximum points of the irrigation level were higher as a function of the ndvi varying between 92 and 96 of the etc between the phenological stages than in function of the fci in which it varied between 82 and 87 of the etc the results of modeling the estimation of grain gy and biomass by yield as a function of the spectral indices for the phenological rubbery stage 8 are presented in fig 4 the models for fci were found to be insignificant whereas for the ndvi they presented significant r2 and probability values p 0 01 this indicates that it is not possible to model the grain and biomass yields of white oats as a function of fci at this phenological stage for the ndvi the precision of the models r2 for the estimation of the by and gy were of equal significance while the percentages of the error rmse in relation to the averages observed was higher for the estimation of biomass yield with value of 19 while for gy it was 13 for the phenological stage 10 all the models with ndvi and fci as predictors were significant at a probability level of 1 fig 5 in this case the model accuracy and the error percentage in relation to the mean were better for the estimation of the gy compared to that of by between the two indices using ndvi as a predictor resulted in higher accuracy and lower error compared to fci with accuracy of 9 and 18 higher and error 25 and 17 in the estimation of gy and by respectively for the phenological stage 10 5 4 all generated models were significant at a level of 1 fig 6 in this case the model accuracy and error percentage in relation to the average varied between the estimation of gy and by according to the index used fci was a more accurate predictor for gy compared to by while ndvi predicted both with equal accuracy between the two indices using ndvi as a predictor resulted in higher accuracy and lower error compared to fci with accuracy of 15 and 35 higher and error 24 and 35 lower than those obtained for the fci in the estimation of gy and by respectively from the models generated for the estimation of gy the three critical ranges yield response were defined from the spectral indices fig 7 for the phenological stage 8 no critical limit could be defined for fci since it could not be used to model the yield as shown in fig 7 for ndvi the minimum limit for the class of high decreased as the phenological stage advanced for fci the effect was the opposite since the minimum value for the class high was bigger for the phenological stage 10 5 4 in relation to 10 according to grohs et al 2011 the two indices presents lower spatial and interannual variability at the flowering stage of winter cereals thus the indices values for the phenological stage 10 5 4 are considered more accurate in evaluating gy classes this is confirmed by the precision of the models where the highest determination coefficient values are observed at the phenological stage 10 5 4 the spectral indices critical ranges for the average class of oat grain yield as a function of the ndvi were 0 71 0 77 0 66 0 73 and 0 63 0 71 in the phenological stages 8 10 and 10 5 4 respectively for fci these ranges were 58 4 60 2 and 58 2 61 3 for the phenological stages 10 and 10 5 4 respectively 4 discussion as spectral indices show a high correlation with crop yield bégué et al 2010 klem et al 2018 they can indirectly indicate the optimal irrigation level to be used for maximum yield assuming a mean maximum point between phenological stages as a function of ndvi 94 7 of etc and fci 84 6 of etc it was observed that a small water deficit can be tolerated by white oats without affecting crop yield fig 3 the difference between the optimal irrigation values for the two indices with fci correlating to lower values is probably due to the fact that a slight water deficit does not interfere with the nutrient and chlorophyll content in the leaves gonzalez dugo et al 2010 since fci indirectly measures leaf chlorophyll content no significant differences were observed in its values between treatments l3 l4 and l5 the maximum value on the curve representing irrigation level as a function of fci was closest to that applied in treatment l4 which was 87 of etc ndvi was shown to have a greater sensitivity to water deficit exhibiting direct correlation to irrigation level up to 95 of etc for winter cereals such as wheat and barley grohs et al 2009 reported the minimum critical index of ndvi for the class of high yield to be 0 75 at the sixth stage of leaf development in both crops a phenological stage corresponding to stage 8 in the present study according to the authors there were no differences between the two species the reported ndvi value is very close to that observed in the present study for phenological stage 8 and 10 confirming that for winter cereals

have been tested for cotton production in the thp under field conditions these strategies included irrigation scheduling based on time temperature threshold ttt crop evapotranspiration demand and soil

patented as biologically identified optimal temperature interactive console biotic upchurch et al 1996 recommends irrigation based on two thresholds of time and temperature when the time accumulated above a specific canopy temperature on a given day exceeds the threshold value it indicates a temperature stress and the need for irrigation as the time threshold increases average daily stress time increases wanjura et al 2003 indicated a negative relationship between daily stress times and lint yield or irrigation water use when compared to other irrigation strategies yield and water use efficiency obtained from the ttt controlled irrigation are as good as or greater than those obtained under other efficient irrigation scheduling methods such as neutron probe measured soil water

results from field experiments could provide more insights into yield irrigation water use relationships which is essential for developing water conserving management practices crop growth models such as the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat allow researchers to conduct several hypothetical irrigation experiments rapidly and inexpensively facilitating the development and evaluation of water use efficient strategies dssat is a process based model hoogenboom et al 2015 that uses meteorological soil and crop management data to predict the growth and development of a particular crop in a set location dssat has over 42 crop modules each of which is designed to mimic the behavior of a specific crop the cropgro cotton jones et al 2003 module in the dssat cropping system model csm was used in this study although previous research has addressed the evaluation of csm cropgro cotton model for the thp kothari et al 2019 adhikari et al 2016 limited in season crop data mainly related to the dates of onset of different phenological stages were used for model evaluation in those studies crop growth and development are important aspects of dssat model evaluation as the model is designed to simulate crop growth and they are overlooked when evaluating the model solely with yield data evaluation of dssat cropgro cotton model using phenological stages in season crop growth and development data and crop yield has been attempted by modala et al 2015 in the texas rolling plains region which neighbors the thp measured in season data used for model evaluation in the modala et al 2015 study include the canopy height number of nodes and leaf area index however such a detailed evaluation of the csm cropgro cotton model was lacking for the thp region the objectives of this research were therefore to 1 evaluate the dssat csm cropgro cotton model for the thp region using measured data on in season canopy height and biomass and seed cotton yield from a field experiment and 2 use the evaluated model to determine the lowest irrigation amount that can be applied to maximize yield under four irrigation strategies implemented in the field study and identify the most efficient irrigation strategy for maximizing yield 2 methodology materials 2 1 field methods cotton cultivar deltapine 444 seeds were planted at the lubbock tx usda ars nursery 33 35 38 2 n 101 53 59 9 w on day of year doy 154 in 2008 seeds were planted 3 75 cm 1 5 deep at 16 15 875 seeds meter into east west oriented raised beds spaced at 1 m 40 an initial 51 mm 2 subsurface irrigation was delivered to all plots two weeks before planting and an additional 51 mm furrow irrigation was delivered to all plots 9 days after planting dap this was done to bring all plots to field capacity at the beginning of the experiment and to insure even emergence and an even stand these efforts resulted in a population density of 159 000 plants hectare no further irrigations were applied to the dryland treatment which received water only from precipitation events stout 2018 the soil at the location is an amarillo fine sandy loam fine loamy mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustalfs irrigation was provided by subsurface drip irrigation sdi with drip tapes laid 35 cm deep parallel to the beds and spaced at 1 m the field was divided into seven sdi zones consisting of 8 rows each each irrigation zone was sub divided into three plots east middle and west irrigation was driven by ttt calculated et or daily irrigation di treatments that delivered daily irrigation events simulating reduced well capacities typical of the region table 1 the ttt treatments were controlled on a daily time step by the biotic wanjura et al 2006 approach canopy temperature was measured with infrared thermometers at 6 s intervals and 15 min averages were computed a 5 mm irrigation was then triggered using either a 5 5 h or 7 5 h time threshold above 28 c in all treatments a simple rain subroutine substituted scheduled irrigation with adequate rain the et treatments replaced either 60 or 100 of the estimated water lost thermal units were calculated as growing degree days using the average daily maximal and minimal air temperatures recorded at the onsite 33 35 38 1 n 101 54 03 6 w weather station stout 2018 subtracting a 15 6 c 60 f base temperature wanjura and supak 1985 and letting accumulated thermal units equal zero when average temperatures were below the base temperature accumulated heat units were used to drive a model young et al 1980 grimes and el zik 1990 to calculate the crop coefficient kc of a cotton crop allowed to develop under the absence of water stress in daily time steps the standardized reference crop evapotranspiration et0 for short crops allen et al 2005 was obtained from the texas tech mesonet schroeder et al 2005 data for calculation of et0 were taken from the station lubbock 3wnw ttu located about 1 km ne of the experimental plots within the texas tech university ttu natural resources management rangeland research station 33 36 14 7 n 101 53 57 1 w the calculated potential evapotranspiration pet of the developing crop was expressed as the product of et0 and kc in daily time steps grimes and el zik 1990 vegetation samples were taken from only the middle two rows of each zone to avoid interference from the neighboring zones irrigation regimes to collect a canopy height record a meter stick was held at the soil line and the measure from base to terminal was recorded in centimeters to the nearest tenth the average value was calculated from the 6 8 measurements taken on each of 21 monitored days spaced throughout the growing season to collect a plant biomass record plants were harvested and oven dried at 60 65 for a minimum of 48 h the dry weight of the plant was recorded at various growth stages the average biomass was calculated for the measurements taken on each of the monitored days spaced throughout the growing season for comparison with the dssat output it was necessary to combine the leaf stem and boll dry weights into a total plant biomass yield was measured as the combined seed and lint weight from two meters of hand harvest the average of the three samples collected from each zone was calculated 2 2 model inputs weather data were taken from the on site meteorological tower stout 2018 daily precipitation wind speed average relative humidity minimum temperature maximum temperature solar radiation and pan evaporation data were input to the model information for three days in total was missing from this data set so supplementary precipitation temperature solar radiation and wind speed data were retrieved from the lubbock 3wnw ttu weather station which is part of the west texas mesonet west texas mesonet 2008 and located less than 1 2 km from the experimental field 33 36 14 8 n 101 53 57 1 solar radiation daily averages for doy 10 through doy 144 were also replaced a summary of the most critical weather factors for the months of june through september in 2008 is shown in table 2 soil profile information was not available for the experimental field so a profile table 3 was developed based on the soil type amarillo fine sandy loam the soil horizon designation slmh saturated hydraulic conductivity ssks bulk density sbdm organic carbon percentage sloc clay percentage slcl silt percentage slsi ph by water extraction slhw and cation exchange capacity scec were obtained and calculated from national cooperative soil survey data accessed through soilweb an online application maintained by the california soil resource lab at the university of california davis the lower limit of extractable water slll drained upper limit sdul saturated upper limit ssat were approximated as the water retained at 15 bar and 0 33 bar and effective porosity respectively based on the soil texture for each layer as calculated by rawls et al 1982 the calculated plant available water capacity for the 2 1 m soil profile from these approximations was 0 226 m the munsell soil color of 7 5yr ncss 2016 corresponded to a value of 0 13 for the albedo ratio gijsman et al 2007 while the soil was classified as well drained ncss 2019 a more conservative drainage rate of 0 4 was used gijsman et al 2007 the soil was categorized as hydrologic group b ncss 2019 which corresponds to a runoff curve number of 78 for straight row cultivated agricultural land in good condition nrcs 1986 the daily irrigation water delivered to each treatment as described in the preceding section was used as an input to the dssat model the crop management related model inputs were also decided based on the actual practices followed in the field experiment 2 3 model evaluation the calibration methodology adopted in the present study was partly based on adhikari et al 2016 who evaluated csm cropgro cotton for the thp by comparing the simulated dates of onset of phenological stages of emergence anthesis and maturity as well as seed cotton yield the testing ranges and resulting variables used in the adhikari et al 2016 study served as guidelines for many of the variable testing ranges used to perform this detailed thp evaluation an adjustment of dssat simulated growth stages to comparable phenological stages from the field experiment and other sources kerns et al 2008 deterling and el zik 1982 was conducted prior to the calibration of parameters related to crop development and yield the ecotype parameters for time from planting to emergence pl em and time from planting to first leaf em v1 as well as the cultivar parameter for time from emergence to flower appearance em fl were all modified and set before continuing with the crop development yield calibration throughout calibration the growth stages were monitored to ensure that they remained within the documented ranges from literature the model was calibrated by comparing the experimental results of the high water treatments including ttt 5 5 h et 100 and di 4 mm to the model results for plant height and biomass throughout the season as well as the final yield with complete data only available for the year of 2008 the application of many widely used statistical calibration indicators was limited by the lack of sequential data so calibration efforts were primarily directed by the minimization of two error indicators mean absolute percentage error mape eq 1 and percentage root mean square error prmse eq 2 with a target of 20 or lower mape in the case of yield comparisons an absolute percent error ape eq 3 was used to more clearly portray a single point comparison for each of the canopy height and biomass comparisons a coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 was calculated the formulae used for estimating model performance statistics were 1 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y m i y s i y m i 2 p r m s e i 1 n y s i y m i 2 n 100 n i 1 n y m i 3 a p e y m i y s i y m i 4 r 2 i 1 n y m

of samples eleven cultivar parameters and three ecotype parameters in dssat were individually adjusted across a testing range for each iteration table 4 the testing range was chosen based on previous studies adhikari et al 2016 pathak et al 2007 thorp et al 2014 and observation of values for other preexisting cultivars in dssat the parameter adjustment was done in a systematic fashion finalizing the value of the first parameter and continuing to the next in the listed order until all variables were finalized iterations were performed with the goal of identifying the value which minimized error in plant height biomass and yield predictions the simulated growth stages were compared with the corresponding observed occurrences and acceptable date ranges for cotton grown in the same region as a final check to ensure that the values are reasonable once an ideal combination of variable values was identified the accuracy of the calibrated model was verified by comparing the simulated values for the deficit irrigation plots ttt 7 5 h et 60 di 2 mm and dryland against the experimental values which were not used during calibration this was completed using the same error indicators employed in the calibration comparisons mape and prmse with a target of 20 or lower mape 2 4 irrigation scenario comparison after successful evaluation of the model it was used as a tool to determine the best water use efficient irrigation strategy using the four unique irrigation strategies from the field study ttt 5 5 h ttt 7 5 h di and et replacement various scenarios representing different well capacities were developed by holding irrigation timing constant and varying the amount of water applied incrementally for each irrigation event this comparison among irrigation scenarios was made for the year 2018 as the continuously measured canopy temperature data was available for that year only long term simulations could not be run due to the lack of the canopy temperature data and this prevented the assessment of the effects of interannual variability on simulated irrigation scenarios the yield trend for each strategy was evaluated to determine whether the yield had reached a stable maximum value if not the range was extended the final ranges tested were in 0 5 mm increments from 2 0 to 8 0 mm for ttt 5 5 h from 2 0 to 15 0 mm for ttt 7 5 h and from 2 0 to 6 0 mm for di and 5 increments from 50 to 100 for the et replacement strategy the maximum yield threshold was determined to be the yield beyond which no substantial increase greater than 1 in yield was achieved with additional application of irrigation water simulations were designed to represent consistent initial conditions those of zone 41 in the field study irrigation was scheduled exactly as it was recorded in the field study which did not supply water during days on which rainfall override was triggered by a sensed precipitation event the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated using eq 5 for each simulation in the testing range eq 5 is a modification of similar equations to better suit the experiment circumstances howell 2003 comparisons were made against a baseline scenario which used the same initial conditions as the other simulations in the testing range the irrigation schedule for the baseline scenario was modelled after that of the dryland zone in the field experiments 5

accordance with the methodology the parameter rhght was initially adjusted to get a suitable match between observed and simulated canopy height and parameters xfrt thrsh podur sfdur and lngsh were then adjusted during the seed cotton yield calibration at the end of the systematic calibration process for the fourteen adjusted parameters the values which produced the minimum error were recorded as final table 4 3 1 1 phenological stage calibration a reasonable match between the timing of emergence and flowering simulated by dssat and the dates recorded for the onset of those growth stages from the field study was found table 5 the stages for all of the simulations fell within an acceptable range for cotton grown in the thp region this was achieved by setting pl em to 3 em v1 to 5 and em fl to 38 prior to continuing with the yield calibration during the calibration it was deemed necessary to cap the upper limit of the testing range for sd pm at the value remaining after subtracting fl sd from 51 to maintain a physiological maturity date within the targeted range the dates for emergence and flowering that were recorded in the field study came sooner than the corresponding mean dates from literature deterling and el zik 1982 kerns et al 2008 this was attributed to the early maturity of the deltapine 444 cultivar 3 1 2 biomass calibration the individual biomass graphs for each treatment are shown in fig 1 in general the measured and simulated data were in agreement up until approximately 113 days after planting dap in the subsequent days it is presumed that the natural progression of senescence was not reflected as strongly in the simulated biomass data this difference is particularly prominent in the di 4 mm treatment model performance in biomass prediction for the calibration treatments was good as indicated by an average mape of 17 1 prmse of 26 2 and r2 of 0 89 table 6 3 1 3 canopy height calibration canopy height data were only collected for two of the calibration treatments ttt 5 5 h and et 100 fig 2 while the model underpredicted canopy height in case of ttt 5 5 h treatment it slightly overpredicted canopy height for the et 100 treatment the resulting mape prmse and coefficient of determination are shown in table 7 the average mape prmse and r2 during canopy height calibration were 14 7 15 0 and 0 82 respectively the r2 value was not as high as some values achieved for calibration treatments in literature modala et al 2015 but it was still reasonably close to unity the underprediction of biomass and canopy height for ttt 5 5 h treatment could be due to the use of air temperature instead of canopy temperature for simulating crop development in dssat thorp et al 2014 the design of ttt 5 5 h likely helped in maintaining canopy temperature cooler than the air temperature and lowered stress levels however due to the use of air temperature a higher stress might have been simulated for the ttt 5 5 h irrigation treatment resulting in lower biomass and canopy height 3 1 4 yield calibration simulated and measured seed cotton yields are presented in table 8 since the yield measurement was only taken once in the season the absolute percentage error for each strategy was also listed in addition to the mape simulated and measured seed cotton yields matched closely during calibration as indicated by very low ape and mape values 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 biomass evaluation simulated and measured biomasses for each of the evaluation treatments matched fairly well except at few growth stages fig 3 the differences between measured and simulated biomass could be due to the limitation of the model in accounting for all biotic and abiotic stresses in addition minor differences in irrigation application likely did not trigger substantial model response thorp et al 2014 model performance statistics obtained during the evaluation average mape of 14 3 prmse of 20 2 and r2 of 0 91 were better than those obtained during the model calibration table 6 3 2 2 canopy height evaluation as was the case for calibration canopy height data were only available for two of the evaluation treatments ttt 7 5 h and dryland a good match between the simulated and measured canopy height was found for each evaluation treatment fig 4 the model performance in canopy height prediction for evaluation treatments was much better when compared to calibration treatments as indicated by substantially lower mape prmse values and higher coefficient of determination values average mape prmse and r2 were 8 9 8 7 and 0 82 respectively table 7 3 2 3 yield evaluation table 8 shows the results from the yield comparisons for the evaluation treatments as was practiced for the calibration results the absolute percentage error for each strategy was listed in addition to the mape the ape values for evaluation treatments especially the drier treatments were higher than those achieved in calibration and exceeded those reported in similar studies which generally ranged from 1 to 9 adhikari et al 2016 modala et al 2015 despite this the mape for the evaluation treatments remained below 20 at 16 2 3 3 irrigation scenario comparison in the present study field data provided many opportunities for a robust evaluation of the cropgro cotton model for the thp by comparing the experimental crop with the modelled crop using in season data canopy height and biomass at different crop growth stages and crop yield for seven irrigation scheduling strategies were used to evaluate the model with the comparison of in season crop growth and development in addition to the end of season crop yield the evaluated model serves as a more accurate reflection of what happens in the field throughout the cotton growing season the simulated yield and resulting iwue are shown for the increments across the testing range for ttt 5 5 h ttt 7 5 h di and et replacement scenarios in fig 5 the ttt 5 5 h experiment showed a steady rise in yield until it plateaued the maximum yield threshold was achieved at approximately 6 mm fig 5a however the simulated iwue peaked at 4 mm and declined with each increase in water application thereafter in case of the ttt 7 5 h strategy yield increased with increasing daily irrigation up to 12 mm maximum yield threshold and then plateaued fig 5b the yield did not rise as steadily as it did for the other strategies leading to a more erratic water use efficiency curve with a maximum iwue occurring at 7 5 mm the beginning of the most consistent decline in efficiency was concurrent with the achievement of maximum yield the di strategy showed a steady increase in the simulated yield until it reached a maximum threshold at 4 5 mm and then remained stable fig 5c the iwue remained stable at approximately 21 kg ha 1 mm 1 before the beginning of a clear negative trend at 4 mm results from the et replacement strategy simulations indicated a positive trend in yield until the yield plateaued at 95 et replacement fig 5d the iwue decreased with each increase in applied water with a small increase concurrent with the maximum yield threshold after which it decreased steadily simulated seed cotton yield increased with increasing irrigation and consequently maximum yield under any given irrigation scenario was achieved with the highest amount of irrigation applied however the yield gain with additional water applied was much smaller at high irrigation levels than at low irrigation levels as a result the yield plateaued at 6 mm for ttt 5 5 h 12 mm for ttt 7 5 h 4 5 mm for daily irrigation and at 95 for et replacement strategy consequently the iwue trend continued to decline after the maximum yield threshold for each of the strategies as the application of additional irrigation water no longer increased the yield substantially the maximum yield threshold or the yield level after which the yield gain was 1 with additional irrigation and corresponding iwue for each strategy are shown collectively in fig 6 the optimum yield levels for all four irrigation strategies tested were comparable with the highest optimum yield being 6007 kg ha 1 under ttt 5 5 h 6 mm and the lowest optimum yield of 5887 kg ha 1 under ttt 7 5 h 12 mm the iwue for the ttt 7 5 h strategy at 12 mm irrigation was the highest among the four simulated irrigation strategies and the iwue for the 95 et replacement strategy was the lowest given the comparable yields the difference in iwue among irrigation strategies was attributed to the amount of seasonal irrigation the amount of irrigation water applied to achieve the near maximum optimum yield fig 6 was the lowest for ttt 7 5 h 12 mm scenario 195 mm and the highest for 95 et replacement scenario 300 mm the amount of irrigation applied to achieve the optimum yield for ttt 5 5 h 6 mm and di 4 5 mm was the same at 213 mm these results are consistent with previous field studies in which ttt method was used for irrigation scheduling wanjura et al 1995 compared cotton yield and irrigation with different ttt treatments ranging from 2 h to 8 h time thresholds at lubbock texas they found that the irrigation decreased as the time threshold increased and that all ttt treatments produced comparable yields the reason behind comparable yield under different ttt treatments was thought to be adeqaute soil water throughout the experiments which prevented yield loss due to water stress in the current study the highest time threshold tested was 7 5 h and the yield under this time threshold although comparable was slightly lower than that under 5 5 h strategy this suggests that increasing the time threshold beyond 7 5 h tested in this study may lead to water stress and greater yield loss in another field study at bushland texas researchers o shaughnessy and evett 2010 compared ttt 7 5 h strategy with manual irrigation strategy in which soil water was replenished to field capacity at a weekly interval they found that iwue was always higher for the ttt treatment whereras cotton yield was either the same or higher under ttt treatment than under soil replenishment irrigaiton scheduling it should be borne in mind that while the amounts delivered to the crop were altered in the modelled ttt 5 5 h and ttt 7 5 h irrigation schemes the timing of the irrigations was based on the actual field irrigation timing and number of events were held constant recall that the real world irrigation events were triggered by the time when canopy temperature was greater than 28 c a surrogate measure for physiological crop stress it is concievable that changing the amounts of irrigation water delivered in each event would change the time when canopy temperature was above threshold since canopy temperature was not a calculated output of dssat irrigation timing was held constant in the simulations in an actual field setting timing of irrigation could and should differ from that of the modelled timing especially early in the season when leaf area and kc is lower and later in the season when et0 is lower for example it can be expected that a single irrigation of 12 mm in an early season when canopy has a realtviely low leaf area would last longer than a 7 5 mm irrigation in the field a 12 mm irrigation signal might not be received until a day or more after a 7 5 mm irrigation signal a similar argument can be made for later in the season when et0 begins to drop however when the crop canopy is rapidly developing and mid growing season pet is high then the assumptions about irrigation timing are likely to be reasonable so that a few irrigations more or less in the early or late season might not markedly affect the results 4 conclusions the thp region in which the study was conducted is unique and vital to cotton production the water shortages on the horizon increase the necessity of developing more efficient irrigation practices crop growth models are valuable tools which enable experimentation with different procedures and treatments on a field without wasting tangible resources the in season data available from the field study and the variety of irrigation strategies that were used provided extra dimensions in the evaluation of the dssat model in this study running a panel of simulations can be very useful in pinpointing an ideal scenario or set of conditions this functionality was utilized as the model was run in the multi scenario irrigation experiment overall the dssat cropgro cotton model demonstrated potential to accurately simulate experimental yields under various irrigation treatments the biomass canopy height and yield comparisons during calibration produced average mapes of 17 1 14 7 and 2 4 respectively these were below the 20 goal for average mape in each category when compared to calibration treatments the average mape in biomass and canopy height prediction in evaluation treatments was lower 14 3 and 8 9 respectively in case of yield prediction although the average mape was higher 13 for the evaluation treatments than calibration treatments it was within the 20 goal the ttt 7 5 h 12 mm irrigation scenario was found to be the most efficient of the maximum yield scenarios followed closely by di 4 mm and ttt 5 5 h 6 mm while et 95 was the least efficient of the four in summary the ttt treatment was found to optimize water use efficiency and yield irrigation scheduling based on et replacement was found to be the least efficient among the four strategies studied disclaimer mention of company or trade names

water status while cotton irrigation scheduling using the ttt approach has been documented in select field studies conducted in the thp o shaughnessy and evett 2010 o shaughnessy et al 2011 wanjura et al 1995 2002 estimation of irrigation water demand based on crop evapotranspiration et has been more commonly used bordovsky et al 1992 bronson et al 2001 2006 howell et al 2004 the ttt technique patented as biologically identified optimal temperature interactive console biotic upchurch et al 1996 recommends irrigation based on two thresholds of time and temperature when the time accumulated above a specific canopy temperature on a given day exceeds the threshold value it indicates a temperature stress and the need for irrigation as the time threshold increases average daily stress time increases wanjura et al 2003 indicated a negative relationship between daily stress times and lint yield or irrigation water use when compared to other irrigation strategies yield and water use efficiency obtained from the ttt controlled irrigation are as good as or greater than those obtained under other efficient irrigation scheduling methods such as neutron probe measured soil water status based methods o shaughnessy and evett 2010 peters and evett 2008 in the et based irrigation method crop water demand is estimated from standard et equations e g fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in a modelling study in the texas rolling plains a region neighboring the thp cotton lint yield response to six irrigation levels from 0 to 140 of et was found to be quadratic attia et al 2016 experiments conducted using the low energy precision application lepa irrigation system in the thp suggested that et replacement of 75 80 was optimal for cotton production bordovsky et al 1992 high irrigation levels exceeding 90 et replacement resulted in an increased biomass but not lint yield bronson et al 2006 evaluating additional irrigation scenarios strategies based on the results from field experiments could provide more insights into yield irrigation water use relationships which is essential for developing water conserving management practices crop growth models such as the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat allow researchers to conduct several hypothetical irrigation experiments rapidly and inexpensively facilitating the development and evaluation of water use efficient strategies dssat is a process based model hoogenboom et al 2015 that uses meteorological soil and crop management data to predict the growth and development of a particular crop in a set location dssat has over 42 crop modules each of which is designed to mimic the behavior of a specific crop the cropgro cotton jones et al 2003 module in the dssat cropping system model csm was used in this study although previous research has addressed the evaluation of csm cropgro cotton model for the thp kothari et al 2019 adhikari et al 2016 limited in season crop data mainly related to the dates of onset of different phenological stages were used for model evaluation in those studies crop growth and development are important aspects of dssat model evaluation as the model is designed to simulate crop growth and they are overlooked when evaluating the model solely with yield data evaluation of dssat cropgro cotton model using phenological stages in season crop growth and development data and crop yield has been attempted by modala et al 2015 in the texas rolling plains region which neighbors the thp measured in season data used for model evaluation in the modala et al 2015 study include the canopy height number of nodes and leaf area index however such a detailed evaluation of the csm cropgro cotton model was lacking for the thp region the objectives of this research were therefore to 1 evaluate the dssat csm cropgro cotton model for the thp region using measured data on in season canopy height and biomass and seed cotton yield from a field experiment and 2 use the evaluated model to determine the lowest irrigation amount that can be applied to maximize yield under four irrigation strategies implemented in the field study and identify the most efficient irrigation strategy for maximizing yield 2 methodology materials 2 1 field methods cotton cultivar deltapine 444 seeds were planted at the lubbock tx usda ars nursery 33 35 38 2 n 101 53 59 9 w on day of year doy 154 in 2008 seeds were planted 3 75 cm 1 5 deep at 16 15 875 seeds meter into east west oriented raised beds spaced at 1 m 40 an initial 51 mm 2 subsurface irrigation was delivered to all plots two weeks before planting and an additional 51 mm furrow irrigation was delivered to all plots 9 days after planting dap this was done to bring all plots to field capacity at the beginning of the experiment and to insure even emergence and an even stand these efforts resulted in a population density of 159 000 plants hectare no further irrigations were applied to the dryland treatment which received water only from precipitation events stout 2018 the soil at the location is an amarillo fine sandy loam fine loamy mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustalfs irrigation was provided by subsurface drip irrigation sdi with drip tapes laid 35 cm deep parallel to the beds and spaced at 1 m the field was divided into seven sdi zones consisting of 8 rows each each irrigation zone was sub divided into three plots east middle and west irrigation was driven by ttt calculated et or daily irrigation di treatments that delivered daily irrigation events simulating reduced well capacities typical of the region table 1 the ttt treatments were controlled on a daily time step by the biotic wanjura et al 2006 approach canopy temperature was measured with infrared thermometers at 6 s intervals and 15 min averages were computed a 5 mm irrigation was then triggered using either a 5 5 h or 7 5 h time threshold above 28 c in all treatments a simple rain subroutine substituted scheduled irrigation with adequate rain the et treatments replaced either 60 or 100 of the estimated water lost thermal units were calculated as growing degree days using the average daily maximal and minimal air temperatures recorded at the onsite 33 35 38 1 n 101 54 03 6 w weather station stout 2018 subtracting a 15 6 c 60 f base temperature wanjura and supak 1985 and letting accumulated thermal units equal zero when average temperatures were below the base temperature accumulated heat units were used to drive a model young et al 1980 grimes and el zik 1990 to calculate the crop coefficient kc of a cotton crop allowed to develop under the absence of water stress in daily time steps the standardized reference crop evapotranspiration et0 for short crops allen et al 2005 was obtained from the texas tech mesonet schroeder et al 2005 data for calculation of et0 were taken from the station lubbock 3wnw ttu located about 1 km ne of the experimental plots within the texas tech university ttu natural resources management rangeland research station 33 36 14 7 n 101 53 57 1 w the calculated potential evapotranspiration pet of the developing crop was expressed as the product of et0 and kc in daily time steps grimes and el zik 1990 vegetation samples were taken from only the middle two rows of each zone to avoid interference from the neighboring zones irrigation regimes to collect a canopy height record a meter stick was held at the soil line and the measure from base to terminal was recorded in centimeters to the nearest tenth the average value was calculated from the 6 8 measurements taken on each of 21 monitored days spaced throughout the growing season to collect a plant biomass record plants were harvested and oven dried at 60 65 for a minimum of 48 h the dry weight of the plant was recorded at various growth stages the average biomass was calculated for the measurements taken on each of the monitored days spaced throughout the growing season for comparison with the dssat output it was necessary to combine the leaf stem and boll dry weights into a total plant biomass yield was measured as the combined seed and lint weight from two meters of hand harvest the average of the three samples collected from each zone was calculated 2 2 model inputs weather data were taken from the on site meteorological tower stout 2018 daily precipitation wind speed average relative humidity minimum temperature maximum temperature solar radiation and pan evaporation data were input to the model information for three days in total was missing from this data set so supplementary precipitation temperature solar radiation and wind speed data were retrieved from the lubbock 3wnw ttu weather station which is part of the west texas mesonet west texas mesonet 2008 and located less than 1 2 km from the experimental field 33 36 14 8 n 101 53 57 1 solar radiation daily averages for doy 10 through doy 144 were also replaced a summary of the most critical weather factors for the months of june through september in 2008 is shown in table 2 soil profile information was not available for the experimental field so a profile table 3 was developed based on the soil type amarillo fine sandy loam the soil horizon designation slmh saturated hydraulic conductivity ssks bulk density sbdm organic carbon percentage sloc clay percentage slcl silt percentage slsi ph by water extraction slhw and cation exchange capacity scec were obtained and calculated from national cooperative soil survey data accessed through soilweb an online application maintained by the california soil resource lab at the university of california davis the lower limit of extractable water slll drained upper limit sdul saturated upper limit ssat were approximated as the water retained at 15 bar and 0 33 bar and effective porosity respectively based on the soil texture for each layer as calculated by rawls et al 1982 the calculated plant available water capacity for the 2 1 m soil profile from these approximations was 0 226 m the munsell soil color of 7 5yr ncss 2016 corresponded to a value of 0 13 for the albedo ratio gijsman et al 2007 while the soil was classified as well drained ncss 2019 a more conservative drainage rate of 0 4 was used gijsman et al 2007 the soil was categorized as hydrologic group b ncss 2019 which corresponds to a runoff curve number of 78 for straight row cultivated agricultural land in good condition nrcs 1986 the daily irrigation water delivered to each treatment as described in the preceding section was used as an input to the dssat model the crop management related model inputs were also decided based on the actual practices followed in the field experiment 2 3 model evaluation the calibration methodology adopted in the present study was partly based on adhikari et al 2016 who evaluated csm cropgro cotton for the thp by comparing the simulated dates of onset of phenological stages of emergence anthesis and maturity as well as seed cotton yield the testing ranges and resulting variables used in the adhikari et al 2016 study served as guidelines for many of the variable testing ranges used to perform this detailed thp evaluation an adjustment of dssat simulated growth stages to comparable phenological stages from the field experiment and other sources kerns et al 2008 deterling and el zik 1982 was conducted prior to the calibration of parameters related to crop development and yield the ecotype parameters for time from planting to emergence pl em and time from planting to first leaf em v1 as well as the cultivar parameter for time from emergence to flower appearance em fl were all modified and set before continuing with the crop development yield calibration throughout calibration the growth stages were monitored to ensure that they remained within the documented ranges from literature the model was calibrated by comparing the experimental results of the high water treatments including ttt 5 5 h et 100 and di 4 mm to the model results for plant height and biomass throughout the season as well as the final yield with complete data only available for the year of 2008 the application of many widely used statistical calibration indicators was limited by the lack of sequential data so calibration efforts were primarily directed by the minimization of two error indicators mean absolute percentage error mape eq 1 and percentage root mean square error prmse eq 2 with a target of 20 or lower mape in the case of yield comparisons an absolute percent error ape eq 3 was used to more clearly portray a single point comparison for each of the canopy height and biomass comparisons a coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 was calculated the formulae used for estimating model performance statistics were 1 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y m i y s i y m i 2 p r m s e i 1 n y s i y m i 2 n 100 n i 1 n y m i 3 a p e y m i y s i y m i 4 r 2 i 1 n y m

of samples eleven cultivar parameters and three ecotype parameters in dssat were individually adjusted across a testing range for each iteration table 4 the testing range was chosen based on previous studies adhikari et al 2016 pathak et al 2007 thorp et al 2014 and observation of values for other preexisting cultivars in dssat the parameter adjustment was done in a systematic fashion finalizing the value of the first parameter and continuing to the next in the listed order until all variables were finalized iterations were performed with the goal of identifying the value which minimized error in plant height biomass and yield predictions the simulated growth stages were compared with the corresponding observed occurrences and acceptable date ranges for cotton grown in the same region as a final check to ensure that the values are reasonable once an ideal combination of variable values was identified the accuracy of the calibrated model was verified by comparing the simulated values for the deficit irrigation plots ttt 7 5 h et 60 di 2 mm and dryland against the experimental values which were not used during calibration this was completed using the same error indicators employed in the calibration comparisons mape and prmse with a target of 20 or lower mape 2 4 irrigation scenario comparison after successful evaluation of the model it was used as a tool to determine the best water use efficient irrigation strategy using the four unique irrigation strategies from the field study ttt 5 5 h ttt 7 5 h di and et replacement various scenarios representing different well capacities were developed by holding irrigation timing constant and varying the amount of water applied incrementally for each irrigation event this comparison among irrigation scenarios was made for the year 2018 as the continuously measured canopy temperature data was available for that year only long term simulations could not be run due to the lack of the canopy temperature data and this prevented the assessment of the effects of interannual variability on simulated irrigation scenarios the yield trend for each strategy was evaluated to determine whether the yield had reached a stable maximum value if not the range was extended the final ranges tested were in 0 5 mm increments from 2 0 to 8 0 mm for ttt 5 5 h from 2 0 to 15 0 mm for ttt 7 5 h and from 2 0 to 6 0 mm for di and 5 increments from 50 to 100 for the et replacement strategy the maximum yield threshold was determined to be the yield beyond which no substantial increase greater than 1 in yield was achieved with additional application of irrigation water simulations were designed to represent consistent initial conditions those of zone 41 in the field study irrigation was scheduled exactly as it was recorded in the field study which did not supply water during days on which rainfall override was triggered by a sensed precipitation event the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated using eq 5 for each simulation in the testing range eq 5 is a modification of similar equations to better suit the experiment circumstances howell 2003 comparisons were made against a baseline scenario which used the same initial conditions as the other simulations in the testing range the irrigation schedule for the baseline scenario was modelled after that of the dryland zone in the field experiments 5

accordance with the methodology the parameter rhght was initially adjusted to get a suitable match between observed and simulated canopy height and parameters xfrt thrsh podur sfdur and lngsh were then adjusted during the seed cotton yield calibration at the end of the systematic calibration process for the fourteen adjusted parameters the values which produced the minimum error were recorded as final table 4 3 1 1 phenological stage calibration a reasonable match between the timing of emergence and flowering simulated by dssat and the dates recorded for the onset of those growth stages from the field study was found table 5 the stages for all of the simulations fell within an acceptable range for cotton grown in the thp region this was achieved by setting pl em to 3 em v1 to 5 and em fl to 38 prior to continuing with the yield calibration during the calibration it was deemed necessary to cap the upper limit of the testing range for sd pm at the value remaining after subtracting fl sd from 51 to maintain a physiological maturity date within the targeted range the dates for emergence and flowering that were recorded in the field study came sooner than the corresponding mean dates from literature deterling and el zik 1982 kerns et al 2008 this was attributed to the early maturity of the deltapine 444 cultivar 3 1 2 biomass calibration the individual biomass graphs for each treatment are shown in fig 1 in general the measured and simulated data were in agreement up until approximately 113 days after planting dap in the subsequent days it is presumed that the natural progression of senescence was not reflected as strongly in the simulated biomass data this difference is particularly prominent in the di 4 mm treatment model performance in biomass prediction for the calibration treatments was good as indicated by an average mape of 17 1 prmse of 26 2 and r2 of 0 89 table 6 3 1 3 canopy height calibration canopy height data were only collected for two of the calibration treatments ttt 5 5 h and et 100 fig 2 while the model underpredicted canopy height in case of ttt 5 5 h treatment it slightly overpredicted canopy height for the et 100 treatment the resulting mape prmse and coefficient of determination are shown in table 7 the average mape prmse and r2 during canopy height calibration were 14 7 15 0 and 0 82 respectively the r2 value was not as high as some values achieved for calibration treatments in literature modala et al 2015 but it was still reasonably close to unity the underprediction of biomass and canopy height for ttt 5 5 h treatment could be due to the use of air temperature instead of canopy temperature for simulating crop development in dssat thorp et al 2014 the design of ttt 5 5 h likely helped in maintaining canopy temperature cooler than the air temperature and lowered stress levels however due to the use of air temperature a higher stress might have been simulated for the ttt 5 5 h irrigation treatment resulting in lower biomass and canopy height 3 1 4 yield calibration simulated and measured seed cotton yields are presented in table 8 since the yield measurement was only taken once in the season the absolute percentage error for each strategy was also listed in addition to the mape simulated and measured seed cotton yields matched closely during calibration as indicated by very low ape and mape values 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 biomass evaluation simulated and measured biomasses for each of the evaluation treatments matched fairly well except at few growth stages fig 3 the differences between measured and simulated biomass could be due to the limitation of the model in accounting for all biotic and abiotic stresses in addition minor differences in irrigation application likely did not trigger substantial model response thorp et al 2014 model performance statistics obtained during the evaluation average mape of 14 3 prmse of 20 2 and r2 of 0 91 were better than those obtained during the model calibration table 6 3 2 2 canopy height evaluation as was the case for calibration canopy height data were only available for two of the evaluation treatments ttt 7 5 h and dryland a good match between the simulated and measured canopy height was found for each evaluation treatment fig 4 the model performance in canopy height prediction for evaluation treatments was much better when compared to calibration treatments as indicated by substantially lower mape prmse values and higher coefficient of determination values average mape prmse and r2 were 8 9 8 7 and 0 82 respectively table 7 3 2 3 yield evaluation table 8 shows the results from the yield comparisons for the evaluation treatments as was practiced for the calibration results the absolute percentage error for each strategy was listed in addition to the mape the ape values for evaluation treatments especially the drier treatments were higher than those achieved in calibration and exceeded those reported in similar studies which generally ranged from 1 to 9 adhikari et al 2016 modala et al 2015 despite this the mape for the evaluation treatments remained below 20 at 16 2 3 3 irrigation scenario comparison in the present study field data provided many opportunities for a robust evaluation of the cropgro cotton model for the thp by comparing the experimental crop with the modelled crop using in season data canopy height and biomass at different crop growth stages and crop yield for seven irrigation scheduling strategies were used to evaluate the model with the comparison of in season crop growth and development in addition to the end of season crop yield the evaluated model serves as a more accurate reflection of what happens in the field throughout the cotton growing season the simulated yield and resulting iwue are shown for the increments across the testing range for ttt 5 5 h ttt 7 5 h di and et replacement scenarios in fig 5 the ttt 5 5 h experiment showed a steady rise in yield until it plateaued the maximum yield threshold was achieved at approximately 6 mm fig 5a however the simulated iwue peaked at 4 mm and declined with each increase in water application thereafter in case of the ttt 7 5 h strategy yield increased with increasing daily irrigation up to 12 mm maximum yield threshold and then plateaued fig 5b the yield did not rise as steadily as it did for the other strategies leading to a more erratic water use efficiency curve with a maximum iwue occurring at 7 5 mm the beginning of the most consistent decline in efficiency was concurrent with the achievement of maximum yield the di strategy showed a steady increase in the simulated yield until it reached a maximum threshold at 4 5 mm and then remained stable fig 5c the iwue remained stable at approximately 21 kg ha 1 mm 1 before the beginning of a clear negative trend at 4 mm results from the et replacement strategy simulations indicated a positive trend in yield until the yield plateaued at 95 et replacement fig 5d the iwue decreased with each increase in applied water with a small increase concurrent with the maximum yield threshold after which it decreased steadily simulated seed cotton yield increased with increasing irrigation and consequently maximum yield under any given irrigation scenario was achieved with the highest amount of irrigation applied however the yield gain with additional water applied was much smaller at high irrigation levels than at low irrigation levels as a result the yield plateaued at 6 mm for ttt 5 5 h 12 mm for ttt 7 5 h 4 5 mm for daily irrigation and at 95 for et replacement strategy consequently the iwue trend continued to decline after the maximum yield threshold for each of the strategies as the application of additional irrigation water no longer increased the yield substantially the maximum yield threshold or the yield level after which the yield gain was 1 with additional irrigation and corresponding iwue for each strategy are shown collectively in fig 6 the optimum yield levels for all four irrigation strategies tested were comparable with the highest optimum yield being 6007 kg ha 1 under ttt 5 5 h 6 mm and the lowest optimum yield of 5887 kg ha 1 under ttt 7 5 h 12 mm the iwue for the ttt 7 5 h strategy at 12 mm irrigation was the highest among the four simulated irrigation strategies and the iwue for the 95 et replacement strategy was the lowest given the comparable yields the difference in iwue among irrigation strategies was attributed to the amount of seasonal irrigation the amount of irrigation water applied to achieve the near maximum optimum yield fig 6 was the lowest for ttt 7 5 h 12 mm scenario 195 mm and the highest for 95 et replacement scenario 300 mm the amount of irrigation applied to achieve the optimum yield for ttt 5 5 h 6 mm and di 4 5 mm was the same at 213 mm these results are consistent with previous field studies in which ttt method was used for irrigation scheduling wanjura et al 1995 compared cotton yield and irrigation with different ttt treatments ranging from 2 h to 8 h time thresholds at lubbock texas they found that the irrigation decreased as the time threshold increased and that all ttt treatments produced comparable yields the reason behind comparable yield under different ttt treatments was thought to be adeqaute soil water throughout the experiments which prevented yield loss due to water stress in the current study the highest time threshold tested was 7 5 h and the yield under this time threshold although comparable was slightly lower than that under 5 5 h strategy this suggests that increasing the time threshold beyond 7 5 h tested in this study may lead to water stress and greater yield loss in another field study at bushland texas researchers o shaughnessy and evett 2010 compared ttt 7 5 h strategy with manual irrigation strategy in which soil water was replenished to field capacity at a weekly interval they found that iwue was always higher for the ttt treatment whereras cotton yield was either the same or higher under ttt treatment than under soil replenishment irrigaiton scheduling it should be borne in mind that while the amounts delivered to the crop were altered in the modelled ttt 5 5 h and ttt 7 5 h irrigation schemes the timing of the irrigations was based on the actual field irrigation timing and number of events were held constant recall that the real world irrigation events were triggered by the time when canopy temperature was greater than 28 c a surrogate measure for physiological crop stress it is concievable that changing the amounts of irrigation water delivered in each event would change the time when canopy temperature was above threshold since canopy temperature was not a calculated output of dssat irrigation timing was held constant in the simulations in an actual field setting timing of irrigation could and should differ from that of the modelled timing especially early in the season when leaf area and kc is lower and later in the season when et0 is lower for example it can be expected that a single irrigation of 12 mm in an early season when canopy has a realtviely low leaf area would last longer than a 7 5 mm irrigation in the field a 12 mm irrigation signal might not be received until a day or more after a 7 5 mm irrigation signal a similar argument can be made for later in the season when et0 begins to drop however when the crop canopy is rapidly developing and mid growing season pet is high then the assumptions about irrigation timing are likely to be reasonable so that a few irrigations more or less in the early or late season might not markedly affect the results 4 conclusions the thp region in which the study was conducted is unique and vital to cotton production the water shortages on the horizon increase the necessity of developing more efficient irrigation practices crop growth models are valuable tools which enable experimentation with different procedures and treatments on a field without wasting tangible resources the in season data available from the field study and the variety of irrigation strategies that were used provided extra dimensions in the evaluation of the dssat model in this study running a panel of simulations can be very useful in pinpointing an ideal scenario or set of conditions this functionality was utilized as the model was run in the multi scenario irrigation experiment overall the dssat cropgro cotton model demonstrated potential to accurately simulate experimental yields under various irrigation treatments the biomass canopy height and yield comparisons during calibration produced average mapes of 17 1 14 7 and 2 4 respectively these were below the 20 goal for average mape in each category when compared to calibration treatments the average mape in biomass and canopy height prediction in evaluation treatments was lower 14 3 and 8 9 respectively in case of yield prediction although the average mape was higher 13 for the evaluation treatments than calibration treatments it was within the 20 goal the ttt 7 5 h 12 mm irrigation scenario was found to be the most efficient of the maximum yield scenarios followed closely by di 4 mm and ttt 5 5 h 6 mm while et 95 was the least efficient of the four in summary the ttt treatment was found to optimize water use efficiency and yield irrigation scheduling based on et replacement was found to be the least efficient among the four strategies studied disclaimer mention of company or trade names
