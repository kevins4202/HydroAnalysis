19240,in this study the spatial and temporal distribution of 41 multiclass organic compounds were assessed in three estuaries of the basque country from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab active sampling methods and an extra campaign combining both grab and passive sampling methods wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents were also evaluated to assess their impact on the estuaries moreover the physicochemical features phosphate and nitrate concentrations ph etc of each site were measured and included in the statistical analysis anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac and acetaminophen hypertensive drugs irbesartan and valsartan a stimulant caffeine an artificial sweetener acesulfame and a corrosion inhibitor 2 hydroxybenzothiazole were the most ubiquitous compounds due to the stratification of the waters in the estuary of bilbao two independent sources were identified wwtp and harbour activities in the case of gernika and plentzia both are estuaries with a high tidal dilution and the main sources were localized in the effluents of the wwtps in addition to this the use of pocis provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long sampling period finally risk quotient rq values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined at each estuary and wwtp effluent for acute and chronic effects in the case of acute toxicity the highest rq values 1 were obtained for the angiotensin ii receptor blockers telmisartan eprosartan etc diuron and diclofenac in the case of the chronic toxicity the highest rq values 1 were estimated for caffeine diclofenac bezafibrate and sulfadiazine graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging pollutants occurrence wwtps estuaries passive sampling environmental risk assessment

average uv vis ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry wfd water framework directive wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the fate and distribution of emerging contaminants is a matter of growing interest since most of the chemicals considered are unregulated and the effects that might be attributed to many of them are missed or overlooked in many monitoring and surveillance programs ternes et al 2015 among these emerging contaminants we may find many different chemicals including personal care products and pharmaceuticals pcpps consumption products food additives detergents etc industrial compounds perfluoroalkyl substances pfass plasticizers etc pesticides and engineered nano materials though we can find many of these contaminants in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in agriculture surface run offs and in industrial discharges the impact of the former ones from urban areas i e wwtp effluents is especially remarkable prasse et al 2015 as a consequence rivers estuaries and coastal ecosystems are under the influence of chronic exposures to many emerging contaminants environmental monitoring of special sensitive areas such as estuaries has become a challenge owing to the complexity of the analytical end points a growing amount of target candidates at trace level a high physical and chemical dynamism in estuaries and coastal areas an unknown number of transformation products etc and the potential effects antibiotic resistance endocrine disruption mutagenicity etc maruya et al 2016 although the application of the current legal framework i e the water framework directive wfd and the marine strategy framework directive msfd is somewhat limited by the prioritized set of contaminants and the application of compliance methods we can also widen those limits by a thorough application of screening and non target methods and new effect based bio analytical approaches busch et al 2016 brack et al 2017 in this work we consider the application of recently developed procedures for the simultaneous analysis of 41 emerging contaminants and for the calibration of polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis of those emerging contaminants mijangos et al 2018a 2018b in several estuaries of the basque country because there was a clear lack of analytical data and a high uncertainty about the real impact of many of these contaminants though some recent works described a general assessment about the health status cajaraville et al 2016 or the anthropogenic drivers in bacterial communities of the bilbao estuary aguirre et al 2017 the occurrence of emerging contaminants is still missed in addition to this estuary we also extended this study to the estuaries of urdaibai gernika and plentzia because they fit with completely different geophysical and urban features valencia et al 2004 in this sense the occurrence of 41 emerging contaminants was analyzed from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab sampling with an extra campaign carried out in spring 2017 combining both grab and passive sampling protocols the main wwtp effluents of each estuary were also monitored to assess the impact of these effluents on the average loading of the estuaries finally we ranked the contaminants in terms of their acute and chronic toxic effects based on the estimated risk quotient values ec 2003 2 experimental section 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 a three estuaries bilbao bi plentzia pl and urdaibai ur of the basque country were selected for this study and between 4 and 7 sampling sites were chosen at each estuary fig 1b d those sites were selected along a longitudinal gradient from the sea to upstream taking into account the general features of each estuary in the particular case of the estuary of bilbao water samples were collected at two depths surface and bottom water due to the high stratification observed in this estuary in addition to this the effluents of the main wwtps of each estuary i e galindo in bilbao gorliz in plentzia and gernika in urdaibai were also monitored an overview of the selected sampling sites is given in table s1 of the supplementary material sm the estuary of bilbao is 15 km long and an average 100 m wide and the depth ranges between 2 m upper estuary and 30 m estuary mouth the estuary is partially mixed in the outer part and highly stratified within the inner half with average tidal ranges between 1 2 m and 4 6 m and crosses the metropolitan area of bilbao 1 000 000 inhabitants currently major pollution inputs have been related with the harbour activities and urban discharges from the wwtp of galindo the biggest wwtp in the basque country and one of the largest in spain the estuary of plentzia is classified as a mesotidal system with a tidal variation of 2 5 m being exposed 80 of the estuary at lowtide the presence of a dam 10 km upstream from the sea in the upper part of the estuary limits the intertidal area major pollution inputs can be related to leisure shipping traffic and urban discharges the gorliz wwtp located in the mouth of the estuary collects urban wastewater from 10 000 inhabitants featured by an increase in population during the summer period but it releases the effluent out the estuary mouth through a submarine pipe located at 1000 m from the coast and 18 m depth the estuary of urdaibai reserve of the biosphere declared by unesco since 1984 is formed by the tidal part of the oka river with 11 6 km long and 1 km wide alluvial valley valencia et al 2004 the estuary is impacted by urban inputs especially from the direct discharge of the wwtp of gernika to the oka river fisheries industrial activities metallurgic motoring and shipyards and leisure activities 2 2 reagents and materials the selection of the target pollutants was carried out taking into account their presence and relevance in the environment busch et al 2016 according to these criteria 41 organic pollutants with urban rural and industrial use among several classes artificial sweeteners corrosion inhibitors hormones pcps pfass pesticides pharmaceuticals and phytoestrogens were selected compound families names cas numbers molecular formulas and other relevant physicochemical properties for all the target compounds are summarized in table s2 suppliers for each target analyte are also listed in table s2 all chemicals and labworks are provided in section 1 of the sm 2 3 water sample collection and treatment five sampling campaigns were undertaken between february 2016 and february 2017 winter 2016 february 24 march 18 spring may 31 jun 2 summer september 8 september 12 fall november 11 november 30 and winter 2017 february 16 february 23 for each sampling campaign samples were collected along a salinity gradient from the sea up to the non tidal zone always at high tide surface water near 50 cm and depth water near the bottom were collected by means of van dorn and niskin bottles kc denmark a s 2l respectively an exo2 multiparametric probe was deployed during the sampling for in situ measuring of depth ph oxidation reduction potential orp temperature conductivity salinity total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen concentration do along the water column the rest of the parameters were determined in the laboratory non purgable organic carbon npoc was determined using a toc vcsn shimadzu corporation kyoto japan which is based on total oxidation on a platinum catalyst at a temperature of 680 c the concentrations of ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 were evaluated potentiometrically using the standard additions method with an ion selective electrode and silicate si oh 4 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined using molybdenum blue based flow injection analysis methods with uv vis spectrophotometric detection kortazar et al 2016 the physico chemical properties measured are summarized in tables s3 s5 in sm regarding to the analysis of organic pollutants effluents and estuary water samples were transferred to pre cleaned polypropylene pp bottles transported to the laboratory in cooled boxes and kept in the fridge at 4 c before analysis the analyses were performed within 24 h after sampling a previously validated solid phase extraction spe method mijangos et al 2018a was used for the extraction of the samples as thoroughly described in section 2 of the sm 2 4 passive sampling in march april 2017 pocis devices were deployed at the estuaries of bilbao bi 2b and bi 4b plentzia pl 3 and urdaibai ur 3 as shown in fig 1b d at each site a canister containing two pocis was deployed at 50 100 cm below the surface and two consecutive deployments of 14 days were carried out pocis were prepared according to the procedure described previously mijangos et al 2018b pocis were transported at 4 c to the lab and stored at 20 c before being processed the analytical procedure followed to analyse the pocis is briefly described in section 2 of the sm one transport blank was performed per sampling day and simultaneously water samples were taken in pp bottles from the sampling sites before each deployment and after the last retrieval 0th 14th and 28th days water samples were carried to the laboratory in cooled boxes and kept at 4 c before analysis which was performed within 24 h according to a previously validated spe procedure mijangos et al 2018a described in section 2 of the sm time weight average concentrations twa of acesulfame acetaminophen amitriptyline atrazine bezafibrate butylparaben caffeine carbamazepine diuron irbesartan ketoprofen 2 hydroxybenzothiazole obt nonafluorobutanesulfonate pfbs perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos phenytoin progesterone and telmisartan were calculated based on the sampling rates rs determined previously and the concentration of atrazine d5 included as a performance reference compound prc mijangos et al 2018b 2 5 lc ms ms analysis analysis was carried out using an hplc qqq agilent 1260 series lc coupled to an agilent 6430 triple quadrupole equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source agilent technologies according to a previously optimized method mijangos et al 2018a methodological details are included in section 3 of the sm 2 6 quality control apparent recoveries as well as method quantification limits mqls for each analyte in the estuary and effluent water are included in table s6 according to the previously published work mijangos et al 2018a although the analytical method used in this work was previously developed and validated procedural blanks and control samples samples spiked at known concentration were analyzed every 20 samples values lower than mqls were obtained in the case of blanks and apparent recoveries were in agreement with those reported before mijangos et al 2018a 2 7 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca of the data was performed using the unscrambler software v 9 2 6 camo norway prior to any data treatment the responses were normalized and centred and the models were built using cross validation esbensen et al 2002 a pca of the data included in tables s3 5 and s8 12 was performed 2 8 environmental risk assessment era era was carried out using a risk quotient rq according to the european union technical guidance document ec 2003 in this study rqs for acute and chronic effects were calculated for each compound as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec maximum values obtained along the monitoring period for each compound at each estuary and effluent samples were used as mec values which represent the worst case scenario alygizakis et al 2016 ma et al 2017 pnec values were calculated dividing the lowest chronic or acute toxicity data available from the ecotoxicology knowledge base ecotox database https cfpub epa gov ecotox for several target species representing different trophic levels algae bacteria invertebrates and fish by an assessment factor af the reference values were chosen considering the effects on growth population reproduction and behaviour and both fresh water and marine species were considered for sub lethal chronic toxicity levels no observed effect concentrations noec were used and the applied af values were 1000 100 50 and 10 depending on the data available ec 2003 for acute toxicity levels the effect concentration ec50 or the lethal concentration lc50 was used and the af was 1000 alygizakis et al 2016 ma et al 2017 l e c50s were based on either measured acute concentrations retrieved from the ecotox database or when the data was missing by qsar models as described by busch et al 2016 details on the selected noecs and l e c50s values are shown in tables s14 and s15 3 results and discussion the minimum maximum and median analyte concentrations ng l and detection frequencies of the target compounds determined in each wwtp effluent and estuary are summarised in tables 1 and 2 respectively out of the total 41 compounds 35 compounds were detected in at least one effluent sample and 36 in at least one estuary sample clofibric acid genistin glycitin imipramine pfoa and perfluoroctylsulfonamide pfosa were below their mqls in most of the samples 3 1 occurrence and seasonal distribution in the wwtps concerning wwtps concentration levels were ranged between low ng l levels to 8963 ng l 4532 ng l and 11419 ng l in the case of galindo gorliz and gernika wwtps respectively only caffeine 66000 ng l found in the gernika wwtp greatly exceeded these concentrations in the case of galindo sulfamethoxazole 8963 ng l trimethoprim 5843 ng l and ciprofloxacin 3803 ng l were the analytes detected at the highest concentrations sucralose 4532 ng l ciprofloxacin 3194 ng l valsartan 1811 ng l and acesulfame 1261 ng l were the analytes detected at the highest concentrations in the case of the gorliz wwtp whereas in the gernika wwtp caffeine 65999 ng l acesulfame 11419 ng l valsartan 9485 ng l and acetaminophen 5460 ng l showed the highest maximum concentration levels genistein 5 597 ng l methylparaben n d 189 ng l and butylparaben mql 100 ng l were only found in the gernika wwtp in general the levels of commonly detected target pharmaceuticals i e trimethoprim diclofenac acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine were in the same range as those detected in europe wide surveys of wwtp effluents beckers et al 2018 loos et al 2013 ciprofloxacin which is highly prescribed for human use was also found with relatively high concentrations 32 4719 ng l despite its high sorption and degradation coefficients boy roura et al 2018 acesulfame sucralose irbesartan eprosartan valsartan and telmisartan which are not so often studied also exhibited high detection rates and high concentrations see table 1 confirming the relevance of their monitoring in fact loos et al 2013 considered the angiotensin ii receptor antagonists ara iis family one of the most relevant emerging contaminants with median concentrations of 480 ng l 368 ng l and 227 ng l and maximum concentrations up to 17900 ng l 4300 ng l and 6800 ng l for irbesartan telmisartan and eprosartan congeners respectively the levels of caffeine typically used as an indicator of the presence of untreated domestic wastewater nödler et al 2016 were much higher in the gernika wwtp than those obtained in galindo and gorliz wwtps see table s1 for wwtp details moreover according to the global distribution of caffeine in effluent samples world wide analysis of 29132 samples rodríguez gil et al 2018 the reported levels in gernika wwtp 1752 65999 ng l would be ranked above the 95th percentile the seasonal patterns at each wwtp were also studied to identify specific features regarding the use of some of the studied contaminants in the case of the wwtp of galindo the highest concentrations were found in summer and winter 2017 in 9 and 8 compounds respectively out of 28 and the lowest in spring 14 out of 28 compounds and winter 2016 in 8 out of 28 compounds in the case of the wwtp of gorliz the distribution of the highest concentrations was evenly observed along all the campaigns and the lowest ones in summer early september and autumn late november it is worth mentioning that in summer seven compounds showed the highest levels acetaminophen butylparaben caffeine carbamazepin propranolol simazine and telmisartan and another seven the lowest ones acesulfame bezafibrate diclofenac diuron losartan sucralose and sulfadiazine which could be related with the seasonal mobility patterns of the population in the surrounding urban areas finally in the wwtp of gernika it is clearly seen that the highest levels were measured in summer in 12 out of 28 and the lowest ones in winter 16 out of 28 3 2 occurrence and distribution of contaminants in the estuaries concentrations in the range of 1 3977 ng l 1 4138 ng l and 1 1092 ng l in the case of the bilbao plentzia and urdaibai estuaries respectively were determined table 2 taking into account the three estuaries caffeine and obt showed the highest detection frequencies above 97 followed by irbesartan 70 telmisartan 68 acetaminophen 54 carbamazepine 52 diclofenac 46 and acesulfame 42 atrazine clofibric acid genistein genistin glycitin imipramine isoproturon pfoa pfosa progesterone simazine and testosterone were not detected above their mqls see table s6 in any sample though the highest concentrations were in general terms detected in the gernika wwtp the levels observed along this estuary were not the highest ones as a consequence of the high dilution effect by tidal intrusion in the estuary caffeine was detected in all the evaluated samples at levels ranging between 8 and 699 ng l 20 362 ng l and 27 1092 ng l for the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively caffeine levels reported in this study are in the same order of magnitude as those reported by alygizakis et al 2016 in saronikog gulf greece in the eastern mediterraneans sea which also receives inputs from wwtps obt a compound widely used as a corrosion inhibitor in many industrial applications as well as in anti icing fluids and in detergents for household dishwashers has been frequently reported in effluents and in rivers at concentrations up to 1000 ng l beckers et al 2018 loos et al 2013 however data on its presence in estuarine environments are scarce the maximum concentrations at offshore from venice 113 ng l in san francisco bay 240 ng l and in baltic sea germany 135 ng l nödler et al 2014 are lower than the values obtained in this work maximum concentrations of 3977 ng l 4138 ng l and 669 ng l in the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively in general the pharmaceutical compounds concentrations measured in the three estuaries are similar to those reported in european estuaries and coastal waters aminot et al 2016 maruya et al 2016 munaron et al 2012 nödler et al 2014 for instance diclofenac and acetaminophen were widely detected at high concentration ranges 1 650 ng l and 54 440 ng l 1 22 and 14 49 ng l and 2 35 ng l and 14 321 ng l in estuaries of bilbao taking into account both surface and bottom water plentzia and urdaibai respectively the european commission recently adopted a watch list decision 495 2015 eu of substances for union wide monitoring in the field of water policy where diclofenac was included it is worth mentioning the detection of pfbs a short chain perfluorinated compound ranging between its mql and 158 ng l and 13 ng l in the estuaries of bilbao and urdaibai respectively besides the detection of pfos in estuary waters non detected n d 28 ng l also indicates that products containing pfoss are still releasing these substances into the environment despite the european restrictions on the marketing and use of this compound in 2006 directive 2006 122 ec concerning herbicides a high overall detection of atrazine was observed in the coastal and surface waters of europe beckers et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 however we only detected diuron in the ranges of 4 81 ng l 2 13 ng l and 3 10 ng l for the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively moreover though diuron is used as active ingredient in antifouling paints as substitutes for tributylin the concentrations detected in this work are similar to those reported in the literature munaron et al 2012 nödler et al 2016 in coastal waters with marinas and or areas with high ship density and those concentrations do not exceed the annual average of the environmental quality standards eqs 0 2 μg l defined by the european commission directive 2013 39 eu the three estuaries showed a similar longitudinal pattern since most concentrations decreased from the upper limit of the estuary to the estuary mouth as it can be seen in the summation of concentrations included in fig 2 a d for the estuaries of bilbao surface and bottom water plentzia and urdaibai respectively in the estuary of bilbao the samples collected at two depths were significantly different analysis of variance p value 0 05 deep and surface water showed two different cumulative presented as sum of contaminants longitudinal distributions see fig 2a and b for surface and bottom water respectively suggesting the presence of two independent sources on the one hand surface water showed the highest cumulative concentrations 2742 5558 ng l at bi 4s which receives the input of the wwtp of galindo with a gradual decrease trend from the wwtp discharge point to the sea and upstream on the contrary in deep waters the highest cumulative concentrations 1044 4050 ng l are coming predominantly from obt corrosion inhibitor 71 93 and the sources were detected close to the estuary mouth at bi 1b and bi 2b where the industrial harbour a marina and passenger ship traffic are located in addition to this the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners were one order of a magnitude higher in the surface water 32 in fall and 75 97 in the rest of seasons for drugs and 57 in fall and 83 97 in the rest of seasons for sweeteners on the contrary higher concentrations of obt see table 2 were observed in deep waters 38 3977 ng l compared to the superficial ones 20 1267 ng l therefore the consequences of a partially mixed estuarine system is observed as well as the impact of the effluent s flowing mostly along the upper layer and bypassing the bottom saline water to the best of our knowledge there are few works thoroughly evaluating the distribution of emerging contaminants in an estuary environment at different depths of the water columns alygizakis et al 2016 lara martín et al 2014 for instance lara martín et al 2014 studied the environmental distribution of nonionic surfactants and pharmaceuticals in the long island sound estuary new york and they found variations in the profile of concentrations consistent with salinity differences alygizakis et al 2016 evaluated the occurrence and spatial distribution of 158 pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in the saronikos gulf athenes mediterranean sea at 3 different depths and amoxicillin caffeine and salicylic acid showed a significant concentration variation with depth in the case of the plentzia estuary since the wwtp discharges to the open sea the effects of this source are hardly seen along the estuary the concentrations measured in the coastal point pl 1 were very low being caffeine 88 362 ng l obt 23 1361 ng l and methylparaben n d 65 ng l the only analytes detected above their mqls in fact the highest cumulative concentrations were found at pl 7 site 11 km upstream of the estuary mouth see fig 2c suggesting a non defined source upstream the estuary the presence of pharmaceuticals acetaminophen 25 40 ng l bezafibrate 3 11 ng l diclofenac n d 22 ng l eprosartan n d 42 ng l irbesartan 20 182 ng l losartan mql 50 ng l phenytoin n d 3 ng l sulfadiazine 2 51 ng l telmisartan 3 83 ng l trimethoprim n d 6 ng l valsartan 51 213 ng l and especially the presence of wwtp effluent marker compounds lange et al 2012 nödler et al 2016 such as carbamazepine 3 45 ng l and acesulfame 9 70 ng l at pl 7 indicates the strong possibility of a non monitored wwtp effluent in the urdaibai estuary a hot spot was located at site ur 3 see fig 2d which receives the discharge from the wwtp effluent upstream of that point at sampling point ur 4 only caffeine mql 120 ng l and obt nd 669 ng l were detected 3 3 statistical analysis and seasonal patterns the pca of the reported data of each estuary was performed independently see tables s3 5 and table s8 12 the mean concentrations at each site depth and campaign plus the physico chemical parameters were included in the pca in the case of the estuary of bilbao up to 3 principal components pcs were enough to explain up to 70 of the variance of the experiments where the first pc pc1 explained up to the 33 of the variance pc2 up to 25 and the pc3 up to 12 fig 3 a shows the pc1 pc2 projection of the loadings and 3b d shows the projection of the scores pc1 vs pc2 pc1 vs pc3 and pc2 vs pc3 in the case of the estuary of bilbao as observed in fig 3a the target chemicals can be clustered in three main groups according to their relationships with the most likely source compounds with non identified sources methylparaben caffeine and obt see figure s1a for obt as example compounds detected at low frequencies and tentatively linked with a wwtp source see figure s1b for amitriptyline as example and compounds with a high detection frequency and closely linked with a wwtp source acesulfame carbamazepine diuron sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim sucralose see figure s1c for carbamazepine as example in fact po4 3 is also clustered in this latter group showing high correlation coefficients r with the concentrations of carbamazepine r in the range of 0 82 0 95 and acesulfame r in the range of 0 79 0 98 since both organic compounds are also recognized as persistent markers of wwtp effluent discharges sun et al 2016a 2016b these results provide a stronger proof of the identification of these sources for the target analytes 76 86 and 81 of the compounds showed a significantly positive correlation with po4 3 in the case of the estuary of bilbao r 0 863 plentzia r 0 714 and urdaibai r 0 854 respectively five analytes acetaminophen caffeine methylparaben obt and pfos showed low r values suggesting the presence of an additional or different input source in the case of acetaminophen and pfos two different sources are identified in the estuary of bilbao a wwtp discharge in spring and summer positive r in the range of 0 71 and 0 86 0 87 for acetaminophen and pfos respectively and a non identified source in bi 3 in winter 2016 and 2017 methylparaben r from 0 600 to 0 237 showed the highest concentrations close to the estuary mouth and harbour sites at the three estuaries lastly in the case of caffeine r from 0 71 to 1 000 and obt r from 0 827 to 0 992 steady emissions were observed at bi 1s b and ur 1 both sampling points close to a harbour marine and at the hot spots of the three estuaries bi 4s pl 7 and ur 3 additionally non specific inputs of caffeine and obt over the whole estuary were observed mainly related to leisure or urban activities in the case of caffeine and shipping activity over the navigable estuary channel in the case of obt the high detection frequencies and wide distribution of both underlines the relevance of their monitoring in estuaries in the estuary of bilbao unlike to the other two estuaries surface and bottom water samples were clustered separately in fall as seen in fig 3a c bottom water showed higher cumulative concentrations in comparison to the other campaigns see fig 2b probably due to a higher mixing rate of the water column see table s3 for water physico chemical parameters among the target analytes the highest levels of acetaminophen and diclofenac were observed during the winter see figure s2a for diclofenac and fall seasons in plentzia and urdaibai probably related to an increased in the consumption of them and decreased biodegradation aminot et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 sun et al 2016a moreover in summer significantly high concentrations anova pvalue 0 05 of amitriptyline bezafibrate ara iis and ciprofloxacin pharmaceuticals were detected in the estuary of bilbao see figure s2b where telmisartan was included as example this fact might be related to the lower flow in this season and the lowest impact of the tidal dilution a similar effect was observed by aminot et al 2016 where the majority of pharmaceuticals exhibited lower in stream attenuation during summer in the estuary of the garonne river in the case of carbamazepine and phenytoin see figure s2c in the case of phenytoin psychiatric drugs which are mainly used to treat epilepsy the highest concentrations were observed during summer and spring at the three estuaries which might be related to a higher prescription and usage in those seasons aminot et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 the same pattern was also observed with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole see figure s2d where sulfamethoxazole is included as example which are often co administered to enhance the treatment against a variety of bacterial infection they showed significantly lower concentrations pvalue 0 05 in summer suggesting a joint prescription of these two antibiotics in the basque country throughout the year beckers et al 2018 also observed a join temporal exposure patterns for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole after analysing the presence of 146 organic micropollutants from two separate wwtp effluents in germany lastly obt see figure s2e and caffeine showed a constant emission with large general variation but we were unable to see a clear pattern probably because of their wide variety of applications and their potential different sources 3 4 passive sampling results the concentrations obtained from the pocis were included together with the grab sampling concentrations days 0th 14th and 28th in table s13 grab sampling and twa concentrations in water ng l are only shown for compounds for whose rs values were previously determined mijangos et al 2018b the highest concentrations ranges obtained with passive samplers were observed in the upstream site in bilbao bi 4 progesterone 2 ng l telmisartan 3118 ng l and in urdaibai ur 3 amitriptyline 1 telmisartan 1088 ng l followed by plentzia pl 3 1 0 ng l amitriptyline obt 530 ng l and the harbor of bilbao bi 2 bezafibrate 0 9 ng l caffeine 129 ng l from the 21 monitored compounds by passive sampling ketoprofen pfbs pfos and progesterone were exclusively quantified by passive sampling on the contrary only atrazine butylparaben pfoa and phenytoin were not quantifiable at any sampling site with the passive sampling approach finally though we were able to identify genistein glycitin and clofibric acid in the pocis we could not estimate their ctwa since we lacked their sampling rates rs therefore we can highlight the need for further pocis calibration to include these compounds the comparison between twa concentrations and direct ones days 0th 14th and 28th showed a good agreement in all the estuaries only two compounds caffeine 416 ng l in pocis vs 22 174 ng l with grab sample in plentzia and progesterone 26 ng l in pocis vs n d 8 ng l with grab sample in urdaibai showed higher concentrations with pocis than with active sampling see fig 4 a and b for the estuaries of plentzia and urdaibai respectively pocis has been used primarily for continental surface water monitoring or sewage discharges harman et al 2012 and few works munaron et al 2012 shi et al 2014 have used pocis as a tool to monitor emerging contaminants in estuarine environments since they can be highly dynamic the concentrations measured here by spot sampling over 3 different days fluctuated less than 35 in the case of the estuary of bilbao taking into account both sampling points and more than 56 and 91 for plentzia and urdaibai estuaries respectively therefore it is clear from this study that pocis provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long time period 3 5 environmental risk assessment concerning the toxicity database selection most of the literature works related to emerging compounds toxicity focused on fresh water organisms alygizakis et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 ma et al 2017 however in this work bioassays carried out with marine representative organisms were also taken into consideration to include the effects of the measured contaminants in estuarine ecosystems from the evaluated initial dataset 833 for lc50s ec50s and 904 for noecs values only 27 of the bioassays reported were performed in seawater furthermore measured data were favoured over qsar based ones due to the limitations of the qsar models to account for a large variety of chemical structures busch et al 2016 tables s14 and s15 show the most sensitive noec and acute l e c50 values respectively reported for the studied contaminants and for target species zebra danio water flea copepod bivalve sea urchin water flea green algae haptophyte and cyanobecteria and test media fresh water and sea water chronic data were available only for 21 of the 41 target compounds whereas acute toxicological data were missed only for clomipramine imipramine and nortriptyline european guidelines ec 2003 recommend the use of chronic toxicity to calculate pnec values as they are most likely to induce chronic effects rather than acute ones however due to the current limited availability of chronic toxicity data short term ec50 and lc50 values are widely used to estimate pnec values and therefore the potential adverse effects to aquatic organisms beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 criteria for interpreting the rq values in order to establish different levels of environmental risk were low risk rq values below to 0 1 medium risk rq values between 0 1 and 1 and high risk rq values higher than 1 alygizakis et al 2016 ec 2003 ma et al 2017 rq values of the detected compounds are summarized in tables s16 and s17 regarding the chronic toxicity as can be seen in fig 5 a and b for wwtp effluent and estuary samples respectively caffeine diclofenac bezafibrate sulfadiazine and genistein are the compounds that showed the most negative impact it is worth mentioning the impact of caffeine detection frequency of 99 and the fact that its main source is not only related to wwtp effluents rq values obtained for pharmaceutical compounds are consistent with other rqs reported in the literature beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 among them the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac was previously identified as one of the main risk drivers in environmental mixtures beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 and has been associated with growth inhibition in daphnia and cell multiplication in algae see table s14 compounds detected at low concentrations and frequency as genistein only detected in effluent samples at maximum concentrations of 5 597 ng l could imply a higher acute risk due to their higher toxicity see fig 5a moreover pfos also showed a rqacute 0 1 although the maximum detected concentrations during the monitoring campaign 28 ng l and 168 ng l for estuary and effluent samples respectively did not exceed its established environmental quality standard maximum allowable concentration 7200 ng l directive 2013 39 eu regarding the acute toxicity in at least one of the evaluated sample points telmisartan eprosartan irbesartan diuron caffeine valsartan diclofenac sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole losartan norfloxacin simazine atrazine genistein and ketoprofen showed a rqacute 1 while isoproturon ciprofloxacin bezafibrate acetaminophen phenytoin trimethoprim pfos propranolol and amitriptyline showed a rqacute 0 1 fig 5c and d for effluent and estuary samples respectively in this work three sartans compounds telmisartan eprosartan and irbesartan were ranked as the most toxic compounds on the bases of rqacute estimation similar results were also found by busch et al 2016 from a list of 214 top toxic compounds although the occurrence of sartans has been reported before loos et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there are no measured l e 50 values and in this work their rq ranking relies only on toxicity estimations that are retrieved from qsar prediction busch et al 2016 therefore they should be included in further monitoring campaigns as well as in bioassays norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine also showed high rqacute values these results are in agreement with ma et al 2017 where sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole rqs ranging from 1 0 to 9 2 were identified as the antibiotics with the higher ecological risks besides it is noteworthy that the aquatic risk assessment pointed out a highly possible risk in all the sites where diuron simazine and atrazine were detected see table 1 and table 2 for the concentrations even if the annual average environmental quality standard values for them eqs 0 2 1 μg l established by directive 2013 39 ec were not exceeded lastly in the case of obt rqacute values 0 1 were only obtained in the estuary samples confirming the importance of monitoring not only wwtps but also other potential sources such as harbors in any case it should be underlined that rqs act as a normalized measurement of risk allowing a comparison between different compounds with different toxicities and exposure levels and thereby it might be a good starting point for further prioritization 4 conclusions the analysis of a wide number of emerging contaminants in three estuaries and three wwtp effluents allowed us to describe the complexity of the studied scenarios the time and space distribution of the studied contaminants allowed us to identify that one of the most likely sources are the urban wastes released by the wwtps though other remarkable contributions such as the harbour activities were also identified it is important to emphasize that wwtps are important secondary sources of anthropogenic compounds and the composition of their effluents depend on the primary urban inputs and the efficiency of the treatments in this sense the confirmation of valuable markers of these effluents has also been highlighted to identify non monitored effluents in addition to these we can also pinpoint the utility of passive samplers because they allowed us to estimate twa concentrations of a number of contaminants and to detect contaminants that would have not been measured by active sampling methods besides based on the estimated rq values the contaminants were ranked in terms of their acute and chronic toxic effects to complement their occurrence data along the estuaries and their most likely sources on the one hand well known pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac show high acute and chronic effects but ubiquitous caffeine seems to be a contaminant of increasing concern on the other hand the estimated toxicity of the antihypertensive drugs sartans together with their detection frequency in effluents and estuaries are warning evidences of their environmental impact

19240,in this study the spatial and temporal distribution of 41 multiclass organic compounds were assessed in three estuaries of the basque country from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab active sampling methods and an extra campaign combining both grab and passive sampling methods wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents were also evaluated to assess their impact on the estuaries moreover the physicochemical features phosphate and nitrate concentrations ph etc of each site were measured and included in the statistical analysis anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac and acetaminophen hypertensive drugs irbesartan and valsartan a stimulant caffeine an artificial sweetener acesulfame and a corrosion inhibitor 2 hydroxybenzothiazole were the most ubiquitous compounds due to the stratification of the waters in the estuary of bilbao two independent sources were identified wwtp and harbour activities in the case of gernika and plentzia both are estuaries with a high tidal dilution and the main sources were localized in the effluents of the wwtps in addition to this the use of pocis provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long sampling period finally risk quotient rq values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined at each estuary and wwtp effluent for acute and chronic effects in the case of acute toxicity the highest rq values 1 were obtained for the angiotensin ii receptor blockers telmisartan eprosartan etc diuron and diclofenac in the case of the chronic toxicity the highest rq values 1

growing interest since most of the chemicals considered are unregulated and the effects that might be attributed to many of them are missed or overlooked in many monitoring and surveillance programs ternes et al 2015 among these emerging contaminants we may find many different chemicals including personal care products and pharmaceuticals pcpps consumption products food additives detergents etc industrial compounds perfluoroalkyl substances pfass plasticizers etc pesticides and engineered nano materials though we can find many of these contaminants in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in agriculture surface run offs and in industrial discharges the impact of the former ones from urban areas i e wwtp effluents is especially remarkable prasse et al 2015 as a consequence rivers estuaries and coastal ecosystems are under the influence of chronic exposures to many emerging contaminants environmental monitoring of special sensitive areas such as estuaries has become a challenge owing to the complexity of the analytical end points a growing amount of target candidates at trace level a high physical and chemical dynamism in estuaries and coastal areas an unknown number of transformation products etc and the potential effects antibiotic resistance endocrine disruption mutagenicity etc maruya et al 2016 although the application of the current legal framework i e the water framework directive wfd and the marine strategy framework directive msfd is somewhat limited by the prioritized set of contaminants and the application of compliance methods we can also widen those limits by a thorough application of screening and non target methods and new effect based bio analytical approaches busch et al 2016 brack et al 2017 in this work we consider the application of recently developed procedures for the simultaneous analysis of 41 emerging contaminants and for the calibration of polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis of those emerging contaminants mijangos et al 2018a 2018b in several estuaries of the basque country because there was a clear lack of analytical data and a high uncertainty about the real impact of many of these contaminants though some recent works described a general assessment about the health status cajaraville et al 2016 or the anthropogenic drivers in bacterial communities of the bilbao estuary aguirre et al 2017 the occurrence of emerging contaminants is still missed in addition to this estuary we also extended this study to the estuaries of urdaibai gernika and plentzia because they fit with completely different geophysical and urban features valencia et al 2004 in this sense the occurrence of 41 emerging contaminants was analyzed from winter 2016 to winter 2017 by grab sampling with an extra campaign carried out in spring 2017 combining both grab and passive sampling protocols the main wwtp effluents of each estuary were also monitored to assess the impact of these effluents on the average loading of the estuaries finally we ranked the contaminants in terms of their acute and chronic toxic effects based on the estimated risk quotient values ec 2003 2 experimental section 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 a three estuaries bilbao bi plentzia pl and urdaibai ur of the basque country were selected for this study and between 4 and 7 sampling sites were chosen at each estuary fig 1b d those sites were selected along a longitudinal gradient from the sea to upstream taking into account the general features of each estuary in the particular case of the estuary of bilbao water samples were collected at two depths surface and bottom water due to the high stratification observed in this estuary in addition to this the effluents of the main wwtps of each estuary i e galindo in bilbao gorliz in plentzia and gernika in urdaibai were also monitored an overview of the selected sampling sites is given in table s1 of the supplementary material sm the estuary of bilbao is 15 km long and an average 100 m wide and the depth ranges between 2 m upper estuary and 30 m estuary mouth the estuary is partially mixed in the outer part and highly stratified within the inner half with average tidal ranges between 1 2 m and 4 6 m and crosses the metropolitan area of bilbao 1 000 000 inhabitants currently major pollution inputs have been related with the harbour activities and urban discharges from the wwtp of galindo the biggest wwtp in the basque country and one of the largest in spain the estuary of plentzia is classified as a mesotidal system with a tidal variation of 2 5 m being exposed 80 of the estuary at lowtide the presence of a dam 10 km upstream from the sea in the upper part of the estuary limits the intertidal area major pollution inputs can be related to leisure shipping traffic and urban discharges the gorliz wwtp located in the mouth of the estuary collects urban wastewater from 10 000 inhabitants featured by an increase in population during the summer period but it releases the effluent out the estuary mouth through a submarine pipe located at 1000 m from the coast and 18 m depth the estuary of urdaibai reserve of the biosphere declared by unesco since 1984 is formed by the tidal part of the oka river with 11 6 km long and 1 km wide alluvial valley valencia et al 2004 the estuary is impacted by urban inputs especially from the direct discharge of the wwtp of gernika to the oka river fisheries industrial activities metallurgic motoring and shipyards and leisure activities 2 2 reagents and materials the selection of the target pollutants was carried out taking into account their presence and relevance in the environment busch et al 2016 according to these criteria 41 organic pollutants with urban rural and industrial use among several classes artificial sweeteners corrosion inhibitors hormones pcps pfass pesticides pharmaceuticals and phytoestrogens were selected compound families names cas numbers molecular formulas and other relevant physicochemical properties for all the target compounds are summarized in table s2 suppliers for each target analyte are also listed in table s2 all chemicals and labworks are provided in section 1 of the sm 2 3 water sample collection and treatment five sampling campaigns were undertaken between february 2016 and february 2017 winter 2016 february 24 march 18 spring may 31 jun 2 summer september 8 september 12 fall november 11 november 30 and winter 2017 february 16 february 23 for each sampling campaign samples were collected along a salinity gradient from the sea up to the non tidal zone always at high tide surface water near 50 cm and depth water near the bottom were collected by means of van dorn and niskin bottles kc denmark a s 2l respectively an exo2 multiparametric probe was deployed during the sampling for in situ measuring of depth ph oxidation reduction potential orp temperature conductivity salinity total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen concentration do along the water column the rest of the parameters were determined in the laboratory non purgable organic carbon npoc was determined using a toc vcsn shimadzu corporation kyoto japan which is based on total oxidation on a platinum catalyst at a temperature of 680 c the concentrations of ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 were evaluated potentiometrically using the standard additions method with an ion selective electrode and silicate si oh 4 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined using molybdenum blue based flow injection analysis methods with uv vis spectrophotometric detection kortazar et al 2016 the physico chemical properties measured are summarized in tables s3 s5 in sm regarding to the analysis of organic pollutants effluents and estuary water samples were transferred to pre cleaned polypropylene pp bottles transported to the laboratory in cooled boxes and kept in the fridge at 4 c before analysis the analyses were performed within 24 h after sampling a previously validated solid phase extraction spe method mijangos et al 2018a was used for the extraction of the samples as thoroughly described in section 2 of the sm 2 4 passive sampling in march april 2017 pocis devices were deployed at the estuaries of bilbao bi 2b and bi 4b plentzia pl 3 and urdaibai ur 3 as shown in fig 1b d at each site a canister containing two pocis was deployed at 50 100 cm below the surface and two consecutive deployments of 14 days were carried out pocis were prepared according to the procedure described previously mijangos et al 2018b pocis were transported at 4 c to the lab and stored at 20 c before being processed the analytical procedure followed to analyse the pocis is briefly described in section 2 of the sm one transport blank was performed per sampling day and simultaneously water samples were taken in pp bottles from the sampling sites before each deployment and after the last retrieval 0th 14th and 28th days water samples were carried to the laboratory in cooled boxes and kept at 4 c before analysis which was performed within 24 h according to a previously validated spe procedure mijangos et al 2018a described in

hydroxybenzothiazole obt nonafluorobutanesulfonate pfbs perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos phenytoin progesterone and telmisartan were calculated based on the sampling

water are included in table s6 according to the previously published work mijangos et al 2018a although the analytical method used in this work was previously developed and validated procedural blanks and control samples samples spiked at known concentration were analyzed every 20 samples values lower than mqls were obtained in the case of blanks and apparent recoveries were in agreement with those reported before mijangos et al 2018a 2 7 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca of the data was performed using the unscrambler software v 9 2 6 camo norway prior to any data treatment the responses were normalized and centred and the models were built using cross validation esbensen et al 2002 a pca of the data included in tables s3 5 and s8 12 was performed 2 8 environmental risk assessment era era was carried out using a risk quotient rq according to the european union technical guidance document ec 2003 in this study rqs for acute and chronic effects were calculated for each compound as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec maximum values obtained along the monitoring period for each compound at each estuary and effluent samples were used as mec values which represent the worst case scenario alygizakis et al 2016 ma et al 2017 pnec values were calculated dividing the lowest chronic or acute toxicity data available from the ecotoxicology knowledge base ecotox database https cfpub epa gov ecotox for several target species representing different trophic levels algae bacteria invertebrates and fish by an assessment factor af the reference values were chosen considering the effects on growth population reproduction and behaviour and both fresh water and marine species were considered for sub lethal chronic toxicity levels no observed effect concentrations noec were used and the applied af values were 1000 100 50 and 10 depending on the data available ec 2003 for acute toxicity levels the effect concentration ec50 or the lethal concentration lc50 was used and the af was 1000 alygizakis et al 2016 ma et al 2017 l e c50s were based on either measured acute concentrations retrieved from the ecotox database or when the data was missing by qsar models as described by busch et al 2016 details on the selected noecs and l e c50s values are shown in tables s14 and s15 3 results and discussion the minimum maximum and median analyte concentrations ng l and detection frequencies of the target compounds determined in each wwtp effluent and estuary are summarised in tables 1 and 2 respectively out of the total 41 compounds 35 compounds were detected in at least one effluent sample and 36 in at least one estuary sample clofibric acid genistin glycitin imipramine pfoa and perfluoroctylsulfonamide pfosa were below their mqls in most of the samples 3 1 occurrence and seasonal distribution in the wwtps concerning wwtps concentration levels were ranged between low ng l levels to 8963 ng l 4532 ng l and 11419 ng l in the case of galindo gorliz and gernika wwtps respectively only caffeine 66000 ng l found in the gernika wwtp greatly exceeded these concentrations in the case of galindo sulfamethoxazole 8963 ng l trimethoprim 5843 ng l and ciprofloxacin 3803 ng l were the analytes detected at the highest concentrations sucralose 4532 ng l ciprofloxacin 3194 ng l valsartan 1811 ng l and acesulfame 1261 ng l were the analytes detected at the highest concentrations in the case of the gorliz wwtp whereas in the gernika wwtp caffeine 65999 ng l acesulfame 11419 ng l valsartan 9485 ng l and acetaminophen 5460 ng l showed the highest maximum concentration levels genistein 5 597 ng l methylparaben n d 189 ng l and butylparaben mql 100 ng l were only found in the gernika wwtp in general the levels of commonly detected target pharmaceuticals i e trimethoprim diclofenac acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine were in the same range as those detected in europe wide surveys of wwtp effluents beckers et al 2018 loos et al 2013 ciprofloxacin which is highly prescribed for human use was also found with relatively high concentrations 32 4719 ng l despite its high sorption and degradation coefficients boy roura et al 2018 acesulfame sucralose irbesartan eprosartan valsartan and telmisartan which are not so often studied also exhibited high detection rates and high concentrations see table 1 confirming the relevance of their monitoring in fact loos et al 2013 considered the angiotensin ii receptor antagonists ara iis family one of the most relevant emerging contaminants with median concentrations of 480 ng l 368 ng l and 227 ng l and maximum concentrations up to 17900 ng l 4300 ng l and 6800 ng l for irbesartan telmisartan and eprosartan congeners respectively the levels of caffeine typically used as an indicator of the presence of untreated domestic wastewater nödler et al 2016 were much higher in the gernika wwtp than those obtained in galindo and gorliz wwtps see table s1 for wwtp details moreover according to the global distribution of caffeine in effluent samples world wide analysis of 29132 samples rodríguez gil et al 2018 the reported levels in gernika wwtp 1752 65999 ng l would be ranked above the 95th percentile the seasonal patterns at each wwtp were also studied to identify specific features regarding the use of some of the studied contaminants in the case of the wwtp of galindo the highest concentrations were found in summer and winter 2017 in 9 and 8 compounds respectively out of 28 and the lowest in spring 14 out of 28 compounds and winter 2016 in 8 out of 28 compounds in the case of the wwtp of gorliz the distribution of the highest concentrations was evenly observed along all the campaigns and the lowest ones in summer early september and autumn late november it is worth mentioning that in summer seven compounds showed the highest levels acetaminophen butylparaben caffeine carbamazepin propranolol simazine and telmisartan and another seven the lowest ones acesulfame bezafibrate diclofenac diuron losartan sucralose and sulfadiazine which could be related with the seasonal mobility patterns of the population in the surrounding urban areas finally in the wwtp of gernika it is clearly seen that the highest levels were measured in summer in 12 out of 28 and the lowest ones in winter 16 out of 28 3 2 occurrence and distribution of contaminants in the estuaries concentrations in the range of 1 3977 ng l 1 4138 ng l and 1 1092 ng l in the case of the bilbao plentzia and urdaibai estuaries respectively were determined table 2 taking into account the three estuaries caffeine and obt showed the highest detection frequencies above 97 followed by irbesartan 70 telmisartan 68 acetaminophen 54 carbamazepine 52 diclofenac 46 and acesulfame 42 atrazine clofibric acid genistein genistin glycitin imipramine isoproturon pfoa pfosa progesterone simazine and testosterone were not detected above their mqls see table s6 in any sample though the highest concentrations were in general terms detected in the gernika wwtp the levels observed along this estuary were not the highest ones as a consequence of the high dilution effect by tidal intrusion in the estuary caffeine was detected in all the evaluated samples at levels ranging between 8 and 699 ng l 20 362 ng l and 27 1092 ng l for the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively caffeine levels reported in this study are in the same order of magnitude as those reported by alygizakis et al 2016 in saronikog gulf greece in the eastern mediterraneans sea which also receives inputs from wwtps obt a compound widely used as a corrosion inhibitor in many industrial applications as well as in anti icing fluids and in detergents for household dishwashers has been frequently reported in effluents and in rivers at concentrations up to 1000 ng l beckers et al 2018 loos et al 2013 however data on its presence in estuarine environments are scarce the maximum concentrations at offshore from venice 113 ng l in san francisco bay 240 ng l and in baltic sea germany 135 ng l nödler et al 2014 are lower than the values obtained in this work maximum concentrations of 3977 ng l 4138 ng l and 669 ng l in the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively in general the pharmaceutical compounds concentrations measured in the three estuaries are similar to those reported in european estuaries and coastal waters aminot et al 2016 maruya et al 2016 munaron et al 2012 nödler et al 2014 for instance diclofenac and acetaminophen were widely detected at high concentration ranges 1 650 ng l and 54 440 ng l 1 22 and 14 49 ng l and 2 35 ng l and 14 321 ng l in estuaries of bilbao taking into account both surface and bottom water plentzia and urdaibai respectively the european commission recently adopted a watch list decision 495 2015 eu of substances for union wide monitoring in the field of water policy where diclofenac was included it is worth mentioning the detection of pfbs a short chain perfluorinated compound ranging between its mql and 158 ng l and 13 ng l in the estuaries of bilbao and urdaibai respectively besides the detection of pfos in estuary waters non detected n d 28 ng l also indicates that products containing pfoss are still releasing these substances into the environment despite the european restrictions on the marketing and use of this compound in 2006 directive 2006 122 ec concerning herbicides a high overall detection of atrazine was observed in the coastal and surface waters of europe beckers et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 however we only detected diuron in the ranges of 4 81 ng l 2 13 ng l and 3 10 ng l for the estuaries of bilbao plentzia and urdaibai respectively moreover though diuron is used as active ingredient in antifouling paints as substitutes for tributylin the concentrations detected in this work are similar to those reported in the literature munaron et al 2012 nödler et al 2016 in coastal waters with marinas and or areas with high ship density and those concentrations do not exceed the annual average of the environmental quality standards eqs 0 2 μg l defined by the european commission directive 2013 39 eu the three estuaries showed a similar longitudinal pattern since most concentrations decreased from the upper limit of the estuary to the estuary mouth as it can be seen in the summation of concentrations included in fig 2 a d for the estuaries of bilbao surface and bottom water plentzia and urdaibai respectively in the estuary of bilbao the samples collected at two depths were significantly different analysis of variance p value 0 05 deep and surface water showed two different cumulative presented as sum of contaminants longitudinal distributions see fig 2a and b for surface and bottom water respectively suggesting the presence of two independent sources on the one hand surface water showed the highest cumulative concentrations 2742 5558 ng l at bi 4s which receives the input of the wwtp of galindo with a gradual decrease trend from the wwtp discharge point to the sea and upstream on the contrary in deep waters the highest cumulative concentrations 1044 4050 ng l are coming predominantly from obt corrosion inhibitor 71 93 and the sources were detected close to the estuary mouth at bi 1b and bi 2b where the industrial harbour a marina and passenger ship traffic are located in addition to this the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners were one order of a magnitude higher in the surface water 32 in fall and 75 97 in the rest of seasons for drugs and 57 in fall and 83 97 in the rest of seasons for sweeteners on the contrary higher concentrations of obt see table 2 were observed in deep waters 38 3977 ng l compared to the superficial ones 20 1267 ng l therefore the consequences of a partially mixed estuarine system is observed as well as the impact of the effluent s flowing mostly along the upper layer and bypassing the bottom saline water to the best of our knowledge there are few works thoroughly evaluating the distribution of emerging contaminants in an estuary environment at different depths of the water columns alygizakis et al 2016 lara martín et al 2014 for instance lara martín et al 2014 studied the environmental distribution of nonionic surfactants and pharmaceuticals in the long island sound estuary new york and they found variations in the profile of concentrations consistent with salinity differences alygizakis et al 2016 evaluated the occurrence and spatial distribution of 158 pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in the saronikos gulf athenes mediterranean sea at 3 different depths and amoxicillin caffeine and salicylic acid showed a significant concentration variation with depth in the case of the plentzia estuary since the wwtp discharges to the open sea the effects of this source are hardly seen along the estuary the concentrations measured in the coastal point pl 1 were very low being caffeine 88 362 ng l obt 23 1361 ng l and methylparaben n d 65 ng l the only analytes detected above their mqls in fact the highest cumulative concentrations were found at pl 7 site 11 km upstream of the estuary mouth see fig 2c suggesting a non defined source upstream the estuary the presence of pharmaceuticals acetaminophen 25 40 ng l bezafibrate 3 11 ng l diclofenac n d 22 ng l eprosartan n d 42 ng l irbesartan 20 182 ng l losartan mql 50 ng l phenytoin n d 3 ng l sulfadiazine 2 51 ng l telmisartan 3 83 ng l trimethoprim n d 6 ng l valsartan 51 213 ng l and especially the presence of wwtp effluent marker compounds lange et al 2012 nödler et al 2016 such as carbamazepine 3 45 ng l and acesulfame 9 70 ng l at pl 7 indicates the strong possibility of a non monitored wwtp effluent in the urdaibai estuary a hot spot was located at site ur 3 see fig 2d which receives the discharge from the wwtp effluent upstream of that point at sampling point ur 4 only caffeine mql 120 ng l and obt nd 669 ng l were detected 3 3 statistical analysis and seasonal patterns the pca of the reported data of each estuary was performed independently see tables s3 5 and table s8 12 the mean concentrations at each site depth and campaign plus the physico chemical parameters were included in the pca in the case of the estuary of bilbao up to 3 principal components pcs were enough to explain up to 70 of the variance of the experiments where the first pc pc1 explained up to the 33 of the variance pc2 up to 25 and the pc3 up to 12 fig 3 a shows the pc1 pc2 projection of the loadings and 3b d shows the projection of the scores pc1 vs pc2 pc1 vs pc3 and pc2 vs pc3 in the case of the estuary of bilbao as observed in fig 3a the target chemicals can be clustered in three main groups according to their relationships with the most likely source compounds with non identified sources methylparaben caffeine and obt see figure s1a for obt as example compounds detected at low frequencies and tentatively linked with a wwtp source see figure s1b for amitriptyline as example and compounds with a high detection frequency and closely linked with a wwtp source acesulfame carbamazepine diuron sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim sucralose see figure s1c for carbamazepine as example in fact po4 3 is also clustered in this latter group showing high correlation coefficients r with the concentrations of carbamazepine r in the range of 0 82 0 95 and acesulfame r in the range of 0 79 0 98 since both organic compounds are also recognized as persistent markers of wwtp effluent discharges sun et al 2016a 2016b these results provide a stronger proof of the identification of these sources for the target analytes 76 86 and 81 of the compounds showed a significantly positive correlation with po4 3 in the case of the estuary of bilbao r 0 863 plentzia r 0 714 and urdaibai r 0 854 respectively five analytes acetaminophen caffeine methylparaben obt and pfos showed low r values suggesting the presence of an additional or different input source in the case of acetaminophen and pfos two different sources are identified in the estuary of bilbao a wwtp discharge in spring and summer positive r in the range of 0 71 and 0 86 0 87 for acetaminophen and pfos respectively and a non identified source in bi 3 in winter 2016 and 2017 methylparaben r from 0 600 to 0 237 showed the highest concentrations close to the estuary mouth and harbour sites at the three estuaries lastly in the case of caffeine r from 0 71 to 1 000 and obt r from 0 827 to 0 992 steady emissions were observed at bi 1s b and ur 1 both sampling points close to a harbour marine and at the hot spots of the three estuaries bi 4s pl 7 and ur 3 additionally non specific inputs of caffeine and obt over the whole estuary were observed mainly related to leisure or urban activities in the case of caffeine and shipping activity over the navigable estuary channel in the case of obt the high detection frequencies and wide distribution of both underlines the relevance of their monitoring in estuaries in the estuary of bilbao unlike to the other two estuaries surface and bottom water samples were clustered separately in fall as seen in fig 3a c bottom water showed higher cumulative concentrations in comparison to the other campaigns see fig 2b probably due to a higher mixing rate of the water column see table s3 for water physico chemical parameters among the target analytes the highest levels of acetaminophen and diclofenac were observed during the winter see figure s2a for diclofenac and fall seasons in plentzia and urdaibai probably related to an increased in the consumption of them and decreased biodegradation aminot et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 sun et al 2016a moreover in summer significantly high concentrations anova pvalue 0 05 of amitriptyline bezafibrate ara iis and ciprofloxacin pharmaceuticals were detected in the estuary of bilbao see figure s2b where telmisartan was included as example this fact might be related to the lower flow in this season and the lowest impact of the tidal dilution a similar effect was observed by aminot et al 2016 where the majority of pharmaceuticals exhibited lower in stream attenuation during summer in the estuary of the garonne river in the case of carbamazepine and phenytoin see figure s2c in the case of phenytoin psychiatric drugs which are mainly used to treat epilepsy the highest concentrations were observed during summer and spring at the three estuaries which might be related to a higher prescription and usage in those seasons aminot et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 the same pattern was also observed with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole see figure s2d where sulfamethoxazole is included as example which are often co administered to enhance the treatment against a variety of bacterial infection they showed significantly lower concentrations pvalue 0 05 in summer suggesting a joint prescription of these two antibiotics in the basque country throughout the year beckers et al 2018 also observed a join temporal exposure patterns for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole after analysing the presence of 146 organic micropollutants from two separate wwtp effluents in germany lastly obt see figure s2e and caffeine showed a constant emission with large general variation but we were unable to see a clear pattern probably because of their wide variety of applications and their potential different sources 3 4 passive sampling results the concentrations obtained from the pocis were included together with the grab sampling concentrations days 0th 14th and 28th in table s13 grab sampling and twa concentrations in water ng l are only shown for compounds for whose rs values were previously determined mijangos et al 2018b the highest concentrations ranges obtained with passive samplers were observed in the upstream site in bilbao bi 4 progesterone 2 ng l telmisartan 3118 ng l and in urdaibai ur 3 amitriptyline 1 telmisartan 1088 ng l followed by plentzia pl 3 1 0 ng l amitriptyline obt 530 ng l and the harbor of bilbao bi 2 bezafibrate 0 9 ng l caffeine 129 ng l from the 21 monitored compounds by passive sampling ketoprofen pfbs pfos and progesterone were exclusively quantified by passive sampling on the contrary only atrazine butylparaben pfoa and phenytoin were not quantifiable at any sampling site with the passive sampling approach finally though we were able to identify genistein glycitin and clofibric acid in the pocis we could not estimate their ctwa since we lacked their sampling rates rs therefore we can highlight the need for further pocis calibration to include these compounds the comparison between twa concentrations and direct ones days 0th 14th and 28th showed a good agreement in all the estuaries only two compounds caffeine 416 ng l in pocis vs 22 174 ng l with grab sample in plentzia and progesterone 26 ng l in pocis vs n d 8 ng l with grab sample in urdaibai showed higher concentrations with pocis than with active sampling see fig 4 a and b for the estuaries of plentzia and urdaibai respectively pocis has been used primarily for continental surface water monitoring or sewage discharges harman et al 2012 and few works munaron et al 2012 shi et al 2014 have used pocis as a tool to monitor emerging contaminants in estuarine environments since they can be highly dynamic the concentrations measured here by spot sampling over 3 different days fluctuated less than 35 in the case of the estuary of bilbao taking into account both sampling points and more than 56 and 91 for plentzia and urdaibai estuaries respectively therefore it is clear from this study that pocis provides an efficient way to monitor emerging pollutants over a relatively long time period 3 5 environmental risk assessment concerning the toxicity database selection most of the literature works related to emerging compounds toxicity focused on fresh water organisms alygizakis et al 2016 beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 ma et al 2017 however in this work bioassays carried out with marine representative organisms were also taken into consideration to include the effects of the measured contaminants in estuarine ecosystems from the evaluated initial dataset 833 for lc50s ec50s and 904 for noecs values only 27 of the bioassays reported were performed in seawater furthermore measured data were favoured over qsar based ones due to the limitations of the qsar models to account for a large variety of chemical structures busch et al 2016 tables s14 and s15 show the most sensitive noec and acute l e c50 values respectively reported for the studied contaminants and for target species zebra danio water flea copepod bivalve sea urchin water flea green algae haptophyte and cyanobecteria and test media fresh water and sea water chronic data were available only for 21 of the 41 target compounds whereas acute toxicological data were missed only for clomipramine imipramine and nortriptyline european guidelines ec 2003 recommend the use of chronic toxicity to calculate pnec values as they are most likely to induce chronic effects rather than acute ones however due to the current limited availability of chronic toxicity data short term ec50 and lc50 values are widely used to estimate pnec values and therefore the potential adverse effects to aquatic organisms beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 criteria for interpreting the rq values in order to establish different levels of environmental risk were low risk rq values below to 0 1 medium risk rq values between 0 1 and 1 and high risk rq values higher than 1 alygizakis et al 2016 ec 2003 ma et al 2017 rq values of the detected compounds are summarized in tables s16 and s17 regarding the chronic toxicity as can be seen in fig 5 a and b for wwtp effluent and estuary samples respectively caffeine diclofenac bezafibrate sulfadiazine and genistein are the compounds that showed the most negative impact it is worth mentioning the impact of caffeine detection frequency of 99 and the fact that its main source is not only related to wwtp effluents rq values obtained for pharmaceutical compounds are consistent with other rqs reported in the literature beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 among them the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac was previously identified as one of the main risk drivers in environmental mixtures beckers et al 2018 busch et al 2016 and has been associated with growth inhibition in daphnia and cell multiplication in algae see table s14 compounds detected at low concentrations and frequency as genistein only detected in effluent samples at maximum concentrations of 5 597 ng l could imply a higher acute risk due to their higher toxicity see fig 5a moreover pfos also showed a rqacute 0 1 although the maximum detected concentrations during the monitoring campaign 28 ng l and 168 ng l for estuary and effluent samples respectively did not exceed its established environmental quality standard maximum allowable concentration 7200 ng l directive 2013 39 eu regarding the acute toxicity in at least one of the evaluated sample points telmisartan eprosartan irbesartan diuron caffeine valsartan diclofenac sulfadiazine sulfamethoxazole losartan norfloxacin simazine atrazine genistein and ketoprofen showed a rqacute 1 while isoproturon ciprofloxacin bezafibrate acetaminophen phenytoin trimethoprim pfos propranolol and amitriptyline showed a rqacute 0 1 fig 5c and d for effluent and estuary samples respectively in this work three sartans compounds telmisartan eprosartan and irbesartan were ranked as the most toxic compounds on the bases of rqacute estimation similar results were also found by busch et al 2016 from a list of 214 top toxic compounds although the occurrence of sartans has been reported before loos et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there are no measured l e 50 values and in this work their rq ranking relies only on toxicity estimations that are retrieved from qsar prediction busch et al 2016 therefore they should be included in further monitoring campaigns as well as in bioassays norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine also showed high rqacute values these results are in agreement with ma et al 2017 where sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole rqs ranging from 1 0 to 9 2 were identified as the antibiotics with the higher ecological risks besides it is noteworthy that the aquatic risk assessment pointed out a highly possible risk in all the sites where diuron simazine and atrazine were detected see table 1 and table 2 for the concentrations even if the annual average environmental quality standard values for them eqs 0 2 1 μg l established by directive 2013 39 ec were not exceeded lastly in the case of obt rqacute values 0 1 were only obtained in the estuary samples confirming the importance of monitoring not only wwtps but also other potential sources such as harbors in any case it should be underlined that rqs act as a normalized measurement of risk allowing a comparison between different compounds with different toxicities and exposure levels and thereby it might be a good starting point for further prioritization 4 conclusions the analysis of a wide number of emerging contaminants in three estuaries and three wwtp effluents allowed us to describe the complexity of the studied scenarios the time and space distribution of the studied contaminants allowed us to identify that one of the most likely sources are the urban wastes released by the wwtps though other remarkable contributions such as the harbour activities were also identified it is important to emphasize that wwtps are important secondary sources of anthropogenic compounds and the composition of their effluents depend on the primary urban inputs and the efficiency of the treatments in this sense the confirmation of valuable markers of these effluents has also been highlighted to identify non monitored effluents in addition to these we can also pinpoint the utility of passive samplers because they allowed us to estimate twa concentrations of a number of contaminants and to detect contaminants that would have not been measured by active sampling methods besides based on the estimated rq values the contaminants were ranked in terms of their acute and chronic toxic effects to complement their occurrence data along the estuaries and their most likely sources on the one hand well known pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac show high acute and chronic effects but ubiquitous caffeine seems to be a contaminant of increasing concern on the other hand the estimated toxicity of the antihypertensive drugs sartans together with their detection frequency in effluents and estuaries are warning evidences of their environmental impact

19241,despite numerous studies on changes to optical proxies of dissolved organic matter dom by biogeochemical processing the applicability of commonly used spectroscopic indices has not been explored as dom source tracking tools under conditions where biogeochemical processes may alter them for this study two contrasting dom end members suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and algogenic dom adom and their mixtures were used to examine the potential changes in the conservative mixing behaviors of several well known optical indices via end member mixing analysis under the influence of biodegradation uv irradiation and clay mineral kaolin adsorption most of the source tracking indices exhibited large deviations from conservative mixing behavior between the two end members biodegradation tended to lower the portions of labile and adom in the mixtures while the allochthonous end member srfa was reduced by a greater extent after the process of uv irradiation or adsorption the extent of the variations in biological index bix and fluorescence index fi was smaller for more allochthonous dom mixtures under the processes of biodegradation and uv irradiation overall the process driven variations in ratios of humic like protein like fluorescence as modeled by parallel factor analysis parafac were greater for the srfa versus adom evaluation criteria used in this study suggested that bix specific uv absorbance suva and fi each could be the reliable discrimination parameter least affected by biodegradation uv irradiation and adsorption respectively this study provided criterion information for the choice and the interpretation of the optical indices for dom source discrimination in aquatic environments after substantial biogeochemical processing graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter spectroscopic indices end member mixing analysis biodegradation uv irradiation adsorption 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural waters optical methods such as absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy have been widely used to characterize dom and to discriminate the sources in aquatic environments due to the advantages of a high sensitivity ease of processing and analysis and a low cost chen et al 2015 derrien et al 2018 jaffé et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the commonly used spectroscopic indices include spectral slope s275 295 and slope ratio sr which are the proxies of dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 specific uv absorbance suva254 as an indicator of dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 fluorescence index fi to distinguish between terrestrial and microbial sources mcknight et al 2001 humification index hix ohno 2002 zsolnay et al 1999 biological index bix relating to recent autochthonous dom production huguet et al 2009 and the relative abundances or the ratios of the dissimilar fluorescent components such as humic like fulvic like or protein like components baker et al 2008 chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 the application of such spectroscopic indices for source discrimination is primarily based on the differences in particular chromophoric dom levels across contrasting end members derrien et al 2017 for instance light insensitive compounds such as carbohydrates and proteins are more abundant in autochthonous sources e g algae in lake dom than in allochthonous sources which are dominated by aromatic structures such as lignin fellman et al 2010 spectroscopic characteristics of dom are affected by the physical mixing ratios of different dom sources as well as a variety of biogeochemical processes occurring in natural environments helms et al 2008 yang and hur 2014 massicotte et al 2017 biogeochemical processes might alter the chemical composition of dom likely leading to uncertainty in discrimination capability of dom source indices as such optical properties of dom could be highly variable and controlled by different physical e g hydrology chemical e g photoreactivity redox conditions and biological e g primary productivity processes jaffé et al 2008 the increased trends of suva values humic like fluorescence and hydrophobic fraction have been consistently reported after biodegradation while protein like fluorescence and aliphatic carbon fraction were more enriched in the biodegraded dom samples hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2011c marschner and kalbitz 2003 nguyen and hur 2011 further dom in aquatic environments can absorb uv light which may lead to the structural modification and gradual decomposition of dom hur et al 2011a stedmon et al 2007 such a dom photodegradation is considered to proceed firstly via direct photolysis involving energy and electron transfer after photon absorption by dom xu et al 2011 the photochemical degradation of dom generally results in potential increase of its availability to bacteria waiser and robarts 2005 and or its mineralization to co2 du et al 2016 xu and jiang 2013 although sunlight itself also may photochemically humify dom especially in the presence of iron mayer et al 2009 mineral adsorption is another biogeochemical process that may alter dom properties many studies have underlined the importance of dom adsorption to mineral surfaces in terms of the fate the stability the surface properties of mineral particles balcke et al 2002 hur and schlautman 2003a phong and hur 2018 zhang et al 2012 the adsorption affinity of dom for mineral surfaces is affected by the chemical composition or sources of dom thus preferential adsorption of certain dom molecules onto mineral sources may result in a substantial difference in dom structures and optical properties before and after adsorption hur and schlautman 2003a the major adsorption mechanisms suggested to explain the dom mineral interactions are i hydrophobic interaction ii electrostatic interaction iii van der waals forces iv ligand exchange via carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in dom v hydrogen bonding and vi cation bridging claret et al 2008 philippe and schaumann 2014 yang and xing 2009 despite the numerous reports on the changes in dom properties upon various biogeochemical processes bittar et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 mann et al 2014 massicotte et al 2017 romera castillo et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 little to no effort has gone to systematically examine the validity of these optical properties for source discrimination capability that might be deteriorated by the processes driven changes only a few studies have been reported with the research focus on the comparison of dom spectroscopic indices with respect to the potential changes in their conservative mixing behaviors yang and hur 2014 for example yang and hur 2014 evaluated the effects of solution chemistry including different ph nacl concentration i e during estuarine mixing ca2 i e metal effects and dom concentration i e dilution effect on ideal mixing behavior of several well known optical proxies via end member mixing analysis emma and suggested further studies to explore the potential alternation on the emma relationships of optical properties driven by biogeochemical processes past studies utilizing optical indices for tracking dom sources in estuary and freshwater environments have generally considered conservative mixing without considering the biogeochemical processes driven changes in the indices lee et al 2014 nguyen and hur 2011 stedmon et al 2003 stedmon and markager 2005 although some studies have recognized the potential effects of photo and biological degradation on organic matter properties for source tracking detailed information on the potential alteration of ideal mixing behaviors of particular indices has not yet been provided fellman et al 2010 hood et al 2005 inamdar et al 2011 osburn et al 2012 which would be essential for proposing optimal indices for certain situations and proper interpretation of optical data in this regard a systematic study was conducted to evaluate the practical applicability of the optical dom indices to discriminate dom sources subjected to several biogeochemical processes i e biodegradation photodegradation and mineral adsorption changes to optical indices were evaluated in terms of ideal mixing behavior using emma the aim of this study was 1 to track the changes in several commonly used spectroscopic parameters with different ratios of two dom end members suwannee river fulvic acid srfa vs algal dom adom 2 to examine the influence of the three natural processes on the spectroscopic indices of the dom mixtures of the two end members and 3 to provide new insights into the applicability of the optical indices under the situations where the biogeochemical processes prevail and affect dom properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of end member materials and the mixtures srfa i e srfa solution and algae chlorella spp were selected as the two contrasting dom end members which represent allochthonous and autochthonous sources in fresh water resources respectively yang and hur 2014 srfa was purchased from the international humic substance society ihss https ihss humicsubstances org in powdered form dissolved in milli q water and filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec cultivated freshwater chlorella spp was purchased in a bulk suspension solution from a company from aquanet co ltd http aquasm com the supernatant of the bulk algae solution was separated using centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 min freeze dried grounded and passed through a 0 018 mm sieve the freeze dried powder was dissolved in milli q water and shaken at 130 rpm in the dark for 6 h the solution was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec both end member srfa and adom were diluted to a concentration of 10 mg c l 1 as the dom working solutions at ph 7 and 0 01 m nacl and used for further experiments within 24 h after the preparation the two end members were mixed at seven different volume ratios of 0 1 1 9 1 3 1 1 3 1 9 1 and 1 0 following yang and hur 2014 therefore a ratio of 0 1 in fig 1 indicated a 100 srfa solution while a ratio of 1 0 indicated a 100 adom solution the experiments for biogeochemical processes were carried out in triplicate 2 2 biodegradation experiments surface water was collected from a stream water 37 33 10 16 n 127 03 58 16 e jungrang stream near sejong university campus seoul south korea to use as an inoculum for biodegradation experiments following the procedure described in hur et al 2009 inorganic nutrients nh4no3 28 6 mg l 1 and k2hpo4 16 9 mg l 1 were introduced into the incubation tubes to prevent n and p limitation and to maintain a c n p ratio of 30 10 3 the low doc concentration 0 3 mg c l 1 and volume 2 of the inoculum had negligible effect on the doc of the final end member mixing solutions the incubation was conducted in 200 ml flasks at 20 c in dark and aerated every day for 28 days to prevent anoxic conditions typically the biodegradable dom fraction is determined based on 28 day incubations benner and kaiser 2011 fellman et al 2010 wickland et al 2012 in which dramatic changes occur mostly during the early stage of the incubation period abiotic controls were amended with 3 mm of sodium azide nan3 and incubated in the same manner black et al 2012 porcal et al 2004 during the incubation dom samples were collected on 1 3 7 and 28 days and directly filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec the filtrate was immediately used for dom analyses 2 3 uv photodegradation experiments dom mixtures 100 ml were transferred to 21 autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes inner diameter 4 5 cm height 8 cm for uv irradiation controls in amber glass bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and irradiated alongside light treatments the quartz tubes were placed vertically in the middle of closed cabinets equipped with six 8w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl inside as a light source the wavelength of the lamps was centered at 352 nm which provides a spectral shape similar to that of natural sunlight in the wavelength range of 295 365 nm helms et al 2008 the measured light intensity of six lamps in the closed cabinet was 4200 μw cm 2 using an ultraviolet uv meter model 850009 sper scientific the intensity was equivalent to a solar irradiance measured 4350 μw cm 2 in sejong university campus at noon on a day of july 37 33 7 92 n 127 4 23 43 e the temperature in the closed cabinet was maintained at 25 c 3 by circulating cooling air with fans the irradiated samples were taken for dom analyses after 3 and 10 days of exposure a small amount 3 mm of sodium azide nan3 was added to each sample to exclude potential bacterial activity that might occur during the photodegradation experiments 2 4 kaolin adsorption experiments commercially available kaolin powder sigma aldrich usa was used as a model mineral adsorbent without further washing treatment the specific surface areas of kaolin by n2 based bet measurement are 14 3 17 7 m2 g 1 and the points of zero charge are near 4 2 hunt et al 2007 hur and schlautman 2003a concentrated aqueous kaolin suspensions 5 10 and 50 g l 1 were prepared at ph 7 in 2 l flasks containing nan3 the doc concentrations of the leachate solutions i e water soluble organic matter from kaolin ranged from 0 49 to 1 02 mg c l 1 and their uv absorption coefficients at 254 nm varied from 0 005 to 0 015 cm 1 which were taken into account for final dom analyses by subtracting them from the measured dom values in adsorption experiments aliquots 20 ml of the well mixed kaolin suspensions were taken and transferred to centrifuge tubes containing dom mixing solutions such that the final kaolin concentration reached 2 5 5 or 25 g l 1 all samples were horizontally placed on a reciprocating shaker for 24 h to equilibrate at room temperature 20 2 c in dark the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and filtrated through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec to obtain dom samples 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan s275 295 values were estimated based on the slopes of linear regression for log transformed absorption spectra between 275 and 295 nm helms et al 2008 the spectral slopes are reported here as absolute values thus larger values indicate a greater decreasing tendency of absorption with a longer wavelength suva values are typically calculated based on the decadal uv absorption coefficient at a wavelength between 250 nm and 300 nm normalized by the doc concentration in this study suva254 254 nm was used for a proxy of dom aromatic content after the potential nan3 interferences were taken into account in samples see supporting information figs s1 and s2 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was recorded with a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at the emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm with 1 nm increments and over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the samples were diluted until the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm dropped below 0 05 cm 1 to avoid inner filter effects ohno 2002 the luminescence spectrometer was adjusted by correcting ex lamp and the em detector the fluorescence responses to the blank i e milli q water were subtracted from the original eem data the fluorescence intensities of all samples were normalized to raman units ru using the fluorescence intensity of the calculated raman peak wavelength at emission spectrum of 350 nm lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the analytical precision of the instruments are presented in table s1 parafac modeling was performed using matlab mathworks natick ma usa with the domfluor toolbox http www models lif ku dk stedmon and bro 2008 outliers were not found and all data were included for the modeling the number of fluorescent dom fdom components was determined based on split half validation and random initialization fig s3 and table s2 parafac components e g c1 c2 c3 were calculated based on the maximum fluorescence intensity of each fdom component chen et al 2015 yang and hur 2014 the relative ratios of two different fdom components e g c1 c2 c1 c3 c2 c3 considered as a chemical composition index as the tracking indices instead of percent value e g c1 c2 and c3 because one percent value could depend on another fig s10 1 the commonly used dom optical indices also tested here included fi two types of hix i e hixzsolnay and hixohno and bix values the details of the calculations and the variable definitions are described in the supplementary information 2 6 conservative mixing relationship lines and statistical analyses the prediction of spectroscopic indices for dom mixing solutions was based on our previous work which calculated the indices of the dom mixtures using the end member s values the known mixing ratios of dom samples and the assumption of conservative mixing yang and hur 2014 to estimate any deviation between indices subjected to biogeochemical processing and the corresponding control mixing trends in indices were determined as a function of increasing abundance of the adom end member r2 0 549 0 994 for linear relationships r2 0 613 0 996 for exponential relationships n 21 the indices exhibiting nonlinear relationships were further log transformed to ease comparison with other linear indices table 1 the results of the correlation between the optical indices and algal carbon content were tested using sigma plot 13 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectroscopic features of two end members and the mixtures the correlation results such as coefficient of determination r2 values p values and regression slopes are shown in table 1 the two dom end members srfa vs adom showed contrasting features in measured optical indices in the absence of nan3 uv absorption spectra of adom showed a shoulder between 240 and 290 nm which was not as obvious in srfa fig 1a similar observations of such peaks and shoulders were previously reported for algal derived dom collected in lakes mayer et al 2009 yamashita and tanoue 2009 yang and hur 2014 s275 295 values of adom 0 0253 0 0275 nm 1 were about 5 times higher than those of srfa 0 0054 0 0056 nm 1 while the suva254 values of srfa 4 83 5 09 l mg c 1 m 1 were more than 5 times higher than those of adom 1 11 2 5 l mg c 1 m 1 fig s5 tables s3 5 these values fell within the ranges previously reported for these spectral properties chen et al 2003 hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2006 hur and schlautman 2003b nguyen and hur 2011 weishaar et al 2003 yang and hur 2014 in the fluorescence eem spectra srfa exhibited three peaks at ex em of 220 240 400 470 nm peak 1 250 270 400 470 nm peak 2 and at ex em 310 330 420 455 nm peak 3 fig 1c which corresponded to the traditionally defined peaks a ex em 260 450 and c ex em 340 440 as humic like fluorescence baker et al 2008 cory et al 2010 two fluorescence peaks were found in the adom at ex em of 200 215 330 345 nm peak 4 and 270 280 335 340 nm peak 5 fig 1d the peak 5 was previously reported as a tryptophan like fluorescence in dom during an algal bloom hong et al 2012 yang and hur 2014 or during the incubation of algae in culture romera castillo et al 2010 three different fdom components were identified via eem parafac analysis n 273 fig s4 the peak locations of the three components were compared with those previously reported in table s2 supplementary information based on the previous literature the component 1 2 and 3 c1 c2 and c3 were assigned as marine humic like fluorophores of allochthonous origin osburn et al 2011 yamashita and jaffé 2008 terrestrial humic like fluorophores baker et al 2008 cory et al 2010 and tryptophan like fluorophores fellman et al 2010 respectively the srfa sample was characterized by abundant c1 and c2 as 91 94 while the adom was dominated by c3 in 95 96 fig 1b hixzsolnay values were higher in srfa 16 7 than in adom 0 1 while hix values defined by ohno 2002 for srfa and adom were 0 94 and 0 1 respectively fig 2 fig s5 such differences between the two types of humification indices in the same dom samples have also been reported elsewhere birdwell and engel 2010 inamdar et al 2011 ohno 2002 for example srfa exhibited the hixzsolnay of 14 47 birdwell and engel 2010 peng et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 while the hixohno values of soil derived dom or fa were only 1 hansen et al 2016 inamdar et al 2011 ohno 2002 suggesting that the two humification indices cannot be comparable in absolute terms the discrepancy seems to result from the different definitions see their equations in the supplementary information although both indices have been widely used for source tracking derrien et al 2018 inamdar et al 2011 nguyen and hur 2011 yang et al 2015 yang and hur 2014 bix value was 0 4 for srfa and 1 2 1 5 for adom roughly corresponding to the previously reported values hansen et al 2016 yang and hur 2014 the lower fi values of srfa 1 3 than adom 1 7 matched well with results from previous reports tables s3 5 some studies reported relatively high fi values 2 0 for adom which can be attributed to influence of microbial transformation hansen et al 2016 nguyen and hur 2011 spectroscopic information in this study confirm prior works on srfa that it likely contains relatively a higher aromatic content helms et al 2008 and more condensed polyaromatic structures fuentes et al 2006 marschner and kalbitz 2003 compared to adom 3 2 changes in source discrimination indices by biogeochemical processes 3 2 1 biodegradation induced changes biodegradation of the dom mixtures using microbial inoculation resulted in decreased doc concentrations as expected the doc reduction was more pronounced for adom than for srfa 82 6 vs 0 9 from the initial concentrations respectively after 7 day incubations fig 2 table s3 the doc loss occurred mostly within first 1 day of the incubation which was 67 99 of the total doc reduction by day 28 fig s7 1 the results agreed with the other prior studies using soil derived and algal dom samples which also found faster loss of algal dom than soil leached organic matter nguyen and hur 2011 hansen et al 2016 the 7 day long biodegradation resulted in substantial decrease of s275 295 for adom 0 0270 0 0038 nm 1 in comparison with the change for srfa 0 0053 0 0050 nm 1 fig s7 2 the relative changes in uv absorption spectra of dom samples became more pronounced with incubation time 1 d 3 d 7 d 28 d fig s7 3 however it caused only slight changes suva254 values for srfa 5 07 5 17 l mg c 1 m 1 and adom 1 19 1 02 l mg c 1 m 1 the increased suva254 values can be attributed to the preferential microbial removal of labile aliphatic structures and small molecular size dom molecules hur et al 2009 2011c hix values of the two end members increased after biodegradation with a larger increase shown for adom versus srfa fig 2 which were in line with prior studies hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2009 2011c the change in bix values was not as pronounced for srfa with only 1 of the variation shown after 7 days of incubation while bix declined to 25 of the initial value for adom fig 2 the fi value of adom increased upon biodegradation while the change was negligible for srfa with only 1 4 variation for the ratios of different fdom components no noticeable variations were found for c1 c2 ratios while the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 increased after biodegradation fig 3 and fig s10 2 these results suggest that biodegradation processes preferentially removed tryptophan like or protein like components in dom similar changes in dom fluorescence were observed in previous studies using dom samples derived from algae and leaf litter biers et al 2007 hur et al 2009 2011c in addition enzymatic processes of microbial degradation may lead to the enhancement of condensed aromatic structures or microbial humification causing a red shift of fulvic like fluorescence hur et al 2009 ohno 2002 ohno et al 2010 zsolnay et al 1999 microbial humification of adom generating structures that have increased conjugation was consistent with the higher values of hix we observed in our biodegradation experiments the changing trends of the optical properties were generally similar to those previously reported even though the previous results were based on different experimental conditions e g microbial communities irradiation intensity solution chemistry dom sources and so on table s6 3 2 2 photodegradation induced changes after uv irradiation 6 variation was observed for the doc concentrations of the two end members and the mixtures fig 2 fig s8 1 and table s4 previous studies have reported a range of doc changes in dom samples by uv irradiation from substantial reductions to virtually no reduction hansen et al 2016 showed a minor reduction 3 in doc for the dom samples derived from soil plant and algae upon uva irradiation while hur et al 2011a reported a substantial reduction 22 of doc concentrations in srfa after 12 days of uv irradiation other studies reported that 32 60 of lake dom pool could be mineralized to co2 by uv irradiation du et al 2016 xu and jiang 2013 the minimal change in the doc concentration after 10 days of uv irradiation can be explained by incomplete mineralization of dom structures under the irradiation it is suspected that the slight rise doc in the adom dominant samples might be related to increased biomass by microbial growth the preservative used nan3 absorbs uv irradiation which may have reduced its anti microbial properties although further studies are warranted to determine this possibility s275 295 values increased substantially for both srfa 0 0054 0 0120 nm 1 and adom 0 0280 0 0360 nm 1 after 10 days of uv irradiation fig s8 2 indicating preferential loss of long wave absorbance similar to the result of biodegradation the relative changes of uv absorption spectra of dom samples tended to increase with uv irradiation time 3 d 10 d fig s8 3 the suva254 values decreased after uv irradiation with more pronounced changes shown for srfa versus adom fig 2 and fig s8 2 for example the extent of the reduction in the suva254 values corresponded to 25 5 and 1 1 of the initial values for srfa and algal dom respectively similar results were reported in the prior studies using srfa and algal derived dom hur et al 2011a xu and jiang 2013 the decreased suva values can be explained by preferential removal of aromatic chromophores and or partial transformation of some chromophores into non uv absorbing compounds upon uv irradiation hur et al 2011a no reduction in doc but decreased suva values suggest that the irradiation induced dom changes did not reach mineralization to co2 but mostly resulted in degradation of aromatic and other conjugated structures during our experiments the uv irradiation resulted in the decrease in hix values and a corresponding increase in bix values fig 2 the changes were more pronounced for srfa than for adom one exception was the increase in hixohno value of the algal dom after exposure overall the linearly decreasing trend of hixzsolnay was consistent with our previous observations of the changes in suva254 values after uv irradiation indicating the reduction of aromatic structures in dom by photodegradation however contradictory results were also found in prior studies hansen et al 2016 reported larger changes in the hixohno values for algal dom than for soil derived dom after uva irradiation for 4 h increased hixzsolnay values upon irradiation were also reported for lake dom du et al 2016 osburn et al 2011 in this study the irradiation induced change in fi values were more pronounced for adom than for srfa resulting in more distinct differences in the values between the two end members after the irradiation reduced aromaticity in dom upon uv irradiation can be largely responsible for the changes in the fi values cory et al 2005 jaffé et al 2008 the bix values followed the changing trends of the fi values which were in the opposite direction to trends in suva254 hixzsolnay and hixohno the irradiation induced changes in dom fluorescence depended on the fdom components as well as the end members the c1 c2 ratios increased for both srfa and adom fig 3 and fig s10 2 however the changes in the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 were different depending upon dom source with decreasing trends for srfa but little variation for adom these results agreed well with those from prior studies for example protein like fluorophores tend to be resistant to photodegradation than humic like counterparts e g peaks a m and c in eem while humic like fluorophores with excitation maxima within the uva band i e 315 400 nm are quite susceptible to photodegradation du et al 2016 phong and hur 2015 therefore the humic like and the tryptophan like components can be associated with photolabile dom and residual products respectively in general the observed changes in the optical proxies reflected preferential removal of aromatic structures and relatively bio refractory fractions from the dom mixture samples while the labile part tended to be resistant to photodegradation likely due to its lack of absorption 3 2 3 adsorption induced changes the addition of kaolin 25 g l 1 resulted in substantial reduction in doc with more pronounced change shown for srfa 47 versus adom 1 fig 2 fig s9 1 and table s5 s275 295 of srfa increased from 0 0056 to 0 008 nm 1 while that of adom decreased from 0 033 to 0 0265 nm 1 fig s9 2 the relative changes of uv absorption spectra were greater at the kaolin addition of 5 g l 1 versus 2 5 g l 1 fig s9 3 only suva254 values for srfa were reduced to a great extent due to adsorption onto kaolin fig 2 and fig s9 2 suggesting the preferential adsorption of aromatic moieties onto the mineral surface the results were consistent with prior work which suggested hydrophobic interactions as a major adsorption mechanism at ph 7 hur et al 2011b it is known that hydrophobic interactions may prevail over other mechanisms including electrostatic attraction for dom adsorption onto minerals when the solution ph is higher than the zero point of charge value of the adsorbent hur and schlautman 2003a in the adsorption processes where hydrophobic interactions are dominant the adsorption affinity of minerals are correlated positively with the aromaticity of dom and inversely with the dom polarity expressed as o c atomic ratios balcke et al 2002 hur and schlautman 2003b the hix values of srfa showed substantial reduction after adsorption while only a slight increase in hix was observed for adom fig 2 and fig s9 2 the opposite trends were observed in the changes of the bix values between the two end members after adsorption with 49 increase for srfa and 31 reduction for algal dom the fi increased up to 17 from the control value for srfa while it was stable for algal dom the mineral adsorption led to the increase of c1 c2 ratios and the declines of the c1 c3 and c2 c3 ratios for srfa and the dom mixtures while no to little variations were observed for adom fig 3 and fig s10 2 the most pronounced changes in the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 were found for srfa suggesting humic like components with allochthonous origins are preferably adsorbed to mineral surfaces the trends of increased c1 c2 ratios were consistent with the adsorption mechanism i e hydrophobic interactions presumed for the dom mineral systems hur and schlautman 2003a kleber et al 2007 the fluorescent components with the maximum peak emission at a longer wavelength e g c2 versus c1 for this study have been related to humic substance of relatively larger molecular size and of a high degree of structural condensation hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 which can be more favorable for adsorption via hydrophobic interactions 3 2 4 relationships between dom aromatic content and source discrimination indices the optical proxies used for source discrimination also reflect dom composition particularly aromatic structures of dom in this study potential changes in the relationships between the optical indices and aromatic content expressed by suva254 here were explored using the dom mixtures under the influence of the three biogeochemical processes fig s11 hixzsolnay c1 c3 and c2 c3 exhibited positive correlations with suva254 values while negative relationships were observed for c1 c2 bix and fi the positive or the negative trends were consistent with those previously reported in many prior studies fuentes et al 2006 hur et al 2009 2011b mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 although the dom mixtures were affected by different biogeochemical processes all the samples followed the general trends between the indices and suva values fig s11 these results suggest that irrespectively of the biogeochemical alternation on dom composition the relationships between the optical indices and dom composition may not be seriously disturbed by the processing in aquatic environments this finding explains why such relationships have been commonly found in many literature despite the wide ranges of dom origins and sampling locations 3 3 deviations of source discrimination indices from the emma relationships before the biogeochemical processes were considered the initial relationships between the spectroscopic indices and the abundance of algal content in the mixture mostly followed conservative mixing behavior although there were some exceptions e g hixohno bix fi fig 2 the observed relationships could be grouped into four different trends 1 a linear decreasing trend i e suva254 hixzsonlay 2 an exponential decreasing trend i e hixohno c1 c3 c2 c3 3 an exponential increasing trend i e s275 295 bix fi and 4 a stable trend i e c1 c2 the relationships constructed using the original mixtures in this study were consistent with those of yang and hur 2014 3 3 1 biodegradation induced deviations from the initial relationships after biodegradation the initial trends of the optical indices with increasing algal content in the mixture mostly remained the same in the relationship types except for the s275 295 value changing from increasing exponential trend to a stable trend and the suva254 values shifting from a linear to non linear relationship figs 2 and 3 the values of suva254 hixzsolnay hixohno and fi in the dom mixtures were overall shifted upward after biodegradation while s275 295 showed the opposite trend in the values i e downward the source discrimination capability of an index can be evaluated using 1 the percent difference between the measured values and those predicted by ideal mixing behavior 2 the r2 value was calculated based on the linear regression between the optical indices and algal carbon content exponential relationships were first log transformed to make them comparable with linear indices and 3 the regression slope divided by the analytical standard deviation i e s sd yang and hur 2014 in this study the effects of biogeochemical processes on an index s capability to predict sources were assessed firstly by using the average values of the absolute percent difference apd in the indices between the control and the treated samples secondly using the s sd values and lastly by the r2 values of the relationships table 1 the first evaluation parameter is related to the accuracy in the prediction of the source assignment based on a conservative mixing assumption while the second can be a measure of the sensitivity of the index to changing sources in dom mixtures relative to its uncertainty in the measurements therefore the indices with relatively low apd and relatively high values of the s sd and r2 values from the regression relationships can be regarded as good predictors for the relative contributions of different sources in samples with two end members for example although the c1 c2 ratios exhibited the lowest apd 2 9 among the tested optical indices it was difficult to distinguish between the two contrasting sources because of the low regression slope by contrast hixzsolnay exhibited the highest slope with a distinct difference between the two end members without any change in the relationship however the upward shifting trend after biodegradation resulted in a great extent of the deviation of the index from those predicted based on the initial relationship before biodegradation based on the evaluation criteria bix can be suggested as a rather robust indices in discriminating the two different dom sources in aquatic systems under severe biodegradation processes table 1 it was interesting to observe that except for a short incubation time i e 1 day the measured first order degradation rates of dom mixtures also followed the ideal mixing line which was constructed based on the mixing ratios and the individual rate constants of the two end members fig s7 4 this result suggests that the ideal mixing assumption can be applied to predict the biodegradation rates of dom samples with different sources 3 3 2 uv irradiation induced deviations from the initial relationships uv irradiation did not lead to the changes in the types of the relationships between the indices and algal carbon content in the dom mixtures however most of indices showed fairly large deviations from the relationships between the control and treated samples upon photodegradation figs 2 and 3 for example suva254 and hixzsolnay exhibited negative linear regression lines after uv irradiation which were similar to those before uv irradiation however compared to the control samples both indices values decreased in the srfa dominant sample after uv irradiation while relatively smaller changes were found in the algal dominant dom mixtures fig 2 after uv irradiation ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 showed lower regression slopes which indicated the lesser extent of changes to these ratios with increasing algal carbon content fig 3 the apd was the lowest for fi 4 5 followed by suva 27 7 and hixohno 29 8 meanwhile the s sd values were relatively high for hixohno 0 118 suva254 0 050 and hixzsolnay 0 038 despite the smallest apd fi did not show strong source discrimination capability for the srfa dominated dom mixtures with respect to its sensitivity fig 2 and fig s8 2 with its relatively low s d value 0 008 among the tested indices suva254 exhibited the best performance in the source discrimination considering the effects of photodegradation 3 3 3 adsorption induced deviations from the initial relationships similar to the irradiation induced changes the shapes of the relationships between the indices and algal carbon content in dom mixtures were not altered by mineral adsorption figs 2 and 3 one exception was fi which showed a linearly increasing trend with algal carbon content in contrast to a concave up curve shown for the control samples i e before adsorption fig 2 substantial differences were found in the individual indices between before and after adsorption for example the values shifted down after adsorption from the indices of suva254 hixzsolnay and hixohno while the opposite trends were found for s275 295 bix fi and c1 c2 figs 2 and 3 fig s9 1 for the adsorption affected dom mixtures the apd was smallest for fi 16 1 followed by c1 c2 38 1 s275 295 47 0 and bix 49 1 among these indices the s sd values were highest for hixohno 0 186 followed by suva254y 0 049 and hixzsolnay 0 040 although fi widely used as a conventional dom source tracking index showed a high accuracy for source discrimination i e the lowest apd its sensitivity was found to be low as indicated by the small s sd value suggesting the ineffectiveness in the source discrimination capability where adsorption processes are dominant based on the evaluation criteria c1 c2 was found to be good indices for tracking dom sources in aquatic systems with high clay or other mineral content where adsorption is important 3 4 implications for the applicability of the indices under biogeochemical processes our results demonstrate that conservative mixing behaviors of well known spectroscopic indices which is a major assumption for emma could be seriously disrupted by biogeochemical processes yang and hur 2014 after biogeochemical processing by microbes photodegradation and adsorption to kaolin most of the indices tested here showed the large shifts from the levels predicted based on the mixing relationships of different sources and even altered the regression relationships of the index with increasing one end member in dom mixtures i e linear or non linear resulting in dramatic differences between the measured values and those predicted by the original mixing relationships or emma ideally the proper index for source discrimination should be rather insensitive to biogeochemical process and be well distinguishable between different dom sources this study provided strong evidence that the application of well known optical indices for source tracking via emma could lead to the wrong estimation of source contribution to dom without careful consideration of the biogeochemical processes that might otherwise affect the indices used to discriminate its sources for example under the environments with dominant biodegradation processes autochthonous source assignment to dom samples based on fi could be overestimated fig 2 while biodegradation heightens the possibility of the under estimation of autochthonous origins in dom using hix values photodegradation and kaolin adsorption likely lead to the underestimation of allochthonous dom among the indices tested here the variability of bix and suva254 were the smallest after biodegradation and uv irradiation respectively while both bix and fi were rather robust to the changes upon mineral adsorption table 1 these results suggest that these optical indices could provide reliable estimates on dom source independent of each biogeochemical process in addition our study showed the potential difficulty of using spectroscopic indices in accurately assigning different sources to dom in aquatic environments where such biogeochemical processes are important systems with long residence times where biogeochemical processing can operate especially surface waters of lakes reservoirs and estuaries will stand to have the largest uncertainty in sources using the optical indices studied here for example osburn et al 2012 observed a large shift in the quality of fluorescent organic matter pools upon biodegradation and or upon the exposure to sunlight in an estuary despite these uncertainties however combining emma relationships altered by the individual biogeochemical processes would provide critical information in interpreting the sources and reactivities of dom in aquatic environments it is highly advisable for proper data interpretation to identify the dominant biogeochemical processes possibly applicable to dom in a particular system consequently the results presented in this study can be utilized to probe the most dominant biogeochemical process affecting dom in aquatic environments by comparing the measured values with the conservative mixing line of the original end members where those end members are known yang and hur 2014 in some case it may be necessary to obtain proxy values of different dom end members which already reflected the particular processes driven changes further studies using other terrestrial and aquatic dom sources under an array of experimental conditions are warranted to test the use of emma relationships as done for the present on only two dom sources further these relationships should be tested and validated for field samples in future studies nevertheless this study adds value in that this is the first to examine the potential changes in the emma relationships of optical proxies which are a critical information in dom source tracking under the influence of three different biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated that three important biogeochemical processes in natural waters might cause significant changes to key optical indices used to track source of dom highlighting their important effects under changing contributions of dom sources compared to conservative mixing between terrestrial and algal end members most indices were different with changes related to the source of the organic matter in general the spectroscopic indices we investigated in this study revealed changes in the opposite direction between biodegradation and uv irradiation kaolin adsorption biodegradation resulted in enhanced aromaticity increase in suva254 hix and humic like fluorescence but a reduction in aliphatic and labile fractions decrease in bix and protein like fluorescence both uv irradiation and adsorption altered the optical indices of terrestrial dom to make it resemble dom with lower degrees of aromaticity and humification i e the decrease in suva254 and hix and the increase of bix the optical indices of bix and suva254 seem to be robust proxies for dom source discrimination under the influence of biodegradation and uv irradiation respectively as shown by the small differences between treatments and controls and the high sensitivity of the regression relationships changing with increasing one end member in the dom mixtures under kaolin adsorption both bix and fi could be suggested as good source discrimination indices we caution that the simple application of the spectroscopic indices via emma without the consideration of the biogeochemical influences could result in serious errors e g under or over estimation in assigning the relative contribution of dom sources in natural waters our study provides new insight into the applicability of well known optical indices for dom source tracking in aquatic systems where biogeochemical processes are dominant acknowledgments this work was supported by a

19241,despite numerous studies on changes to optical proxies of dissolved organic matter dom by biogeochemical processing the applicability of commonly used spectroscopic indices has not been explored as dom source tracking tools under conditions where biogeochemical processes may alter them for this study two contrasting dom end members suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and algogenic dom adom and their mixtures were used to examine the potential changes in the conservative mixing behaviors of several well known optical indices via end member mixing analysis under the influence of biodegradation uv irradiation and clay mineral kaolin adsorption most of the source tracking indices exhibited large deviations from conservative mixing behavior between the two end members biodegradation tended to lower the portions of labile and adom in the mixtures while the allochthonous end member srfa was reduced by a greater extent after the process of uv irradiation or adsorption the extent of the variations in biological index bix and fluorescence index fi was smaller for more allochthonous dom mixtures under the processes of biodegradation and uv irradiation overall the process driven variations in ratios of humic like protein like fluorescence as modeled by parallel factor analysis parafac were greater for the srfa versus adom evaluation criteria used in this study suggested that bix specific uv absorbance suva and fi each could be the reliable discrimination parameter least affected by biodegradation uv irradiation and adsorption respectively this study provided criterion information for the choice and the interpretation of the optical indices for dom source discrimination in aquatic environments after substantial biogeochemical processing graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter spectroscopic indices end member mixing analysis biodegradation uv irradiation adsorption 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural waters optical methods such as absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy have been widely used to characterize dom and to discriminate the sources in aquatic environments due to the advantages of a high sensitivity ease of processing and analysis and a low cost chen et al 2015 derrien et al 2018 jaffé et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the commonly used spectroscopic indices include spectral slope s275 295 and slope ratio sr which are the proxies of dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 specific uv absorbance suva254 as an indicator of dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003

2008 chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 the application of such spectroscopic indices for source discrimination is primarily based on the differences in particular chromophoric dom levels across contrasting end members derrien et al 2017 for instance light insensitive compounds such as carbohydrates and proteins are more abundant in autochthonous sources e g algae in lake dom than in allochthonous sources which are dominated by aromatic structures such as lignin fellman et al 2010 spectroscopic characteristics of dom are affected by the physical mixing ratios of different dom sources as well as a variety of biogeochemical processes occurring in natural environments helms et al 2008 yang and hur 2014 massicotte et al 2017 biogeochemical processes might alter the chemical composition of dom likely leading to uncertainty in discrimination capability of dom source indices as such optical properties of dom could be highly variable and controlled by different physical e g hydrology chemical e g photoreactivity redox conditions and biological e g primary productivity processes jaffé et al 2008 the increased trends of suva values humic like fluorescence and hydrophobic fraction have been consistently reported after biodegradation while protein like fluorescence and aliphatic carbon fraction were more enriched in the biodegraded dom samples hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2011c marschner and kalbitz 2003 nguyen and hur 2011 further dom in aquatic environments can absorb uv light which may lead to the structural modification and gradual decomposition of dom hur et al 2011a stedmon et al 2007 such a dom photodegradation is considered to proceed firstly via direct photolysis involving energy and electron transfer after photon absorption by dom xu et al 2011 the photochemical degradation of dom generally results in potential increase of its availability to bacteria waiser and robarts 2005 and or its mineralization to co2 du et al 2016 xu and jiang 2013 although sunlight itself also may photochemically humify dom especially in the presence of iron mayer et al 2009 mineral adsorption is another biogeochemical process that may alter dom properties many studies have underlined the importance of dom adsorption to mineral surfaces in terms of the fate the stability the surface properties of mineral particles balcke et al 2002 hur and schlautman 2003a phong and hur 2018 zhang et al 2012 the adsorption affinity of dom for mineral surfaces is affected by the chemical composition or sources of dom thus preferential adsorption of certain dom molecules onto mineral sources may result in a substantial difference in dom structures and optical properties before and after adsorption hur and schlautman 2003a the major adsorption mechanisms suggested to explain the dom mineral interactions are i hydrophobic interaction ii electrostatic interaction iii van der waals forces iv ligand exchange via carboxylic and phenolic functional groups in dom v hydrogen bonding and vi cation bridging claret et al 2008 philippe and schaumann 2014 yang and xing 2009 despite the numerous reports on the changes in dom properties upon various biogeochemical processes bittar et al 2015 hansen et al 2016 mann et al 2014 massicotte et al 2017 romera castillo et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 little to no effort has gone to systematically examine the validity of these optical properties for source discrimination capability that might be deteriorated by the processes driven changes only a few studies have been reported with the research focus on the comparison of dom spectroscopic indices with respect to the potential changes in their conservative mixing behaviors yang and hur 2014 for example yang and hur 2014 evaluated the effects of solution chemistry including different ph nacl concentration i e during estuarine mixing ca2 i e metal effects and dom concentration i e dilution effect on ideal mixing behavior of several well known optical proxies via end member mixing analysis emma and suggested further studies to explore the potential alternation on the emma relationships of optical properties driven by biogeochemical processes past studies utilizing optical indices for tracking dom sources in estuary and freshwater environments have generally considered conservative mixing without considering the biogeochemical processes driven changes in the indices lee et al 2014 nguyen and hur 2011 stedmon et al 2003 stedmon and markager 2005 although some studies have recognized the potential effects of photo and biological degradation on organic matter properties for source tracking detailed information on the potential alteration of ideal mixing behaviors of particular indices has not yet been provided fellman et al 2010 hood et al 2005 inamdar et al 2011 osburn et al 2012 which would be essential for proposing optimal indices for certain situations and proper interpretation of optical data in this regard a systematic study was conducted to evaluate the practical applicability of the optical dom indices to discriminate dom sources subjected to several biogeochemical processes i e biodegradation photodegradation and mineral adsorption changes to optical indices were evaluated in terms of ideal mixing behavior using emma the aim of this study was 1 to track the changes in several commonly used spectroscopic parameters with different ratios of two dom end members suwannee river fulvic acid srfa vs algal dom adom 2 to examine the influence of the three natural processes on the spectroscopic indices of the dom mixtures of the two end members and 3 to provide new insights into the applicability of the optical indices under the situations where the biogeochemical processes prevail and affect dom properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of end member materials and the mixtures srfa i e srfa solution and algae chlorella spp were selected as the two contrasting dom end members which represent allochthonous and autochthonous sources in fresh water resources respectively yang and hur 2014 srfa was purchased from the international humic substance society ihss https ihss humicsubstances org in powdered form dissolved in milli q water and filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec cultivated freshwater chlorella spp was purchased in a bulk suspension solution from a company from aquanet co ltd http aquasm com the supernatant of the bulk algae solution was separated using centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 min freeze dried grounded and passed through a 0 018 mm sieve the freeze dried powder was dissolved in milli q water and shaken at 130 rpm in the dark for 6 h the solution was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec both end member srfa and adom were diluted to a concentration of 10 mg c l 1 as the dom working solutions at ph 7 and 0 01 m nacl and used for further experiments within 24 h after the preparation the two end members were mixed at seven different volume ratios of 0 1 1 9 1 3 1 1 3 1 9 1 and 1 0 following yang and hur 2014 therefore a ratio of 0 1 in fig 1 indicated a 100 srfa solution while a ratio of 1 0 indicated a 100 adom solution the experiments for biogeochemical processes were carried out in triplicate 2 2 biodegradation experiments surface water was collected from a stream water 37 33 10 16 n 127 03 58 16 e jungrang stream near sejong university campus seoul south korea to use as an inoculum for biodegradation experiments following the procedure described in hur et al 2009 inorganic nutrients nh4no3 28 6 mg l 1 and k2hpo4 16 9 mg l 1 were introduced into the incubation tubes to prevent n and p limitation and to maintain a c n p ratio of 30 10 3 the low doc concentration 0 3 mg c l 1 and volume 2 of the inoculum had negligible effect on the doc of the final end member mixing solutions the incubation was conducted in 200 ml flasks at 20 c in dark and aerated every day for 28 days to prevent anoxic conditions typically the biodegradable dom fraction is determined based on 28 day incubations benner and kaiser 2011 fellman et al 2010 wickland et al 2012 in which dramatic changes occur mostly during the early stage of the incubation period abiotic controls were amended with 3 mm of sodium azide nan3 and incubated in the same manner black et al 2012 porcal et al 2004 during the incubation dom samples were collected on 1 3 7 and 28 days and directly filtered through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec the filtrate was immediately used for dom analyses 2 3 uv photodegradation experiments dom mixtures 100 ml were transferred to 21 autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes inner diameter 4 5 cm height 8 cm for uv irradiation controls in amber glass bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and irradiated alongside light treatments the quartz tubes were placed vertically in the middle of closed cabinets equipped with six 8w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl inside as a light source the wavelength of the lamps was centered at 352 nm which provides a spectral shape similar to that of natural sunlight in the wavelength range of 295 365 nm helms et al 2008 the measured light intensity of six lamps in the closed cabinet was 4200 μw cm 2 using an ultraviolet uv meter model 850009 sper scientific the intensity was equivalent to a solar irradiance measured 4350 μw cm 2 in sejong university campus at noon on a day of july 37 33 7 92 n 127 4 23 43 e the temperature in the closed cabinet was maintained at 25 c 3 by circulating cooling air with fans the irradiated samples were taken for dom analyses after 3 and 10 days of exposure a small amount 3 mm of sodium azide nan3 was added to each sample to exclude potential bacterial activity that might occur during the photodegradation experiments 2 4 kaolin adsorption experiments commercially available kaolin powder sigma aldrich usa was used as a model mineral adsorbent without further washing treatment the specific surface areas of kaolin by n2 based bet measurement are 14 3 17 7 m2 g 1 and the points of zero charge are near 4 2 hunt et al 2007 hur and schlautman 2003a concentrated aqueous kaolin suspensions 5 10 and 50 g l 1 were prepared at ph 7 in 2 l flasks containing nan3 the doc concentrations of the leachate solutions i e water soluble organic matter from kaolin ranged from 0 49 to 1 02 mg c l 1 and their uv absorption coefficients at 254 nm varied from 0 005 to 0 015 cm 1 which were taken into account for final dom analyses by subtracting them from the measured dom values in adsorption experiments aliquots 20 ml of the well mixed kaolin suspensions were taken and transferred to centrifuge tubes containing dom mixing solutions such that the final kaolin concentration reached 2 5 5 or 25 g l 1 all samples were horizontally placed on a reciprocating shaker for 24 h to equilibrate at room temperature 20 2 c in dark the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and filtrated through a 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filter advantec to obtain dom samples 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan s275 295 values were estimated based on the slopes of linear regression for log transformed absorption spectra between 275 and 295 nm helms et al 2008 the spectral slopes are reported here as absolute values thus larger values indicate a greater decreasing tendency of absorption with a longer wavelength suva values are typically calculated based on the decadal uv absorption coefficient at a wavelength between 250 nm and 300 nm normalized by the doc concentration in this study suva254 254 nm was used for a proxy of dom aromatic content after the potential nan3 interferences were taken into account in samples see supporting information figs s1 and s2 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was recorded with a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at the emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm with 1 nm increments and over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the samples were diluted until the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm dropped below 0 05 cm 1 to avoid inner filter effects ohno 2002 the luminescence spectrometer was adjusted by correcting ex lamp and the em detector the fluorescence responses to the blank i e milli q water were subtracted from the original eem data the fluorescence intensities of all samples were normalized to raman units ru using the fluorescence intensity of the calculated raman peak wavelength at emission spectrum of 350 nm lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the analytical precision of the instruments are presented in table s1 parafac modeling was performed using matlab mathworks natick ma usa with the domfluor toolbox http www models lif ku dk stedmon and bro 2008 outliers were not found and all data were included for the modeling the number of fluorescent dom fdom components was determined based on split half validation and random initialization fig s3 and table s2 parafac components e g c1 c2 c3 were calculated based on the maximum fluorescence intensity of each fdom component chen et al 2015 yang and hur 2014 the relative ratios of two different fdom components e g c1 c2 c1 c3 c2 c3 considered as a chemical composition index as the tracking indices instead of percent value e g c1 c2 and c3 because one percent value could depend on another fig s10 1 the commonly used dom optical indices also tested here included fi two types of hix i e hixzsolnay and hixohno and bix values the details of the calculations and the variable definitions are described in the supplementary information 2 6 conservative mixing relationship lines and statistical analyses the prediction of spectroscopic indices for dom mixing solutions was based on our previous work which calculated the indices of the dom mixtures using the end member s values the known mixing ratios of dom samples and the assumption of conservative mixing yang and hur 2014 to estimate any deviation between indices subjected to biogeochemical processing and the corresponding control mixing trends in indices were determined as a function of increasing abundance of the adom end member r2 0 549 0 994 for linear relationships r2 0 613 0 996 for exponential relationships n 21 the indices exhibiting nonlinear relationships were further log transformed to ease comparison with other linear indices table 1 the results of the correlation between the optical indices and algal carbon content were tested using sigma plot 13 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectroscopic features of two end members and the mixtures the correlation results such as coefficient of determination r2 values p values and regression slopes are shown in table 1 the two dom end members srfa vs adom showed contrasting features in measured optical indices in the absence of nan3 uv absorption spectra of adom showed a shoulder between 240 and 290 nm which was not as obvious in srfa fig 1a similar observations of such peaks and shoulders were previously reported for algal derived dom collected in lakes mayer et al 2009 yamashita and tanoue 2009 yang and hur 2014 s275 295 values of adom 0 0253 0 0275 nm 1 were about 5 times higher than those of srfa 0 0054 0 0056 nm 1 while the suva254 values of srfa 4 83 5 09 l mg c 1 m 1 were more than 5 times higher than those of adom 1 11 2 5 l mg c 1 m 1 fig s5 tables s3 5 these values fell within the ranges previously reported for these spectral properties chen et al 2003 hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2006 hur and schlautman 2003b nguyen and hur 2011 weishaar et al 2003 yang and hur 2014 in the fluorescence eem spectra srfa exhibited three peaks at ex em of 220 240 400 470 nm peak 1 250 270 400 470 nm peak 2 and at ex em 310 330 420 455 nm peak 3 fig 1c which corresponded to the traditionally defined peaks a ex em 260 450 and c ex em 340 440 as humic like fluorescence baker et al 2008 cory et al 2010 two fluorescence peaks were found in the adom at ex em of 200 215 330 345 nm peak 4 and 270 280 335 340 nm peak 5 fig 1d the peak 5 was previously reported as a tryptophan like fluorescence in dom during an algal bloom hong et al 2012 yang and hur 2014 or during the incubation of algae in culture romera castillo et al 2010 three different fdom components were identified via eem parafac analysis n 273 fig s4 the peak locations of the three components were compared with those previously reported in table s2 supplementary information based on the previous literature the component 1 2 and 3 c1 c2 and c3 were assigned as marine humic like fluorophores of allochthonous origin osburn et al 2011 yamashita and jaffé 2008 terrestrial humic like fluorophores baker et al 2008 cory et al 2010 and tryptophan like fluorophores fellman et al 2010 respectively the srfa sample was characterized by abundant c1 and c2 as 91 94 while the adom was dominated by c3 in 95 96 fig 1b hixzsolnay values were higher in srfa 16 7 than in adom 0 1 while hix values defined by ohno 2002 for srfa and adom were 0 94 and 0 1 respectively fig 2 fig s5 such differences between the two types of humification indices in the same dom samples have also been reported elsewhere birdwell and engel 2010 inamdar et al 2011 ohno 2002 for example srfa exhibited the hixzsolnay of 14 47 birdwell and engel 2010 peng et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 while the hixohno values of soil derived dom or fa were only 1 hansen et al 2016 inamdar et al 2011 ohno 2002 suggesting that the two humification indices cannot be comparable in absolute terms the discrepancy seems to result from the different definitions see their equations in the supplementary information although both indices have been widely used for source tracking derrien et al 2018 inamdar et al 2011 nguyen and hur 2011 yang et al 2015 yang and hur 2014 bix value was 0 4 for srfa and 1 2 1 5 for adom roughly corresponding to the previously reported values hansen et al 2016 yang and hur 2014 the lower fi values of srfa 1 3 than adom 1 7 matched well with results from previous reports tables s3 5 some studies reported relatively high fi values 2 0 for adom which can be attributed to influence of microbial transformation hansen et al 2016 nguyen and hur 2011 spectroscopic information in this study confirm prior works on srfa that it likely contains relatively a higher aromatic content helms et al 2008 and more condensed polyaromatic structures fuentes et al 2006 marschner and kalbitz 2003 compared to adom 3 2 changes in source discrimination indices by biogeochemical processes 3 2 1 biodegradation induced changes biodegradation of the dom mixtures using microbial inoculation resulted in decreased doc concentrations as expected the doc reduction was more pronounced for adom than for srfa 82 6 vs 0 9 from the initial concentrations respectively after 7 day incubations fig 2 table s3 the doc loss occurred mostly within first 1 day of the incubation which was 67 99 of the total doc reduction by day 28 fig s7 1 the results agreed with the other prior studies using soil derived and algal dom samples which also found faster loss of algal dom than soil leached organic matter nguyen and hur 2011 hansen et al 2016 the 7 day long biodegradation resulted in substantial decrease of s275 295 for adom 0 0270 0 0038 nm 1 in comparison with the change for srfa 0 0053 0 0050 nm 1 fig s7 2 the relative changes in uv absorption spectra of dom samples became more pronounced with incubation time 1 d 3 d 7 d 28 d fig s7 3 however it caused only slight changes suva254 values for srfa 5 07 5 17 l mg c 1 m 1 and adom 1 19 1 02 l mg c 1 m 1 the increased suva254 values can be attributed to the preferential microbial removal of labile aliphatic structures and small molecular size dom molecules hur et al 2009 2011c hix values of the two end members increased after biodegradation with a larger increase shown for adom versus srfa fig 2 which were in line with prior studies hansen et al 2016 hur et al 2009 2011c the change in bix values was not as pronounced for srfa with only 1 of the variation shown after 7 days of incubation while bix declined to 25 of the initial value for adom fig 2 the fi value of adom increased upon biodegradation while the change was negligible for srfa with only 1 4 variation for the ratios of different fdom components no noticeable variations were found for c1 c2 ratios while the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 increased after biodegradation fig 3 and fig s10 2 these results suggest that biodegradation processes preferentially removed tryptophan like or protein like components in dom similar changes in dom fluorescence were observed in previous studies using dom samples derived from algae and leaf litter biers et al 2007 hur et al 2009 2011c in addition enzymatic processes of microbial degradation may lead to the enhancement of condensed aromatic structures or microbial humification causing a red shift of fulvic like fluorescence hur et al 2009 ohno 2002 ohno et al 2010 zsolnay et al 1999 microbial humification of adom generating structures that have increased conjugation was consistent with the higher values of hix we observed in our biodegradation experiments the changing trends of the optical properties were generally similar to those previously reported even though the previous results were based on different experimental conditions e g microbial communities irradiation intensity solution chemistry dom sources and so on table s6 3 2 2 photodegradation induced changes after uv irradiation 6 variation was observed for the doc concentrations of the two end members and the mixtures fig 2 fig s8 1 and table s4 previous studies have reported a range of doc changes in dom samples by uv irradiation from substantial reductions to virtually no reduction hansen et al 2016 showed a minor reduction 3 in doc for the dom samples derived from soil plant and algae upon uva irradiation while hur et al 2011a reported a substantial reduction 22 of doc concentrations in srfa after 12 days of uv irradiation other studies reported that 32 60 of lake dom pool could be mineralized to co2 by uv irradiation du et al 2016 xu and jiang 2013 the minimal change in the doc concentration after 10 days of uv irradiation can be explained by incomplete mineralization of dom structures under the irradiation it is suspected that the slight rise doc in the adom dominant samples might be related to increased biomass by microbial growth the preservative used nan3 absorbs uv irradiation which may have reduced its anti microbial properties although further studies are warranted to determine this possibility s275 295 values increased substantially for both srfa 0 0054 0 0120 nm 1 and adom 0 0280 0 0360 nm 1 after 10 days of uv irradiation fig s8 2 indicating preferential loss of long wave absorbance similar to the result of biodegradation the relative changes of uv absorption spectra of dom samples tended to increase with uv irradiation time 3 d 10 d fig s8 3 the suva254 values decreased after uv irradiation with more pronounced changes shown for srfa versus adom fig 2 and fig s8 2 for example the extent of the reduction in the suva254 values corresponded to 25 5 and 1 1 of the initial values for srfa and algal dom respectively similar results were reported in the prior studies using srfa and algal derived dom hur et al 2011a xu and jiang 2013 the decreased suva values can be explained by preferential removal of aromatic chromophores and or partial transformation of some chromophores into non uv absorbing compounds upon uv irradiation hur et al 2011a no reduction in doc but decreased suva values suggest that the irradiation induced dom changes did not reach mineralization to co2 but mostly resulted in degradation of aromatic and other conjugated structures during our experiments the uv irradiation resulted in the decrease in hix values and a corresponding increase in bix values fig 2 the changes were more pronounced for srfa than for adom one exception was the increase in hixohno value of the algal dom after exposure overall the linearly decreasing trend of hixzsolnay was consistent with our previous observations of the changes in suva254 values after uv irradiation indicating the reduction of aromatic structures in dom by photodegradation however contradictory results were also found in prior studies hansen et al 2016 reported larger changes in the hixohno values for algal dom than for soil derived dom after uva irradiation for 4 h increased hixzsolnay values upon irradiation were also reported for lake dom du et al 2016 osburn et al 2011 in this study the irradiation induced change in fi values were more pronounced for adom than for srfa resulting in more distinct differences in the values between the two end members after the irradiation reduced aromaticity in dom upon uv irradiation can be largely responsible for the changes in the fi values cory et al 2005 jaffé et al 2008 the bix values followed the changing trends of the fi values which were in the opposite direction to trends in suva254 hixzsolnay and hixohno the irradiation induced changes in dom fluorescence depended on the fdom components as well as the end members the c1 c2 ratios increased for both srfa and adom fig 3 and fig s10 2 however the changes in the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 were different depending upon dom source with decreasing trends for srfa but little variation for adom these results agreed well with those from prior studies for example protein like fluorophores tend to be resistant to photodegradation than humic like counterparts e g peaks a m and c in eem while humic like fluorophores with excitation maxima within the uva band i e 315 400 nm are quite susceptible to photodegradation du et al 2016 phong and hur 2015 therefore the humic like and the tryptophan like components can be associated with photolabile dom and residual products respectively in general the observed changes in the optical proxies reflected preferential removal of aromatic structures and relatively bio refractory fractions from the dom mixture samples while the labile part tended to be resistant to photodegradation likely due to its lack of absorption 3 2 3 adsorption induced changes the addition of kaolin 25 g l 1 resulted in substantial reduction in doc with more pronounced change shown for srfa 47 versus adom 1 fig 2 fig s9 1 and table s5 s275 295 of srfa increased from 0 0056 to 0 008 nm 1 while that of adom decreased from 0 033 to 0 0265 nm 1 fig s9 2 the relative changes of uv absorption spectra were greater at the kaolin addition of 5 g l 1 versus 2 5 g l 1 fig s9 3 only suva254 values for srfa were reduced to a great extent due to adsorption onto kaolin fig 2 and fig s9 2 suggesting the preferential adsorption of aromatic moieties onto the mineral surface the results were consistent with prior work which suggested hydrophobic interactions as a major adsorption mechanism at ph 7 hur et al 2011b it is known that hydrophobic interactions may prevail over other mechanisms including electrostatic attraction for dom adsorption onto minerals when the solution ph is higher than the zero point of charge value of the adsorbent hur and schlautman 2003a in the adsorption processes where hydrophobic interactions are dominant the adsorption affinity of minerals are correlated positively with the aromaticity of dom and inversely with the dom polarity expressed as o c atomic ratios balcke et al 2002 hur and schlautman 2003b the hix values of srfa showed substantial reduction after adsorption while only a slight increase in hix was observed for adom fig 2 and fig s9 2 the opposite trends were observed in the changes of the bix values between the two end members after adsorption with 49 increase for srfa and 31 reduction for algal dom the fi increased up to 17 from the control value for srfa while it was stable for algal dom the mineral adsorption led to the increase of c1 c2 ratios and the declines of the c1 c3 and c2 c3 ratios for srfa and the dom mixtures while no to little variations were observed for adom fig 3 and fig s10 2 the most pronounced changes in the ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 were found for srfa suggesting humic like components with allochthonous origins are preferably adsorbed to mineral surfaces the trends of increased c1 c2 ratios were consistent with the adsorption mechanism i e hydrophobic interactions presumed for the dom mineral systems hur and schlautman 2003a kleber et al 2007 the fluorescent components with the maximum peak emission at a longer wavelength e g c2 versus c1 for this study have been related to humic substance of relatively larger molecular size and of a high degree of structural condensation hur and kim 2009 lee et al 2015 which can be more favorable for adsorption via hydrophobic interactions 3 2 4 relationships between dom aromatic content and source discrimination indices the optical proxies used for source discrimination also reflect dom composition particularly aromatic structures of dom in this study potential changes in the relationships between the optical indices and aromatic content expressed by suva254 here were explored using the dom mixtures under the influence of the three biogeochemical processes fig s11 hixzsolnay c1 c3 and c2 c3 exhibited positive correlations with suva254 values while negative relationships were observed for c1 c2 bix and fi the positive or the negative trends were consistent with those previously reported in many prior studies fuentes et al 2006 hur et al 2009 2011b mcknight et al 2001 zsolnay et al 1999 although the dom mixtures were affected by different biogeochemical processes all the samples followed the general trends between the indices and suva values fig s11 these results suggest that irrespectively of the biogeochemical alternation on dom composition the relationships between the optical indices and dom composition may not be seriously disturbed by the processing in aquatic environments this finding explains why such relationships have been commonly found in many literature despite the wide ranges of dom origins and sampling locations 3 3 deviations of source discrimination indices from the emma relationships before the biogeochemical processes were considered the initial relationships between the spectroscopic indices and the abundance of algal content in the mixture mostly followed conservative mixing behavior although there were some exceptions e g hixohno bix fi fig 2 the observed relationships could be grouped into four different trends 1 a linear decreasing trend i e suva254 hixzsonlay 2 an exponential decreasing trend i e hixohno c1 c3 c2 c3 3 an exponential increasing trend i e s275 295 bix fi and 4 a stable trend i e c1 c2 the relationships constructed using the original mixtures in this study were consistent with those of yang and hur 2014 3 3 1 biodegradation induced deviations from the initial relationships after biodegradation the initial trends of the optical indices with increasing algal content in the mixture mostly remained the same in the relationship types except for the s275 295 value changing from increasing exponential trend to a stable trend and the suva254 values shifting from a linear to non linear relationship figs 2 and 3 the values of suva254 hixzsolnay hixohno and fi in the dom mixtures were overall shifted upward after biodegradation while s275 295 showed the opposite trend in the values i e downward the source discrimination capability of an index can be evaluated using 1 the percent difference between the measured values and those predicted by ideal mixing behavior 2 the r2 value was calculated based on the linear regression between the optical indices and algal carbon content exponential relationships were first log transformed to make them comparable with linear indices and 3 the regression slope divided by the analytical standard deviation i e s sd yang and hur 2014 in this study the effects of biogeochemical processes on an index s capability to predict sources were assessed firstly by using the average values of the absolute percent difference apd in the indices between the control and the treated samples secondly using the s sd values and lastly by the r2 values of the relationships table 1 the first evaluation parameter is related to the accuracy in the prediction of the source assignment based on a conservative mixing assumption while the second can be a measure of the sensitivity of the index to changing sources in dom mixtures relative to its uncertainty in the measurements therefore the indices with relatively low apd and relatively high values of the s sd and r2 values from the regression relationships can be regarded as good predictors for the relative contributions of different sources in samples with two end members for example although the c1 c2 ratios exhibited the lowest apd 2 9 among the tested optical indices it was difficult to distinguish between the two contrasting sources because of the low regression slope by contrast hixzsolnay exhibited the highest slope with a distinct difference between the two end members without any change in the relationship however the upward shifting trend after biodegradation resulted in a great extent of the deviation of the index from those predicted based on the initial relationship before biodegradation based on the evaluation criteria bix can be suggested as a rather robust indices in discriminating the two different dom sources in aquatic systems under severe biodegradation processes table 1 it was interesting to observe that except for a short incubation time i e 1 day the measured first order degradation rates of dom mixtures also followed the ideal mixing line which was constructed based on the mixing ratios and the individual rate constants of the two end members fig s7 4 this result suggests that the ideal mixing assumption can be applied to predict the biodegradation rates of dom samples with different sources 3 3 2 uv irradiation induced deviations from the initial relationships uv irradiation did not lead to the changes in the types of the relationships between the indices and algal carbon content in the dom mixtures however most of indices showed fairly large deviations from the relationships between the control and treated samples upon photodegradation figs 2 and 3 for example suva254 and hixzsolnay exhibited negative linear regression lines after uv irradiation which were similar to those before uv irradiation however compared to the control samples both indices values decreased in the srfa dominant sample after uv irradiation while relatively smaller changes were found in the algal dominant dom mixtures fig 2 after uv irradiation ratios of c1 c3 and c2 c3 showed lower regression slopes which indicated the lesser extent of changes to these ratios with increasing algal carbon content fig 3 the apd was the lowest for fi 4 5 followed by suva 27 7 and hixohno 29 8 meanwhile the s sd values were relatively high for hixohno 0 118 suva254 0 050 and hixzsolnay 0 038 despite the smallest apd fi did not show strong source discrimination capability for the srfa dominated dom mixtures with respect to its sensitivity fig 2 and fig s8 2 with its relatively low s d value 0 008 among the tested indices suva254 exhibited the best performance in the source discrimination considering the effects of photodegradation 3 3 3 adsorption induced deviations from the initial relationships similar to the irradiation induced changes the shapes of the relationships between the indices and algal carbon content in dom mixtures were not altered by mineral adsorption figs 2 and 3 one exception was fi which showed a linearly increasing trend with algal carbon content in contrast to a concave up curve shown for the control samples i e before adsorption fig 2 substantial differences were found in the individual indices between before and after adsorption for example the values shifted down after adsorption from the indices of suva254 hixzsolnay and hixohno while the opposite trends were found for s275 295 bix fi and c1 c2 figs 2 and 3 fig s9 1 for the adsorption affected dom mixtures the apd was smallest for fi 16 1 followed by c1 c2 38 1 s275 295 47 0 and bix 49 1 among these indices the s sd values were highest for hixohno 0 186 followed by suva254y 0 049 and hixzsolnay 0 040 although fi widely used as a conventional dom source tracking index showed a high accuracy for source discrimination i e the lowest apd its sensitivity was found to be low as indicated by the small s sd value suggesting the ineffectiveness in the source discrimination capability where adsorption processes are dominant based on the evaluation criteria c1 c2 was found to be good indices for tracking dom sources in aquatic systems with high clay or other mineral content where adsorption is important 3 4 implications for the applicability of the indices under biogeochemical processes our results demonstrate that conservative mixing behaviors of well known spectroscopic indices which is a major assumption for emma could be seriously disrupted by biogeochemical processes yang and hur 2014 after biogeochemical processing by microbes photodegradation and adsorption to kaolin most of the indices tested here showed the large shifts from the levels predicted based on the mixing relationships of different sources and even altered the regression relationships of the index with increasing one end member in dom mixtures i e linear or non linear resulting in dramatic differences between the measured values and those predicted by the original mixing relationships or emma ideally the proper index for source discrimination should be rather insensitive to biogeochemical process and be well distinguishable between different dom sources this study provided strong evidence that the application of well known optical indices for source tracking via emma could lead to the wrong estimation of source contribution to dom without careful consideration of the biogeochemical processes that might otherwise affect the indices used to discriminate its sources for example under the environments with dominant biodegradation processes autochthonous source assignment to dom samples based on fi could be overestimated fig 2 while biodegradation heightens the possibility of the under estimation of autochthonous origins in dom using hix values photodegradation and kaolin adsorption likely lead to the underestimation of allochthonous dom among the indices tested here the variability of bix and suva254 were the smallest after biodegradation and uv irradiation respectively while both bix and fi were rather robust to the changes upon mineral adsorption table 1 these results suggest that these optical indices could provide reliable estimates on dom source independent of each biogeochemical process in addition our study showed the potential difficulty of using spectroscopic indices in accurately assigning different sources to dom in aquatic environments where such biogeochemical processes are important systems with long residence times where biogeochemical processing can operate especially surface waters of lakes reservoirs and estuaries will stand to have the largest uncertainty in sources using the optical indices studied here for example osburn et al 2012 observed a large shift in the quality of fluorescent organic matter pools upon biodegradation and or upon the exposure to sunlight in an estuary despite these uncertainties however combining emma relationships altered by the individual biogeochemical processes would provide critical information in interpreting the sources and reactivities of dom in aquatic environments it is highly advisable for proper data interpretation to identify the dominant biogeochemical processes possibly applicable to dom in a particular system consequently the results presented in this study can be utilized to probe the most dominant biogeochemical process affecting dom in aquatic environments by comparing the measured values with the conservative mixing line of the original end members where those end members are known yang and hur 2014 in some case it may be necessary to obtain proxy values of different dom end members which already reflected the particular processes driven changes further studies using other terrestrial and aquatic dom sources under an array of experimental conditions are warranted to test the use of emma relationships as done for the present on only two dom sources further these relationships should be tested and validated for field samples in future studies nevertheless this study adds value in that this is the first to examine the potential changes in the emma relationships of optical proxies which are a critical information in dom source tracking under the influence of three different biogeochemical processes 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated that three important biogeochemical processes in natural waters might cause significant changes to key optical indices used to track source of dom highlighting their important effects under changing contributions of dom sources compared to conservative mixing between terrestrial and algal end members most indices were different with changes related to the source of the organic matter in general the spectroscopic indices we investigated in this study revealed changes in the opposite direction between biodegradation and uv irradiation kaolin adsorption biodegradation resulted in enhanced aromaticity increase in suva254 hix and humic like fluorescence but a reduction in aliphatic and labile fractions decrease in bix and protein like fluorescence both uv irradiation and adsorption altered the optical indices of terrestrial dom to make it resemble dom with lower degrees of aromaticity and humification i e the decrease in suva254 and hix and the increase of bix the optical indices of bix and suva254 seem to be robust proxies for dom source discrimination under the influence of biodegradation and uv irradiation respectively as shown by the small differences between treatments and controls and the high sensitivity of the regression relationships changing with increasing one end member in the dom mixtures under kaolin adsorption both bix and fi could be suggested as good source discrimination indices we caution that the simple application of the spectroscopic indices via emma without the consideration of the biogeochemical influences could result in serious errors e g under or over estimation in assigning the relative contribution of dom sources in natural waters our study provides new insight into the applicability of well known optical indices for dom source tracking in aquatic systems where biogeochemical processes are dominant acknowledgments this work was supported by a

19242,the degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes was compared at practical concentrations in simulated drinking water and wastewater in pure water the uv chlorine process performed better than the uv h2o2 process for the degradation of 16 ppcps among the investigated 28 ppcps under neutral conditions interestingly the uv chlorine approach was superior to the uv h2o2 approach for the removal of all ppcps in simulated drinking water and wastewater at the same molar oxidant dosage the radical sink by oxidants and or h2o was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher in uv chlorine than uv h2o2 in pure water thus the uv chlorine process was less affected by the water and wastewater matrices than uv h2o2 in uv chlorine the concentration of clo was calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of ho in pure water and the reactivities of clo with some ppcps were as high as 108 m 1 s 1 clo was mainly scavenged by the effluent organic matter efom with a rate constant of 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 in wastewater meanwhile secondary radicals such as br br2 clbr and co3 further contributed to ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine process in wastewater whose concentrations were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in uv h2o2 compared with the uv h2o2 process the uv chlorine process saved 3 5 93 5 and 19 1 98 1 electrical energy per order ee o for ppcp degradation in simulated drinking water and wastewater respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chlorine uv h2o2 advanced oxidation process hydroxyl radicals reactive halogen radicals water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are of increasing concern due to their presence in aquatic environments at the ng l 1 μg l 1 levels daughton and ternes 1999 ppcps include antibiotics β blockers blood lipid regulators non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids antiepileptic drugs and antidepressants yan and song 2014 most of the ppcps are primarily discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants into surface water due to their incomplete removal efficiency by biological treatment processes carballa et al 2004 in water and wastewater treatment chlorine and ozone are widely used for oxidation disinfection however most ppcps are not reactive towards free chlorine and ozone ikehata et al 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 sharma 2008 wert et al 2009 thus advanced treatments are needed to remove various ppcps in water and wastewater treatment the uv h2o2 process is a conventional advanced oxidation process aop based on the production of hydroxyl radical ho via h2o2 photolysis the quantum yield of ho production and the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 254 nm were 0 5 mol e 1 and 18 6 m 1 cm 1 respectively morgan et al 1988 liao and gurol 1995 the uv h2o2 process has been reported to efficiently degrade many ppcps such as bisphenol a caffeine carbamazepine chloramphenicol diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen metoprolol primidone ronidazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim because their rate constants k reacting with ho are as high as 109 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 however ho could be scavenged significantly by water matrices such as carbonate bicarbonate and dissolved organic matter dom kim et al 2009 whose concentrations in real water are at the level of mg l 1 which are much higher than ppcps rosario ortiz et al 2010 furthermore the chemical cost of uv h2o2 is considerable since the low uv absorbance of h2o2 and the significant scavenging effects of ho by the water matrix components require excessive h2o2 dosing lee et al 2016 in most drinking water practices only 5 10 of the added peroxide is consumed by the treatment rosenfeldt et al 2013 the unreacted peroxide requires quenching which further increases the cost keen et al 2013 the uv chlorine process is an emerging aop as an alternative to the uv h2o2 process by producing ho and reactive chlorine species rcs the quantum yields of hocl and ocl by uv photolysis and their absorptivity were reported to be higher than h2o2 feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 compared to ho rcs such as cl cl2 and clo are also powerful oxidants with oxidation potentials of 2 47 v 2 0 v and 1 5 1 8 v respectively alfassi et al 1988 neta et al 1988 beitz et al 1998 in the uv chlorine process ho mainly contributes to the degradation of electron withdrawing compounds such as ibuprofen and ronidazole qin et al 2014 xiang et al 2016 while rcs are selective and preferentially react with electron rich moieties containing olefins phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes such as carbamazepine naproxen clenbuterol salbutamol sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim guo et al 2017 specifically the role of clo in the uv chlorine process has been gaining attention recently due to its high concentration 10 10 m and relatively high reaction rates towards some ppcps guo et al 2017 due to the contribution of rcs in uv chlorine uv chlorine more efficiently removes some micropollutants such as benzoate 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine trimethoprim and atrazine compared with uv h2o2 kong et al 2016 wu et al 2016 chuang et al 2017 however only a few ppcps were selected to compare their removal efficiency by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 at practical concentrations in real water samples ng l 1 μg l 1 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016a therefore the degradation of ppcps with various structures by these two aops should be comprehensively compared in real water the objective of this work was to compare the degradation of 28 typical ppcps by the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes in simulated drinking water and secondary wastewater with respects to kinetics radical mechanism and energy requirements the kinetic models involving major radicals were applied to predict the ppcp degradation by the two processes in simulated drinking water and wastewater the sinks for primary radicals in pure water and real water were quantitatively elucidated the energy consumption was investigated for the two processes by using electrical energy per order ee o 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the ppcps and isotopic internal standards were obtained from sigma aldrich or toronto research chemicals trc unless otherwise noted the preparation for the calibration solutions working stock solution

nom in pure water to achieve a concentration of 1 mg l 1 as toc the secondary wastewater effluent was obtained from the taicang wastewater treatment plant in shanghai the water parameters of the wwtp effluent were listed in table s1 including 1 3 mm hco3 5 75 μm br 2 92 mm cl and 3 5 mg l 1 dissolved organic matter as toc the effluent organic matter efom isolate was obtained from wastewater by solid phase extraction using ppl cartridges agilent bodhipaksha et al 2015 zhou et al 2017a an efom stock solution was prepared by dissolving efom powder in pure water and was used for the determination of the second order rate constant k clo between clo and efom 2 2 experimental procedure the photochemical reactor followed guo et al 2017 the average uv fluence rate ep0 was 0 78 mw cm 2 a 750 ml test solution containing 1 μg l 1 of each ppcp and 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with the oxidant naocl or h2o2 stock solution and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation at 25 0 2 c control experiments of direct uv irradiation and dark chlorine h2o2 oxidation were conducted under the same conditions the oxidant dosages of 10 20 and 50 μm were investigated the similar tests were also conducted in simulated drinking water containing 1 mg l 1 nom and the secondary wastewater effluent at ph 7 the oxidant dosages were 20 and 50 μm samples were quenched with ascorbic acid the experiments were repeated at least twice 2 3 analytical methods the ppcps were quantified by lc ms ms agilent 6430 with online solid phase extraction spe the details can be found in our former study guo et al 2017 the chlorine concentration was determined using the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the h2o2 concentration was measured by an i3 colorimetric method klassen et al 1994 the toc was determined by a toc analyser toc v csh shimadzu the ph was measured using a ph metre fe20 mettler toledo 2 4 kinetic model simulation the model contained 211 reactions and was implemented with kintecus v4 55 using rate constants k obtained from the literature when available table s3 or estimated based on data fitting function from kintecus v4 55 and similar reactions in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes text s3 compared to the previous model this model considered the scavenging of cl by clo2 clo2 and clo3 chuang et al 2017 the reactions involving co3 were also considered due to the reactions between ho or rcs with hco3 co3 2 which is widely present in aquatic systems by dissolving co2 wu et al 2017 the bromine related reactions were considered when modelling the radical concentrations in wastewater effluents 2 5 determination of the second order rate constants for clo reacting with the ppcps and efom the second order rate constants k clo for the reaction of clo with the ppcps were determined by competition kinetics between the target ppcps and a reference compound of gemfibrozil which was selected to be the reference compound due to its available k value with clo of 4 16 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 the reaction solution was spiked with a mixture of 1 μg l 1 ppcp to create an effective condition for clo 50 mm hco3 was spiked in the uv chlorine system with a chlorine dosage of 10 μm at ph 8 4 to scavenge ho cl and cl2 in this system using eqs 1 3 1 ho hco 3 h 2 o co 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 2 cl hco 3 h cl co 3 k 2 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 cl 2 hco 3 2 cl h co 3 k 8 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 the modelling result shows that the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 were suppressed by 97 2 96 8 and 99 9 respectively while that of clo was stable at 10 10 m figure s1 the k clo ppcp values were calculated using eq 4 guo et al 2017 4 ln ppcp 0 ppcp k c l o p p c p k c l o gemfibrozil ln gemfibrozil 0 gemfibrozil where k clo ppcp and k clo gemfibrozil represent the k of clo with the specific ppcp and gemfibrozil respectively figure s2 note that co3 with the concentration of 10 9 m figure s1 formed through eqs 1 3 could not be ignored in this system guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 thus the reactivity of co3 was also investigated with details shown in text s1 and figure s3 the parameter k clo of clo reacting with the efom was determined using dmob as a reference details shown in text s2 following the method in guo et al 2017 2 6 ee o calculation the electrical energy per order ee o was applied to calculate the energy consumption of removing each ppcp by the two processes the total ee o consists of the electrical energy for uv irradiation ee ouv and equivalent electrical energy for the oxidant consumption ee ooxidant the calculation of ee o ee ouv and ee

electronic energy input of the uv lamps in units of kw shown in text s4 v is the reaction volume l t is the reaction time h oxidant is the applied concentration of chlorine or h2o2 in units of mol l 1 log n n0 t is the logarithmic removal percentage of each ppcp at a certain time h eqoxidant is the equivalent electric energy consumption to produce per mole of oxidant eqchlorine 0 851 kw h mol 1 eqh2 o2 0 241 kw h mol 1 the unit conversion is detailed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes in pure water fig 1 compares the observed first order rate constants k of ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine and the uv h2o2 processes at an oxidant dosage of 10 μm at ph 7 in pure water the degradation of the ppcps was negligible by h2o2 alone not shown but that of trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole was significant by chlorination figure s4 uv photolysis was only efficient for diclofenac degradation k 0 159 min 1 the k of the 12 ppcps was higher by uv h2o2 while that of the other 16 ppcps was higher by uv chlorine it is apparent that k by uv chlorine presented a much broader range than uv h2o2 fig 1 inset to facilitate the discussion the ppcps were divided into two groups according to their degradation kinetics by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 as shown in fig 1 1 compounds that degraded faster by uv h2o2 than by uv chlorine at ph 7 were divided into group i for these compounds ho rather than rcs was the primary oxidant for their degradation by uv chlorine guo et al 2017 2 compounds that degraded more rapidly by uv chlorine than by uv h2o2 were classified into group ii for which rcs were important for their degradation by uv chlorine guo et al 2017 the steady state radical concentrations in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes at ph 7 were modelled to better understand the roles of specific radicals table 1 the concentration of ho in uv h2o2 was 1 97 10 13 m which was 36 8 higher than that in uv chlorine 1 44 10 13 m this behaviour is due to the higher scavenging rates of hocl ocl on ho k hocl ho 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl ho 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 than that of h2o2 k h2 o2 ho 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 at the same time the production of the rcs by uv chlorine was significant the modelled cl concentration was 9 52 10 15 m which was 15 times lower than ho table 1 in addition to the scavenging of cl by hocl ocl k hocl cl 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl cl 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 cl can be additionally scavenged by h2o or oh eqs 8 and 9 which forms cloh and further transforms to ho eq 10 chuang et al 2017 8 cl h 2 o cloh h k 2 50 10 5 s 1 9 cl oh cloh k 1 80 10 10 m 1 s 1 10 cloh ho cl k 6 10 10 9 s 1 the concentration of clo formed from the scavenging of ho and cl by hocl ocl was calculated to be 1 23 10 10 m which was 3 5 orders of magnitude higher that of ho and cl additionally the reactivity of clo with several ppcps has been reported to be compound specific guo et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the k clo values of the ppcps in group i were determined to be 108 m 1 s 1 such as tinidazole 1 38 106 m 1 s 1 and ibuprofen 5 51 106 m 1 s 1 while those of metoprolol caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil in group ii were 108 m 1 s 1 the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar between the k clo of the aromatic ppcps and hammett σ constants were established by using the obtained rate constants text s5 and excel s1 the natural logarithms of k clo ln k clo of ibuprofen flumequine venlafaxine atenolol metoprolol and gemfibrozil increased linearly with increasing hammett σ constants eq 11 which represents the electron donating property of the aromatic compounds fig 2 11 ln k c l o 3 583 σ 15 028 r 2 0 935 where σ represents the hammett σ constants of the substituents on the aromatic compounds furthermore the unavailable k clo of some aromatic ppcps in group ii could be predicted by eq 11 such as diclofenac trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine and bisphenol a table 2 which are also higher than 108 m 1 s 1 the qsar of k clo and σ for the aromatic ppcps developed in this study was consistent with that of the bulk rcs and σ reported in guo et al 2017 3 2 effect of oxidant dosages on the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes fig 3 shows the effect of oxidant dosages on the degradation of the ppcps by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes the k values of all the ppcps increased with increasing h2o2 dosage by uv h2o2 from 10 to 50 μm due to the increasing k ho for ppcp degradation the k values of ppcps in group ii were significantly enhanced with increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm by uv chlorine but not for most ppcps in group i meanwhile k rcs was enhanced significantly for the degradation of most ppcps while k ho was only changed slightly note that ornidazole was selected as the ho probe in this study because it only reacted with ho during the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 the concentration of ho increased significantly from 1 97 10 13 m to 5 27 10 13 m with increasing h2o2 dosage from 10 to 50 μm in the uv h2o2 process table 1 the concentration of ho depended on the formation rate by the uv photolysis of h2o2 and the scavenging rate by water matrix components such as the phosphate buffer hco3 ppcps and oxidants by multiplying the individual concentrations of the scavengers with their rate constants with ho the scavenging rates of h2o2 and ppcps to scavenge ho in uv h2o2 are summarized in fig 4 a the main scavengers of ho were h2o2 and ppcps increasing the h2o2 dosage from 10 to 50 μm only promoted the scavenging rate of ho by 41 3 but promoted the ho production through uv photolysis by 400 thus the concentration of ho increased with increasing the h2o2 dosage during the uv h2o2 process in the uv chlorine process the concentration of ho varied slightly 1 44 10 13 m to 1 23 10 13 m with an increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm the main scavengers of ho in uv chlorine were hocl and ocl fig 4b the scavenging rate of hocl ocl on ho was in the range of 104 105 s 1 while that of the other components i e ppcps buffer and hco3 was only 1 23 103 s 1 table s4 thus the ho concentration kept stable with growing dosage as the enhanced ho production by chlorine photolysis was counteracted by the enhanced scavenging rate of chlorine the concentration of cl during the uv chlorine process increased from 9 52 10 15 m to 2 91 10 14 m with increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm as shown in fig 4b cl was primarily scavenged by h2o and free chlorine in uv chlorine at ph 7 but not the ppcps buffer and oh at ph 7 note that the k of each ppcp towards cl was unavailable and assumed to be 5 109 m 1 s 1 when evaluating the scavenging rates of the ppcps as chlorine dosage increased from 10 to 50 μm the total scavenging rates of hocl and ocl increased from 4 27 104 s 1 to 2 14 105 s 1 while that of h2o was 2 48 105 s 1 table s4 leading to an enhancement in the total scavenging rate by only 60 however the production of cl by chlorine photolysis was enhanced by 400 resulting in a significant increase in the cl concentration with increasing chlorine dosage the concentration of clo increased from 1 23 10 10 m to 2 68 10 10 m which was formed through the scavenging of ho and cl by hocl ocl wu et al 2017 this resulted in a significant enhancement in the ppcp degradation in group ii k clo 108 m 1 s 1 3 3 comparison of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in simulated drinking water fig 5 shows the ppcp degradation by these two processes at an oxidant dosage of 20 μm in simulated drinking water containing 1 mg l 1 nom at ph 7 interestingly the degradation of all ppcps by uv chlorine was higher than that by uv h2o2 compared with pure water the inhibition was significant for the degradation of all ppcps by uv h2o2 while the inhibition was only significant for the ppcps in group ii by uv chlorine figure s5 the significant inhibition of ppcp degradation by uv h2o2 with the presence of 1 mg l 1 nom was due to a decrease in the ho concentration by 76 from 3 25 10 13 m to 7 81 10 14 m table 1 the contribution of the nom for scavenging ho was 93 4 indicating that nom was the major ho scavenger during the uv h2o2 process fig 6 a during the uv chlorine process the ho concentration only decreased by 26 1 the contributions of nom and hocl ocl to the ho scavenging rate were 25 3 and 73 5 respectively fig 6b indicating that the main ho scavenger was hocl ocl rather than nom meanwhile the nom could also scavenge the rcs in uv chlorine the rate constants of the nom reacting with cl and clo were 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2017 the concentration of cl decreased by 3 7 while that of clo dropped significantly by 99 8 in the presence of the nom table 1 h2o and hocl ocl were the major cl scavengers with the contributions of 69 2 and 23 9 respectively fig 6c thus the slight change in the cl concentration was due to the insignificant contribution of nom to scavenge cl only 3 6 however the nom was the main scavenger of clo which significantly inhibited the degradation of ppcps in group ii dominated by clo guo et al 2017 a kinetic model for predicting the degradation of ppcps in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes was developed by considering the steady state concentrations of radicals and their reactivity with ppcps text s6 and figure s6 in uv h2o2 most of the predicted k values fitted well with the experimental results fig 7 a by considering ho and clo as the major radicals in uv chlorine the predicted k of the 15 ppcps in uv chlorine were satisfactorily fitted with the experimental k with a 50 error fig 7a especially for nitroimidazoles and ibuprofen in group i and caffeine carbamazepine and metoprolol in group ii however those of the 5 ppcps with electron donating groups were lower than the experimental k values by 54 76 in simulated drinking water including diclofenac trimethoprim ractopamine and bisphenol a the lower predicted k in uv chlorine may be due to the lack of contributions from the other radicals such as cl and cl2 in addition the degradation kinetics as a function of time by modelling fitted well with that by experiments for most ppcps in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes in simulated drinking water figure s6 which is consistent with the results shown in fig 7 3 4 comparison of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in wastewater fig 8 compares k of the ppcps by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes at ph 7 in a secondary wastewater effluent at the same molar oxidant dosage of 50 μm interestingly the k values of all the ppcps were higher by uv chlorine than by uv h2o2 due to the higher k ho and remarkable k other radicals in uv chlorine the k by uv h2o2 decreased significantly by 80 4 99 5 in the presence of the wastewater matrix figure s7 however the inhibition of k of the ppcps in group i and group ii by the wastewater matrix showed different trends using the uv chlorine process the k values of ppcps in group i and those dominated by chlorination in group ii decreased by 0 69 4 while the other k values in group ii deceased by 91 6 figure s7 3 4 1 scavenging of ho in uv h2o2 the ho concentration decreased from 5 27 10 13 m in pure water to 3 79 10 14 m in wastewater table 1 resulting in a suppression of the degradation of most ppcps the efom and br were likely to be major ho scavengers with rate constants of 3 3 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 and 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively yuan et al 2012 lou et al 2016 yang et al 2016b the contributions of efom and br to scavenging ho were 60 0 and 32 9 respectively while the contribution of hco3 was only 5 8 fig 9 a note that the scavenging of ho by cl was negligible due to its reversible reaction towards ho lian et al 2017 during the uv chlorine process the concentration of ho decreased from 1 23 10 13 m in pure water to 4 81 10 14 m in wastewater table 1 leading to a decrease in the k of most ppcps in group i in wastewater fig 9b shows that the main ho scavenger was hocl ocl 53 6 in wastewater while the contribution of the efom 38 5 to ho scavenging during the uv chlorine process was less important than that in uv h2o2 unlike the uv h2o2 system br did not scavenge ho directly in uv chlorine as it immediately reacted with hocl to form hobr at ph 7 figure s9 heeb et al 2014 although hobr could scavenge ho at 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 the scavenging contribution was insignificant 3 8 in uv chlorine furthermore ho could be generated by the uv photolysis of hobr zhao et al 2009 3 4 2 scavenging of rcs the scavenging effect of the water matrix on the rcs in the uv chlorine process was also significant the concentration of clo decreased from 2 68 10 10 m to 2 35 10 13 m while that of cl decreased from 2 91 10 14 m to 7 22 10 16 m table 1 the significant decrease in the clo concentration was due to its scavenging by the efom whose k was determined to be 1 83 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 figure s10 compared with nom the lower reactivity of the efom towards clo was likely because nom contains more electron donating functional groups than efom such as phenolic moieties zhang et al 2014 for cl hco3 h2o and chlorine were the major scavengers with contributions of 38 0 32 8 and 21 3 respectively while the contribution from the efom was only 6 0 fig 9c the scavenging of cl by hobr was negligible in uv chlorine 1 5 by assuming the rate constant of cl reacting with hobr was similar with that of hocl k hocl cl 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 cl was not considered a cl scavenger in the uv chlorine process as the concentration of cl was almost unchanged in the presence of cl fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016a wu et al 2017 3 4 3 formation of reactive bromine species rbs during the uv h2o2 process reactive bromine species rbs such as br br2 and clbr were formed with concentrations of 1 37 10 15 m 1 94 10 14 m and 6 01 10 15 m respectively table 1 the scavenging of ho by br resulted in the formation of broh via eq 12 which further transformed into br and br2 via eqs 13 15 cheng et al 2018 12 ho br broh k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 13 broh br br 2 oh k 1 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 14 broh h br h 2 o k 4 4 10 10 m 1 s 1 15 br br br 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 br2 was reported to be reactive towards specific organics such as aniline phenolate ion indole and dimethyl sulfide with k values of 108 109 m 1 s 1 national institute of standards and technology 2017 cl could react with br and br2 to form clbr yang et al 2014 which is reactive towards some specific ppcps such as caffeine wu et al 2017 in the uv chlorine process the concentration of hobr reached 5 56 μm in the presence of 5 74 μm br table 1 thus the k values by chlorination were significantly enhanced for some ppcps in wastewater such as venlafaxine erythromycin gemfibrozil clenbuterol salbutamol bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole figure s11 because hobr obr are more reactive than hocl ocl towards ppcps containing phenolic groups amines and sulfamides heeb et al 2014 on the other hand br and br2 were generated by the uv irradiation of hobr obr while bro was further generated through the scavenging of ho and br by hobr obr via eqs 16 19 zhao et al 2009

particularly the concentration of bro reached 5 06 10 10 m when ignoring the reaction between efom and bro 3 4 4 formation of co3 co3 are reactive towards some ppcps in group ii with rate constants 107 m 1 s 1 including naproxen propranolol clenbuterol diclofenac trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole table 2 and figure s2 during the uv h2o2 process co3 was generated by the scavenging of ho by hco3 whose concentration was 1 84 10 12 m table 1 however in the uv chlorine process the concentration of co3 was much higher 1 51 10 9 m which was formed via the scavenging of ho cl and br by hco3 with k values of 106 108 m 1 s 1 national institute of standards and technology 2017 in summary efom was expected to reduce degradation kinetics of ppcps in uv chlorine and the uv h2o2 systems by scavenging radicals particularly for clo in uv chlorine and ho in uv h2o2 figure s12 the scavenging with ho and rcs by other wastewater matrix components such as br and hco3 in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes formed secondary radicals such as rbs and co3 which can selectively react with several ppcps and compensate for the loss of ho and rcs the predicted k values of all ppcps in the uv h2o2 process fitted well with the experimental k values fig 7b in wastewater in uv chlorine the predicted k values of 17 ppcps were well fitted with the experimental k values with a 50 error such as nitroimidazoles venlafaxine ibuprofen caffeine carbamazepine gemfibrozil and trimethoprim however the contributions of rbs and co3 to ppcp degradation were not included in this model resulting to the underestimated predicted degradation of a few ppcps also the fitness of the ppcp degradation kinetics as a function of time by modelling and experiments figure s6 are consistent with the results shown in fig 7 for wastewater note that the reactive species from efom photochemistry such as ho and efom zhou et al 2017b was insignificant to the degradation of ppcps in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes as the ppcp degradation by uv alone in wastewater was suppressed compared with that in pure water figure s8 3 5 energy calculations the electrical energy per order ee o was applied to calculate the energy requirements of removing each ppcp by these two processes the ee o for a 90 ppcp transformation by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 varied in the ranges from 0 017 to 2 26 kw h m 3 and from 0 17 to 2 38 kw h m 3 respectively in simulated drinking water while the ee o varied in the ranges from 0 048 to 4 53 kw h m 3 and from 0 22 to 8 09 kw h m 3 respectively in wastewater fig 10 compared with the uv h2o2 process uv chlorine saved 3 5 93 5 and 19 1 98 1 of the ee o for the degradation of ppcps in drinking water and wastewater respectively generally the removal of the ppcps in group ii saved more ee o than that in group i during the uv chlorine process the ee o consists of the energy input of the uv ee ouv process and the cost of the oxidants ee ooxidant the ee ooxidant was the same for each ppcp at a specific oxidant dosage while the ee ouv was associated with the removal efficiency of each ppcp in aops in the uv h2o2 process the ee ouv dominated the ee o for all ppcp degradation 94 in both simulated drinking water and wastewater in the uv chlorine process the ee ouv dominated the ee o for the removal of most ppcps in group i 90 but not for that of some ppcps in group ii 10 6 64 7 in wastewater the ee ouv for the ppcp degradation driven by ho in group i in the uv chlorine process was lower than that in uv h2o2 due to less suppression of ho by water matrix during the uv chlorine process for the degradation of ppcps in group ii dominated by the rcs in uv chlorine the ee ouv for some ppcps such as naproxen propranolol clenbuterol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole was even less than 0 1 kw h m 3 the energy consumption can be higher for the uv h2o2 process when considering the reagent cost for quenching residual h2o2 4 conclusions and engineering implications in pure water among the investigated 28 ppcps the uv h2o2 process was superior to the uv chlorine process for the removal of 12 ppcps primarily driven by ho at neutral ph values while the uv chlorine process was better for the other 16 ppcps primarily driven by the rcs the concentration of ho was lower in the uv chlorine process than in the uv h2o2 process but rcs such as cl and clo in uv chlorine contributed to the degradation of ppcps with electron donating functional groups clo was important to the degradation of ppcps possessing electron rich groups in the uv chlorine process the steady state concentration of clo was calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of ho and the reactivities of clo with 16 ppcps were determined to be in the range of 106 109 m 1 s 1 the reactivity of clo ln k clo was linearly related to the hammett σσp constant for aromatic ppcps hocl ocl was a significant sink for ho in the uv chlorine process which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than h2o2 in the uv h2o2 process at ph 7 hocl ocl and h2o significantly scavenged cl in uv chlorine thus the scavenging effects of ho and cl by hocl ocl and h2o outweighed those by water matrix components such as nom and alkalinity resulting in the less effect of water matrix on uv chlorine than uv h2o2 in real water in simulated drinking water and wastewater the abatement of all ppcps was more efficient by uv chlorine than that by uv h2o2 considering the degradation kinetics and ee o the efom bromide and bicarbonate affected ppcp degradation by uv chlorine the secondary radicals such as br br2 bro clbr and co3 and hobr were 2 orders of magnitude higher in the uv chlorine process than the uv h2o2 process in wastewater which contributed to the degradation of several ppcps the findings of this study provide a better understanding of ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 aops in drinking water and wastewater the uv chlorine process is a good alternative to the uv h2o2 process with a better efficiency for ppcp degradation in water and wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was financially supported by

19242,the degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes was compared at practical concentrations in simulated drinking water and wastewater in pure water the uv chlorine process performed better than the uv h2o2 process for the degradation of 16 ppcps among the investigated 28 ppcps under neutral conditions interestingly the uv chlorine approach was superior to the uv h2o2 approach for the removal of all ppcps in simulated drinking water and wastewater at the same molar oxidant dosage the radical sink by oxidants and or h2o was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher in uv chlorine than uv h2o2 in pure water thus the uv chlorine process was less affected by the water and wastewater matrices than uv h2o2 in uv chlorine the concentration of clo was calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of ho in pure water and the reactivities of clo with some ppcps were as high as 108 m 1 s 1 clo was mainly scavenged by the effluent organic matter efom with a rate constant of 1 8 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 in wastewater meanwhile secondary radicals such as br br2 clbr and co3 further contributed to ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine process in wastewater whose concentrations were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in uv h2o2 compared with the uv h2o2 process the uv chlorine process saved 3 5 93 5 and 19 1 98 1 electrical energy per order ee o for ppcp degradation in simulated drinking water and wastewater respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chlorine uv h2o2 advanced oxidation process hydroxyl radicals reactive halogen radicals water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are of increasing concern due to their presence in aquatic environments at the ng l 1 μg l 1 levels daughton and ternes 1999 ppcps include antibiotics β blockers blood lipid regulators non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids antiepileptic drugs and antidepressants yan and song 2014 most of the ppcps are primarily discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants into surface water due to their incomplete removal efficiency by biological treatment processes carballa et al 2004 in water and wastewater treatment chlorine and ozone are widely used for oxidation disinfection however most ppcps are not reactive towards free chlorine and ozone ikehata et al 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 sharma 2008 wert et al 2009 thus advanced treatments are needed to remove various ppcps in water and wastewater treatment the uv h2o2 process is a conventional advanced oxidation process aop based on the production of hydroxyl radical ho via h2o2 photolysis the quantum yield of ho production and the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 at 254 nm were 0 5 mol e 1 and 18 6 m 1 cm 1 respectively morgan et al 1988 liao and gurol 1995 the uv h2o2 process has been reported to efficiently degrade many ppcps such as bisphenol a caffeine carbamazepine chloramphenicol diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen metoprolol primidone ronidazole sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim because their rate constants k reacting with ho are as high as 109 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 however ho could be scavenged significantly by water matrices such as carbonate bicarbonate and dissolved organic matter dom kim et al 2009 whose concentrations in real water are at the level of mg l 1 which are much higher than ppcps rosario ortiz et al 2010 furthermore the chemical cost of uv h2o2 is considerable since the low uv absorbance of h2o2 and the significant scavenging effects of ho by the water matrix components require excessive h2o2 dosing lee et al 2016 in most drinking water practices only 5 10 of the added peroxide is consumed by the treatment rosenfeldt et al 2013 the unreacted peroxide requires quenching which further increases the cost keen et al 2013 the uv chlorine process is an emerging aop as an alternative to the uv h2o2 process by producing ho and reactive chlorine species rcs the quantum yields of hocl and ocl by uv photolysis and their absorptivity were reported to be higher than h2o2 feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 compared to ho rcs such as cl cl2 and clo are also powerful oxidants with oxidation potentials of 2 47 v 2 0 v and 1 5 1 8 v respectively alfassi et al 1988 neta et al 1988 beitz et al 1998 in the uv chlorine process ho mainly contributes to the degradation of electron withdrawing compounds such as ibuprofen and ronidazole qin et al 2014 xiang et al 2016 while rcs are selective and preferentially react with electron rich moieties containing olefins phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes such as carbamazepine naproxen clenbuterol salbutamol sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim guo et al 2017 specifically the role of clo in the uv chlorine process has been gaining attention recently due to its high concentration 10 10 m and relatively high reaction rates towards some ppcps guo et al 2017 due to the contribution of rcs in uv chlorine uv chlorine more efficiently removes some micropollutants such as benzoate 1 4 dioxane carbamazepine trimethoprim and atrazine compared with uv h2o2 kong et al 2016 wu et al 2016 chuang et al 2017 however only a few ppcps were selected to compare their removal efficiency by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 at practical concentrations in real water samples ng l 1 μg l 1 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016a therefore the degradation of ppcps with various structures by these two aops should be comprehensively compared in real water the objective of this work was to compare the degradation of 28 typical ppcps by the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes in simulated drinking water and secondary wastewater with respects to kinetics radical mechanism and energy requirements the kinetic models involving major radicals were applied to predict the ppcp degradation by the two processes in simulated drinking water and wastewater the sinks for primary radicals in pure water and real water were quantitatively elucidated the energy consumption was investigated for the two processes by using electrical energy per order ee o 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the ppcps and isotopic internal standards were obtained from sigma aldrich or toronto research chemicals trc unless otherwise noted the preparation for the calibration solutions working stock solution and internal standard stock solution could be found in our former study guo et al 2017 sodium hypochlorite naocl 4 00 4 99 h2o2 solution 30 and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were purchased from sigma

nom in pure water to achieve a concentration of 1 mg l 1 as toc the secondary wastewater effluent was obtained from the taicang wastewater treatment plant in shanghai the water parameters of the wwtp effluent were listed in table s1 including 1 3 mm hco3 5 75 μm br 2 92 mm cl and 3 5 mg l 1 dissolved organic matter as toc the effluent organic matter efom isolate was obtained from wastewater by solid phase extraction using ppl cartridges agilent bodhipaksha et al 2015 zhou et al 2017a an efom stock solution was prepared by dissolving efom powder in pure water and was used for the determination of the second order rate constant k clo between clo and efom 2 2 experimental procedure the photochemical reactor followed guo et al 2017 the average uv fluence rate ep0 was 0 78 mw cm 2 a 750 ml test solution containing 1 μg l 1 of each ppcp and 2 mm phosphate buffer was dosed with the oxidant naocl or h2o2 stock solution and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation at 25 0 2 c control experiments of direct uv irradiation and dark chlorine h2o2 oxidation were conducted under the same conditions the oxidant dosages of 10 20 and 50 μm were investigated the similar tests were also conducted in simulated drinking water containing 1 mg l 1 nom and the secondary wastewater effluent at ph 7 the oxidant dosages were 20 and 50 μm samples were quenched with ascorbic acid the experiments were repeated at least twice 2 3 analytical methods the ppcps were quantified by lc ms ms agilent 6430 with online solid phase extraction spe the details can be found in our former study guo et al 2017 the chlorine concentration was determined using the dpd fas titration method apha awwa wef 2012 the h2o2 concentration was measured by an i3 colorimetric method klassen et al 1994 the toc was determined by a toc analyser toc v csh shimadzu the ph was measured using a ph metre fe20 mettler toledo 2 4 kinetic model simulation the model contained 211 reactions and was implemented with kintecus v4 55 using rate constants k obtained from the literature when available table s3 or estimated based on data fitting function from kintecus v4 55 and similar reactions in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes text s3 compared to the previous model this model considered the scavenging of cl by clo2 clo2 and clo3 chuang et al 2017 the reactions involving co3 were also considered due to the reactions between ho or rcs with hco3 co3 2 which is widely present in aquatic systems by dissolving co2 wu et al 2017 the bromine related reactions were considered when modelling the radical concentrations in wastewater effluents 2 5 determination of the second order rate constants for clo reacting with the ppcps and efom the second order rate constants k clo for the reaction of clo with the ppcps were determined by competition kinetics between the target ppcps and a reference compound of gemfibrozil which was selected to be the reference compound due to its available k value with clo of 4 16 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 the reaction solution was spiked with a mixture of 1 μg l 1 ppcp to create an effective condition for clo 50 mm hco3 was spiked in the uv chlorine system with a chlorine dosage of 10 μm at ph 8 4 to scavenge ho cl and cl2 in this system using eqs 1 3 1 ho hco 3 h 2 o co 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 2 cl hco 3 h cl co 3 k 2 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 cl 2 hco 3 2 cl h co 3 k 8 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 the modelling result shows that the concentrations of ho cl and cl2 were suppressed by 97 2 96 8 and 99 9 respectively while that of clo was stable at 10 10 m figure s1 the k clo ppcp values were calculated using eq 4 guo et al 2017 4 ln ppcp 0 ppcp k c l o p p c p k c l o gemfibrozil ln gemfibrozil 0 gemfibrozil where k clo ppcp and k clo gemfibrozil represent the k of clo with the specific ppcp and gemfibrozil respectively figure s2 note that co3 with the concentration of 10 9 m figure s1 formed through eqs 1 3 could not be ignored in this system guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 thus the reactivity of co3 was also investigated with details shown in text s1 and figure s3 the parameter k clo of clo reacting with the efom was determined using dmob as a reference details shown in text s2 following the method in guo et al 2017 2 6 ee o calculation the electrical energy per order ee o was applied to calculate the energy consumption of removing each ppcp by the two processes the total ee o consists of the electrical energy for uv irradiation ee ouv and equivalent electrical energy for the oxidant consumption ee ooxidant the calculation of ee o ee ouv and ee

electronic energy input of the uv lamps in units of kw shown in text s4 v is the reaction volume l t is the reaction time h oxidant is the applied concentration of chlorine or h2o2 in units of mol l 1 log n n0 t is the logarithmic removal percentage of each ppcp at a certain time h eqoxidant is the equivalent electric energy consumption to produce per mole of oxidant eqchlorine 0 851 kw h mol 1 eqh2 o2 0 241 kw h mol 1 the unit conversion is detailed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes in pure water fig 1 compares the observed first order rate constants k of ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine and the uv h2o2 processes at an oxidant dosage of 10 μm at ph 7 in pure water the degradation of the ppcps was negligible by h2o2 alone not shown but that of trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole was significant by chlorination figure s4 uv photolysis was only efficient for diclofenac degradation k 0 159 min 1 the k of the 12 ppcps was higher by uv h2o2 while that of the other 16 ppcps was higher by uv chlorine it is apparent that k by uv chlorine presented a much broader range than uv h2o2 fig 1 inset to facilitate the discussion the ppcps were divided into two groups according to their degradation kinetics by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 as shown in fig 1 1 compounds that degraded faster by uv h2o2 than by uv chlorine at ph 7 were divided into group i for these compounds ho rather than rcs was the primary oxidant for their degradation by uv chlorine guo et al 2017 2 compounds that degraded more rapidly by uv chlorine than by uv h2o2 were classified into group ii for which rcs were important for their degradation by uv chlorine guo et al 2017 the steady state radical concentrations in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes at ph 7 were modelled to better understand the roles of specific radicals table 1 the concentration of ho in uv h2o2 was 1 97 10 13 m which was 36 8 higher than that in uv chlorine 1 44 10 13 m this behaviour is due to the higher scavenging rates of hocl ocl on ho k hocl ho 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl ho 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 than that of h2o2 k h2 o2 ho 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 at the same time the production of the rcs by uv chlorine was significant the modelled cl concentration was 9 52 10 15 m which was 15 times lower than ho table 1 in addition to the scavenging of cl by hocl ocl k hocl cl 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 k ocl cl 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 cl can be additionally scavenged by h2o or oh eqs 8 and 9 which forms cloh and further transforms to ho eq 10 chuang et al 2017 8 cl h 2 o cloh h k 2 50 10 5 s 1 9 cl oh cloh k 1 80 10 10 m 1 s 1 10 cloh ho cl k 6 10 10 9 s 1 the concentration of clo formed from the scavenging of ho and cl by hocl ocl was calculated to be 1 23 10 10 m which was 3 5 orders of magnitude higher that of ho and cl additionally the reactivity of clo with several ppcps has been reported to be compound specific guo et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the k clo values of the ppcps in group i were determined to be 108 m 1 s 1 such as tinidazole 1 38 106 m 1 s 1 and ibuprofen 5 51 106 m 1 s 1 while those of metoprolol caffeine carbamazepine and gemfibrozil in group ii were 108 m 1 s 1 the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar between the k clo of the aromatic ppcps and hammett σ constants were established by using the obtained rate constants text s5 and excel s1 the natural logarithms of k clo ln k clo of ibuprofen flumequine venlafaxine atenolol metoprolol and gemfibrozil increased linearly with increasing hammett σ constants eq 11 which represents the electron donating property of the aromatic compounds fig 2 11 ln k c l o 3 583 σ 15 028 r 2 0 935 where σ represents the hammett σ constants of the substituents on the aromatic compounds furthermore the unavailable k clo of some aromatic ppcps in group ii could be predicted by eq 11 such as diclofenac trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine and bisphenol a table 2 which are also higher than 108 m 1 s 1 the qsar of k clo and σ for the aromatic ppcps developed in this study was consistent with that of the bulk rcs and σ reported in guo et al 2017 3 2 effect of oxidant dosages on the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes fig 3 shows the effect of oxidant dosages on the degradation of the ppcps by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes the k values of all the ppcps increased with increasing h2o2 dosage by uv h2o2 from 10 to 50 μm due to the increasing k ho for ppcp degradation the k values of ppcps in group ii were significantly enhanced with increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm by uv chlorine but not for most ppcps in group i meanwhile k rcs was enhanced significantly for the degradation of most ppcps while k ho was only changed slightly note that ornidazole was selected as the ho probe in this study because it only reacted with ho during the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 the concentration of ho increased significantly from 1 97 10 13 m to 5 27 10 13 m with increasing h2o2 dosage from 10 to 50 μm in the uv h2o2 process table 1 the concentration of ho depended on the formation rate by the uv photolysis of h2o2 and the scavenging rate by water matrix components such as the phosphate buffer hco3 ppcps and oxidants by multiplying the individual concentrations of the scavengers with their rate constants with ho the scavenging rates of h2o2 and ppcps to scavenge ho in uv h2o2 are summarized in fig 4 a the main scavengers of ho were h2o2 and ppcps increasing the h2o2 dosage from 10 to 50 μm only promoted the scavenging rate of ho by 41 3 but promoted the ho production through uv photolysis by 400 thus the concentration of ho increased with increasing the h2o2 dosage during the uv h2o2 process in the uv chlorine process the concentration of ho varied slightly 1 44 10 13 m to 1 23 10 13 m with an increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm the main scavengers of ho in uv chlorine were hocl and ocl fig 4b the scavenging rate of hocl ocl on ho was in the range of 104 105 s 1 while that of the other components i e ppcps buffer and hco3 was only 1 23 103 s 1 table s4 thus the ho concentration kept stable with growing dosage as the enhanced ho production by chlorine photolysis was counteracted by the enhanced scavenging rate of chlorine the concentration of cl during the uv chlorine process increased from 9 52 10 15 m to 2 91 10 14 m with increasing chlorine dosage from 10 to 50 μm as shown in fig 4b cl was primarily scavenged by h2o and free chlorine in uv chlorine at ph 7 but not the ppcps buffer and oh at ph 7 note that the k of each ppcp towards cl was unavailable and assumed to be 5 109 m 1 s 1 when evaluating the scavenging rates of the ppcps as chlorine dosage increased from 10 to 50 μm the total scavenging rates of hocl and ocl increased from 4 27 104 s 1 to 2 14 105 s 1 while that of h2o was 2 48 105 s 1 table s4 leading to an enhancement in the total scavenging rate by only 60 however the production of cl by chlorine photolysis was enhanced by 400 resulting in a significant increase in the cl concentration with increasing chlorine dosage the concentration of clo increased from 1 23 10 10 m to 2 68 10 10 m which was formed through the scavenging of ho and cl by hocl ocl wu et al 2017 this resulted in a significant enhancement in the ppcp degradation in group ii k clo 108 m 1 s 1 3 3 comparison of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in simulated drinking water fig 5 shows the ppcp degradation by these two processes at an oxidant dosage of 20 μm in simulated drinking water containing 1 mg l 1 nom at ph 7 interestingly the degradation of all ppcps by uv chlorine was higher than that by uv h2o2 compared with pure water the inhibition was significant for the degradation of all ppcps by uv h2o2 while the inhibition was only significant for the ppcps in group ii by uv chlorine figure s5 the significant inhibition of ppcp degradation by uv h2o2 with the presence of 1 mg l 1 nom was due to a decrease in the ho concentration by 76 from 3 25 10 13 m to 7 81 10 14 m table 1 the contribution of the nom for scavenging ho was 93 4 indicating that nom was the major ho scavenger during the uv h2o2 process fig 6 a during the uv chlorine process the ho concentration only decreased by 26 1 the contributions of nom and hocl ocl to the ho scavenging rate were 25 3 and 73 5 respectively fig 6b indicating that the main ho scavenger was hocl ocl rather than nom meanwhile the nom could also scavenge the rcs in uv chlorine the rate constants of the nom reacting with cl and clo were 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2017 the concentration of cl decreased by 3 7 while that of clo dropped significantly by 99 8 in the presence of the nom table 1 h2o and hocl ocl were the major cl scavengers with the contributions of 69 2 and 23 9 respectively fig 6c thus the slight change in the cl concentration was due to the insignificant contribution of nom to scavenge cl only 3 6 however the nom was the main scavenger of clo which significantly inhibited the degradation of ppcps in group ii dominated by clo guo et al 2017 a kinetic model for predicting the degradation of ppcps in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes was developed by considering the steady state concentrations of radicals and their reactivity with ppcps text s6 and figure s6 in uv h2o2 most of the predicted k values fitted well with the experimental results fig 7 a by considering ho and clo as the major radicals in uv chlorine the predicted k of the 15 ppcps in uv chlorine were satisfactorily fitted with the experimental k with a 50 error fig 7a especially for nitroimidazoles and ibuprofen in group i and caffeine carbamazepine and metoprolol in group ii however those of the 5 ppcps with electron donating groups were lower than the experimental k values by 54 76 in simulated drinking water including diclofenac trimethoprim ractopamine and bisphenol a the lower predicted k in uv chlorine may be due to the lack of contributions from the other radicals such as cl and cl2 in addition the degradation kinetics as a function of time by modelling fitted well with that by experiments for most ppcps in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes in simulated drinking water figure s6 which is consistent with the results shown in fig 7 3 4 comparison of uv chlorine and uv h2o2 in wastewater fig 8 compares k of the ppcps by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes at ph 7 in a secondary wastewater effluent at the same molar oxidant dosage of 50 μm interestingly the k values of all the ppcps were higher by uv chlorine than by uv h2o2 due to the higher k ho and remarkable k other radicals in uv chlorine the k by uv h2o2 decreased significantly by 80 4 99 5 in the presence of the wastewater matrix figure s7 however the inhibition of k of the ppcps in group i and group ii by the wastewater matrix showed different trends using the uv chlorine process the k values of ppcps in group i and those dominated by chlorination in group ii decreased by 0 69 4 while the other k values in group ii deceased by 91 6 figure s7 3 4 1 scavenging of ho in uv h2o2 the ho concentration decreased from 5 27 10 13 m in pure water to 3 79 10 14 m in wastewater table 1 resulting in a suppression of the degradation of most ppcps the efom and br were likely to be major ho scavengers with rate constants of 3 3 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 and 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively yuan et al 2012 lou et al 2016 yang et al 2016b the contributions of efom and br to scavenging ho were 60 0 and 32 9 respectively while the contribution of hco3 was only 5 8 fig 9 a note that the scavenging of ho by cl was negligible due to its reversible reaction towards ho lian et al 2017 during the uv chlorine process the concentration of ho decreased from 1 23 10 13 m in pure water to 4 81 10 14 m in wastewater table 1 leading to a decrease in the k of most ppcps in group i in wastewater fig 9b shows that the main ho scavenger was hocl ocl 53 6 in wastewater while the contribution of the efom 38 5 to ho scavenging during the uv chlorine process was less important than that in uv h2o2 unlike the uv h2o2 system br did not scavenge ho directly in uv chlorine as it immediately reacted with hocl to form hobr at ph 7 figure s9 heeb et al 2014 although hobr could scavenge ho at 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 the scavenging contribution was insignificant 3 8 in uv chlorine furthermore ho could be generated by the uv photolysis of hobr zhao et al 2009 3 4 2 scavenging of rcs the scavenging effect of the water matrix on the rcs in the uv chlorine process was also significant the concentration of clo decreased from 2 68 10 10 m to 2 35 10 13 m while that of cl decreased from 2 91 10 14 m to 7 22 10 16 m table 1 the significant decrease in the clo concentration was due to its scavenging by the efom whose k was determined to be 1 83 104 mg l 1 1 s 1 figure s10 compared with nom the lower reactivity of the efom towards clo was likely because nom contains more electron donating functional groups than efom such as phenolic moieties zhang et al 2014 for cl hco3 h2o and chlorine were the major scavengers with contributions of 38 0 32 8 and 21 3 respectively while the contribution from the efom was only 6 0 fig 9c the scavenging of cl by hobr was negligible in uv chlorine 1 5 by assuming the rate constant of cl reacting with hobr was similar with that of hocl k hocl cl 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 cl was not considered a cl scavenger in the uv chlorine process as the concentration of cl was almost unchanged in the presence of cl fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016a wu et al 2017 3 4 3 formation of reactive bromine species rbs during the uv h2o2 process reactive bromine species rbs such as br br2 and clbr were formed with concentrations of 1 37 10 15 m 1 94 10 14 m and 6 01 10 15 m respectively table 1 the scavenging of ho by br resulted in the formation of broh via eq 12 which further transformed into br and br2 via eqs 13 15 cheng et al 2018 12 ho br broh k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 13 broh br br 2 oh k 1 9 10 8 m 1 s 1 14 broh h br h 2 o k 4 4 10 10 m 1 s 1 15 br br br 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 br2 was reported to be reactive towards specific organics such as aniline phenolate ion indole and dimethyl sulfide with k values of 108 109 m 1 s 1 national institute of standards and technology 2017 cl could react with br and br2 to form clbr yang et al 2014 which is reactive towards some specific ppcps such as caffeine wu et al 2017 in the uv chlorine process the concentration of hobr reached 5 56 μm in the presence of 5 74 μm br table 1 thus the k values by chlorination were significantly enhanced for some ppcps in wastewater such as venlafaxine erythromycin gemfibrozil clenbuterol salbutamol bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole figure s11 because hobr obr are more reactive than hocl ocl towards ppcps containing phenolic groups amines and sulfamides heeb et al 2014 on the other hand br and br2 were generated by the uv irradiation of hobr obr while bro was further generated through the scavenging of ho and br by hobr obr via eqs 16 19 zhao et al 2009 cheng et al 2018 16 hobr ho bro h 2 o k h o b r h o 2 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 17 hobr br bro hbr k h o b r b r 4 8 10 5 m 1 s 1 this study 18 obr ho bro oh k o b r h o 4 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 19 obr br bro br k o b r

particularly the concentration of bro reached 5 06 10 10 m when ignoring the reaction between efom and bro 3 4 4 formation of co3 co3 are reactive towards some ppcps in group ii with rate constants 107 m 1 s 1 including naproxen propranolol clenbuterol diclofenac trimethoprim salbutamol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole table 2 and figure s2 during the uv h2o2 process co3 was generated by the scavenging of ho by hco3 whose concentration was 1 84 10 12 m table 1 however in the uv chlorine process the concentration of co3 was much higher 1 51 10 9 m which was formed via the scavenging of ho cl and br by hco3 with k values of 106 108 m 1 s 1 national institute of standards and technology 2017 in summary efom was expected to reduce degradation kinetics of ppcps in uv chlorine and the uv h2o2 systems by scavenging radicals particularly for clo in uv chlorine and ho in uv h2o2 figure s12 the scavenging with ho and rcs by other wastewater matrix components such as br and hco3 in the uv h2o2 and uv chlorine processes formed secondary radicals such as rbs and co3 which can selectively react with several ppcps and compensate for the loss of ho and rcs the predicted k values of all ppcps in the uv h2o2 process fitted well with the experimental k values fig 7b in wastewater in uv chlorine the predicted k values of 17 ppcps were well fitted with the experimental k values with a 50 error such as nitroimidazoles venlafaxine ibuprofen caffeine carbamazepine gemfibrozil and trimethoprim however the contributions of rbs and co3 to ppcp degradation were not included in this model resulting to the underestimated predicted degradation of a few ppcps also the fitness of the ppcp degradation kinetics as a function of time by modelling and experiments figure s6 are consistent with the results shown in fig 7 for wastewater note that the reactive species from efom photochemistry such as ho and efom zhou et al 2017b was insignificant to the degradation of ppcps in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 processes as the ppcp degradation by uv alone in wastewater was suppressed compared with that in pure water figure s8 3 5 energy calculations the electrical energy per order ee o was applied to calculate the energy requirements of removing each ppcp by these two processes the ee o for a 90 ppcp transformation by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 varied in the ranges from 0 017 to 2 26 kw h m 3 and from 0 17 to 2 38 kw h m 3 respectively in simulated drinking water while the ee o varied in the ranges from 0 048 to 4 53 kw h m 3 and from 0 22 to 8 09 kw h m 3 respectively in wastewater fig 10 compared with the uv h2o2 process uv chlorine saved 3 5 93 5 and 19 1 98 1 of the ee o for the degradation of ppcps in drinking water and wastewater respectively generally the removal of the ppcps in group ii saved more ee o than that in group i during the uv chlorine process the ee o consists of the energy input of the uv ee ouv process and the cost of the oxidants ee ooxidant the ee ooxidant was the same for each ppcp at a specific oxidant dosage while the ee ouv was associated with the removal efficiency of each ppcp in aops in the uv h2o2 process the ee ouv dominated the ee o for all ppcp degradation 94 in both simulated drinking water and wastewater in the uv chlorine process the ee ouv dominated the ee o for the removal of most ppcps in group i 90 but not for that of some ppcps in group ii 10 6 64 7 in wastewater the ee ouv for the ppcp degradation driven by ho in group i in the uv chlorine process was lower than that in uv h2o2 due to less suppression of ho by water matrix during the uv chlorine process for the degradation of ppcps in group ii dominated by the rcs in uv chlorine the ee ouv for some ppcps such as naproxen propranolol clenbuterol ractopamine bisphenol a and sulfamethoxazole was even less than 0 1 kw h m 3 the energy consumption can be higher for the uv h2o2 process when considering the reagent cost for quenching residual h2o2 4 conclusions and engineering implications in pure water among the investigated 28 ppcps the uv h2o2 process was superior to the uv chlorine process for the removal of 12 ppcps primarily driven by ho at neutral ph values while the uv chlorine process was better for the other 16 ppcps primarily driven by the rcs the concentration of ho was lower in the uv chlorine process than in the uv h2o2 process but rcs such as cl and clo in uv chlorine contributed to the degradation of ppcps with electron donating functional groups clo was important to the degradation of ppcps possessing electron rich groups in the uv chlorine process the steady state concentration of clo was calculated to be 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of ho and the reactivities of clo with 16 ppcps were determined to be in the range of 106 109 m 1 s 1 the reactivity of clo ln k clo was linearly related to the hammett σσp constant for aromatic ppcps hocl ocl was a significant sink for ho in the uv chlorine process which was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than h2o2 in the uv h2o2 process at ph 7 hocl ocl and h2o significantly scavenged cl in uv chlorine thus the scavenging effects of ho and cl by hocl ocl and h2o outweighed those by water matrix components such as nom and alkalinity resulting in the less effect of water matrix on uv chlorine than uv h2o2 in real water in simulated drinking water and wastewater the abatement of all ppcps was more efficient by uv chlorine than that by uv h2o2 considering the degradation kinetics and ee o the efom bromide and bicarbonate affected ppcp degradation by uv chlorine the secondary radicals such as br br2 bro clbr and co3 and hobr were 2 orders of magnitude higher in the uv chlorine process than the uv h2o2 process in wastewater which contributed to the degradation of several ppcps the findings of this study provide a better understanding of ppcp degradation by the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 aops in drinking water and wastewater the uv chlorine process is a good alternative to the uv h2o2 process with a better efficiency for ppcp degradation in water and wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was financially supported by

19243,types and structures of phosphorus compounds influence the removal of phosphorus by coagulation until now the molecular level interaction between coagulants and phosphorus especially organophosphates and the relationship between removal efficiency and phosphorus structure have not been clear this work investigated the removal of phosphorus with different structures using conventional coagulants poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs and a novel covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc cbhyc removed more than 98 of phosphate and most of organophosphates had more stable performance than pacl and pfs and was less affected by ph initial phosphorus concentration and co occurring materials molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that cbhyc removed phosphorus mainly through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction furthermore this work established qsar quantitative structure activity relationship models for removal efficiency and organophosphate structure for the first time the model showed that atomic charges of phosphorus atoms qp and hydrogen atoms qh in the system and the energy gap δemo affected electronegativity and hydrophobicity thus influencing organophosphate removal efficiency the model had high fitting precision and good predictive ability and has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of optimizing processes and conditions for phosphorus removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus removal organophosphate coagulation molecular dynamics simulation qsar 1 introduction rapid economic and population growth is leading to an increase in phosphates and organophosphates in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater rott et al 2017 excess phosphorous discharged to a water system can cause a dangerous form of pollution known as eutrophication which threatens human health and ecological environment safety zhang et al 2009 chemical processes such as precipitation and adsorption are widely used for phosphorus removal because they are highly efficient and easy to operate liu et al 2012 the simple structure of phosphates i e containing only phosphorus and oxygen atoms nguyen et al 2016 allows them to also be easily removed from water by coagulants and adsorbents al harahsheh et al 2014 lin et al 2014 however organophosphates usually have a more complex structure because some oxygen atoms bound to phosphorus atoms are replaced by other organic atoms or groups delfino et al 2009 as a result many methods and technologies for phosphate removal are insufficient for organophosphate removal pang et al 2016 a recent study reports that a novel covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc with a unit structure consisting of positive aluminum iron silicon complex and quaternary ammonium groups with a hydrophobic long alkyl chain performs excellently for removing organic matters from water zhao et al 2016b cbhyc is predicted to have remarkable efficiencies in removing phosphates and organophosphates regardless of the coagulant i e conventional coagulants or the newly reported coagulant the coagulation process

aguayo villarreal et al 2014 jia et al 2015 xu et al 2013 and to confirm the toxicity of some organic phosphorus de and hermens 1991 ruark et al 2013 senior et al 2011 to date md has not been used to study processes and mechanisms between coagulants and phosphorus and the qsar model has not been used to evaluate the relationship between removal efficiencies and structure this paper demonstrates removal of phosphorous especially organophosphates by different coagulants and provides molecular level insights into the process and mechanism of the coagulation phosphate and seven organophosphates with different structures were used to study factors influencing phosphorus removal by cbhyc poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs md simulation was used to investigate mechanistic phosphorus removal and a qsar model was constructed with quantum chemical parameters obtained by density functional theory dft 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the new coagulant cbhyc and two conventional coagulants poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs were used we did not select cationic polyacrylamide because it had low efficiencies of phosphorus compound removal from 7 4 to 26 4 fig s1 cbhyc was modified according to the literature synthesis method briefly 1 0 m fecl3 solution and the si source trimethyl 3 triethoxysilyl propyl ammonium chloride were mixed in a 500 ml flask at the si fe molar ratio of 0 1 under rapid stirring the mixture was titrated by 2 5 m naoh to the target basicity oh fe molar ratio of 1 5 then deionized water

phosphorus compound in deionized water to an initial concentration of 5 mg p l or 0 2 mg p l and adding 1 mm nahco3 to reach an initial ph around 7 8 5 mg p l and 0 2 mg p l were selected based on the phosphorus concentrations in the influent and the secondary effluent of the municipal sewage plants de bashan et al 2004 kang et al 2003 li et al 2009 to study the effect of organics on phosphorus removal humic acid ha was added to some test solutions to reach a 5 mg l total organic carbon toc to study the effect of turbidity on phosphorus removal kaolinite was added to reach 5 ntu of turbidity all reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and employed directly without any further purification 2 2 coagulation experiments the coagulation experiments were performed in a programmable jar test apparatus with six paddles ta6 1 program controlled coagulation test agitator the coagulant doses were based on equal molar concentrations of aluminum or iron 1 10 4 to 2 10 3 m the test solution 800 ml was mixed with the coagulant rapidly stirred at 250 rpm for 1 5 min slowly stirred at 50 rpm for 15 min and settled for 30 min samples 5 ml were taken from 2 cm under the surface and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters before phosphorus measurement in the tests of evaluating the effect of coagulation ph adjustments to ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were made using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl all coagulation experiments were conducted in triplicate and the mean values were reported 2 3 analytical methods zeta potential was determined using a laser diffraction instrument zetasizer 2000 malvern u k coagulant size was characterized by a dynamic light scattering dls dls analyzer brookhaven instruments colloid titration was employed to characterize the charge density the hydrophobicity of coagulants was determined by measuring the octanol water partition coefficient detailed information was provided in supporting information si the total phosphorus concentration was measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 1800 based on ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry gb 11893 89 after settling the flocs were collected and dried for xps analysis using an imaging x ray photoelectron spectrometer axis ultra model from kratos analytical ltd to compensate the surface charge effects binding energies were calibrated with the c 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284 80 ev and the results were analyzed with casaxps software 2 4 md simulation an md simulation system was constructed with 16 cbhyc unit structures 5 ppoa molecules and 3000 water molecules the opls optimized potentials for liquid simulations force field was adopted for cbhyc and ppoa jorgensen et al 2017 and the spc simple point charge models water model was used to represent water molecules mark and nilsson 2001 the md simulations were carried out in the npt ensembles using dl poly 4 08 software smith and forester 1996 during the simulation temperature was maintained at 298 k and periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions after the equilibrium runs production runs of 1 ns were used the time step was 1 fs and the data collection frequency was 10 ps the output file also has the radial distribution function rdf alawneh and henderson 2008 and the atomic density distribution zden greathouse and cygan 2005 to infer the effect of the matter 2 5 qsar model gaussian 09 was used to calculate the quantum parameter and optimize the structure of organic compounds in this study at first organic compound structures were optimized by dft b3lyp 6 31g d p then most quantum

fukui indices f f and f 0 were obtained after calculation and analysis table s3 the removal efficiency re of different organophosphates fig 1 at cbhyc dose of 0 3 mm as fe was selected as the training set spss 17 0 software was used to build and evaluate models first a sequential approach of correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and multivariate linear regression mlr were applied to build the qsar model details in si dearden et al 2009 the resulting model needed to satisfy several criteria tropsha et al 2010 1 high squared correlation coefficient r 2 high adjusted multiple

validation r c v 2 to determine the expected error of future predictions a qsar model r c v 2 greater than 0 5 for internal validation confirms the robustness of the developed model for external

procedure the qsar predictive power was estimated by an external validation q e x t 2 table s4 papa et al 2005 q e x t 2 greater than 0 5 indicates a good prediction in addition the validation set was also recommended to meet golbraikh and tropsha s test table s5 golbraikh and tropsha 2002 huang et al 2012 tropsha et al 2010 in the final step the applicability domain ad of the model was characterized by the leverage approach using the williams plot i e standardized residuals versus leverage values h i definition is shown in si gramatica 2007 when the sets fall into this domain the predictions can be considered reliable 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal efficiency 3 1 1 effect of coagulant dose the coagulation experiments were carried out with 8 phosphorus compounds and three coagulants at ph 7 0 fig 1 phosphorus removal efficiency increased rapidly with the increase of coagulant dose and then leveled the three coagulants performed well in removing phosphate however they had different removal efficiency for the different organophosphates pacl and pfs removed over 98 of phosphate and atmp and 50 70 of p507 and ppoa but were ineffective in removing ppia and tpio pacl and pfs performance differed for pbtca and edtmpa where pacl removed more than 98 of those compounds and pfs removed only about 50 this difference may be related to the optimal ph for pacl and pfs coagulation cbhyc removed more than 98 of six phosphorus compounds orthophosphate atmp pbtca edtmpa p507 and ppo and removed ppia and tpio by 55 and 69 respectively the higher removal efficiency with cbhyc is likely because the inorganic components of the cbhyc silicon and iron were connected to the organic component quaternary ammonium groups with alkyl chains through covalent bonds which possesses higher positive charge density 0 75 meq mmol fe and larger particle size 867 nm as illustrated in fig s2 3 1 2 effect of ph a similar trend in removal efficiency with respect to ph was observed for 8 phosphorus compounds by three coagulants the results for atmp are shown in fig 2 and the other compounds are shown in si figs s3 s4 and s5 the system ph had a significant effect on the phosphorus removal by pacl and pfs pacl performed best at ph 7 0 followed by ph 9 0 and worst at ph 5 0 for pfs the removal efficiencies decreased as ph increased i e removal at ph 5 0 ph 7 0 ph 9 0 pacl and pfs have different the optimum ph for the phosphorus removal the reason may be that ph affects the distribution of the aluminum or iron species in pacl and pfs for phosphorus removal li et al 2012 residual phosphorus decreased first and increased with increasing pacl doses at ph 5 0 which was resulted from the restabilization of flocs carrying excessive positive charges as evidenced by zeta potential variations fig s6 for cbhyc there was little difference in phosphorus removal at different ph possibly because aluminum and silicon components in cbhyc were covalently bound with positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and thus were less affected by ph 3 1 3 effects of initial phosphorus concentration and co occurring substances fig 3 is representative of the eight phosphorus compounds and presents the removal efficiency of p507 by three coagulants under different initial phosphorus concentration and with without ha and turbidity pacl and pfs were significantly affected by the initial phosphorus concentration pacl removed 11 of p507 at low initial phosphorus concentration and 72 at high initial phosphorus concentration fig 3a for pfs removal was 18 and 54 for low and high initial concentrations respectively fig 3b the presence of ha and turbidity can increase the removal efficiency of p507 by pacl and pfs fig 3d e g and h the removal efficiencies using cbhyc at different initial phosphorus concentrations reached more than 98 fig 3c and the presence of ha and turbidity had little effect on the phosphorus removal efficiency fig 3f and i pacl and pfs remove phosphorus mainly through precipitation mechanism al harahsheh et al 2014 which is closely related with the concentration of phosphorus and coagulants ha and turbidity can adsorb phosphorus and increase the contaminant concentration in the system which can enhance the formation of precipitates and thus remove more phosphorus cbhyc has some organic groups and high molecular weight zhao et al 2016a 2016b which can increase the probability of collisions in the system and enhance the combination of cbhyc and phosphorus to form easily settling precipitates therefore phosphorus removal by cbhyc was less affected by initial phosphorus concentration organic matters and turbidity 3 2 phosphorus removal mechanism for all phosphorus compounds cbhyc performed better and the coagulation process was less affected by water quality because ppoa had oh and benzene ring groups the cbhyc ppoa system was chosen to explore the phosphorus removal mechanism wide scan xps spectrum fig 4 a and b showed that the pure cbhyc mainly had the peaks of c o and n the flocs of cbhyc with ppoa had two peaks for p2s and p2p in the high resolution p2p spectrum fig 4b only a distinct peak at 133 ev was observed which could be attributed to the surface adsorption of phosphorus hu et al 2010 zach maor et al 2011 the high resolution spectra of n1s core region from 394 to 408 ev showed a broad peak of n1s at 399 402 ev for cbhyc fig 4c and included one obvious peak at binding energy 401 8 ev which was attributed to quaternary ammonium n miralles cuevas et al 2016 for the ppoa containing flocs a new peak appeared near 399 2 ev which was assigned to neutral n atoms formed from the combination of positive n atoms with anion ions ppoa anions the ratio of neutral n to positively charged n was 0 34 fig 4d for other phosphorus compounds figs s7 and s8 the new n peaks appeared and had different n n ratios the n n ratio table 1 was positively correlated with phosphorus removal efficiency indicating that the electrostatic attraction between phosphorus and quaternary ammonium groups in cbhyc played an important role in phosphorus removal the coagulation of ppoa by cbhyc was simulated by md the initial state of the cbhyc ppoa system showed that the ppoa molecules were randomly distributed around cbhyc fig 5 a as the simulation continued the ppoa molecules tended to move closer to the cbhyc most four ppoa molecules were close to the hydrophilic end with positive charges of cbhyc and only 1 ppoa molecule was close to the hydrophobic alkyl chain of cbhyc fig 5b the density distribution showed peaks of oxygen atoms and carbon atoms of ppoa appeared on the two sides hydrophilic and hydrophobic of cbhyc fig 5c and d a strong peak of radial distribution function rdf appeared 3 9 å fig s9 which indicated that there was a strong interaction between the o atoms in ppoa and the n atoms in cbhyc these results demonstrated that during the interaction of ppoa and cbhyc there was electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged oxygen atoms in ppoa and the hydrophilic structures in cbhyc si fe complex and the quaternary ammonium groups there was also hydrophobic interaction between the benzene ring in ppoa and the long alkyl chain in cbhyc the distribution of ppoa molecules shows that the electrostatic attraction was the dominant action mechanism 3 3 qsar model the qsar model was developed with re removal efficiency and the computational quantum descriptors table 2 the correlation analysis tested the correlation between the descriptors n 20 and re values table s6 highly correlated descriptors were selected with r 0 5 as the boundary n 14 further pca analysis xiao et al 2015 reduced the dimensionality and identified the most important variables i e q p δe mo and q h fig s10 a qsar model was obtained using mlr analysis with the descriptors selected in the pca process the obtained qsar model was 1 r e 2 637 q p 1 443 δ e m o 0 874 q

variables bring about significant difference further the high f value indicates that the equation did an excellent job of predicting the re the value of the root mean squared error rmse was only 0 039 implying that model had advantages in predicting re the statistical criteria including r 2 f sig and rmse were met in the equation indicating a good model was obtained the derived model contains three variables q p δe mo and q h q p which is the positive charge on phosphorus atom was positively correlated with re because the molecule was electroneutral more positive charge on phosphorus atom led to more negative charge on the oxygen atom that was directly linked to the phosphorus atom the electrostatic force between the negative oxygen atom and positive components quaternary ammonium and hydrolyzed iron species of cbhyc led to more organophosphates adsorption the molecular orbital descriptor δe mo energy gap is an important stability index and is reported to influence many reactions to a great extent karelson et al 1996 a decrease of the energy gap δe mo usually leads to easier polarization of the molecule pearson 1989 which reduces the hydrophobicity of the molecules karelson et al 1996 in other words an increase inδe mo increases the hydrophobicity of organophosphates enhancing the hydrophobic adsorption between organophosphates and cbhyc and thus increases the removal efficiency of organophosphates the third variable of the model q h which is the positive charge on a hydrogen atom was negatively correlated with re atomic charges were used to describe the molecular polarity karelson et al 1996 the increase of q h decreased the polarity of functional group e g oh which created the difficulty of h dissociation the organophosphates lacked negatively charged atoms to be attracted by the positively charged components of cbhyc which reduced the organophosphate removal efficiency we measured the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction directly to validate the qsar model by investigating zeta potentials of flocs at different cbhyc doses we found that as zeta potentials changed from negative to positive the concentrations of residual phosphorus decreased and reached the lowest at zeta potentials around zero which validated the qsar model from the perspective of the electrostatic attraction mechanism fig s11 we measured the octanol water partition coefficient kow expressed as logkow of coagulants and the results showed that cbhyc had the highest logkow 4 42 fig s12 suggesting cbhyc was more hydrophobic than pacl and pfs cbhyc had higher organphosphate removal efficiency than pacl and pfs at the same positive charge doses fig s13 suggesting more organphosphates were removed through the hydrophobic interaction between cbhyc and organphosphates which validated the qsar model from the perspective of the hydrophobic interaction mechanism the derived model was further evaluated by internal validation and external validation the internal validation was performed within the training data set n 7 and the r 2 cv was 0 983 indicating good reliability the external validation was performed within the validation data set n 3 which contained three organophosphates not used in the model building process 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 2 hydroxyphosphonocarboxylic acid hpaa and diphenylphosphine oxide dpio table s1 the value of q e x t 2 was 0 971 and the model was satisfied with golbraikh and tropsha s test table s5 which indicating the model had good predictive capability experimental removal efficiency versus predicted removal efficiency is shown in fig 6 the point was close to the y x line indicating the prediction was accurate the williams plot was used to visualize the applicability domain fig 7 all the training sets and validation sets fell into the domain indicating that the training set was representative the model predictions were considered reliable and the model was generalizable the qsar model constructed in this project has high fitting precision and good predictive ability the phosphorus removal efficiency by cbhyc can be described and predicted well using three parameters sorted by correlation q p δe mo and q h increasing q p increasing δe mo and decreasing q h can improve phosphorus removal by cbhyc because of the increase of the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of phosphorus compounds 4 conclusion this study investigated removal of various phosphorus compounds by coagulation and explored the removal mechanism using md simulation and qsar model for the first time we found the new coagulant cbhyc performed excellently and was less influenced by ph turbidity initial concentration and co occurring materials cbhyc removed phosphorus compounds mainly through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction a qsar model was constructed with three variables the phosphorus atomic charge q p energy gap δe mo and the hydrogen atomic charge q h that accurately described and predicted phosphorus removal by cbhyc this study not only provided a new coagulant and approach for phosphorus removal but also clarified the phosphorus removal by coagulation

19243,types and structures of phosphorus compounds influence the removal of phosphorus by coagulation until now the molecular level interaction between coagulants and phosphorus especially organophosphates and the relationship between removal efficiency and phosphorus structure have not been clear this work investigated the removal of phosphorus with different structures using conventional coagulants poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs and a novel covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc cbhyc removed more than 98 of phosphate and most of organophosphates had more stable performance than pacl and pfs and was less affected by ph initial phosphorus concentration and co occurring materials molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that cbhyc removed phosphorus mainly through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction furthermore this work established qsar quantitative structure activity relationship models for removal efficiency and organophosphate structure for the first time the model showed that atomic charges of phosphorus atoms qp and hydrogen atoms qh in the system and the energy gap δemo affected electronegativity and hydrophobicity thus influencing organophosphate removal efficiency the model had high fitting precision and good predictive ability and has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of optimizing processes and conditions for phosphorus removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus removal organophosphate coagulation molecular dynamics simulation qsar 1 introduction rapid economic and population growth is leading to an increase in phosphates and organophosphates in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater rott et al 2017 excess phosphorous discharged to a water system can cause a dangerous form of pollution known as eutrophication which threatens human health and ecological environment safety zhang et al 2009 chemical processes such as precipitation and adsorption are widely used for phosphorus removal because they are highly efficient and easy to operate liu et al 2012 the simple structure of phosphates i e containing only phosphorus and oxygen atoms nguyen et al 2016 allows them to also be easily removed from water by coagulants and adsorbents al harahsheh et al 2014 lin et al 2014 however organophosphates usually have a more complex structure because some oxygen atoms bound to phosphorus atoms are replaced by other organic atoms or groups delfino et al 2009 as a result many methods and technologies for phosphate removal are insufficient for organophosphate removal pang et al 2016 a recent study reports that a novel covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc with a unit structure consisting of positive aluminum iron silicon complex and quaternary ammonium groups with a hydrophobic long alkyl chain performs excellently for removing organic matters from water zhao et al 2016b cbhyc is predicted to have remarkable efficiencies in removing phosphates and organophosphates regardless of the coagulant i e conventional coagulants or the newly reported coagulant the coagulation process and the molecular level mechanisms for removing organophosphates with various types and complex structures are less studied molecular dynamics md simulation can be used to study removal mechanisms md is an effective tool to understand diffusion adsorption oxidation and coagulation bhattacharya et al 2017 liang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 an advantage of md is that it can probe the

study processes and mechanisms between coagulants and phosphorus and the qsar model has not been used to evaluate the relationship between removal efficiencies and structure this paper demonstrates removal of phosphorous especially organophosphates by different coagulants and provides molecular level insights into the process and mechanism of the coagulation phosphate and seven organophosphates with different structures were used to study factors influencing phosphorus removal by cbhyc poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs md simulation was used to investigate mechanistic phosphorus removal and a qsar model was constructed with quantum chemical parameters obtained by density functional theory dft 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the new coagulant cbhyc and two conventional coagulants poly aluminum chloride pacl and polymerized ferric sulfate pfs were used we did not select cationic polyacrylamide because it had low efficiencies of phosphorus compound removal from 7 4 to 26 4 fig s1 cbhyc was modified according to the literature synthesis method briefly 1 0 m fecl3 solution and the si source trimethyl 3 triethoxysilyl propyl ammonium chloride were mixed in a 500 ml flask at the si fe molar ratio of 0 1 under rapid stirring the mixture was titrated by 2 5 m naoh to the target basicity oh fe molar ratio of 1 5 then deionized water was added to make the total iron concentration 0 2 m cbhyc was obtained after aging for 24 h conventional coagulants pfs 18 5 wt as fe and pacl 29 0 wt as al2o3 were purchased from shanghai mclean

phosphorus compound in deionized water to an initial concentration of 5 mg p l or 0 2 mg p l and adding 1 mm nahco3 to reach an initial ph around 7 8 5 mg p l and 0 2 mg p l were selected based on the phosphorus concentrations in the influent and the secondary effluent of the municipal sewage plants de bashan et al 2004 kang et al 2003 li et al 2009 to study the effect of organics on phosphorus removal humic acid ha was added to some test solutions to reach a 5 mg l total organic carbon toc to study the effect of turbidity on phosphorus removal kaolinite was added to reach 5 ntu of turbidity all reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and employed directly without any further purification 2 2 coagulation experiments the coagulation experiments were performed in a programmable jar test apparatus with six paddles ta6 1 program controlled coagulation test agitator the coagulant doses were based on equal molar concentrations of aluminum or iron 1 10 4 to 2 10 3 m the test solution 800 ml was mixed with the coagulant rapidly stirred at 250 rpm for 1 5 min slowly stirred at 50 rpm for 15 min and settled for 30 min samples 5 ml were taken from 2 cm under the surface and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters before phosphorus measurement in the tests of evaluating the effect of coagulation ph adjustments to ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were made using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl all coagulation experiments were conducted in triplicate and the mean values were reported 2 3 analytical methods zeta potential was determined using a laser diffraction instrument zetasizer 2000 malvern u k coagulant size was characterized by a dynamic light scattering dls dls analyzer brookhaven instruments colloid titration was employed to characterize the charge density the hydrophobicity of coagulants was determined by measuring the octanol water partition coefficient detailed information was provided in supporting information si the total phosphorus concentration was measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 1800 based on ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry gb 11893 89 after settling the flocs were collected and dried for xps analysis using an imaging x ray photoelectron spectrometer axis ultra model from kratos analytical ltd to compensate the surface charge effects binding energies were calibrated with the c 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284 80 ev and the results were analyzed with casaxps software 2 4 md simulation an md simulation system was constructed with 16 cbhyc unit structures 5 ppoa molecules and 3000 water molecules the opls optimized potentials for liquid simulations force field was adopted for cbhyc and ppoa jorgensen et al 2017 and the spc simple point charge models water model was used to represent water molecules mark and nilsson 2001 the md simulations were carried out in the npt ensembles using dl poly 4 08 software smith and forester 1996 during the simulation temperature was maintained at 298 k and periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions after the equilibrium runs production runs of 1 ns were used the time step was 1 fs and the data collection frequency was 10 ps the output file also has the radial distribution function rdf alawneh and henderson 2008 and the atomic density distribution zden greathouse and cygan 2005 to infer the effect of the matter 2 5 qsar model gaussian 09 was used to calculate the quantum parameter and optimize the structure of organic compounds in this study at first organic compound structures were optimized by dft b3lyp 6 31g d p then most quantum parameters were obtained from the output files directly including q p the atomic charge of phosphorus atoms δe mo energy gap q h the hydrogen atomic charge and others shown in table s2 su et al 2016 fukui indices f f and f 0 were obtained after calculation and analysis table s3 the removal efficiency re of different organophosphates fig 1 at cbhyc dose of 0 3 mm as fe was selected as the training set spss 17 0 software was used to build and evaluate models first a sequential approach of correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and multivariate linear regression mlr were applied to build the qsar model details in si dearden et al 2009 the resulting model needed to satisfy several criteria tropsha et al 2010 1 high squared correlation coefficient r 2 high adjusted multiple correlation coefficient r a d j 2 and low root mean square error value rmse 2 significance level sig less than 0 05 3 f statistic f greater than 15 internal validation selected leave one out cross validation r c v 2 to determine the expected error of future predictions a qsar model r c v 2 greater than 0 5 for internal validation confirms the robustness of the developed model for external validation the removal efficiencies of three other organophosphates under the same condition was a validation set table s1 the compounds in the validation set were not involved in the training procedure the qsar predictive power was estimated by an external validation q e x t 2 table s4 papa et al 2005 q e x t 2 greater than 0 5 indicates a good prediction in addition the validation set was also recommended to meet golbraikh and tropsha s test table s5 golbraikh and tropsha 2002 huang et al 2012 tropsha et al 2010 in the final step the applicability domain ad of the model was characterized by the leverage approach using the williams plot i e standardized residuals versus leverage values h i definition is shown in si gramatica 2007 when the sets fall into this domain the predictions can be considered reliable 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus removal efficiency 3 1 1 effect of coagulant dose the coagulation experiments were carried out with 8 phosphorus compounds and three coagulants at ph 7 0 fig 1 phosphorus removal efficiency increased rapidly with the increase of coagulant dose and then leveled the three coagulants performed well in removing phosphate however they had different removal efficiency for the different organophosphates pacl and pfs removed over 98 of phosphate and atmp and 50 70 of p507 and ppoa but were ineffective in removing ppia and tpio pacl and pfs performance differed for pbtca and edtmpa where pacl removed more than 98 of those compounds and pfs removed only about 50 this difference may be related to the optimal ph for pacl and pfs coagulation cbhyc removed more than 98 of six phosphorus compounds orthophosphate atmp pbtca edtmpa p507 and ppo and removed ppia and tpio by 55 and 69 respectively the higher removal efficiency with cbhyc is likely because the inorganic components of the cbhyc silicon and iron were connected to the organic component quaternary ammonium groups with alkyl chains through covalent bonds which possesses higher positive charge density 0 75 meq mmol fe and larger particle size 867 nm as illustrated in fig s2 3 1 2 effect of ph a similar trend in removal efficiency with respect to ph was observed for 8 phosphorus compounds by three coagulants the results for atmp are shown in fig 2 and the other compounds are shown in si figs s3 s4 and s5 the system ph had a significant effect on the phosphorus removal by pacl and pfs pacl performed best at ph 7 0 followed by ph 9 0 and worst at ph 5 0 for pfs the removal efficiencies decreased as ph increased i e removal at ph 5 0 ph 7 0 ph 9 0 pacl and pfs have different the optimum ph for the phosphorus removal the reason may be that ph affects the distribution of the aluminum or iron species in pacl and pfs for phosphorus removal li et al 2012 residual phosphorus decreased first and increased with increasing pacl doses at ph 5 0 which was resulted from the restabilization of flocs carrying excessive positive charges as evidenced by zeta potential variations fig s6 for cbhyc there was little difference in phosphorus removal at different ph possibly because aluminum and silicon components in cbhyc were covalently bound with positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and thus were less affected by ph 3 1 3 effects of initial phosphorus concentration and co occurring substances fig 3 is representative of the eight phosphorus compounds and presents the removal efficiency of p507 by three coagulants under different initial phosphorus concentration and with without ha and turbidity pacl and pfs were significantly affected by the initial phosphorus concentration pacl removed 11 of p507 at low initial phosphorus concentration and 72 at high initial phosphorus concentration fig 3a for pfs removal was 18 and 54 for low and high initial concentrations respectively fig 3b the presence of ha and turbidity can increase the removal efficiency of p507 by pacl and pfs fig 3d e g and h the removal efficiencies using cbhyc at different initial phosphorus concentrations reached more than 98 fig 3c and the presence of ha and turbidity had little effect on the phosphorus removal efficiency fig 3f and i pacl and pfs remove phosphorus mainly through precipitation mechanism al harahsheh et al 2014 which is closely related with the concentration of phosphorus and coagulants ha and turbidity can adsorb phosphorus and increase the contaminant concentration in the system which can enhance the formation of precipitates and thus remove more phosphorus cbhyc has some organic groups and high molecular weight zhao et al 2016a 2016b which can increase the probability of collisions in the system and enhance the combination of cbhyc and phosphorus to form easily settling precipitates therefore phosphorus removal by cbhyc was less affected by initial phosphorus concentration organic matters and turbidity 3 2 phosphorus removal mechanism for all phosphorus compounds cbhyc performed better and the coagulation process was less affected by water quality because ppoa had oh and benzene ring groups the cbhyc ppoa system was chosen to explore the phosphorus removal mechanism wide scan xps spectrum fig 4 a and b showed that the pure cbhyc mainly had the peaks of c o and n the flocs of cbhyc with ppoa had two peaks for p2s and p2p in the high resolution p2p spectrum fig 4b only a distinct peak at 133 ev was observed which could be attributed to the surface adsorption of phosphorus hu et al 2010 zach maor et al 2011 the high resolution spectra of n1s core region from 394 to 408 ev showed a broad peak of n1s at 399 402 ev for cbhyc fig 4c and included one obvious peak at binding energy 401 8 ev which was attributed to quaternary ammonium n miralles cuevas et al 2016 for the ppoa containing flocs a new peak appeared near 399 2 ev which was assigned to neutral n atoms formed from the combination of positive n atoms with anion ions ppoa anions the ratio of neutral n to positively charged n was 0 34 fig 4d for other phosphorus compounds figs s7 and s8 the new n peaks appeared and had different n n ratios the n n ratio table 1 was positively correlated with phosphorus removal efficiency indicating that the electrostatic attraction between phosphorus and quaternary ammonium groups in cbhyc played an important role in phosphorus removal the coagulation of ppoa by cbhyc was simulated by md the initial state of the cbhyc ppoa system showed that the ppoa molecules were randomly distributed around cbhyc fig 5 a as the simulation continued the ppoa molecules tended to move closer to the cbhyc most four ppoa molecules were close to the hydrophilic end with positive charges of cbhyc and only 1 ppoa molecule was close to the hydrophobic alkyl chain of cbhyc fig 5b the density distribution showed peaks of oxygen atoms and carbon atoms of ppoa appeared on the two sides hydrophilic and hydrophobic of cbhyc fig 5c and d a strong peak of radial distribution function rdf appeared 3 9 å fig s9 which indicated that there was a strong interaction between the o atoms in ppoa and the n atoms in cbhyc these results demonstrated that during the interaction of ppoa and cbhyc there was electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged oxygen atoms in ppoa and the hydrophilic structures in cbhyc si fe complex and the quaternary ammonium groups there was also hydrophobic interaction between the benzene ring in ppoa and the long alkyl chain in cbhyc the distribution of ppoa molecules shows that the electrostatic attraction was the dominant action mechanism 3 3 qsar model the qsar model was developed with re removal efficiency and the computational quantum descriptors table 2 the correlation analysis tested the correlation between the descriptors n 20 and re values table s6 highly correlated descriptors were selected with r 0 5 as the boundary n 14 further pca analysis xiao et al 2015 reduced the dimensionality and identified the most important variables i e q p δe mo and q h fig s10 a qsar model was obtained using mlr analysis with the descriptors selected in the pca process the obtained qsar model was 1 r e 2 637 q p 1 443 δ e m o 0 874 q h 2 133 r 2 0 983 r a d j 2 0 966 f 59 327 s i g 0 004 rmse 0 039 r c v 2 0 983 q e x t 2 0 971 k 1 05 k 0 95 r 0 2 0 934 r 0 2 0 990 the value of sig was 0 004 smaller than 0 05 indicating the variables bring about significant difference further the high f value indicates that the equation did an excellent job of predicting the re the value of the root mean squared error rmse was only 0 039 implying that model had advantages in predicting re the statistical criteria including r 2 f sig and rmse were met in the equation indicating a good model was obtained the derived model contains three variables q p δe mo and q h q p which is the positive charge on phosphorus atom was positively correlated with re because the molecule was electroneutral more positive charge on phosphorus atom led to more negative charge on the oxygen atom that was directly linked to the phosphorus atom the electrostatic force between the negative oxygen atom and positive components quaternary ammonium and hydrolyzed iron species of cbhyc led to more organophosphates adsorption the molecular orbital descriptor δe mo energy gap is an important stability index and is reported to influence many reactions to a great extent karelson et al 1996 a decrease of the energy gap δe mo usually leads to easier polarization of the molecule pearson 1989 which reduces the hydrophobicity of the molecules karelson et al 1996 in other words an increase inδe mo increases the hydrophobicity of organophosphates enhancing the hydrophobic adsorption between organophosphates and cbhyc and thus increases the removal efficiency of organophosphates the third variable of the model q h which is the positive charge on a hydrogen atom was negatively correlated with re atomic charges were used to describe the molecular polarity karelson et al 1996 the increase of q h decreased the polarity of functional group e g oh which created the difficulty of h dissociation the organophosphates lacked negatively charged atoms to be attracted by the positively charged components of cbhyc which reduced the organophosphate removal efficiency we measured the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction directly to validate the qsar model by investigating zeta potentials of flocs at different cbhyc doses we found that as zeta potentials changed from negative to positive the concentrations of residual phosphorus decreased and reached the lowest at zeta potentials around zero which validated the qsar model from the perspective of the electrostatic attraction mechanism fig s11 we measured the octanol water partition coefficient kow expressed as logkow of coagulants and the results showed that cbhyc had the highest logkow 4 42 fig s12 suggesting cbhyc was more hydrophobic than pacl and pfs cbhyc had higher organphosphate removal efficiency than pacl and pfs at the same positive charge doses fig s13 suggesting more organphosphates were removed through the hydrophobic interaction between cbhyc and organphosphates which validated the qsar model from the perspective of the hydrophobic interaction mechanism the derived model was further evaluated by internal validation and external validation the internal validation was performed within the training data set n 7 and the r 2 cv was 0 983 indicating good reliability the external validation was performed within the validation data set n 3 which contained three organophosphates not used in the model building process 1 hydroxyethylidene 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 2 hydroxyphosphonocarboxylic acid hpaa and diphenylphosphine oxide dpio table s1 the value of q e x t 2 was 0 971 and the model was satisfied with golbraikh and tropsha s test table s5 which indicating the model had good predictive capability experimental removal efficiency versus predicted removal efficiency is shown in fig 6 the point was close to the y x line indicating the prediction was accurate the williams plot was used to visualize the applicability domain fig 7 all the training sets and validation sets fell into the domain indicating that the training set was representative the model predictions were considered reliable and the model was generalizable the qsar model constructed in this project has high fitting precision and good predictive ability the phosphorus removal efficiency by cbhyc can be described and predicted well using three parameters sorted by correlation q p δe mo and q h increasing q p increasing δe mo and decreasing q h can improve phosphorus removal by cbhyc because of the increase of the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of phosphorus compounds 4 conclusion this study investigated removal of various phosphorus compounds by coagulation and explored the removal mechanism using md simulation and qsar model for the first

19244,oxcarbazepine oxc is ubiquitous in the aqueous environment and due to its ecotoxicological effects and potential risks to human an effective way to eliminate oxc from aqueous environment has aroused public concerns in recent years radical based reactions have been shown to be an efficient way for oxc destruction but the reactions of oxc with reactive oxygen species ros and carbonate radical co3 are still unclear in this study we focused the degradation of oxc and ros co3 generation mechanism and their roles in oxc degradation via uv and uv h2o2 the triplet state of oxcarbazepine 3oxc was found to play an important role in oxc degradation via uv and hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 were found to be the dominant ros in oxc degradation superoxide radical o2 did not react with oxc directly but it may react with intermediate byproducts generation of co3 played a positive role on oxc degradation for both uv and uv h2o2 in addition to oh 3oxc also contribute to co3 production the second order rate constants of oxc with oh and co3 were 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively potential oxc degradation mechanisms by oh were proposed and included hydroxylation α ketol rearrangement and benzylic acid rearrangement compared with non selective oh the reactions involving co3 are mainly electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction and the acute toxicity of oxc was lower after uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 treatments which was confirmed by luminescent bacterial assay vibrio fischeri bacterium graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxcarbazepine carbonate radical reactive oxygen species toxicity ultraviolet light hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction oxcarbazepine oxc the keto analogue of carbamazepine cbz is an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical that is widely used in the treatment of epileptic patients brezina et al 2017 as a result oxc and its metabolites are released into aquatic environments through wastewater treatment plants kaiser et al 2014 leclercq et al reported the occurrence of oxc in sewage treatment plant and its concentration was ranged from 85 to 476 ng l in influent and from 51 to 255 ng l in effluent leclercq et al 2009 oxc has relatively stable chemical structure and it cannot be effectively degraded using conventional waste water treatment processes i e biological and chlorination processes bahlmann et al 2014 kaiser et al 2014 moreover oxc transformation products tps are relatively persistent in water distribution system which illustrates that longer contact with secondary disinfectants do not play a significant role in further removing or lowering the concentrations of these refractory compounds bu et al 2016 li et al 2011 therefore an effective advanced treatment processes are required to eliminate oxc from waster water advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive and promising technologies to destroy organic pollutants hydroxyl radical oh based aops such as uv h2o2 are among the most frequently employed to degrade recalcitrant organic contaminants and have been successfully applied to remove pharmaceuticals in various conditions baeza and knappe 2011 keen and linden 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 yao et al 2013 reports have shown that many pharmaceuticals react rapidly with oh k 108 1010 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2016 however the reactivity of pharmaceuticals to other species is still limited such as reactive oxygen species ros and carbonate radical co3 that are produced in aops ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 can effectively oxidize a variety of electron rich pharmaceuticals insecticides and flame retardants han et al 2008 hirahara et al 2003 kim et al 2012 compared to non selective oh the rate of reaction of 1o2 and o2 are less affected by other components in the natural waters rosadolausell et al 2013 therefore the role of ros in destroying organic contaminants especially those with electron rich moieties such as oxc are important in addition co3 is attracting increasing attention because it is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment dell arciprete et al 2012 mazellier 2002 normally co3 production pathways including reaction of carbonate species hco3 co3 2 with oh excited state aromatic ketones and photolysis of the cobalt iii tetraaminocarbonate ion canonica et al 2005 cope et al 1973 mazellier et al 2007 co3 e co3 co3 2 1 63 v at ph 8 4 is a one electron oxidant and can degrade organic compounds and it has second order rate constants ranging between 102 and 109 m 1 s 1 zuo et al 1999 previous work on the uv h2o2 process has shown that the concentration of co3 is much higher than oh four orders of magnitude greater than oh when carbonate species are present zhang et al 2015 in surface waters the steady state concentration of co3 has been reported to be two orders of magnitude higher than oh in the presence of sunlight lai et al 2017 reactivity of co3 toward pharmaceuticals has been investigated but its still in early stage and limited information has been reported liu et al 2015 wols et al 2015 in addition the mechanism of ros formation and its degradation pathway with oxc are not fully understood therefore it is necessary to have overall understanding on the degradation reaction of oxc that include the role of ros and co3 accordingly we investigated the role the effect of ros and carbonate species on oxc degradation by uv and uv h2o2 namely these aspects have been examined 1 determine the formation mechanism of ros co3 and their role in the degradation of oxc 2 investigate kinetics and probable transformation pathways of oxc by oh and co3 based on the identified reaction byproducts and 3 evaluate toxic effects of the parent

in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 elucidation of reactive oxygen species in uv and uv h2o2 processes oxc is degraded by direct uv photolysis in ultrapure water uw however the addition of h2o2 significantly enhances the degradation of oxc under uv irradiation fig 1 to explore the role of ros in oxc degradation scavenger experiments were employed as depicted in fig 1 a an evident inhibition of oxc degradation was observed by adding tertiary butanol tba 10 mm which indicates that oh is present during oxc degradation 1o2 an excited state of molecular oxygen is readily quenched by nan3 with a rate constant of 2 109 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2008 after nan3 0 5 mm was added to the solution the degradation of oxc was significantly inhibited over 90 of dissolved oxygen in aqueous can be removed with a steady purge with n2 gas butler et al 1994 the rate of photolytic degradation of oxc was suppressed by purging with n2 in uv photolysis in order to further confirm the role of ros in the degradation of oxc other chemical scavengers were used in further investigation to confirm that the o2 was involved in uv photolysis superoxide dismutase sod which can convert o2 to h2o2 was added to the solution as shown in fig s2 the k obs of oxc increased when sod is added and this occurred for two reasons firstly more oh was produced by uv h2o2 because more h2o2 was present secondly the oxcarbazepine n radical cation reacts with o2 to regenerate oxc and produce molecular oxygen scheme 2 wuttig et al 2013 by adding sod this regeneration reaction would be inhibited both of these effects contributed to the 2 fold increase in the decay rate of oxc when sod was added however the degradation of oxc was suppressed when tba and sod were added and this is due to quenching of oh by tba as illustrated in fig s3 ffa etoh and tmp were used as chemical scavengers to determine the formation of 1o2 oh and triplet state 3oxc during uv photolysis li et al 2017 yang et al 2016 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 etoh was selected to quench the reaction between ffa and oh to determine the role of 1o2 in oxc destruction tmp eliminates triplet state species and was used identify the formation of 3oxc for 1o2 generation we proposed that oxc was first excited to singlet states 1oxc under uv irradiation and then the excited triplet 3oxc state was formed by the inter system relaxation process following this 3oxc reacts with dissolved oxygen to yield the generation of 1o2 and oh this hypothesis was verified by 3oxc quenching study using tmp with ffa scavengers the degradation of ffa was significantly suppressed in the presence of tmp and etoh fig s3 and this indicates that 3oxc was formed and was responsible for 1o2 formation in the uv system according to these results we concluded that during photolysis of oxc direct photolysis and ros were produced via three pathways noted as path 1 path 2 and path 3 that proposed in scheme 1 chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 3 2 effect of ph on uv and uv h2o2 photolysis as shown in fig 2 the k obs increased significantly from 0 0157 min 1 to 0 347 min 1 with increasing ph from 5 0 to 10 0 via uv which was probably related to an increase in the molar absorption coefficient εoxc bolton and stefan 2002 the uv absorption as represented by εoxc fig s5 a e at different ph values are presented in table s1 the increasing εoxc with the increasing ph from 5 0 to 10 0 was resulted in the increasing photolysis of oxc other than εoxc quantum yield of oxc φoxc is also another key factor that responsible for the degradation of oxc under different ph conditions by uv photolysis table s1 in summary it is more conducive to conduct oxc degradation under alkaline conditions as ph varied from 3 0 to 7 0 no significant difference of k obs for reaction was observed but the sharp increase of k obs was observed when ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 in the uv h2o2 fig 2 the main reasons for the differences in k obs observed at alkaline conditions are as follows at higher ph values especially when ph 10 5 the hydroperoxide anion ho2 becomes the dominant form of h2o2 it has a higher molar absorption coefficient 256 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm than h2o2 18 6 m 1 cm 1 baxendale and wilson 1957 khan et al 2014 in addition the higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield of oxc at alkaline ph 7 10 conditions table s1 favor greater degradation of oxc however oh can be largely eliminated when ph reaches above 10 which due to the existence of the reaction between oh and ho with the rate constant of k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2015 as a consequence of the dynamics of the production yield and scavenging effect of hydroxyl radicals and the increase of photolysis the degradation of oxc was found to higher at alkaline conditions fig 2 3 3 effect of bicarbonate the degradation rate of oxc increases for uv and uv h2o2 with increasing hco3 concentration fig 3 however many studies have reported that co3 2 hco3 have an inhibitory effect on the degradation of organic compounds due to their quenching property for oh grebel et al 2010 he et al 2012 pelaez et al 2011 shah et al 2013 in uv photolysis the enhanced oxc degradation was due to the following reasons details mentioned in scheme 1 first the excited triplet state 3oxc reacts with hco3 one electron reduction of 3oxc is transferred from dissolved hco3 and this generates of co3 this reaction pathway is favorable at high hco3 concentrations breton et al 2005 in addition the generated ros also contributes to the production of co3 in uv process to confirm the role of co3 on oxc degradation in the uv and uv h2o2 isopropanol ipa and tba k oh ipa 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 were added to the reactor solution buxton et al 1988 for the uv hco3 process the degradation rate of oxc was suppressed with the addition of tba ipa fig 4 a this is due to co3 was involved in the reaction scheme 1 in uv h2o2 the presence of hco3 can alter the degradation mechanism of oxc because of the production of co3 as shown in fig 4 b although the rate constants of tba and ipa toward oh are similar we found that ipa inhibited the degradation of oxc to a greater extent than tba this is due to the reaction of ipa with co3 has a much higher rate constant than the reaction of tba with co3 kco3 ipa 4 0 104 m 1 s 1 kco3 tba 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 chen et al 1973 this result suggests that co3 participates in the degradation of oxc on the other hand the degradation of oxc cannot be completely inhibited even when excess tba ipa was used table s2 the probable reasons of this result are that oxc was degraded by uv and co3 was formed in the reaction between hco3 and 3oxc fig 4 a another possible reason for this result is that hco3 is an important scavenger of o2 that can generate co3 burns et al 2012 due to the higher reactivity of co3 huie et al 1991 relative to o2 and 1o2 the conversion of o2 to more selective co3 can also enhance oxc degradation dell arciprete et al 2012 the second order rate constants of oxc with oh and co3 were determined text s3 to be 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively although the rate constants with co3 was lower than oh the high selectivity of co3 makes it less susceptible to scavenging effects by the solution matrix and would markedly lead to the degradation of oxc zhang et al 2015 this could be seen from the kinetic modeling that the values of co3 ss were 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh ss under different hco3 concentrations table s2 3 4 degradation of oxc in natural water matrices the degradation of oxc via uv and uv h2o2 in different natural water matrices in table s3 were also investigated fig 5 for uv photolysis there is a slight increase in k obs in natural water samples as compared to uw according to the ph of the water samples table s3 hco3 was the main form of alkalinity and according to the result from fig 3 higher concentration of hco3 have positive effect on oxc degradation generally nom exhibits two opposite effects 1 a promoting effect caused by ros generation 2 an inhibiting effect caused by its light absorption and radical scavenging effects no effect on the degradation of oxc via uv in the presence of different concentrations of humic acid was observed fig s9 suggesting that contributions from effect 1 and effect 2 maybe equal taking the above factors into consideration the degradation of oxc was slightly promoted by uv in the natural water the suva254nm is typically used to determine the organic carbon and aromatic character of water he et al 2014 kull et al 2006 generally the higher suva254nm value can result in the less effective on the treatment process of target contaminant degradation as shown in table s3 sw1 has the largest suva254nm value while smallest suva254nm value was observed in gw but degradation rate of oxc is almost the same to a large extent this difference could mainly due to the variation of alkalinity in different water samples liu et al 2016 hco3 could enhance the degradation of oxc in uw via uv h2o2 due to the production of co3 compared to hco3 nom competes with oxc for the uv photons and it also has large quenching rate for oh k 2 5 104 mgc l 1 s 1 in uv h2o2 paul westerhoff et al 2007 under such conditions the nom is the major scavenger of oh fig s9 which explains the smaller k obs was observed for oxc removal in all natural water samples tw gw sw1 and sw2 for the uv h2o2 process as compared to uw fig 5 the above results show that uv h2o2 is more susceptible to different water matrix but the performance by using uv h2o2 in all natural water samples is still much better than uv alone therefore uv h2o2 is applicable to be used to treated oxc contaminated water compared to uv alone 3 5 byproduct formation and their production pathways the extracted ion chromatograms eic and hplc esi tqms were used to determine the generation of oxc byproducts after uv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 respectively details were shown in fig s10 and fig s11 byproduct molecular weight was assigned on the basis of the pseudomolecule ions m h radical quenching tests have shown that oxc degradation by uv and uv h2o2 is mainly driven by 1o2 scheme 2 and oh scheme 3 respectively the potential oxc transformation mechanism by co3 in uv h2o2 na2co3 was proposed as well scheme 4 3 5 1 singlet oxygen and superoxide radical attack the oxcarbazepine as mentioned in section 3 1 oxc in its ground state is promoted to 3oxc by absorbing a uv photon furthermore the 3oxc can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen to yield carbonyl peroxyl radical carbonyl peroxyl radical is also subjected to self combination producing tetroxide intermediates which can further decompose into other byproducts li et al 2017 in this case a byproduct of 266a was observed scheme 2 moreover carbonyl peroxyl radical can also react with o2 or ho2 resulting in the formation of tp284a and tp284b which further eliminate water to form tp266a as well according to pathways for 1o2 reacting with sulfamethoxazole zhou et al 2017 hydroxyl oxc derivative tp268c may produce in two pathways involving the formation of 1 aniline radicals and 2 endoperoxide intermediate however li et al 2011 have proposed that hydroxyl oxc would probably derived from oh attack on an aromatic ring scheme 3 it is reported that the reaction of 1o2 with amines may proceed via electron transfer pathway or the formation of endoperoxide intermediate derosa and crutchley 2002 li et al 2000 moan and wold 1979 the nitroso nitro oxc tp266b and tp282a were produced through the reaction of amine group by 1o2 zhou et al 2017 furthermore the electron transfer process of 3oxc could occur at the acetamide group to produce a n radical cation scheme 2 which would further react with o2 to generate the peroxide byproduct of tp241 and then dehydrate li et al 2017 to produce tp223b 3 5 2 hydroxyl radical attack of oxcarbazepine and its byproducts transformation pathway i the formation of tp268a is caused by the hydroxylation of oxc which is most likely succeeded by the cleavage of c10 c11 bond leading to the formation of intermediate tp268b similar reactions have been observed for the benzoin linkage of benzoin with benzaldehyde through thiamine diphosphate dependent benzaldehyde lyase gonzález and vicuña 1989 tp268b can be further oxidized to form tp284 a ring closure was related to intramolecular reaction of the carbamoyl nitrogen with the aldehyde moiety i e dehydration which leads to the formation of tp266c finally tp282 could be formed by the oxidation of tp266c the above mentioned tps were also detected via ozonation of carbamazepine hubner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 meanwhile tp268a lost terminal carbamoyl group resulting in the formation of tp225a which followed by α ketol rearrangement leading to a ring contraction scheme s1 cane 1985 vedula et al 2007 transformation pathway ii in the second pathway the formation of a diol tp270 was identified as dioh cbz li et al 2011 by comparing its chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior fig s10 11 tp270 formed two peaks including trans and cis stereoisomer tp270a and tp270b afterward the formation of tp235 can be explained by ring contraction of tp239a decarboxylation of the formed tp235 leads to the formation of tp209a in addition hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of tp209a yielded tp225b tp225c was proposed to contain nc double bond which may tautomerize to tp225b pan et al 2017 and the loss of one water molecule from tp225b and tp225c may form tp207 tp179 was identified as acridine it may be involved from the deoxidation of tp195a or the elimination of decarbonylation from tp207 pan et al 2017 tp179 further attack by oh may degrade it to ring cleavage byproducts such as anthranilic acid salicylic acid and catechol vogna et al 2004 transformation pathway iii in the third pathway tp223a was formed by hydroxylation followed by oxc oxidation at position c11 the formation of tp223b can be explained by a ring contraction caused by benzylic acid rearrangement scheme s1 of tp223a andersson et al 2012 extraction of eic graph in m z 196 with two byproducts tp195a tp195b identified tp195a was identified as acridone and tp195b structure was shown in scheme 3 further attack on tp195a by oh led to the formation of tp211 pan et al 2017 3 5 3 carbonate radical attack the oxcarbazepine and its byproducts though most of the previous experimental works were conducted using nahco3 na2co3 was used directly in this part of study detailed description was provided in text s3 and table s2 this was mainly due to na2co3 can generates significant amount of co3 which was responsible for oxc degradation liu et al 2015 an electron transfer reaction from aminic nitrogen to co3 was proposed for aliphatic amines elango et al 1985 anilines elango et al 1984 and guanine shafirovich et al 2001 two different mechanisms were proposed for the attack of co3 on aromatic amines the electron transfer from the n atom to co3 yields an amine radical cation followed by proton elimination which seems to be the favored mechanism for tertiary amines dell arciprete et al 2012 for primary amines a direct hydrogen abstraction yields n centered radicals considering that oxc has primary and tertiary amines group the hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer mechanism might exist the detailed degradation pathway was shown in scheme 4 the formation of nitroso tp266b tp266d and nitro byproducts tp282a tp282b can be explained by the initial hydrogen abstraction pathway a direct hydrogen abstraction from the nh2 group yields the formation of n centered radical scheme 4 the n centered radical readily reacted with water and this reaction was followed by elimination of h to form hydroxylamine radical molecular oxygen addition to hydroxylamine radical resulted in the formation of hydroxylamine further oxidation of hydroxylamine tp268e tp268f led to the formation of nitroso and nitro byproducts yang et al 2017 the formation of byproducts tp225a tp209 can be explained by the initial electron transfer pathway briefly an electron transfer from tertiary amine group to co3 yields n centered radical cation scheme 4 further nh3 elimination leads to the formation of carbonyl cation and this reaction was followed by the loss of co to form tp225a and tp209 according to the experimental results section 3 5 1 3 5 2 3 5 3 the functional groups i e aromatic ketone structure and nh2 play a major role in the degradation of oxc previous studies have reported that contaminants contain aromatic ketone structure and or nh2 group i e oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole which are experimentally similar to oxc liu et al 2015 yang et al 2017 3 6 toxicity evaluation luminescent bacterium test has been frequently used as biological toxicity detection method detailed information is shown in text s5 to evaluate acute aquatic toxicity xu et al 2016 yin et al 2017 the inhibitory rate of luminescence il of vibrio fischeri bacterium was calculated according to eq 1 1 i l i 0 i t i 0 100 where i0 represents the luminescence intensity of negative control sample and it represents the luminescence intensity of the sample at reaction time as shown in fig s12 during the first 2 min the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence decreased significantly via uv h2o2 but the opposite phenomenon was observed via uv h2o2 nahco3 generally oh attack is more conducive to the hydroxylation process the toxicity of parent compound and its metabolite was positively related to their octanol water partition coefficients kow and the hydroxylated products of oxc increased hydrophilicity so lower acute toxicity could result from the hydroxylated byproducts yang et al 2017 co3 can effectively react with nh2 group and favorable to form the nitrogen oxidized byproducts which could increase the toxicity of oxc scheme 4 to estimate the impact of the oxc and tps on various species qsar analysis was applied to predict the ecotoxicity by ecosar program according to the previous result of 48 h half effective concentration ec50 value for daphnia magna kim et al 2007 the value of class aniline unhindered was selected for prediction as shown in table s5 the oxc and its tps revealed different toxicity levels for different species generally green algae were the most sensitive species for oxc and its byproducts for fish and daphnid lc50 values were lower for most tps than oxc however for green algae lc50 values for most tps were much larger than oxc although with some exceptions the tps generally showed similar toxicity order in terms of organism as well as acute and chronic toxicity for example hydroxylated byproducts of oxc i e tp225a tp239a tp268a tp268b tp268c tp268e tp268f tp270a tp270b have showed lower acute and chronic toxicity towards all tested aquatic organisms compared to the parent oxc it can be seen that tps were less toxic than oxc itself however nitroso and nitro byproducts of oxc i e tp266b tp266d and tp282a tp282b have determined to have more acute and chronic toxicity towards all tested aquatic organisms than parent oxc evidently tps were more toxic than oxc itself these results were similar to earlier studies kaiser et al 2014 li et al 2011 tp195a is known to be carcinogenic and significantly toxic however tp195a has less chronic toxicity than oxc which is dissimilar to previous research results pan et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the assessment of the reliability of aops for a contaminant depends on the nature of tps which is of immense importance as they can be even more toxic than the parent compound the toc value showed a downward trend so tps were continuously consumed during the 30 min reaction fig s13 indicating that even smaller byproducts were still being formed although smaller byproducts were not monitored in this study the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence decreased in tandem with the tps formation in the first 10 min the result indicated that the reaction products have lower acute toxicity than oxc therefore providing enough reaction time is helpful to detoxify byproducts 4 conclusions a mechanistic framework scheme 1 was proposed based on the experimental results and it explains the formation of ros and co3 in addition this study explored the role of co3 in the degradation of oxc via uv and uv h2o2 through kinetics evaluation and mechanism investigation oxc underwent the following transformation pathways hydroxylation α ketol rearrangement and benzylic acid rearrangement under uv and uv h2o2 the results indicated that co3 was involved and enhanced oxc degradation in uv and uv h2o2 compared with non selective oh the reactions involved in co3 are mainly electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction the toxicity tests indicated that the toxicity of the reaction intermediates decreases as they are converted to the byproducts notably the high concentration of bi carbonate favors the scavenging of oh to generate co3 which exhibited higher reactivity towards n containing groups and it will result the formation of tps which are responsible for n centered radical generation in summary this work would be helpful in predicting the fate of oxc using in photochemical processes furthermore it may also improve the understanding of the environmental fate toward other contaminants that contain aromatic ketone structure and or nh2 group acknowledgements

19244,oxcarbazepine oxc is ubiquitous in the aqueous environment and due to its ecotoxicological effects and potential risks to human an effective way to eliminate oxc from aqueous environment has aroused public concerns in recent years radical based reactions have been shown to be an efficient way for oxc destruction but the reactions of oxc with reactive oxygen species ros and carbonate radical co3 are still unclear in this study we focused the degradation of oxc and ros co3 generation mechanism and their roles in oxc degradation via uv and uv h2o2 the triplet state of oxcarbazepine 3oxc was found to play an important role in oxc degradation via uv and hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 were found to be the dominant ros in oxc degradation superoxide radical o2 did not react with oxc directly but it may react with intermediate byproducts generation of co3 played a positive role on oxc degradation for both uv and uv h2o2 in addition to oh 3oxc also contribute to co3 production the second order rate constants of oxc with oh and co3 were 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively potential oxc degradation mechanisms by oh were proposed and included hydroxylation α ketol rearrangement and benzylic acid rearrangement compared with non selective oh the reactions involving co3 are mainly electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction and the acute toxicity of oxc was lower after uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 hco3 treatments which was confirmed by luminescent bacterial assay vibrio fischeri bacterium graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxcarbazepine carbonate radical reactive oxygen species toxicity ultraviolet light hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction oxcarbazepine oxc the keto analogue of carbamazepine cbz is an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical that is widely used in the treatment of epileptic patients brezina et al 2017 as a result oxc and its metabolites are released into aquatic environments through wastewater treatment plants kaiser et al 2014 leclercq et al reported the occurrence of oxc in sewage treatment plant and its concentration was ranged from 85 to 476 ng l in influent and from 51 to 255 ng l in effluent leclercq et al 2009 oxc has relatively stable chemical structure and it cannot be effectively degraded using conventional waste water treatment processes i e biological and chlorination processes bahlmann et al 2014 kaiser et al 2014 moreover oxc transformation products tps are relatively persistent in water distribution system which illustrates that longer contact with secondary disinfectants do not play a significant role in further removing or lowering the concentrations of these refractory compounds bu et al 2016 li et al 2011 therefore an effective advanced treatment processes are required to eliminate oxc from waster water advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive and promising technologies to destroy organic pollutants hydroxyl radical oh based aops such as uv h2o2 are among the most frequently employed to degrade recalcitrant organic contaminants and have been successfully applied to remove pharmaceuticals in various conditions baeza and knappe 2011 keen and linden 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 yao et al 2013 reports have shown that many pharmaceuticals react rapidly with oh k 108 1010 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2016 however the reactivity of pharmaceuticals to other species is still limited such as reactive oxygen species ros and carbonate radical co3 that are produced in aops ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 can effectively oxidize a variety of electron rich pharmaceuticals insecticides and flame retardants han et al 2008 hirahara et al 2003 kim et al 2012 compared to non selective oh the rate of reaction of 1o2 and o2 are less affected by other components in the natural waters rosadolausell et al 2013 therefore the role of ros in destroying organic contaminants especially those with electron rich moieties such as oxc are important in addition co3 is attracting increasing attention because it is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment dell arciprete et al 2012 mazellier 2002 normally co3 production pathways including reaction of carbonate species hco3 co3 2 with oh excited state aromatic ketones and photolysis of the cobalt iii tetraaminocarbonate ion canonica et al 2005 cope et al 1973 mazellier et al 2007 co3 e co3 co3 2 1 63 v at ph 8 4 is a one electron oxidant and can degrade organic compounds and it has second order rate constants ranging between 102 and 109 m 1 s 1 zuo et al 1999 previous work on the uv h2o2 process has shown that the concentration of co3 is much higher than oh four orders of magnitude greater than oh when carbonate species are present zhang et al 2015 in surface waters the steady state concentration of co3 has been reported to be two orders of magnitude higher than oh in the presence of sunlight lai et al 2017 reactivity of co3 toward pharmaceuticals has been investigated but its still in early stage and limited information has been reported liu et al 2015 wols et al 2015 in addition the mechanism of ros formation and its degradation pathway with oxc are not fully understood therefore it is necessary to have overall understanding on the degradation reaction of oxc that include the role of ros and co3 accordingly we investigated the role the effect of ros and carbonate species on oxc degradation by uv and uv h2o2 namely these aspects have been examined 1 determine the formation mechanism of ros co3 and their role in the degradation of oxc 2 investigate kinetics and probable transformation pathways of oxc by oh and co3 based on the identified reaction byproducts and 3 evaluate toxic effects of the parent compounds and the transformation products by testing their bioluminescence inhibition quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis was used to estimate the ecotoxicity 2 materials and

in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 elucidation of reactive oxygen species in uv and uv h2o2 processes oxc is degraded by direct uv photolysis in ultrapure water uw however the addition of h2o2 significantly enhances the degradation of oxc under uv irradiation fig 1 to explore the role of ros in oxc degradation scavenger experiments were employed as depicted in fig 1 a an evident inhibition of oxc degradation was observed by adding tertiary butanol tba 10 mm which indicates that oh is present during oxc degradation 1o2 an excited state of molecular oxygen is readily quenched by nan3 with a rate constant of 2 109 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2008 after nan3 0 5 mm was added to the solution the degradation of oxc was significantly inhibited over 90 of dissolved oxygen in aqueous can be removed with a steady purge with n2 gas butler et al 1994 the rate of photolytic degradation of oxc was suppressed by purging with n2 in uv photolysis in order to further confirm the role of ros in the degradation of oxc other chemical scavengers were used in further investigation to confirm that the o2 was involved in uv photolysis superoxide dismutase sod which can convert o2 to h2o2 was added to the solution as shown in fig s2 the k obs of oxc increased when sod is added and this occurred for two reasons firstly more oh was produced by uv h2o2 because more h2o2 was present secondly the oxcarbazepine n radical cation reacts with o2 to regenerate oxc and produce molecular oxygen scheme 2 wuttig et al 2013 by adding sod this regeneration reaction would be inhibited both of these effects contributed to the 2 fold increase in the decay rate of oxc when sod was added however the degradation of oxc was suppressed when tba and sod were added and this is due to quenching of oh by tba as illustrated in fig s3 ffa etoh and tmp were used as chemical scavengers to determine the formation of 1o2 oh and triplet state 3oxc during uv photolysis li et al 2017 yang et al 2016 yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 etoh was selected to quench the reaction between ffa and oh to determine the role of 1o2 in oxc destruction tmp eliminates triplet state species and was used identify the formation of 3oxc for 1o2 generation we proposed that oxc was first excited to singlet states 1oxc under uv irradiation and then the excited triplet 3oxc state was formed by the inter system relaxation process following this 3oxc reacts with dissolved oxygen to yield the generation of 1o2 and oh this hypothesis was verified by 3oxc quenching study using tmp with ffa scavengers the degradation of ffa was significantly suppressed in the presence of tmp and etoh fig s3 and this indicates that 3oxc was formed and was responsible for 1o2 formation in the uv system according to these results we concluded that during photolysis of oxc direct photolysis and ros were produced via three pathways noted as path 1 path 2 and path 3 that proposed in scheme 1 chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 3 2 effect of ph on uv and uv h2o2 photolysis as shown in fig 2 the k obs increased significantly from 0 0157 min 1 to 0 347 min 1 with increasing ph from 5 0 to 10 0 via uv which was probably related to an increase in the molar absorption coefficient εoxc bolton and stefan 2002 the uv absorption as represented by εoxc fig s5 a e at different ph values are presented in table s1 the increasing εoxc with the increasing ph from 5 0 to 10 0 was resulted in the increasing photolysis of oxc other than εoxc quantum yield of oxc φoxc is also another key factor that responsible for the degradation of oxc under different ph conditions by uv photolysis table s1 in summary it is more conducive to conduct oxc degradation under alkaline conditions as ph varied from 3 0 to 7 0 no significant difference of k obs for reaction was observed but the sharp increase of k obs was observed when ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 in the uv h2o2 fig 2 the main reasons for the differences in k obs observed at alkaline conditions are as follows at higher ph values especially when ph 10 5 the hydroperoxide anion ho2 becomes the dominant form of h2o2 it has a higher molar absorption coefficient 256 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm than h2o2 18 6 m 1 cm 1 baxendale and wilson 1957 khan et al 2014 in addition the higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield of oxc at alkaline ph 7 10 conditions table s1 favor greater degradation of oxc however oh can be largely eliminated when ph reaches above 10 which due to the existence of the reaction between oh and ho with the rate constant of k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2015 as a consequence of the dynamics of the production yield and scavenging effect of hydroxyl radicals and the increase of photolysis the degradation of oxc was found to higher at alkaline conditions fig 2 3 3 effect of bicarbonate the degradation rate of oxc increases for uv and uv h2o2 with increasing hco3 concentration fig 3 however many studies have reported that co3 2 hco3 have an inhibitory effect on the degradation of organic compounds due to their quenching property for oh grebel et al 2010 he et al 2012 pelaez et al 2011 shah et al 2013 in uv photolysis the enhanced oxc degradation was due to the following reasons details mentioned in scheme 1 first the excited triplet state 3oxc reacts with hco3 one electron reduction of 3oxc is transferred from dissolved hco3 and this generates of co3 this reaction pathway is favorable at high hco3 concentrations breton et al 2005 in addition the generated ros also contributes to the production of co3 in uv process to confirm the role of co3 on oxc degradation in the uv and uv h2o2 isopropanol ipa and tba k oh ipa 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 were added to the reactor solution buxton et al 1988 for the uv hco3 process the degradation rate of oxc was suppressed with the addition of tba ipa fig 4 a this is due to co3 was involved in the reaction scheme 1 in uv h2o2 the presence of hco3 can alter the degradation mechanism of oxc because of the production of co3 as shown in fig 4 b although the rate constants of tba and ipa toward oh are similar we found that ipa inhibited the degradation of oxc to a greater extent than tba this is due to the reaction of ipa with co3 has a much higher rate constant than the reaction of tba with co3 kco3 ipa 4 0 104 m 1 s 1 kco3 tba 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 chen et al 1973 this result suggests that co3 participates in the degradation of oxc on the other hand the degradation of oxc cannot be completely inhibited even when excess tba ipa was used table s2 the probable reasons of this result are that oxc was degraded by uv and co3 was formed in the reaction between hco3 and 3oxc fig 4 a another possible reason for this result is that hco3 is an important scavenger of o2 that can generate co3 burns et al 2012 due to the higher reactivity of co3 huie et al 1991 relative to o2 and 1o2 the conversion of o2 to more selective co3 can also enhance oxc degradation dell arciprete et al 2012 the second order rate constants of oxc with oh and co3 were determined text s3 to be 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and 8 6 107 m 1 s 1 respectively although the rate constants with co3 was lower than oh the high selectivity of co3 makes it less susceptible to scavenging effects by the solution matrix and would markedly lead to the degradation of oxc zhang et al 2015 this could be seen from the kinetic modeling that the values of co3 ss were 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of oh ss under different hco3 concentrations table s2 3 4 degradation of oxc in natural water matrices the degradation of oxc via uv and uv h2o2 in different natural water matrices in table s3 were also investigated fig 5 for uv photolysis there is a slight increase in k obs in natural water samples as compared to uw according to the ph of the water samples table s3 hco3 was the main form of alkalinity and according to the result from fig 3 higher concentration of hco3 have positive effect on oxc degradation generally nom exhibits two opposite effects 1 a promoting effect caused by ros generation 2 an inhibiting effect caused by its light absorption and radical scavenging effects no effect on the degradation of oxc via uv in the presence of different concentrations of humic acid was observed fig s9 suggesting that contributions from effect 1 and effect 2 maybe equal taking the above factors into consideration the degradation of oxc was slightly promoted by uv in the natural water the suva254nm is typically used to determine the organic carbon and aromatic character of water he et al 2014 kull et al 2006 generally the higher suva254nm value can result in the less effective on the treatment process of target contaminant degradation as shown in table s3 sw1 has the largest suva254nm value while smallest suva254nm value was observed in gw but degradation rate of oxc is almost the same to a large extent this difference could mainly due to the variation of alkalinity in different water samples liu et al 2016 hco3 could enhance the degradation of oxc in uw via uv h2o2 due to the production of co3 compared to hco3 nom competes with oxc for the uv photons and it also has large quenching rate for oh k 2 5 104 mgc l 1 s 1 in uv h2o2 paul westerhoff et al 2007 under such conditions the nom is the major scavenger of oh fig s9 which explains the smaller k obs was observed for oxc removal in all natural water samples tw gw sw1 and sw2 for the uv h2o2 process as compared to uw fig 5 the above results show that uv h2o2 is more susceptible to different water matrix but the performance by using uv h2o2 in all natural water samples is still much better than uv alone therefore uv h2o2 is applicable to be used to treated oxc contaminated water compared to uv alone 3 5 byproduct formation and their production pathways the extracted ion chromatograms eic and hplc esi tqms were used to determine the generation of oxc byproducts after uv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 respectively details were shown in fig s10 and fig s11 byproduct molecular weight was assigned on the basis of the pseudomolecule ions m h radical quenching tests have shown that oxc degradation by uv and uv h2o2 is mainly driven by 1o2 scheme 2 and oh scheme 3 respectively the potential oxc transformation mechanism by co3 in uv h2o2 na2co3 was proposed as well scheme 4 3 5 1 singlet oxygen and superoxide radical attack the oxcarbazepine as mentioned in section 3 1 oxc in its ground state is promoted to 3oxc by absorbing a uv photon furthermore the 3oxc can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen to yield carbonyl peroxyl radical carbonyl peroxyl radical is also subjected to self combination producing tetroxide intermediates which can further decompose into other byproducts li et al 2017 in this case a byproduct of 266a was observed scheme 2 moreover carbonyl peroxyl radical can also react with o2 or ho2 resulting in the formation of tp284a and tp284b which further eliminate water to form tp266a as well according to pathways for 1o2 reacting with sulfamethoxazole zhou et al 2017 hydroxyl oxc derivative tp268c may produce in two pathways involving the formation of 1 aniline radicals and 2 endoperoxide intermediate however li et al 2011 have proposed that hydroxyl oxc would probably derived from oh attack on an aromatic ring scheme 3 it is reported that the reaction of 1o2 with amines may proceed via electron transfer pathway or the formation of endoperoxide intermediate derosa and crutchley 2002 li et al 2000 moan and wold 1979 the nitroso nitro oxc tp266b and tp282a were produced through the reaction of amine group by 1o2 zhou et al 2017 furthermore the electron transfer process of 3oxc could occur at the acetamide group to produce a n radical cation scheme 2 which would further react with o2 to generate the peroxide byproduct of tp241 and then dehydrate li et al 2017 to produce tp223b 3 5 2 hydroxyl radical attack of oxcarbazepine and its byproducts transformation pathway i the formation of tp268a is caused by the hydroxylation of oxc which is most likely succeeded by the cleavage of c10 c11 bond leading to the formation of intermediate tp268b similar reactions have been observed for the benzoin linkage of benzoin with benzaldehyde through thiamine diphosphate dependent benzaldehyde lyase gonzález and vicuña 1989 tp268b can be further oxidized to form tp284 a ring closure was related to intramolecular reaction of the carbamoyl nitrogen with the aldehyde moiety i e dehydration which leads to the formation of tp266c finally tp282 could be formed by the oxidation of tp266c the above mentioned tps were also detected via ozonation of carbamazepine hubner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 meanwhile tp268a lost terminal carbamoyl group resulting in the formation of tp225a which followed by α ketol rearrangement leading to a ring contraction scheme s1 cane 1985 vedula et al 2007 transformation pathway ii in the second pathway the formation of a diol tp270 was identified as dioh cbz li et al 2011 by comparing its chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior fig s10 11 tp270 formed two peaks including trans and cis stereoisomer tp270a and tp270b afterward the formation of tp235 can be explained by ring contraction of tp239a decarboxylation of the formed tp235 leads to the formation of tp209a in addition hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of tp209a yielded tp225b tp225c was proposed to contain nc double bond which may tautomerize to tp225b pan et al 2017 and the loss of one water molecule from tp225b and tp225c may form tp207 tp179 was identified as acridine it may be involved from the deoxidation of tp195a or the elimination of decarbonylation from tp207 pan et al 2017 tp179 further attack by oh may degrade it to ring cleavage byproducts such as anthranilic acid salicylic acid and catechol vogna et al 2004 transformation pathway iii in the third pathway tp223a was formed by hydroxylation followed by oxc oxidation at position c11 the formation of tp223b can be explained by a ring contraction caused by benzylic acid rearrangement scheme s1 of tp223a andersson et al 2012 extraction of eic graph in m z 196 with two byproducts tp195a tp195b identified tp195a was identified as acridone and tp195b structure was shown in scheme 3 further attack on tp195a by oh led to the formation of tp211 pan et al 2017 3 5 3 carbonate radical attack the oxcarbazepine and its byproducts though most of the previous experimental works were conducted using nahco3 na2co3 was used directly in this part of study detailed description was provided in text s3 and table s2 this was mainly due to na2co3 can generates significant amount of co3 which was responsible for oxc degradation liu et al 2015 an electron transfer reaction from aminic nitrogen to co3 was proposed for aliphatic amines elango et al 1985 anilines elango et al 1984 and guanine shafirovich et al 2001 two different mechanisms were proposed for the attack of co3 on aromatic amines the electron transfer from the n atom to co3 yields an amine radical cation followed by proton elimination which seems to be the favored mechanism for tertiary amines dell arciprete et al 2012 for primary amines a direct hydrogen abstraction yields n centered radicals considering that oxc has primary and tertiary amines group the hydrogen abstraction and electron transfer mechanism might exist the detailed degradation pathway was shown in scheme 4 the formation of nitroso tp266b tp266d and nitro byproducts tp282a tp282b can be explained by the initial hydrogen abstraction pathway a direct hydrogen abstraction from the nh2 group yields the formation of n centered radical scheme 4 the n centered radical readily reacted with water and this reaction was followed by elimination of h to form hydroxylamine radical molecular oxygen addition to hydroxylamine radical resulted in the formation of hydroxylamine further oxidation of hydroxylamine tp268e tp268f led to the formation of nitroso and nitro byproducts yang et al 2017 the formation of byproducts tp225a tp209 can be explained by the initial electron transfer pathway briefly an electron transfer from tertiary amine group to co3 yields n centered radical cation scheme 4 further nh3 elimination leads to the formation of carbonyl cation and this reaction was followed by the loss of co to form tp225a and tp209 according to the experimental results section 3 5 1 3 5 2 3 5 3 the functional groups i e aromatic ketone structure and nh2 play a major role in the degradation of oxc previous studies have reported that contaminants contain aromatic ketone structure and or nh2 group i e oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole which are experimentally similar to oxc liu et al 2015 yang et al 2017 3 6 toxicity evaluation luminescent bacterium test has been frequently used as biological toxicity detection method detailed information is shown in text s5 to evaluate acute aquatic toxicity xu et al 2016 yin et al 2017 the inhibitory rate of luminescence il of vibrio fischeri bacterium was calculated according to eq 1 1 i l i 0 i t i 0 100 where i0 represents the luminescence intensity of negative control sample and it represents the luminescence intensity of the sample at reaction time as shown in fig s12 during the first 2 min the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence decreased significantly via uv h2o2 but the opposite phenomenon was observed via uv h2o2 nahco3 generally oh attack is more conducive to the hydroxylation process the toxicity of parent compound and its metabolite was positively related to their octanol water partition coefficients kow and the hydroxylated products of oxc increased hydrophilicity so lower acute toxicity could result from the hydroxylated byproducts yang et al 2017 co3 can effectively react with nh2 group and favorable to form the nitrogen oxidized byproducts which could increase the toxicity of oxc scheme 4 to estimate the impact of the oxc and tps on various species qsar analysis was applied to predict the ecotoxicity by ecosar program according to the previous result of 48 h half effective concentration ec50 value for daphnia magna kim et al 2007 the value of class aniline unhindered was selected for prediction as shown in table s5 the oxc and its tps revealed different toxicity levels for different species generally green algae were the most sensitive species for oxc and its byproducts for fish and daphnid lc50 values were lower for most tps than oxc however for green algae lc50 values for most tps were much larger than oxc although with some exceptions the tps generally showed similar toxicity order in terms of organism as well as acute and chronic toxicity for example hydroxylated byproducts of oxc i e tp225a tp239a tp268a tp268b tp268c tp268e tp268f tp270a tp270b have showed lower acute and chronic toxicity towards all tested aquatic organisms compared to the parent oxc it can be seen that tps were less toxic than oxc itself however nitroso and nitro byproducts of oxc i e tp266b tp266d and tp282a tp282b have determined to have more acute and chronic toxicity towards all tested aquatic organisms than parent oxc evidently tps were more toxic than oxc itself these results were similar to earlier studies kaiser et al 2014 li et al 2011 tp195a is known to be carcinogenic and significantly toxic however tp195a has less chronic toxicity than oxc which is dissimilar to previous research results pan et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the assessment of the reliability of aops for a contaminant depends on the nature of tps which is of immense importance as they can be even more toxic than the parent compound the toc value showed a downward trend so tps were continuously consumed during the 30 min reaction fig s13 indicating that even smaller byproducts were still being formed although smaller byproducts were not monitored in this study the inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence decreased in tandem with the tps formation in the first 10 min the result indicated that the reaction products have lower acute toxicity than oxc therefore providing enough reaction time is helpful to detoxify byproducts 4 conclusions a mechanistic framework scheme 1 was proposed based on the experimental results and it explains the formation of ros and co3 in addition this study explored the role of co3 in the degradation of oxc via uv and uv h2o2 through kinetics evaluation and mechanism investigation oxc underwent the following transformation pathways hydroxylation α ketol rearrangement and benzylic acid rearrangement under uv and uv h2o2 the results indicated that co3 was involved and enhanced oxc degradation in uv and uv h2o2 compared with non selective oh the reactions involved in co3 are mainly electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction the toxicity tests indicated that the toxicity of the reaction intermediates decreases as they are converted to the byproducts notably the high concentration of bi carbonate favors the scavenging of oh to generate co3 which exhibited higher reactivity towards n containing groups and it will result the formation of tps which are responsible for n centered radical generation in summary this work would be helpful in predicting the fate of oxc using in photochemical processes furthermore it may also improve the understanding of the environmental fate toward other contaminants that contain aromatic ketone structure and or nh2 group acknowledgements
