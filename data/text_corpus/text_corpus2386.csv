quality across an urban gradient in onitsha a notable urbanized region and beehive of commercial activity in southeastern nigeria groundwater samples n 120 from sixty boreholes tapping into aquifers spanning major settlement clusters at upper iweka mgbuka and nkpor were sampled over 5 months from august to december 2019 faecal coliforms water soluble metals and nutrients nitrates and phosphates were estimated in groundwater samples noncarcinogenic risks of heavy metals in ground water samples was estimated for average daily dose add and total hazard quotient thq using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches concentrations of mercury and heavy metals fe pb and cd estimated in water samples revealed a general exceedance of world health organization 2009 standards for drinking water

exposure routes strategic mitigation measures including urban planning and infrastructural upgrade are recommended to protect the water resources prevent further groundwater contamination and reduce population health risks emanating from poor drinking water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords multi index approach land cover use mapping sentinel 2a bare land built up area 1 introduction the rapid urbanization phenomenon has put immense pressure on natural resources including groundwater goel et al 2018 odeloui et al 2016 although rising incidences of groundwater degradation in developing nations have received considerable attention henderson 2002 von der heyden and new 2004 its relationship to the concurrent rise in population densities the economic growth and modern lifestyle of urban inhabitants has become topical in estimating risks of such incidences ferreira et al 2018 henderson 2002 these changes in groundwater quality could vary considerably with geographical locations hydrogeological environment built up intensity and coverage of waterborne sewerage foster 2020 sharp 2010 as such handling and management of municipal wastes and sewage water in the sprawling urban dwellings constitute a very crucial issue in the sustainable management of water resources grodzińska jurczak 2001 mesjasz lech 2014 the marked infrastructural deficit of proper municipal waste disposal and sewerage systems are complicit in the incidences of severe groundwater contamination so much that the quality of groundwater is often traceable to the percolation of surface pollutants from septic tank leaks soak pits pit latrines domestic wastewater leaks leachates from solid waste dumps and sewage which enter groundwater table and affect the potability of groundwater mcmichael 2000 odey et al 2018 shaharoona et al 2019 thus prevailing land use patterns and integrity of subsurface layers morris et al 2003 schmoll et al 2006 affect groundwater quality and relative health risks owokotomo et al 2020 typical pollution events from industrial wastewater discharge domestic wastewater and other diffuse sources contribute nitrogen heavy metals volatile organic compounds pathogenic microorganisms and pharmaceuticals which migrate with rainwater through the subsurface into groundwater kuroda and fukushi 2008 leung and jiao 2006 although point data of concentrations at particular locations have been used to identify vulnerable areas current methods for mapping vulnerability entail interpolation methods to visualize the spatial probability of risks

for the thematic identification of land cover at multi temporal scales immitzer et al 2016 radoux et al 2016 groundwater quality degradation portends adverse health effect in humans attributable to toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of pollutants associated with urbanization and industrialization batayneh 2012 giri and singh 2015 emphasis on aspiration 1 of the agenda 2063 framework document which seeks to achieve a prosperous africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development highlights the need to address the challenges of rapid urbanization and access to necessities of life as part of its strategic approach auc 2015 deghetto et al 2016 indeed the lack of basic sanitation and waste management infrastructure constitutes a bane to the availability of potable groundwater as a basic necessity junior et al 2010 odey et al 2018 for eastern nigeria soil erosion particularly gully erosion is an outflow of rapid urbanization igbokwe and ayomaya 2004 which aggravates the vulnerability of groundwater urbanized areas junior et al 2010 thus we hypothesize that among other factors groundwater susceptibility to contaminants of anthropogenic origin could be higher in areas of concentrated built up areas and greater incidence of land degradation events like erosion to highlight areas of high risk to groundwater degradation and public health hazards it is necessary to mesh hydrogeological understanding and land use patterns using simple robust matrices thus this study undertakes a pollution risk assessment within the onitsha area measuring and presenting selected metals and physicochemical properties of borehole water from three metropolitan locations within onitcha area of anambra state 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area onitsha is sited proximal to the eastern bank of the niger river with a coverage of about 50 square kilometres this area links the eastern north south route via the niger bridge at onitsha with a significant population cluster and industrial activity located within and around this transportation axis its marked patterns of urban expansion highlights it as one of the four main potential industrial and commercial growth areas in nigeria sha ato et al 2007 three settlement areas under consideration for this study include upper iweka is located under onitsha north local government area with coordinates 6 10n 6 47e with an estimated population of 261 604 nkpor suburban settlement is located west of onitsha with an estimated population of about 109 377 predominantly agrarian with focus on major crops particularly yam cassava rice maize cocoyam cowpea and tomatoes ijioma and osondu 2015 mgbuka a place in obosi which is attached to the south of onitsha had an estimated population of 144 203 as of 2007 iloeje 1965 the eastern nigeria area is marked by the anambra basin of the benue trough with predominant occurrence of clastic sediments and distinct lithostratigraphic units with varied widths up to 2500 m reyment 1965 geologic formations which define the extensive urban area of onitsha includes the ogwashi asaba formation with a thickness of a few millimeters to a maximum of 6 m which largely underlies the nnewi area while the ameki formation and nanka sands with a thickness ranging from 50 to 300 m underlies the upper iweka area down to mgbuka obosi axis of the onitsha area arinze et al 2015 chiaghanam et al 2014 appendix i 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis in this study groundwater samples n 120 from sixty boreholes tapping into aquifers spanning major settlement clusters at upper iweka mgbuka and nkpor were sampled over 5 months from august to december 2019 fig 1 and analyzed glassware sampling bottles were washed and rinsed before sample collection the average depth of all boreholes sampled was 85 m at each site groundwater samples were analyzed for the ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do using standard procedures of water analysis apha 1998 in brief water samples for chemical analysis were filtered through a hand held hanna filter system using a 0 45 μm cellulose filter paper advantec mfs inc and collected in a 500 ml clean hdpe bottle two 125 ml aliquots were collected at each site one unacidified and the other acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure nitric acid the samples were then refrigerated at 4 c before chemical analysis for microbial analysis samples collected in sterile bottles was analyzed by the pour plating method using the serial dilution technique bartram and ballance 1996 the faecal coliform analysis was carried out using the most probable number mpn method apha 1998 2 3 digestion of samples three millilitres of each of the samples were measured and transferred into a boiling tube labelled a b and c respectively to each sample 3 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid was added 3 ml of hydrogen peroxide was also added to the sample and allowed to stand for 10 15 min the sample in the boiling tube was clamped on a retort stand the clamped boiling tube on the retort stand was heated in a heating mantle for 45 50 min and allowed to cool down the samples were further treated with 1 ml of hydrogen peroxide to help give clear sample digestion the digested sample was filtered with whatman no 45 filter paper and the filtrate collected into a 4 ml sample tube on the other hand the determination of the concentration of mercury in water samples was achieved by slightly modifying the cold vapour technique described by omang 1971 total mercury was reduced to metallic form when it could be volatilized by aeration and measured digested samples were diluted up to 25 ml with distilled water while an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with air acetylene flame was used to determine the concentrations of trace elements except for mercury where a cold vapour technique after wet washing was used 2 4 determination of phosphate groundwater phosphate levels were estimated using the method described by murphy and riley 1962 and apha 2005 water samples were mixed with a solvent containing 1 mil of ammonium molybdate and 0 4 ml of hydrazine sulphate distilled water was added to the resulting solution to form an extract which was heated for 30mins in a water bath exact values for phosphate levels were determined using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uvmini 1240 v at 882 nm wavelength 2 5 determination of nitrates groundwater nitrate levels from onitsha area were estimated using method described by apha 2005 50 ml of filtered water sample and standard nitrate solution was placed in separate 250 ml beakers 1 ml of hcl was added to each beaker and mixed thoroughly with a stirrer the absorbance of the nitrate standard was read at 225 nm while that of ground water samples were read at 225 nm and 275 nm in an attempt to differentiate interference from organics the absorbance due to nitrate ion was obtained by subtracting absorbance of samples 225 nm from 275 nm while concentration was obtained from the nitrate standard curve all standards and chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich chemieor fluka chemie ag buchs switzerland 2 6 heavy metal analysis 1 ml of the collected filtrate was injected into atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas analyser and the reading of each metal tested was taken from the output screen ademoroti 1996 2 7 quality control and assurance buck certified atomic absorption standard was used to calibrate the equipment for the heavy metals of concern in this study to attain a calibration curve while a shimadzu uvmini 1240 v spectrophotometer was used to obtained concentrations of phosphorus and nitrate in ground water samples after every five batches of samples analysis standard reference materials were used to monitor variations from the calibration standard and eliminate equipment drift atobatele and olutona 2015 all samples were analyzed more than once to ensure result exactness and accuracy 2 8 geospatial analysis interpolation of groundwater parameters data was performed using arcgis software using inverse distance weighted idw kriging option based on a linear combination of closely related values meng et al 2013 prior to this observation wells and parameter concentrations were represented by point shapefile vector and converted to raster through interpolation 2 9 spectral indices to estimate the intensity of built up features at each location within the onitcha area the sentinel 2 a high temporal resolution imagery imageries were applied to indices specific for estimating manmade surfaces gadal and ouerghemmi 2019 kuc and chormański 2019 built up areas mapping with vegetation index urbanization is typically marked by the removal of trees and vegetation and the proliferation of built up areas mcgrane 2016 thus two well known vegetation indices the ndvi schell and deering 1973 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 were examined in the mapping of built up features within the onitsha area the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well documented remote sensed procedure for monitoring vegetation dynamics i e vegetation greenness density and fragmentation of landscape types including forest rangeland farmland and urban areas lo and faber 1997 wilson and lindsey 2005 the formulas for ndvi and savi according to zhao et al 2012 are given in equations 1 and 2 below 1 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d 2 s a v i n i r r e d n i r r e d 0 5 x 1 5 build up areas mapping with ndbi the normalized difference built up index ndbi is one of the spectral indices specific for manmade surfaces it highlights urban areas using higher reflectance in the shortwave infrared spectral range swir to extract built up features from remote sensing imagery xu et al 2018 this index was computed as specified in equation 3 3 n d b i ρ swir 1 ρ nir ρ swir 1 ρ nir in addition to the ndbi the ndti was also applied as part of a multi index approach to assess built up patterns within the onitcha area specifications of the ndti is given in equation 4 below 4 n d t i swir 1 swir 2 swir 1 swir 2 2 10 risk characterization groundwater contamination risk estimation for populations who rely on groundwater as a viable source of water for various activities was determined using risk assessment indices proposed by usepa 2001 risk estimation covered intake routes i e direct ingestion drinking inhalation and dermal contact uptake via bathing giri and singh 2015 ogbeide et al 2019 in this study ingestion and dermal contact will be considered the average daily dose add was used to estimate the risk of metals in groundwater to humans papadakis et al 2015 two major routes of exposures were considered including ingestion and dermal routes formulas presented in equation 5and 6 were used to obtain add estimates for both ingestion and dermal routes respectively 5 add ingestion cw ir water e f ed bw at 6 add dermal cw sa kp e f ed bw at where add is the daily exposure while the concentration of metals mg l in water samples is cw table 1 provides the further description and values for other parameters used in these equations because slope factor sf isn t available for selected metals only non carcinogenic risk was considered in this study 7 h a z a r d q u o t i e n t h q e x p r f d the reference dose rfd for each metal refers to a numerical estimate of daily exposure that is not likely to cause harmful effects during the lifetime of a human rfd used in this study was obtained from the usa risk based concentration table usepa 1992 2011 hazard quotient hq for exposure to each metal was determined using add estimates estimates of total hazard quotient thq found to be above 1 indicates the possibility that there is a potential for non carcinogenic health effects while thq estimates 1 implies that there is no potential for non carcinogenic health effects kavcar et al 2009 ogbeide et al 2019 carcinogenic risk determination is based on the assumption that a small number of molecular events can elicit mutations in a single cell causing self replicating damage and ultimately carcinogenic endpoints in principle this is described as a non threshold effect because all levels of exposure have a likelihood capability of generating a response however noncarcinogenic changes are marked by thresholds particularly dose levels below which a response is unlikely due to cellular adaptations against toxic events haber et al 2001 2 11 probabilistic risk assessment due to incidences of accuracy in the use of deterministic risk estimates and inability to account for uncertainties that can affect risk decision thompson and graham 1996 a probabilistic risk determination was done using monte carlo simulations mcs the importance of this method is anchored on its use of the probability density function for the output in understanding the environmental behaviour of contaminants while taking into account uncertainties that exist cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019 for the study data monte carlo simulations were conducted with 1 000 000 iterations using the commercially available companion 5 3 by minitab version 18 this software was used to assign probability distributions for each variable presented in table 1 and estimate uncertainties in risk assessment 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties groundwater samples measures of physicochemical properties across the urban sites revealed all sites revealed low acidic ph with mean values falling below the who tolerance limits samples from upper iweka revealed significantly lower acidic values compared to other urban sites similarly conductivity was significantly higher at upper iweka at about 2 3 fold more compared to other sites mgbuka showed significantly lower levels of tds while levels of do did not significantly differ across urban sites 3 2 the concentration of metals in water samples mercury in groundwater across the urban sites examined revealed that all sites exceeded acceptable limits specified by who however significantly highest levels were recorded at upper iweka 0 122 0 03 mg l while levels recorded at nkpor 0 062 0 006 mg l and mgbuka 0 078 0 01 mg l similarly concentrations of pb in groundwater from upper iweka 0 115 0 014 mg l exceeded acceptable limits by who and was also significantly higher than values recorded from other urban sites at nkpor 0 005 1 00 e 03 mg l and mgbuka 0 039 0 007 mg l levels of pb in groundwater at nkpor showed significantly lowest levels compared to other urban sites the mean concentration of cadmium across all urban sites exceeded acceptable limits by who however mean levels recorded at nkpor area was significantly higher than all other sites mean levels at upper iweka and mgbuka did not significantly differ levels of iron across all urban sites did not exceed who acceptable limits however significantly higher levels were recorded at mgbuka compared to other sites fig 2 fig 4 table 2 3 3 multivariate analysis from the ordination plot of the pca the groundwater samples from upper iweka showed strong associations with ndbi savi hg pb conductivity and faecal coliform the strong negative relationship between nkpor settlement and ndbi indicates that it is the least urbanized settlement within the onitcha area while the location of mgbuka within the ordination plot depicts its intermediate urbanization or built up intensity compared to upper iweka and nkpor the stronger association of the nkpor area with ndti and ndvi was also observed alongside associations with metals cd fe phosphates nitrates low ph and high tds in groundwater samples fig 5 3 4 risk characterization of metals in groundwater from selected location in onitsha metropolis both deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to characterize noncarcinogenic risks of heavy metals in groundwater samples in onitsha metropolis and results are presented in tables 3 and 4 alongside figs 6 and 7 in upper iweka deterministic estimates of human health risk for the metal in groundwater samples showed average daily dose add values for hg pb and cd were above the recommended reference dose when considering the ingestion route of exposure table 3 consequently the total hazard quotient thq for all metals were above the threshold value of 1 when considering the dermal route add estimates for cd hg and pb were below their respective reference doses table 4 furthermore hq values for each metal were above the threshold value of 1 similar results were observed in nkpor where estimated add values for each metal was below rfd values when considering the dermal route of exposure while only hg and pb were above their respective rfd values hazard index values for estimated for nkpor was found to be greater than upper iweka and mgbuka respectively for ingestion exposure route while for dermal exposure route upper iweka was greater than nkpor and mgbuka respectively probabilistic estimates for heavy metals in groundwater from onitsha via ingestion route showed that upper iweka had the highest hq 3 262 followed by mgbuka 2 1233 and nkpor 2 0187 on the other hand estimates showed that mgbuka had the highest hq 0 0241 followed by nkpor 0 016 and upper iweka 0 014 for dermal exposure routes probability estimates using the monte carlo system figs 6 7 showed the increased risk to adults upon ingestion of groundwater contaminated with metals was observed in upper iweka followed by mgbuka and nkpor on the other hand risk estimated for metals in groundwater for adults via dermal exposure routes showed that all hq estimated were below the threshold value of 1 similarly hi estimates were also below 1 this indicates that dermal exposure to groundwater contaminated with cd hg and pb will not result in a non cancer effect this was supported by the monte carlo estimate presented in figs 6 7 hq estimates for all regions showed a mean value less than 1 indicating that there was no probability for non cancer risk via dermal exposure 3 5 probabilistic risk assessment of metals in ground water 4 discussion 4 1 urbanization and groundwater vulnerability the extent to which groundwater quality is impacted is directed related to the vulnerability of underlying aquifers to pollution alongside the type and stage of urban development ellis 1999 the higher built up index values recorded for the upper iweka area gives a direct reflection of the densely populated status of this area this implies a significant presence of man made structures and activities e g landfills leaking sewers pit latrines transportation routes in excavated areas and highway drainage that introduce pollutants directly into the unsaturated or even saturated zones of aquifers igbokwe and ayomaya 2004 okafor et al 2007 it then follows that for largely un sewered cities like onitsha a significant proportion of wastewater can seep into groundwater resources this is most likely to be the case in areas underlain with largely sandy unconsolidated and thus highly permeable stratum within nanka formations in regions with a more consolidated soil profile a greater proportion of urban drainage and wastewater will normally be directed to surface watercourses because of the generally lower infiltration and storage capacity of the ground consequently the contaminant seepages due to urbanization will be more spectacular and significant at upper iweka urban area compared to other urban areas of onitsha egbueri and igwe 2020 in addition the lower elevation of the upper iweka urban area also implies greater susceptibility to groundwater contamination studies have also demonstrated the vulnerability of shallow geology areas to effects of urbanization on groundwater foster and skinner 1995 aside the high built up index values recorded for the upper iweka area the higher contaminant concentrations in groundwater from this area could be attributed to susceptibility of the area to hydrogeomorphic disturbances via erosion events compared to other urban areas the nanka ogwashi and benin formations which predominantly underlie southwards of anambra state appendix i are both vulnerable to hydrogeomorphic factors that contribute to events of gully erosion but areas marked by extensive nanka formation are notable for a higher gullying intensity egbueri and igwe 2020 runoff from drainage from major highways and industrial patios similar to upper iweka also increase the likelihood of groundwater pollution by hydrocarbon fuels and industrial chemical spillages müller et al 2020 furthermore the absence of sewerage and prevalence of in situ or septic tank sanitation in densely populated settlements of urban areas of developing countries increase the likelihood of pathogenic bacteria and viruses occurring in groundwater lewis et al 1982 foster 1985 from the elevation map fig 3 the upper iweka area because of its flat slopes and closeness to the river bank watershed makes it a high vulnerability area this is attributable to the erosion prone features typical of such which include friable and less compacted soil higher precipitation and lower depth to groundwater oke 2020 which increases its susceptibility to migratory pollutants and pathogens infiltrating from topsoil into groundwater egboka and okpoko 1984 as such the lower groundwater risk areas would be areas of the basin that are characterized by thick vadose zones at higher elevations and high depth to groundwater often farther from river watersheds oke 2020 4 2 physicochemical properties of groundwater the low ph acidic ph observed across urban sites of onitsha implies reduced adsorption of metals to the earth s crust and greater bioavailability in drinking water which will portend greater exposure and hazards to human health this is because most metals of concern in groundwater quality are cations e g pb2 cu2 ni2 cd2 and precipitate when ph values of water are higher the general occurrence of acidification of soil and water in the onitsha area could be due to anthropogenic causes linked to the use of fossil fuels in industry and high vehicular emissions due to high traffic within these areas knutsson 1994 studies have demonstrated that groundwater in which acidification processes attains a drop in ph to around or below 5 have attained a very critical stage of acidification and inherently indicate that concentrations of aluminum nitrate and sulphate would be considerably high with the increased dissolution of some heavy metals e g cadmium elsewhere groundwaters in such a state have been considered unsuitable for drinking knutsson 1994 the higher conductivity at the upper iweka settlement where ph was lowest within the onitsha area also corroborates the fact that the water samples contain high levels of precipitated metals and anions in solution adeogun et al 2012 a greater concern is that metals in naturally or anthropogenically acidified groundwaters as observed for upper iweka are more mobile and can travel long distances within the groundwater continuum schmoll et al 2006 most groundwaters with a nearly neutral ph show limited solubility of metal cations due to ease of precipitation as an oxide hydroxide carbonate or phosphate mineral or increased likelihood to become strongly adsorbed to hydrous metal oxides clay or organic matter in the aquifer matrix who 2016 the higher values of nutrients levels i e nitrates and phosphorus in the less built up area at nkpor compared to the more intense built up areas at mgbuka and upper iweka highlights the contribution of intense agricultural activity to groundwater quality within the area the impact of agriculture on water pollution could be problematic in catchments where arable fields dominate with increased likelihood of high nitrogen fertilizers application rates increasing the groundwater pollution lawniczak et al 2016 mahvi et al 2005 smolders et al 2010 the significantly higher concentration of faecal coliforms in groundwater from the more urbanized areas at upper iweka implicates infiltrations from cultivated watersheds and seepages of high volume untreated human sewage due to poor or totally absent sanitary infrastructure studies have demonstrated that altered hydrology due to poorly designed and or constructed water supply and wastewater channels creates a localized pathway and a rapid bypass mechanism for microbes through the protective subsurface layer into groundwater lawrence et al 2001 considering the backdrop of the above localized practices that put severe stress on the quality of groundwater the role of hydrogeological parameters in determining likelihood of contamination has also been highlighted elsewhere pujari et al 2012 4 3 metals in groundwater and potential sources the generally higher trend of heavy metals in groundwater in the more built up areas at upper iweka can be readily attributed to the marked urbanization and industrialization activities associated with areas with more built up features idrees et al 2018 singh et al 2011 in addition surface runoff from more urbanized catchments are laden with a higher load of suspended solids and metals particularly pb cd and cr egodawatta et al 2009 huang et al 2007 instances of lead concentrations exceeding environmental limits in urban runoff was attributed to pollutant laden highway runoff tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 and roof materials davis and burns 1999 more specifically the levels of mercury recorded across settlements within the onitcha area exceeded acceptable limits with the highest concentrations at the more urbanized site at upper iweka these elevated concentrations of mercury hg in groundwater could be linked to industrial contamination or mining activities rytuba 2000 somasundaram et al 1993 and rarely to natural sources sidle 1993 localized hg groundwater contamination in urban areas originating from both inactive and active industrial sources has been identified as a more frequent scenario across many geographical areas with fewer instances of groundwater contamination of groundwater due to multiple potentially small point sources somasundaram et al 1993 the higher levels of iron in groundwater from the relatively less urbanized area at mgbuka may be attributed to sewage and landfill leachate streams which are notable contributors of iron to local groundwater huang et al 2015 in addition increased dissolution of ferrous borehole and handpump components common in developing countries could augment the contributions of iron from major sources 4 4 urbanization and vegetation cover inferences from spectral indices the distribution of ndvi values across the major settlements within the onitsha area revealed lower value pixels within the low elevation areas of upper iweka and mgbuka this incidence of lower vegetation pixels mainly at upper iweka indicates decrease vegetation coverage and density it also indicates that most of the vegetation loss occurred within the watershed of the river niger a major inference from this vegetation density distribution is that the landscape of the watershed at the lower lying areas at upper iweka compared to mgbuka and nkpor is notably more vulnerable to being eroded due to the greater deficit of vegetation cover by implication the loss of protective vegetation cover and susceptibility to soil erosion at upper iweka highlights vulnerability to groundwater pollution due to the eroded lithological lining of subsurface soil kay et al 2007 studies have demonstrated the relationship between ndvi effects of land management on soil loss thus deemed suitable for estimating susceptibility of an area to soil erosion estimation carvalho et al 2014 the typical feature of urbanization marked by the removal of trees and vegetation and the proliferation of built up areas mcgrane 2016 necessitated the use of another well known complementary vegetation indices to the ndvi schell and deering 1973 i e soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 the tillage gradient from the ndti across sites within the onitcha area revealed greater tillage at the less urbanized areas at nkpor the higher ndti in this area highlights a greater magnitude of tillage activity bare soil and increased likelihood of fertilizers and pesticide applications zheng et al 2012 this in turn implies serious environmental risks arising from high erosion susceptibility greater incidence of nutrients in surface water and eventual infiltration into groundwater zheng et al 2014 however the negative values of ndti at upper iweka depict patches of poorly drained soils which is typical of areas with shallow water tables sonmez and slater 2016 depictions from the ndti also corroborates reports that urban areas are tended towards non agricultural activities meaning that the land use and land cover lulc trend of a region is a consequence of economic and social interactions mcintyre et al 2008 the exceptionally rapid rate of urbanization in recent decades has been linked with its distinct impact on both regional and global scales liu and lathrop jr 2002 owokotomo et al 2020 including loss of arable land lópez et al 2001 and adverse effects on groundwater status both quality and quantity graniel et al 1999 thus the greater ndbi index for the upper iweka area compared to mgbuka and nkpor portends greater urbanization intensity and higher risks of environmental degradation associated with it in particular increased erosion prone features like gullies in growing urban areas in developing climes demonstrates that urban social drive and a deteriorating geomorphic system are co evolving factors zolezzi et al 2018 4 5 multivariate correlation of urbanization and groundwater parameters from the ordination plot of the pca the groundwater samples from upper iweka showed strong positive associations with ndbi savi hg pb conductivity and faecal coliform this implies that the high metal hg pb and faecal coliform content could be attributed to the intensity of urbanization ndbi within this part of the onitcha region more importantly the negative relationship between the ndbi and ndvi strongly highlights that areas of the onitcha region with high ndbi will show marked land degradation and vulnerability to emerging geomorphological issues combined information from terrain analysis and vegetation indices have allowed insight into the erodibility potential of an area conrad et al 2006 kheir et al 2008 as such the low vegetation cover feature of the upper iweka area shows little resilience to severe incidences of land degradation in the event of high population growth and high rainfall intensity marker and sidorchuk 2003 geotechnical results from studies within the area have revealed that the soils around upper iweka show greater permeability are weak easily dispersible and collapsible with a high incidence of erosion in the area and increased vulnerability of groundwater to infiltration of contaminants egbueri and igwe 2020 the underlying nanka formation of upper iweka also explains its higher gullying tendencies than in areas underlain by the ogwashi and benin formations due to variations in their hydro geomorphological characteristics egbueri and igwe 2020 in essence marked physical modification of the earth surface typical of urbanized areas can result in radical changes in groundwater quality lerner and harris 2009 naik et al 2008 from the stronger positive association of the nkpor area with ndti and ndvi observed within the ordination plot it can first be inferred that the nkpor area has more vegetation cover however the co association between ndvi and ndti suggests that a tangible portion of this vegetation cover could be agricultural plants thus the positive relationship between water samples from the nkpor area and phosphates nitrates and high ph in groundwater samples strongly suggest the high fertilizer and pesticide applications within the area 4 6 health risk aspects from this study the non carcinogenic health risk estimates using the hq for metals hg pb cd at each site through heavy metals exposure for adults in upper iweka nkpor and mgbuka via oral and dermal exposure routes gave estimated values above the threshold value of 1 except for fe which was below 1 consequently the hazard index hi value estimated for the adult group upon ingestion exposure to contaminated groundwater via ingestion exceeded 1 σhq 1 this implies significant non cancer risks for populations consuming groundwater from the onitsha area with greater risks for residents located at nkpor compared to upper iweka and mgbuka concerning elevated levels of the toxic metal cd in groundwater samples obtained from this area higher intake of cadmium by the nkpor population portends high renal toxicity which is not only due to its mode of action but also to its irreversible accumulation in the kidney who 2004 the greater probability estimates derived from the monte carlo system portends increased risk for high levels of hg and pb through drinking water by adults from the various settlements in the order of upper iweka mgbuka nkpor acute mercury exposure has been implicated in incidences of diarrhoea fever and vomiting while chronic exposure which is a more likely situation through drinking water on the other hand could lead to stomatitis nausea nephritic syndrome pink disease neurasthenia and paralgesia and tremor hawkes 1997 on the other hand uptake of lead pb through drinking water triggers an imbalance in brain function in most children resulting in delayed physical and mental development toxicity outcomes in adults have been documented to include kidney problem like encephalopathy and proximal renal tubular damage in the unborn newborn and young children lead functions as a strong neurotoxin it even crosses the placenta easily causing cognitive and behavioural effects via toxic effects to both the peripheral and central nervous system who 2004 activities about intense urbanization including household plumbing systems i e pipes fittings solder and connections from the mains to homes have been implicated as major exposure routes to lead through water who 2003 who 2004 risk estimated for metals in groundwater for adults via dermal exposure routes showed that all hq estimated across settlements within the onitcha area were below the threshold value of 1 similarly hi estimates were also below 1 this indicates that dermal exposure to groundwater contaminated with cd hg and pb will not result in a non cancer effect findings were also complemented by the monte carlo estimate the mean value of 1 for hq estimates for the different areas indicates a zero probability for non cancer risk via dermal exposure this is consistent with explanations rendered by egbueri 2020 who also identified non carcinogenic hazards for adults through the ingestion of metal contaminated groundwater in the onitsha environment various other local and global studies have also documented potential non cancer risk to human s exposure to heavy metal contaminated groundwater via ingestion and dermal route chai et al 2010 duggal et al 2017 giri et al 2012 nkpaa et al 2018 5

general the higher values for most groundwater quality parameters observed at the urban site compared to the less urbanized areas portend greater health risks and hazard quotient for urban populations compared to the suburban populations we recommend that study findings could be harnessed to engage stakeholders in each city in a dialogue aimed at developing a consensus urban groundwater protection

the rapid urbanization phenomenon has put immense pressure on natural resources including groundwater goel et al 2018 odeloui et al 2016 although rising incidences of groundwater degradation in developing nations have received considerable attention henderson 2002 von der heyden and new 2004 its relationship to the concurrent rise in population densities the economic growth and modern lifestyle of urban inhabitants has become topical in estimating risks of such incidences ferreira et al 2018 henderson 2002 these changes in groundwater quality could vary considerably with geographical locations hydrogeological environment built up intensity and coverage of waterborne sewerage foster 2020 sharp 2010 as such handling and management of municipal wastes and sewage water in the sprawling urban dwellings constitute a very crucial issue in the sustainable management of water resources grodzińska jurczak 2001 mesjasz lech 2014 the marked infrastructural deficit of proper municipal waste disposal and sewerage systems are complicit in the incidences of severe groundwater contamination so much that the quality of groundwater is often traceable to the percolation of surface pollutants from septic tank leaks soak pits pit latrines domestic wastewater leaks leachates from solid waste dumps and sewage which enter groundwater table and affect the potability of groundwater mcmichael 2000 odey et al 2018 shaharoona et al 2019 thus prevailing land use patterns and integrity of subsurface layers morris et al 2003 schmoll et al 2006 affect groundwater quality

organic compounds pathogenic microorganisms and pharmaceuticals which migrate with rainwater through the subsurface into groundwater kuroda and fukushi 2008 leung and jiao 2006 although point data of

document which seeks to achieve a prosperous africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development highlights the need to address the challenges of rapid urbanization and access to necessities of life as part of its strategic approach auc 2015 deghetto et al 2016 indeed the lack of basic sanitation and waste management infrastructure constitutes a bane to the availability of potable groundwater as a basic necessity junior et al 2010 odey et al 2018 for eastern nigeria soil erosion particularly gully erosion is an outflow of rapid urbanization igbokwe and ayomaya 2004 which aggravates the vulnerability of groundwater urbanized areas junior et al 2010 thus we hypothesize that among other factors groundwater susceptibility to contaminants of anthropogenic origin could be higher in areas of concentrated built up areas and greater incidence of land degradation events like erosion to highlight areas of high risk to groundwater degradation and public health hazards it is necessary to mesh hydrogeological understanding and land use patterns using simple robust matrices thus this study undertakes a pollution risk assessment within the onitsha area measuring and presenting selected metals and physicochemical properties of borehole water from three metropolitan locations within onitcha area of anambra state 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area onitsha is sited proximal to the eastern bank of the niger river with a coverage of about 50 square kilometres this area links the eastern north south route via the niger bridge at onitsha with a significant population cluster and industrial activity located within and around this transportation axis its marked patterns of urban expansion highlights it as one of the four main potential industrial and commercial growth areas in nigeria sha ato et al 2007 three settlement areas under consideration for this study include upper iweka is located under onitsha north local government area with coordinates 6 10n 6 47e with an estimated population of 261 604 nkpor suburban settlement is located west of onitsha with an estimated population of about 109 377 predominantly agrarian with focus on major crops particularly yam cassava rice maize cocoyam cowpea and tomatoes ijioma and osondu 2015 mgbuka a place in obosi which is attached to the south of onitsha had an estimated population of 144 203 as of 2007 iloeje 1965 the eastern nigeria area is marked by the anambra basin of the benue trough with predominant occurrence of clastic sediments and distinct lithostratigraphic units with varied widths up to 2500 m reyment 1965 geologic formations which define the extensive urban area of onitsha includes the ogwashi asaba formation with a thickness of a few millimeters to a maximum of 6 m which largely underlies the nnewi area while the ameki formation and nanka sands with a thickness ranging from 50 to 300 m underlies the upper iweka area down to mgbuka obosi axis of the onitsha area arinze et al 2015 chiaghanam et al 2014 appendix i 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis in this study groundwater samples n 120 from sixty boreholes tapping into aquifers spanning major settlement clusters at upper iweka mgbuka and nkpor were sampled over 5 months from august to december 2019 fig 1 and analyzed glassware sampling bottles were washed and rinsed before sample collection the average depth of all boreholes sampled was 85 m at each site groundwater samples were analyzed for the ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do using standard procedures of water analysis apha 1998 in brief water samples for chemical analysis were filtered through a hand held hanna filter system using a 0 45 μm cellulose filter paper advantec mfs inc and collected in a 500 ml clean hdpe bottle two 125 ml aliquots were collected at each site one unacidified and the other acidified to ph 2 using ultrapure nitric acid the samples were then refrigerated at 4 c before chemical analysis for microbial analysis samples collected in sterile bottles was analyzed by the pour plating method using the serial dilution technique bartram and ballance 1996 the faecal coliform analysis was carried out using the most probable number mpn method apha 1998 2 3 digestion of samples three millilitres of each of the samples were measured and transferred into a boiling tube labelled a b and c respectively to each sample 3 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid was added 3 ml of hydrogen peroxide was also added to the sample and allowed to stand for 10 15 min the sample in the boiling tube was clamped on a retort stand the clamped boiling tube on the retort stand was heated in a heating mantle for 45 50 min and allowed to cool down the samples were further treated with 1 ml of hydrogen peroxide to help give clear sample digestion the digested sample was filtered with whatman no 45 filter paper and the filtrate collected into a 4 ml sample tube on the other hand the determination of the concentration of mercury in water samples was achieved by slightly modifying the cold vapour technique described by omang 1971 total mercury was reduced to metallic form when it could be volatilized by aeration and measured digested samples were diluted up to 25 ml with distilled water while an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with air acetylene flame was used to determine the concentrations of trace elements except for mercury where a cold vapour technique after wet washing was used 2 4 determination of phosphate groundwater phosphate levels were estimated using the method described by murphy and riley 1962 and apha 2005 water samples were mixed with a solvent containing 1 mil of ammonium molybdate and 0 4 ml of hydrazine sulphate distilled water was added to the resulting solution to form an extract which was heated for 30mins in a water bath exact values for phosphate levels were determined using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uvmini 1240 v at 882 nm wavelength 2 5 determination of nitrates groundwater nitrate levels from onitsha area were estimated using method described by apha 2005 50 ml of filtered water sample and standard nitrate solution was placed in separate 250 ml beakers 1 ml of hcl was added to each beaker and mixed thoroughly with a stirrer the absorbance of the nitrate standard was read at 225 nm while that of ground water samples were read at 225 nm and 275 nm in an attempt to differentiate interference from organics the absorbance due to nitrate ion was obtained by subtracting absorbance of samples 225 nm from 275 nm while concentration was obtained from the nitrate standard curve all standards and chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich chemieor fluka chemie ag buchs switzerland 2 6 heavy metal analysis 1 ml of the collected filtrate was injected into atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas analyser and the reading of each metal tested was taken from the output screen ademoroti 1996 2 7 quality control and assurance buck certified atomic absorption standard was used to calibrate the equipment for the heavy metals of concern in this study to attain a calibration curve while a shimadzu uvmini 1240 v spectrophotometer was used to obtained concentrations of phosphorus and nitrate in ground water samples after every five batches of samples analysis standard reference materials were used to monitor variations from the calibration standard and eliminate equipment drift atobatele and olutona 2015 all samples were analyzed more than once to ensure result exactness and accuracy 2 8 geospatial analysis interpolation of groundwater parameters data was performed using arcgis software using inverse distance weighted idw kriging option based on a linear combination of closely related values meng et al 2013 prior to this observation wells and parameter concentrations were represented by point shapefile vector and converted to raster through interpolation 2 9 spectral indices to estimate the intensity of built up features at each location within the onitcha area the sentinel 2 a high temporal resolution imagery imageries were applied to indices specific for estimating manmade surfaces gadal and ouerghemmi 2019 kuc and chormański 2019 built up areas mapping with vegetation index urbanization is typically marked by the removal of trees and vegetation and the proliferation of built up areas mcgrane 2016 thus two well known vegetation indices the ndvi schell and deering 1973 and the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 were examined in the mapping of built up features within the onitsha area the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well documented remote sensed procedure for monitoring vegetation dynamics i e vegetation greenness density and fragmentation of landscape types including forest rangeland farmland and urban areas lo and faber 1997 wilson and lindsey 2005 the formulas for ndvi and savi according to zhao et al 2012 are given in

estimation for populations who rely on groundwater as a viable source of water for various activities was determined using risk assessment indices proposed by usepa 2001 risk estimation covered intake routes i e direct ingestion drinking inhalation and dermal contact uptake via bathing giri and singh 2015 ogbeide et al 2019 in this study ingestion and dermal contact will be considered the average daily dose add was used to estimate the risk of metals in groundwater to humans papadakis et al 2015 two major routes of exposures were considered including ingestion and dermal routes formulas presented in equation 5and 6 were used to obtain add estimates for both ingestion and dermal routes respectively 5 add ingestion cw ir water e f ed bw at 6 add dermal cw sa kp e f ed bw at where add is the daily exposure while the concentration of metals mg l in water samples is cw table 1 provides the further description and values for other parameters used in these equations because slope factor sf isn t available for selected metals only non carcinogenic risk was considered in this study 7 h a z a r d q u o t i e n t h q e x p r f d the reference dose rfd for each metal refers to a numerical estimate of daily exposure that is not likely to cause harmful effects during the lifetime of a human rfd used in this study was obtained from the usa risk based concentration table usepa 1992 2011 hazard quotient hq for exposure to each metal was determined using add estimates estimates of total hazard quotient thq found to be above 1 indicates the possibility that there is a potential for non carcinogenic health effects while thq estimates 1 implies that there is no potential for non carcinogenic health effects kavcar et al 2009 ogbeide et al 2019 carcinogenic risk determination is based on the assumption that a small number of molecular events can elicit mutations in a single cell causing self replicating damage and ultimately carcinogenic endpoints in principle this is described as a non threshold effect because all levels of exposure have a likelihood capability of generating a response however noncarcinogenic changes are marked by thresholds particularly dose levels below which a response is unlikely due to cellular adaptations against toxic events haber et al 2001 2 11 probabilistic risk assessment due to incidences of accuracy in the use of deterministic risk estimates and inability to account for uncertainties that can affect risk decision thompson and graham 1996 a probabilistic risk determination was done using monte carlo simulations mcs the importance of this method is anchored on its use of the probability density function for the output in understanding the environmental behaviour of contaminants while taking into account uncertainties that exist cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019 for the study data monte carlo simulations were conducted with 1 000 000 iterations using the commercially available companion 5 3 by minitab version 18 this software was used to assign probability distributions for each variable presented in table 1 and estimate uncertainties in risk assessment 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties groundwater samples measures of physicochemical properties across the urban sites revealed all sites revealed low acidic ph with mean values falling below the who tolerance limits samples from upper iweka revealed significantly lower acidic values compared to other urban sites similarly conductivity was significantly higher at upper iweka at about 2 3 fold more compared to other sites mgbuka showed significantly lower levels of tds while levels of do did not significantly differ across urban sites 3 2 the concentration of metals in water samples mercury in groundwater across the urban sites examined revealed that all sites exceeded acceptable limits specified by who however significantly highest levels were recorded at upper iweka 0 122 0 03 mg l while levels recorded at nkpor 0 062 0 006 mg l and mgbuka 0 078 0 01 mg l similarly concentrations of pb in groundwater from upper iweka 0 115 0 014 mg l exceeded acceptable limits by who and was also significantly higher than values recorded from other urban sites at nkpor 0 005 1 00 e 03 mg l and mgbuka 0 039 0 007 mg l levels of pb in groundwater at nkpor showed significantly lowest levels compared to other urban sites the mean concentration of cadmium across all urban sites exceeded acceptable limits by who however mean levels recorded at nkpor area was significantly higher than all other sites mean levels at upper iweka and mgbuka did not significantly differ levels of iron across all urban sites did not exceed who acceptable limits however significantly higher levels were recorded at mgbuka compared to other sites fig 2 fig 4 table 2 3 3 multivariate analysis from the ordination plot of the pca the groundwater samples from upper iweka showed strong associations with ndbi savi hg pb conductivity and faecal coliform the strong negative relationship between nkpor settlement and ndbi indicates that it is the least urbanized settlement within the onitcha area while the location of mgbuka within the ordination plot depicts its intermediate urbanization or built up intensity compared to upper iweka and nkpor the stronger association of the nkpor area with ndti and ndvi was also observed alongside associations with metals cd fe phosphates nitrates low ph and high tds in groundwater samples fig 5 3 4 risk characterization of metals in groundwater from selected location in onitsha metropolis both deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to characterize noncarcinogenic risks of heavy metals in groundwater samples in onitsha metropolis and results are presented in tables 3 and 4 alongside figs 6 and 7 in upper iweka deterministic estimates of human health risk for the metal in groundwater samples showed average daily dose add values for hg pb and cd were above the recommended reference dose when considering the ingestion route of exposure table 3 consequently the total hazard quotient thq for all metals were above the threshold value of 1 when considering the dermal route add estimates for cd hg and pb were below their respective reference doses table 4 furthermore hq values for each metal were above the threshold value of 1 similar results were observed in nkpor where estimated add values for each metal was below rfd values when considering the dermal route of exposure while only hg and pb were above their respective rfd values hazard index values for estimated for nkpor was found to be greater than upper iweka and mgbuka respectively for ingestion exposure route while for dermal exposure route upper iweka was greater than nkpor and mgbuka respectively probabilistic estimates for heavy metals in groundwater from onitsha via ingestion route showed that upper iweka had the highest hq 3 262 followed by mgbuka 2 1233 and nkpor 2 0187 on the other hand estimates showed that mgbuka had the highest hq 0 0241 followed by nkpor 0 016 and upper iweka 0 014 for dermal exposure routes probability estimates using the monte carlo system figs 6 7 showed the increased risk to adults upon ingestion of groundwater contaminated with metals was observed in upper iweka followed by mgbuka and nkpor on the other hand risk estimated for metals in groundwater for adults via dermal exposure routes showed that all hq estimated were below the threshold value of 1 similarly hi estimates were also below 1 this indicates that dermal exposure to groundwater contaminated with cd hg and pb will not result in a non cancer effect this was supported by the monte carlo estimate presented in figs 6 7 hq estimates for all regions showed a mean value less than 1 indicating that there was no probability for non cancer risk via dermal exposure 3 5 probabilistic risk assessment of metals in ground water 4 discussion 4 1 urbanization and groundwater vulnerability the extent to which groundwater quality is impacted is directed related to the vulnerability of underlying aquifers to pollution alongside the type and stage of urban development ellis 1999 the higher built up index values recorded for the upper iweka area gives a direct reflection of the densely populated status of this area this implies a significant presence of man made structures and activities e g landfills leaking sewers pit latrines transportation routes in excavated areas and highway drainage that introduce pollutants directly into the unsaturated or even saturated zones of aquifers igbokwe and ayomaya 2004 okafor et al 2007 it then follows that for largely un sewered cities like onitsha a significant proportion of wastewater can seep into groundwater resources this is most likely to be the case in areas underlain with largely sandy unconsolidated and thus highly permeable stratum within nanka formations in regions with a more consolidated soil profile a greater proportion of urban drainage and wastewater will normally be directed to surface watercourses because of the generally lower infiltration and storage capacity of the ground consequently the contaminant seepages due to urbanization will be more spectacular and significant at upper iweka urban area compared to other urban areas of onitsha egbueri and igwe 2020 in addition the lower elevation of the upper iweka urban area also implies greater susceptibility to groundwater contamination studies have also demonstrated the vulnerability of shallow geology areas to effects of urbanization on groundwater foster and skinner 1995 aside the high built up index values recorded for the upper iweka area the higher contaminant concentrations in groundwater from this area could be attributed to susceptibility of the area to hydrogeomorphic disturbances via erosion events compared to other urban areas the nanka ogwashi and benin formations which predominantly underlie southwards of anambra state appendix i are both vulnerable to hydrogeomorphic factors that contribute to events of gully erosion but areas marked by extensive nanka formation are notable for a higher gullying intensity egbueri and igwe 2020 runoff from drainage from major highways and industrial patios similar to upper iweka also increase the likelihood of groundwater pollution by hydrocarbon fuels and industrial chemical spillages müller et al 2020 furthermore the absence of sewerage and prevalence of in situ or septic tank sanitation in densely populated settlements of urban areas of developing countries increase the likelihood of pathogenic bacteria and viruses occurring in groundwater lewis et al 1982 foster 1985 from the elevation map fig 3 the upper iweka area because of its flat slopes and closeness to the river bank watershed makes it a high vulnerability area this is attributable to the erosion prone features typical of such which include friable and less compacted soil higher precipitation and lower depth to groundwater oke 2020 which increases its susceptibility to migratory pollutants and pathogens infiltrating from topsoil into groundwater egboka and okpoko 1984 as such the lower groundwater risk areas would be areas of the basin that are characterized by thick vadose zones at higher elevations and high depth to groundwater often farther from river watersheds oke 2020 4 2 physicochemical properties of groundwater the low ph acidic ph observed across urban sites of onitsha implies reduced adsorption of metals to the earth s crust and greater bioavailability in drinking water which will portend greater exposure and hazards to human health this is because most metals of concern in groundwater quality are cations e g pb2 cu2 ni2 cd2 and precipitate when ph values of water are higher the general occurrence of acidification of soil and water in the onitsha area could be due to anthropogenic causes linked to the use of fossil fuels in industry and high vehicular emissions due to high traffic within these areas knutsson 1994 studies have demonstrated that groundwater in which acidification processes attains a drop in ph to around or below 5 have attained a very critical stage of acidification and inherently indicate that concentrations of aluminum nitrate and sulphate would be considerably high with the increased dissolution of some heavy metals e g cadmium elsewhere groundwaters in such a state have been considered unsuitable for drinking knutsson 1994 the higher conductivity at the upper iweka settlement where ph was lowest within the onitsha area also corroborates the fact that the water samples contain high levels of precipitated metals and anions in solution adeogun et al 2012 a greater concern is that metals in naturally or anthropogenically acidified groundwaters as observed for upper iweka are more mobile and can travel long distances within the groundwater continuum schmoll et al 2006 most groundwaters with a nearly neutral ph show limited solubility of metal cations due to ease of precipitation as an oxide hydroxide carbonate or phosphate mineral or increased likelihood to become strongly adsorbed to hydrous metal oxides clay or organic matter in the aquifer matrix who 2016 the higher values of nutrients levels i e nitrates and phosphorus in the less built up area at nkpor compared to the more intense built up areas at mgbuka and upper iweka highlights the contribution of intense agricultural activity to groundwater quality within the area the impact of agriculture on water pollution could be problematic in catchments where arable fields dominate with increased likelihood of high nitrogen fertilizers application rates increasing the groundwater pollution lawniczak et al 2016 mahvi et al 2005 smolders et al 2010 the significantly higher concentration of faecal coliforms in groundwater from the more urbanized areas at upper iweka implicates infiltrations from cultivated watersheds and seepages of high volume untreated human sewage due to poor or totally absent sanitary infrastructure studies have demonstrated that altered hydrology due to poorly designed and or constructed water supply and wastewater channels creates a localized pathway and a rapid bypass mechanism for microbes through the protective subsurface layer into groundwater lawrence et al 2001 considering the backdrop of the above localized practices that put severe stress on the quality of groundwater the role of hydrogeological parameters in determining likelihood of contamination has also been highlighted elsewhere pujari et al 2012 4 3 metals in groundwater and potential sources the generally higher trend of heavy metals in groundwater in the more built up areas at upper iweka can be readily attributed to the marked urbanization and industrialization activities associated with areas with more built up features idrees et al 2018 singh et al 2011 in addition surface runoff from more urbanized catchments are laden with a higher load of suspended solids and metals particularly pb cd and cr egodawatta et al 2009 huang et al 2007 instances of lead concentrations exceeding environmental limits in urban runoff was attributed to pollutant laden highway runoff tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 and roof materials davis and burns 1999 more specifically the levels of mercury recorded across settlements within the onitcha area exceeded acceptable limits with the highest concentrations at the more urbanized site at upper iweka these elevated concentrations of mercury hg in groundwater could be linked to industrial contamination or mining activities rytuba 2000 somasundaram et al 1993 and rarely to natural sources sidle 1993 localized hg groundwater contamination in urban areas originating from both inactive and active industrial sources has been identified as a more frequent scenario across many geographical areas with fewer instances of groundwater contamination of groundwater due to multiple potentially small point sources somasundaram et al 1993 the higher levels of iron in groundwater from the relatively less urbanized area at mgbuka may be attributed to sewage and landfill leachate streams which are notable contributors of iron to local groundwater huang et al 2015 in addition increased dissolution of ferrous borehole and handpump components common in developing countries could augment the contributions of iron from major sources 4 4 urbanization and vegetation cover inferences from spectral indices the distribution of ndvi values across the major settlements within the onitsha area revealed lower value pixels within the low elevation areas of upper iweka and mgbuka this incidence of lower vegetation pixels mainly at upper iweka indicates decrease vegetation coverage and density it also indicates that most of the vegetation loss occurred within the watershed of the river niger a major inference from this vegetation density distribution is that the landscape of the watershed at the lower lying areas at upper iweka compared to mgbuka and nkpor is notably more vulnerable to being eroded due to the greater deficit of vegetation cover by implication the loss of protective vegetation cover and susceptibility to soil erosion at upper iweka highlights vulnerability to groundwater pollution due to the eroded lithological lining of subsurface soil kay et al 2007 studies have demonstrated the relationship between ndvi effects of land management on soil loss thus deemed suitable for estimating susceptibility of an area to soil erosion estimation carvalho et al 2014 the typical feature of urbanization marked by the removal of trees and vegetation and the proliferation of built up areas mcgrane 2016 necessitated the use of another well known complementary vegetation indices to the ndvi schell and deering 1973 i e soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 the tillage gradient from the ndti across sites within the onitcha area revealed greater tillage at the less urbanized areas at nkpor the higher ndti in this area highlights a greater magnitude of tillage activity bare soil and increased likelihood of fertilizers and pesticide applications zheng et al 2012 this in turn implies serious environmental risks arising from high erosion susceptibility greater incidence of nutrients in surface water and eventual infiltration into groundwater zheng et al 2014 however the negative values of ndti at upper iweka depict patches of poorly drained soils which is typical of areas with shallow water tables sonmez and slater 2016 depictions from the ndti also corroborates reports that urban areas are tended towards non agricultural activities meaning that the land use and land cover lulc trend of a region is a consequence of economic and social interactions mcintyre et al 2008 the exceptionally rapid rate of urbanization in recent decades has been linked with its distinct impact on both regional and global scales liu and lathrop jr 2002 owokotomo et al 2020 including loss of arable land lópez et al 2001 and adverse effects on groundwater status both quality and quantity graniel et al 1999 thus the greater ndbi index for the upper iweka area compared to mgbuka and nkpor portends greater urbanization intensity and higher risks of environmental degradation associated with it in particular increased erosion prone features like gullies in growing urban areas in developing climes demonstrates that urban social drive and a deteriorating geomorphic system are co evolving factors zolezzi et al 2018 4 5 multivariate correlation of urbanization and groundwater parameters from the ordination plot of the pca the groundwater samples from upper iweka showed strong positive associations with ndbi savi hg pb conductivity and faecal coliform this implies that the high metal hg pb and faecal coliform content could be attributed to the intensity of urbanization ndbi within this part of the onitcha region more importantly the negative relationship between the ndbi and ndvi strongly highlights that areas of the onitcha region with high ndbi will show marked land degradation and vulnerability to emerging geomorphological issues combined information from terrain analysis and vegetation indices have allowed insight into the erodibility potential of an area conrad et al 2006 kheir et al 2008 as such the low vegetation cover feature of the upper iweka area shows little resilience to severe incidences of land degradation in the event of high population growth and high rainfall intensity marker and sidorchuk 2003 geotechnical results from studies within the area have revealed that the soils around upper iweka show greater permeability are weak easily dispersible and collapsible with a high incidence of erosion in the area and increased vulnerability of groundwater to infiltration of contaminants egbueri and igwe 2020 the underlying nanka formation of upper iweka also explains its higher gullying tendencies than in areas underlain by the ogwashi and benin formations due to variations in their hydro geomorphological characteristics egbueri and igwe 2020 in essence marked physical modification of the earth surface typical of urbanized areas can result in radical changes in groundwater quality lerner and harris 2009 naik et al 2008 from the stronger positive association of the nkpor area with ndti and ndvi observed within the ordination plot it can first be inferred that the nkpor area has more vegetation cover however the co association between ndvi and ndti suggests that a tangible portion of this vegetation cover could be agricultural plants thus the positive relationship between water samples from the nkpor area and phosphates nitrates and high ph in groundwater samples strongly suggest the high fertilizer and pesticide applications within the area 4 6 health risk aspects from this study the non carcinogenic health risk estimates using the hq for metals hg pb cd at each site through heavy metals exposure for adults in upper iweka nkpor and mgbuka via oral and dermal exposure routes gave estimated values above the threshold value of 1 except for fe which was below 1 consequently the hazard index hi value estimated for the adult group upon ingestion exposure to contaminated groundwater via ingestion exceeded 1 σhq 1 this implies significant non cancer risks for populations consuming groundwater from the onitsha area with greater risks for residents located at nkpor compared to upper iweka and mgbuka concerning elevated levels of the toxic metal cd in groundwater samples obtained from this area higher intake of cadmium by the nkpor population portends high renal toxicity which is not only due to its mode of action but also to its irreversible accumulation in the kidney who 2004 the greater probability estimates derived from the monte carlo system portends increased risk for high levels of hg and pb through drinking water by adults from the various settlements in the order of upper iweka mgbuka nkpor acute mercury exposure has been implicated in incidences of diarrhoea fever and vomiting while chronic exposure which is a more likely situation through drinking water on the other hand could lead to stomatitis nausea nephritic syndrome pink disease neurasthenia and paralgesia and tremor hawkes 1997 on the other hand uptake of lead pb through drinking water triggers an imbalance in brain function in most children resulting in delayed physical and mental development toxicity outcomes in adults have been documented to include kidney problem like encephalopathy and proximal renal tubular damage in the unborn newborn and young children lead functions as a strong neurotoxin it even crosses the placenta easily causing cognitive and behavioural effects via toxic effects to both the peripheral and central nervous system who 2004 activities about intense urbanization including household plumbing systems i e pipes fittings solder and connections from the mains to homes have been implicated as major exposure routes to lead through water who 2003 who 2004 risk estimated for metals in groundwater for adults via dermal exposure routes showed that all hq estimated across settlements within the onitcha area were below the threshold value of 1 similarly hi estimates were also below 1 this indicates that dermal exposure to groundwater contaminated with cd hg and pb will not result in a non cancer effect findings were also complemented by the monte carlo estimate the mean value of 1 for hq estimates for the different areas indicates a zero probability for non cancer risk via dermal exposure this is consistent with explanations rendered by egbueri 2020 who also identified non carcinogenic hazards for adults through the ingestion of metal contaminated groundwater in the onitsha environment various other local and global studies have also documented potential non cancer risk to human s exposure to heavy metal contaminated groundwater via ingestion and dermal route chai et al 2010 duggal et al 2017 giri et al 2012 nkpaa et al 2018 5 conclusion this study compared the groundwater quality along an urban gradient within a metropolitan settlement in south east nigeria and showed principal groundwater contaminants of concern in urban areas to be nitrates pb and hg higher incidence of nutrients in groundwater of less urbanized areas suggests impacts of fertilizer applications from greater agricultural activity probabilistic estimates for heavy metals in ground water from onitsha via ingestion route showed hq in the order of iweka mgbuka nkpor while dermal exposure routes showed risks order of mgbuka nkpor upper iweka in general the higher values for most groundwater quality parameters observed at the urban site compared to the less urbanized areas portend greater health risks and hazard quotient for urban populations compared to the suburban populations we recommend that study findings could be harnessed to engage stakeholders in each city in a dialogue aimed at developing a consensus urban groundwater protection

11931,this review paper closely explores the techniques and significances of the most potent artificial intelligence ai approaches in a concise and integrated way specifically in the groundwater quality modelling and forecasting for its suitability in domestic usage this paper systematically provides an extensive review of the four most used ai methods artificial neural network ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis evolutionary algorithm ea and support vector machine svm to reflect on the features and abilities while defining the greatest challenges throughout the process of providing desired results analysis among the four ai methods found that ann performed better when handling a large number of data sets and accurately made predictions due to its ability to model complex non linear and complex relationships despite some weaknesses the findings of this review demonstrate that the successful adoption of ai models is impacted by the appropriateness of input consideration types of individual functions the efficiency of performance metrics etc the outcomes from this study will be beneficial for groundwater development plans and contribute to the improvement of the ai applications in groundwater quality recommendations are presented in this study to strengthen the knowledge development towards improving the modelling structure in the mentioned area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater monitoring groundwater parameters statistical modelling artificial intelligence artificial neural network 1 introduction over the past century water scarcity has been the critical issue globally due to climate change growth of population urbanisation and intensive farming kundzewicz 1997 in response to this issue the groundwater resources are alternatively used for various practices including agricultural industrial and household activities however the rising global demand for water has led to over exploitation of groundwater and deterioration of the quality of groundwater the degradation of groundwater quality is greatly influenced by both natural factors seawater intrusion and rock water leaching interaction and anthropogenic factors mining industrial contamination excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides and domestic sewage which affect the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater nourbakhsh et al 2016 tirkey et al 2017 groundwater contamination has caused adverse impacts on the availability and suitability of groundwater and is harmful to human health furthermore it is expensive and time consuming to clean up contaminated groundwater because of the complex groundwater systems and the invisible threat of groundwater contaminations thus groundwater quality assessment and monitoring are highly necessary concerning the potential risk of groundwater contamination and its effects on suitability for human consumption the main principles in efficiently managing and improving groundwater quality are the accurate and reliable forecast of the groundwater resource information where better understanding of the hydrogeological process and behaviour is fundamental li et al 2012a singh et al 2014 however the complex and changeable characteristics of the hydrogeological system require specific tools to develop such predictions among the various approaches groundwater modelling has proven to be a convenient tool to understand the groundwater systems and identify the current groundwater threats bachmat et al 1978 the development of prediction modelling for the short term and long term is crucial to sustain the use and help to reflect on the implications for future groundwater supply typically the classical methods such as conceptual and numerical groundwater models have been applied to predict the varying hydrogeological condition and processes based on the profound knowledge of the observed dynamic behaviour sufficient and proper data for the calibration and validation of the hydrological system are necessary to define the model prediction accuracy and reliability gao and li 2014 however there are a number of limitations to those techniques such as the large number of input parameters needed through the modelling process in the meantime many models are not able to deal with and quantify the predictive hydrogeological uncertainties and non linearity the failure to recognise and evaluate uncertainties and non linearity can result in improper representation of the actual system which contributes to the poor performance of groundwater model and degrades forecasting accuracy guzman et al 2015 the mentioned limitations have led researchers to make use of artificial intelligence ai as an alternative tool for complex nonlinear hydrological modelling due to its ability to cope with the tremendous amount of data remesan and mathew 2015 in recent decades various types of ai particularly artificial neural network ann and fuzzy logic are widely used in modelling in engineering and sciences the evolutions and the applications of artificial intelligence in predicting and monitoring groundwater quality and quantity are rapidly growing khaki et al 2015 mirabbasi 2015 barzegar et al 2016 sakizadeh 2016 bagheri et al 2017 ai offers advantages in reducing the time needed for data sampling and its ability to identify the nonlinear patterns of input and output is more reliable compared to the other classical statistical methods ay and ozyildirim 2018 therefore the high accuracy and stability of ai structure in simulating the complex groundwater systems has attracted the interest of many researchers this review aims to evaluate the state of the art and ascertain the effectiveness of ai tools for groundwater quality assessment this paper concentrates on the most common and active applications of ai in predicting the suitability of groundwater quality for domestic use which include ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis evolutionary algorithm ea and support vector machine svm the review will be focused on the conceptual frameworks and basic theory of ai approach for predicting groundwater quality section 2 in section 3 the performance and accuracy of various ai applications have been reviewed comprehensively the recommendations for future research are discussed in section 4 2 artificial intelligence techniques in groundwater quality assessment 2 1 artificial neural network ann is the simplified image of the mathematical model driven by a biological neural network that simulates the human cognitive abilities haykin 1994 fausett 1994 distinguished the neural network by the connection patterns or architecture of the nodes connection weight configuration methods and the activation function ann is a computational model that is proficient in machine learning pattern recognition optimization and content addressable memory jain et al 1996 besaw and rizzo 2007 ann models consist of at least three layers of interconnected neurons with one or several hidden layers an output and an input layer as shown in fig 1 the parallel distributed processor of anns processes the information from the input to the output through a network structure of interconnected nodes the input data computed in the input layer and the output layer correspond to network response of the existing database or known input pattern kheradpisheh et al 2015 the intermediate or hidden layer plays an important role in representing and computing complicated associations between patterns among the various types of anns back propagation neural network bpnn levenberg marquardt back propagation lmbp and multilayer perceptron mlp algorithms are the most implemented in groundwater modelling due to their accuracy feed forward neural network ffnn is a simple algorithm where the information passes in one direction from the input nodes through the hidden nodes to output nodes wasserman 1989 determined that the bpnn is fundamental in training a neural network to find global minima using statistical method lmbp was created by coupling the less sensitive levenberg marquardt algorithm to the sensitive back propagation algorithm which optimizes the balance between training speed and accuracy of the predictive model ma et al 2010 mlp is known for its effectiveness in predictive model performance using feed forward learning erdogan and geckinli 2003 mlp is able to generalize non linear mapping of input and output variables when there is little known or no training data matignon 2005 radial basis function rbf is the simplest structure of neural network it is composed of conventional approximation theory and was introduced by broomhead and lowe 1988 rbf is the other form of mlp with only a single hidden layer and faster training speed compared to mlp researchers have been actively using ann in hydrology hydraulics and water resources management for water and groundwater level and quality forecasting sediment modelling rainfall runoff estimation and flood management maier and dandy 1996 dawson and wilby 1998 campolo et al 2003 kuo et al 2004 minns and hall 2009 sreekanth et al 2009 shuai et al 2010 ghuman et al 2011 mustafa et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 considering the effectiveness of ann applications in predicting hydrochemical and hydrogeological parameters ann is extensively applied to groundwater modelling singh et al 2004 trichakis et al 2010 yu and liu 2012 ranjithan et al 1993 used the three layer ffnn for identifying the spatial distribution and degree variation of hydraulic conductivity in aquifer remediation those authors found that pattern recognition in ann is particularly useful to distinguish the uncertainty compared to the conventional ann various realizations of pumping were identified by applying back propagation algorithms to a solute transport model rogers and dowla 1994 quasi newton method for non linear optimization problem was proposed in that study resulting in more statistically significant and consistent simulations the unsupervised neural network called self organizing map som is an effective computational mapping tool that uses ffnn approach to conceptually visualize a logical network topology of the output data through the dimension reduction process kohonen 1982 sanchez martos et al 2002 has applied the som methods to evaluate groundwater quality temperature clˉ so₄2 hco₃ˉ no₃ˉ na mg2 ca2 and total dissolved solids tds were selected as input variables considering hydrogeochemical processes that took place in a semiarid area clˉ and so₄2ˉ are used to model the presence of seawater in a confined aquifer system yamanaka and kumagai 2006 som provides a simple interpretation of parameter data in the form of the activation map each value of a parameter in the activation maps was extracted by derived quadrat system the application of som in hydrogeochemical systems is possible due to its ability to interpret data from input and output relationship and store the information in the mathematical expression roussinov and chen 1999 however som application requires the specific and sufficient data to develop a significant cluster tjaden and cohen 2006 the lack of data results in the randomness of grouping and incorrect evaluation especially in nonlinear modelling ray and klindworth 2000 proposed a general bpnn combined with a feed forward neural network ffbp in evaluating groundwater pollution in countryside private wells the models were separated into nitrate contamination and pesticide contamination input parameters were the depth of land surface to the aquifer well depth and distance from cropland the purpose of bpnn implementation is to modify and minimise the weight of error in the feed forward neural network to produce the desired output of prediction accuracy kvaal and mcewan 1996 the trial and error method was applied to find significant input parameters consequently the presence of each parameter was impacted by the type of wells kuo et al 2004 investigated groundwater quality variation in the blackfoot disease area in taiwan using a bpnn the implications of hidden neuron number and learning performance of different input variables for saltwater intrusion and arsenic pollution were evaluated the input variables used for saltwater intrusion were electrical conductivity ec clˉ so₄2ˉ k and mg2 while the variables for arsenic pollution were alkalinity alk arsenic as and total organic carbon toc in this study root mean square error rmse was calculated to evaluate the model performance of ann the performance of ann was not affected by the higher number of hidden neurons but finding the optimal number of hidden layers is important in generalisation neuron mezard and nadal 1989 the current and previous input data are crucial for an accurate and reliable forecast typically the standard bpnn has a slower convergence rate hence the training for large and complicated datasets tends to get trapped at poor local minima hamed et al 2004 to improve the performance of bpnn the second order method is needed which is the utilization of levenberg marquardt lm proposed by hagan and menhaj 1994 and sivanandam et al 2005 yesilnacar et al 2008 developed a computational model based learning system for nitrate prediction in shallow aquifers using the lmbp algorithm four input parameters were used in the simulations ph temperature ec and groundwater level the tan sigmoid transfer function was applied in the hidden layer while the linear transfer function was implemented in the output layer of the two layer network el din and smith 2002 suggested a single hidden layer is acceptable in model simulation but an additional hidden layer facilitates complex function approximation with optimal connections weight toth et al 2000 while selecting the best fitting bpnn the number of neurons was set to be 20 with the constant learning rate and momentum of 0 1 and 0 9 respectively according to hagan et al 1997 momentum allows the network to slide through a shallow local minimum among the 12 bpnns minimum training error and maximum r of the lm algorithm made trainlm the best fitting bpnn the implementation of lm minimised gradient descent convergence rate and the sum of squared error increases the rate of efficiency of the bpnn algorithms in solving a convex optimization error in non linear systems nash and sofer 1996 according to yesilnacar et al 2008 ec was found to be the most critical input parameter kumar 2010 investigated the performance of bpnn to assess groundwater quality indices in india kriging method was used to map ion concentrations in groundwater the trainlm function was used to train the bpnn input variables of clˉ so₄2ˉ and alkalinity and desired output of ph ec na ca2 mg2 and k were used in bpnn model development the dataset was evaluated for pre monsoon and post monsoon where the sampling took place from 2006 to 2008 in achieving the optimum architecture of ann the numbers of hidden neurons and layers were changed to handle the non linearity in the input data the configuration number was decided to be 50 neurons for every two hidden layers the architecture of 4 50 50 6 gave a small value of correlation coefficient and high uniform distribution mean error to the desired data from the analysis of the concentrations of cations and anions quality of groundwater from 79 sampling wells was validated as safe for human consumption the authors indicate that ec was a crucial parameter in model development zhaoxian and yuling 2011 identified the effectiveness of the rbf to develop a multilayer feed forward neural network of groundwater quality ten input parameters were selected based on water quality the optimal network structure of rbf was determined by adding or deleting the hidden nodes according to node activity rate and mutual information the results demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting the groundwater quality gis was used to visualize the spatial distribution in the grading system rbf offers a lower number of iterations due to increase in convergence speed higher prediction accuracy and stability compared to bpnn moradkhani et al 2004 the random selection of the number of neurons may cause an over fitting or under fitting problem which leads to poor model performance the trial and error mechanism is generally applied to evaluate the optimal structure relevant learning rate parameter and momentum chang et al 2011 kheradpisheh et al 2015 employed a trial and error rule in predicting the proper number of hidden neurons and constructing an optimal structure of bpnn modelling and simulating complex environmental systems in ann can be done using simple shells seyam and mogheir 2011 li et al 2012b however the accurate selection of input variables significantly influences the development of data driven models especially for non linear hydrologic model analysis maier and dandy 2000 fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 in the study kheradpisheh et al 2015 set the number of epoch variously according to its suitability in input parameter combinations gradient descent traingd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate traingda gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation traingdx levenberg marquardt trainlm and scaled conjugate gradient back propagation trainscg were the five training algorithms analyzed with a different number of hidden nodes the optimal structure of ec and clˉ were trained by trainscg which gives the lower value of rmse corel nash sutcliffe coefficient and r2 while trainlm was used to structure no₃ˉ the performance was impressively accurate for clˉ ec so₄2ˉ but not for no₃ˉ typically accuracy was achieved by increasing the number of trials while the trial and error technique increased the run time raised the complexity and was relatively expensive sheela and deepa 2013 sakizadeh 2016 conducted a study to compare the performances of three ann algorithms for water quality index forecasting in groundwater systems ann with early stopping ensemble ann eann and ann with bayesian regularisation these techniques are typically applied to bpnn the most common problem encountered while training a deep neural network is poor regularisation resulting from the increasing model complexity with too many parameters early stopping is the simple technique to control the over fitting problem where the iteration stops at a specific number as the generalisation error increases prechelt 2012 sharkey 1996 discovered the way to enhance generalisation proficiency and stability with the eann approach the limited groups of ann with the same objectives were trained with the output formed from one unified prediction bayesian regulation artificial neural network brann and eann are effective to improve generalization of model network by controlling and penalising large weights of model parameters krogh and hertz 1991 the study indicates the success in wqi estimation by both brann and eann with lower error validation mean square error mse 7 71 and mse 9 25 respectively compared to early stopping method mse 17 67 the sensitivity analysis listed so₄2ˉ ec and no₃ˉ as the insignificant parameters of groundwater quality due to lower error ratio of mse sakizadeh 2016 gholami et al 2016 developed a groundwater quality model by implementing mlp algorithm mlp is a deep neural network approach commonly used to determine pattern classification and regression problems anguita et al 2005 chen and zhang 2009 eight groundwater quality index gwqi parameters were chosen as outputs ph tds k na ca2 clˉ mg2 and so₄2ˉ while the input variables were the factors of gwqi water table depth distance from contamination site elevation aquifer formation population and household activity the value of gwqi was classified into high gwqi 0 15 low gwqi 0 04 and suitable 0 04 gwqi 0 15 gis was applied to gather analyse and demonstrate spatial data of groundwater through the trial and error method the hyperbolic tangent is found to be the significant transfer function while the lm algorithm is the most appropriate network structure to train groundwater quality hyperbolic tangent functions impressively discriminate small input variables the steep derivative was considered as an effective and powerful technique for normalization in nonlinear modelling compared to sigmoid baughman and liu 1995 the water table depth distance from contamination and aquifer transmissivity are the optimal input variables which efficiently describe the behaviour of the output variable in predicting groundwater quality gholami et al 2010 though the integration of ann and gis was proven to be useful in groundwater quality forecasting the prediction value of the optimal input variable was incorrect due to limitation of ann in receiving the large input pixel aquifer parameter estimation was performed by zio 1997 and balkhair 2002 using multilayer perceptron with back propagation technique mlpbp mlpbp has also been implemented in modelling groundwater quality nathan et al 2017 the canadian water quality index cwqi was applied to evaluate 10 physicochemical parameters instead of the standard wqi due to its proper and precise index for overall water usage determination the performance of mlpbp then was compared to multilinear regression model mlr the analysis showed that mlpbp is better in complex groundwater quality modelling due to its adaptive data driven and efficient computational tools most of the studies reviewed have applied the bpnn algorithm either for training or modelling ray and klindworth 2000 kuo et al 2004 yesilnacar et al 2008 kumar 2010 kheradpisheh et al 2015 sakizadeh 2016 nathan et al 2017 however there are several limitations to use of bpnn such as empirical risk minimisation low convergence rate and susceptibility to entrapment in local minima for large input data sets the implementation of lm proved to increase convergence speed and time minimise the training error without being stuck at local minima and increase the prediction accuracy latifoglu et al 2015 however the lm algorithm appeared to be fastest in moderately sized samples kisi 2007 at the same time the rbf was discovered to outperform bpnn in recognition speed and efficiency rate several comparative studies between the rbf and mlp were conducted to analyse performance efficiency senthil kumar et al 2005 and mutlu et al 2008 stated rbf is faster and more stable in learning and training rate compared to mlp but resulted in poor generalisation due to the high number of neurons mlp method showed better prediction accuracy in both training and validation process when appropriate input parameters were added kisi 2004 while the performance of rbf models deteriorates during validation process when introduced to input parameters compared to the better performance presented during training process as observed the selection of input variables and the transfer function is critical in structuring the optimal functions in ann the choice of potential input variables in predicting groundwater quality should consider the characteristics of groundwater the optimum input variables are evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient among the potential variables notably the common input variables used are total hardness th cl so₄2 mg2 ec tds and groundwater level gwl the transfer function is essential to shape the relationship of non linear input and linear output ann modelling the trial and error approach has been the most popular method in selecting the optimal structure of ann and the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer for the groundwater quality prediction the most used performance indexes are rmse mse and determination coefficient r2 table 1 shows the summarization of ann criteria used in predicting groundwater quality 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems fuzzy logic fl has been combined with ann to solve uncertain and ill defined non linear functions due to limitations of traditional mathematical methods the theory of fuzzy set was first published by zadeh 1965 it is defined as the generalization of a set of vague elements and its function considered as an extension of classical sets fl is implemented in fuzzy inference systems fis to formulate mapping inputs to outputs fuzzy reasoning concepts are straightforward and accommodate imprecise and uncertain reasoning with the employment of if then rules in decision making bardossy and disse 1993 however fl systems do not automatically provide the appropriate mechanisms for decision making while ann shows better prediction in the non linear and complex systems the black box approach generates correlation errors between input and output and ineffectively deals with uncertainty tu 1996 feldman and ballard 1982 proposed the general architecture of unified hybrid systems due to the constraint of single ai models researchers have shown interest in the development of hybrid models to enhance model performance and learning results lange et al 1989 gallant 1993 medsker 1994 hambaba 1996 sun and alexandre 1997 sun 2000 anfis resulted from hybrid intelligent systems combining the advantages of neural networks and fuzzy logic proposed by jang 1993 jang 1993 figured out the anfis technique is flexible in generating effective design of nonlinear mapping and hybrid learning rule functions in parameter identification the initial input parameters benefit from faster learning in defining the system dynamics anfis is composed of five layers fuzzification interface the rule layer the layer of normalization defuzzification interface and the output layer fig 2 shows the five layers structured representing the implementation of fis which are then trained to solve a complex problem via neural network learning du and wolfe 1997 there are two types of commonly used fis namely mamdani and takagi sugeno the more commonly used mamdani system expects the defuzzified output of fuzzy set from aggregation of the if then control rule mamdani and assilian 1975 takagi and sugeno 1985 developed a consequent linear combination input in zero order or first order polynomial function with the weighted linear combination of the consequent being treated as the output the inference system is comprised of three stages fuzzification fuzzy rule based and defuzzification the rules of fuzzy systems are generated in the form of linguistic if then pertaining to the input classification or output controlling riid 2002 the purpose of fuzzification is to define the numerical crisp element and to convert the fuzzy set into grades of membership on the other hand defuzzification is the process of decoding the membership degree of fuzzy elements into a crisp value zimmermann 2010 the most common membership functions are triangular and trapezoidal the linear model of the ts system is more compact and computationally effective than mamdani method dixon 2002 investigated the impact of chemical pesticides on the groundwater quality in northwest arkansas usa the input was divided into two layers to generate the fis model the first input layer consisted of soils and land use and land cover lulc while the second input layer was made up of soil structure hydrologic group of soil and soil profile depth bp algorithm was used to train the fis the four fuzzy sets were distinguished by a trapezoidal membership function mf which is broadly implemented and performs well in real time monitoring due to its simple formula and time development efficiency yen and langari 1998 the neuro fuzzy modelling of spatial distribution of vulnerability showed that the highly vulnerable area is the agricultural land the rule weight was set from 0 to 1 the learning of rule weight of fuzzy set improved accuracy in classification systems compared to no rule system nauck and kruse 1998 ishibuchi and nakashima 2001 dixon 2005 applied back propagation anfis and gis to enhance the spatial distribution of no₃ n at the same location the performance of the three membership functions mfs performance known as trapezoidal mf bell shape mf and triangular mf was analyzed and compared as observed the integration of anfis and gis applications improved robustness of understanding the relationships between input and output parameters besides the fuzzy sets from the trapezoidal function were more stable and performed well on the non linear hydrogeologic system tutmez et al 2006 built an anfis model to study the correlation between ec and tds first order ts systems were applied in a bpnn the selected major ions such as na mg2 ca2 and k were used as input variables the fuzzy sets in antecedents were defined by gaussian mf to determine the input output partition into rule in conclusion the flexible fuzzy model was able to interpret the non linearity of the relationship between selected major cations in groundwater and ec based on tds model compared to conventional techniques neuro fuzzy model and principal component analysis pca were implemented to assess groundwater quality in consideration with wqi in an urban area sahu et al 2011 the input variables were selected through pca which reduced the number of possibly correlated water quality variables into independent uncorrelated variables cadavid et al 2009 the observed groundwater quality parameters during different seasons were found to be within the acceptable limit of is 10500 the result from applying both analytical and statistical regression techniques indicates that the developed anfis model of predicted wqi was significantly positively correlated with verified wqi of groundwater four anfis models were built to investigate the relationships between the input parameters and the concentration of nitrate mousavi and javad 2012 th ec mg2 ca2 and hco₃ˉ were selected as the optimum input variables by applying statistical analysis according to correlation coefficient keskin et al 2004 variable numbers of parameters were set for each of four anfis models anfis 1 included th ec mg2 ca2 and hco₃ˉ anfis 2 included th ec ca2 and hco₃ˉ anfis 3 included th ec and hco₃ˉ anfis 4 included th and ec three mfs were applied to each variable to minimise the number of possibilities in final decision making perez et al 2010 the most practical and effective model to predict groundwater quality was determined by the highest correlation coefficient between the parameters and the number of input variable hence anfis 1 best predicted the nitrate concentration value ashiyani and suryanarayana 2015 investigated the gwqi based on fuzzy model and bp neural network with a time series the ph tds sar ca2 mg2 so₄2ˉ and clˉ were set as input data the analysis was conducted during pre monsoon and post monsoon based on the modelling the groundwater quality during pre monsoon season is better than the post monsoon water the correlation of r value and rmse between the observed and estimated gwqi were analyzed and compared to choose the best anfis model for each area yetilmezsoy et al 2011 stated that there are two types of learning algorithms used in anfis hybrid methods and back propagation the gradient descent algorithm is the most popular optimization algorithm applied to identify the parameters of anfis however the size of learning rate would affect the learning process where the small size of learning rate which is prone to get stuck in the local point due to its slow learning process and too large a learning rate will never converge and overshoot the minimum jang 1993 hence a meta heuristic optimization algorithm was applied to overcome the gradient technique related problems jalalkamali 2015 individually combined genetic algorithm ga and partial swarm optimization pso forecasting models with anfis for space time groundwater quality assessment in a complex aquifer system qualitative parameters such as location coordinates monthly groundwater levels and the monthly average of rainfall were added together with chemical parameters as input data to improve quality assessment accuracy the performance of variable hybrid learning algorithms has been compared for their proper tuned changeable parameters for anfis structures to yield optimization and match the output with training data overall both anfis ga and anfis pso modeled spatiotemporal groundwater quality parameters appropriately anfis pso space time model gave the most accurate and satisfactory results in terms of r2 and rmse gholami et al 2017 employed the co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis and gis in their study canfis was used for complicated multi input multi output mimo non linear groundwater quality forecasting based on anfis structure jang et al 1997 gis was used with pre and post processed data to map the spatial distribution of gwqi in different geographic areas lm algorithm was applied to strengthen the performance of canfis the canfis technique increased the accuracy to solve and interpret modelling vagueness singh et al 2007 results indicate that the proposed canfis model can accurately predict the groundwater quality and three critical factors were distinguished in affecting groundwater quality namely mean water table the aquifer transmissivity and distance from the pollutant centers table 2 shows the summary comparison of the input variables desired output performance index membership functions and inference systems the application of anfis proved to be the excellent prediction tool in nonlinear and multivariable analysis tutmez et al 2006 sahu et al 2011 ashiyani and suryanarayana 2015 according to the reviewed papers the utilization of anfis in predicting groundwater quality involves the structure and parameter identification phases of systems the optimization of anfis model needs to consider the appropriate input data performance index and membership function in order to increase efficiency of desired output in the fuzzy inference algorithm the crisp input is interpreted and mapped out in the set of fuzzy classification kumar 2010 the logical rule decides the proper fis in the form of if then statement to interpret the relationship between input variables and output variables amirkhani et al 2015 if then rules are the most common and proficient linguistic form in the modelling field most of the studies used the first order ts inference system due to its high performance in solving the complicated problem in consequent linear equation form the minimum value of training error decides the optimal structure of anfis model anfis can be a robust predictive tool for modelling space time distribution of groundwater quality but longer time is needed when processing big data sets compared to ann najah et al 2011 hence variable hybrid approaches have been introduced to improve the convergence speed of anfis the reduction of search space dimension increased the convergence speed better than the bp algorithm shoorehdeli et al 2009 the application of a hybrid algorithm such as ga and pso stabilised the non linear system and increased the speed of learning rate fraile ardanuy and zufiria 2005 shoorehdeli et al 2009 the powerful combination of both fuzzy logic theories and ffnn dominates in efficiency in adaptation ability to identify complex and nonlinear data trends and capability to learn in shortest time sahin and erol 2017 2 3 evolutionary computation approaches evolutionary computation commonly known as ea is a stochastic optimization technique pioneered by fogel et al 1966 the main focus of ea is the learning and evolution process of adaptation and optimization which creates a new strategy in problem solving the classification of ea includes evolutionary strategies es ga genetic programming gp and evolutionary programming ep de jong et al 1997 whitley 2001 lozano 2002 these algorithms require calibration to estimate the relevant parameters the initial population is generated randomly and the potential solution or population of individuals is iteratively applied until the fittest individuals are selected they are derived by the same conceptual basis of the evolutionary process via the variation operators selection mutation reproduction and survival of the fittest in this section the evolutionary computation application in groundwater quality is discussed in further detail ea approach is reliable in providing a fast solution to a complex and challenging problem specifically in hydrology and water management simpson et al 1994 franchini 1996 haddad and marino 2011 hashmi et al 2011 fallah mehdipour et al 2012 nourani et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 the most classic and popular type of ea is a ga is originally developed by holland 1975 ga conducts a stochastic random search in solution space by imitations and adaptations of the biological evolution process cartwright 1994 the learning mechanism of ga involves the iteration process to reproduce the generation of offspring from the selection of best adapted individuals through the variation operators such as selection mutation and crossover rowe and roberts 1998 previous application of ga in water resources assessment has proven to be one of the best approaches to search global optimum solutions wang 1991 aral and guan 1996 gumrah et al 2000 singh and datta 2006 yeh et al 2006 built a groundwater quality monitoring structure using the ga method the ga and factorial kriging were integrated to solve the optimal problem of chosen regionalised factors nine variables were selected in designing the groundwater model ec tds clˉ na ca2 mg2 mn2 fe³ and so₄2ˉ the integration of ga and factorial kriging successfully portrayed the spatial variation of groundwater quality patterns of various scale in taiwan zhang and dong 2009 presented a classical exploratory projection method based on the application of ga to evaluate groundwater quality the wqi was constructed based on projection pursuit where the simulation was generated from high dimensional to low dimensional according to groundwater quality criteria however in an objective method some discrimination of the index with the addition of restriction may occur the complex and restricted non linear optimization process leads to frequent fluctuation which decreases the convergence rate speed of ga chipperfield and fleming 1995 hence the hybrid approach of ga and traditional optimization technique was used to overcome the problem accordingly the model applied to the groundwater quality evaluation performed well in determining groundwater quality classification gp has been used universally in global optimization solution classification and automatic variable selection the concept of gp was developed by koza 1992 where the basic approach is closely related to the field of ga gp employs a decision tree structure to illustrate individuals and simplify the optimization problem in the form of mathematical expression the flexible tree structures comprehensively determine the fittest function for the optimal solution where the gp application leads in establishing the best formula potentially for high mathematical complexity janardhanan and datta 2012 proposed the application of gp technique in estimating and evaluating the hydrologic system and groundwater problems recently aryafar and khosravi 2019 presented a method based on gp to evaluate the correlation between the input and output variables the aim was to study the capability of gp in groundwater quality parameter prediction and to compare the prediction performance of gp with other ai techniques ten different functions were applied to an enormous number of generations range from 100 up to 1000 to design the most appropriate formulation with low prediction error the functions consisted of the basic arithmetic operator mathematical functions logical expression and boolean operators fallah mehdipour et al 2013 the population parameters in each tree structure were iteratively modified to measure the fitness value in a specific number of generations the performance values r2 rmse and mean absolute relative error mare of gp were well satisfied compared to ann and anfis showing that the proposed gp method is robust against other ai methods in prediction modelling the practical gp generates the probabilistic formulation of the set of relations between variables khalaj et al 2019 implemented gene expression programming gep technique and grey relational analysis gra to identify and appraise groundwater classification this study focused on the impact of human activities and climate change in the degradation of groundwater quality the main factor that influences the groundwater salinity was determined by gra gep is the extension of the gp algorithm where the individual is expressed in fixed length linear strings ferreira 2002 the simulation of temporal variation in ec by gep was divided into three spatial zones the ideal fit relationship between groundwater level and ec was ranked based on different time scales of input variables during training and testing procedure ec values showed an increasing trend during 1971 2010 which is due to groundwater recharge groundwater level fluctuations due to uncontrolled groundwater extraction intensive agriculture and trends in precipitation and temperature extremes contributed to degradation in water quality results indicate that gep with supervised learning is a promising new method for non linear relations the learning and optimization concept are the same for each type of ea and at the same time the principles are simple yet flexible participation of variation operators facilitates the learning process in the evolutionary process from the review each type of ea has benefits and limitations ga and gp are the most popular algorithms table 3 both types efficiently demonstrate optimised complex behaviour at every level and have the potential to hybridise with other ea methods generating a larger number of efficient solutions martinez estudillo et al 2006 grosan and abraham 2007 despite that ga is sensitive to the population size and the selection of the primary parameter rate such as mutation and crossover the unsatisfactory preference might disrupt the efficiency and increase the time consumed in the evolutionary process meanwhile the gp method suffers from slow execution and swapping process to the main memory due to a large amount of population data overall the application of ea in decision making will benefit in the ability to self adapt to decision principle self efficacy and performance alteration in matching the patterns during the search for optimum solutions reed et al 1967 rosenberg 1970 the application of gp overpowered the other ai methods such as ann svm and anfis shiri et al 2013 aryafar and khosravi 2019 however only a few recent studies reported the assessment of groundwater quality using ea technique hence extensive and thorough research on the groundwater quality assessment and forecasting utilizing ea is encouraged to verify the prediction capability and efficiency 2 4 support vector machine svm svm is another simple supervised learning algorithm introduced by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is used in both pattern classification and regression analysis svm creates a boundary called hyper plane to minimise the generalisation error between the separation of the data class and the data amari and wu 1999 there are four major concepts in classifying prediction known as the separation by hyper plane kernel method the soft margin svm and the hard margin svm cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 due to its well built theoretical framework svm has been successfully applied to solve various problems in surface water and groundwater bray and han 2004 khan and coulibaly 2006 lin et al 2006 cimen 2008 liu et al 2009 liao et al 2011 yoon et al 2011 tabari et al 2012 kisi et al 2015 khalil et al 2005 studied the potential of svm for groundwater quality evaluation in the sumas blaine aquifer the focus of this study was to develop a model of precise input and output variable behaviours to simulate the nitrogen concentrations in the groundwater at the specific receptors the type of kernel function was decided via trial and error methods using the optimal value of the rbf kernel parameter four statistical algorithms svm ann lwpr locally weighted projection regression and rvm relevance vector machines were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and better generalisation through the study svm offered an effective mechanism for avoiding the occurrence of overtraining allowing the svm to achieve the best generalisation however the prediction accuracy of svm was generally low and ann was the most accurate prediction model compared to svm lwpr and rvm overall the responses generated by all four learning algorithms had acceptable accuracy and faster prediction pattern recognition compared to physically based modelling mt3d liu et al 2009 presented the data driven svm technique derived from the theory of structural risk minimisation by applying it to a multivariate non linear system groundwater quality indicators such as ph tds th so₄2ˉ clˉ no₃ n no₂ n and fˉ were randomly selected to process input parameters in achieving robustness an attempt was made to design the desired output of groundwater quality classification the kernel trick class of algorithms for pattern analysis transformed the unified indicator from the input space to higher dimensional space the suggested svm exhibited favourable performance in pattern recognition also the authors validated that svm works well with support vector regression svr algorithm for non linear functions and multi category classification thus the svm model showed significant potential in interpreting and predicting the relationships between complex non linear systems and karst groundwater quality classification and input factor the svm application simulated the level concentration and distribution of nitrate in groundwater arabgol et al 2016 the optimal svm model was developed based on the appropriate input parameter the type of kernel function kernel parameters capacity parameter c and ԑ insensitive loss function powerfully affect the performance of svm based classification task singh et al 2011 there are four types of frequently used kernel functions linear polynomial radial basis rbf and sigmoid among the four types rbf was identified as a significant kernel function due to its smaller estimated error a map of the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration was developed by the integration of the svm model and gis the study showed the robust performance of svm in presenting a simple yet systematic approach for nitrate concentration prediction with minimal input data hybrid svm with gis was acceptable in terms of accuracy plot of nitrate distribution when compared to the fate and transport model results isazadeh et al 2017 demonstrated the svm approach for identifying the statistical distribution of groundwater quality variations the predictions of ec na and so₄2 uncertainties were modeled based on an ann and svm the nine supplementary and five primary inputs in march and september 2002 2014 were used for training gamma test was applied to identify the optimal and most promising input variables ph ec and the concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 clˉ hco₃ˉ and so₄2ˉ in the svm method both of the data points and outputs were plotted in x and y coordinates and the optimal hyper plane predefined classes the estimation of groundwater qualitative parameters relies on the uncertainty propagation techniques where the p and the d factors were used to calibrate the output uncertainties generally the accuracy level is related to the uncertainty value meaning that the lower uncertainty value defines the high accuracy the training result depicts that values of p and d factors of the svm model were lower than for ann which highlights that the uncertainty value of svm is lesser however for forecasting data ann had the best rmse and correlation of efficiency e values yet both svm and ann performed better than geostatistical interpolation techniques for mapping ec na and so₄2 hence svm gave a satisfactory model uncertainty performance with x y coordinate classification function compared to the ann the main advantage of svm modelling is it increases robustness of the classification results for non parametric and non linearly separable datasets and has superior generalisation ability based on the structural risk minimisation which makes it possible to predict unseen data cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 smola et al 2003 comparative studies between svm and ann have shown that the generalisation capability of svm is greater than ann thus yielding higher accuracy yoon et al 2011 yadav et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 svm experiences limitations mostly in determining optimal kernel function and its parameter burges 1998 coicca 2013 even though the generalisation performance is better than conventional techniques of classification problem solving the large size of data sets and too much noise in data sets may lower the computational speed thereby causing overlapping of data points osuna et al 1997 feng et al 2009 the svm with rbf kernel function achieves the best in non linear classification performance ali and smith miles 2006 overall svm is an effective classifier method and offers a significant improvement in the groundwater quality analysis with a suitable selection of kernel function and parameters table 4 shows the details of the reviewed svm 3 evaluation and assessment this review has focused on the implementations of ai for groundwater quality modelling the analysis has led to the following observations 1 among the published state of the art research and critical evaluation of ai tools ann and anfis are the most extensively used for assessing groundwater quality up to now ann has become one of the most promising and popular tools to model and simulate complex hydrogeological systems despite some drawbacks such as local minima problems and long training time the authors believe that further studies or several approaches will help to improve the ann s learning rates and performance accuracy anfis which combines the advantages of ann and fuzzy inference systems exhibits marginally better prediction for smaller data both ann and anfis provide satisfactory results in assessment of groundwater quality however the ann technique is preferable for large and complex hydrogeological data sets due to its stability and flexibility estimation peng and wen 1999 have shown that ann is the most effective tool in estimating and systemizing data in wide and various fields 2 recently ea and svm in predictive model applications have outperformed ann and anfis due to their generalization ability and faster optimization fallah mehdipour et al 2012 isazadeh et al 2017 both ea and svm depend on their capability to independently generate new structural solutions to all types of optimization problems by implementing feature selection technique to transform the input sequences into feature vectors even so limited studies have been done on the individual application of ea and svm related to groundwater quality assessment and forecasting hence it is recommended to perform additional research regarding the suitability and effectiveness of these applications for groundwater quality assessment 3 in ai methods some basic concern arises in developing an efficient modelling structure which includes the selection of the input parameters the impacts of initial uncertainty and the criteria of model structure the selection of input parameters must include considerations such as correlation analysis statistical analysis and the characteristics of study area 4 fig 3 shows the input variables that have been applied in ai modelling for groundwater quality from fig 3 one can conclude that so₄2ˉ is the most frequently used input variable followed by clˉ mg2 ca2 ph ec tds and th the analysis revealed that the mentioned parameters strongly correlated within each other and were frequently selected as the input parameters for groundwater quality adnan et al 2019 rajesh et al 2019 these input parameters are effectively verifying the groundwater quality for both drinking and irrigation 5 ec is said to be the most significant and crucial groundwater quality parameter which is used to predict the concentration of certain ions such as ca2 cl mg2 and na yesilnacar et al 2008 kumar 2010 higher ec and tds values indicate the increase in salinity which leads to decrease in water body health the elevated concentrations of heavy metals and major ions can significantly impact human health soil plants and aquatic life the selection of suitable parameters in response to their purposes and hydrogeologic characteristics notably help to improve the groundwater quality assessment kheradpisheh et al 2015 other parameters such as arsenic soils location of well etc were less commonly used in the reviewed papers 6 generally the predictive model performance was evaluated by using a statistical expression such as e mae mse r r2 cv corel vaf mare nash sutcliffe coefficient and rmse fig 4 shows most of the research analyzed used r2 and rmse as the best metrics to evaluate the groundwater quality prediction the functions of individual statistical metrics vary depending on the model performance aspects and uncertainty analysis the model forecast accuracy could be more robust by applying the effective combination of the goodness of fit and at least one of the relative absolute error measures 4 recommendations this review focuses on the learning mechanism of ai applications in groundwater quality modelling hence the recommendations to improve groundwater quality assessment drawn from the comprehensive review are presented as follows 1 in depth exploration of ai application showed that ann is the most satisfactory structure for complex and large data training especially in hydrology the ann modelling specialised in calibrating the predictive uncertainty with the ability to self adapt and imitate the behaviour of hydrogeological systems using deep ensembles daliakopoulos et al 2005 ann is extensively used in groundwater quality prediction and forecasting with high level of accuracy due to its capability to identify the trends and patterns in non linear data farmaki et al 2010 izeboudjen et al 2014 the trial and error approach is frequently applied to determine the proper architecture of ann among the types of ann models mlp is considered as the best structure of ann due to its capability to handle large input space for classification and regression as well as its stable architecture with excellent representation skill despite the low number of applications in groundwater quality modelling the implementation of mlp with back propagation technique increases the efficiency of the groundwater quality simulation hagan et al 1997 haykin 2007 2 appropriate selection of input for groundwater quality forecasting is essential in improving the accuracy and effectiveness of forecasting models there are two types of input selection model free and model based fernando et al 2009 model free input variable selection is a simple implementation of input without being dependent on the model structure and calibration while model based properly identifies the strongest influence and correlation between model input and output from the reviewed papers the input parameters are mostly selected based on the model based technique and physical analysis despite the efficiency of model based input the input consideration is influenced by some modelling performance such as mse and r2 hence conducting the comparative study between model based and model free is essential to identify the ability and suitability of these techniques in groundwater quality modelling 3 the hybridization or integration method has shown effective positive feedback compared to individual classification tools sahu et al 2011 inthachot et al 2015 jalalkamali and jalalkamali 2018 rajaee et al 2020 hence the hybridization method is suggested to improve the accuracy performance high dimensional and non linear time series data and to overcome the drawbacks of ann ea is established as a potential technique to enhance the uncertainty subjected to random noise and helps to prevent premature convergence and overtraining of ann there are three criteria to optimize the ann model based on ea weight adaptations to create new generations with high fitness value evolution of ann structure and learning rules fig 5 shows the detailed integration of ann and ea the integration of ann and ea involved the learning and evolving of ann as an excellent intelligence tool to solve the problems in design and realization of ann for groundwater quality prediction 4 the ann performance is also impacted by the appropriateness of input parameters the implementation of pca can aid in selection of the most pertinent input variables by reducing a number of correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables preserving the essence of original data 5 conclusion the hydrologic functions and state of groundwater systems are complicated and difficult to interpret without the aid of computational tools this paper provides an in depth review of the various ai approaches techniques and methods from the literature review anns anfis ea and svm have proved to be efficient and precise tools in determining and managing groundwater quality at the same time the hybridization of appropriate machine learning is significantly powerful compared to individual tools consequently ai modelling techniques can be beneficial in designing and planning groundwater management and pollution prevention strategies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge grant rg557 18htm university of malaya for the funding given for this study 
11931,this review paper closely explores the techniques and significances of the most potent artificial intelligence ai approaches in a concise and integrated way specifically in the groundwater quality modelling and forecasting for its suitability in domestic usage this paper systematically provides an extensive review of the four most used ai methods artificial neural network ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis evolutionary algorithm ea and support vector machine svm to reflect on the features and abilities while defining the greatest challenges throughout the process of providing desired results analysis among the four ai methods found that ann performed better when handling a large number of data sets and accurately made predictions due to its ability to model complex non linear and complex relationships despite some weaknesses the findings of this review demonstrate that the successful adoption of ai models is impacted by the appropriateness of input consideration types of individual functions the efficiency of performance metrics etc the outcomes from this study will be beneficial for groundwater development plans and contribute to the improvement of the ai applications in groundwater quality recommendations are presented in this study to strengthen the knowledge development towards improving the modelling structure in the mentioned area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater monitoring groundwater parameters statistical modelling artificial intelligence artificial neural network 1 introduction over the past century water scarcity has been the critical issue globally due to climate change growth of population urbanisation and intensive farming kundzewicz 1997 in response to this issue the groundwater resources are alternatively used for various practices including agricultural industrial and household activities however the rising global demand for water has led to over exploitation of groundwater and deterioration of the quality of groundwater the degradation of groundwater quality is greatly influenced by both natural factors seawater intrusion and rock water leaching interaction and anthropogenic factors mining industrial contamination excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides and domestic sewage which affect the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater nourbakhsh et al 2016 tirkey et al 2017 groundwater contamination has caused adverse impacts on the availability and suitability of groundwater and is harmful to human health furthermore it is expensive and time consuming to clean up contaminated groundwater because of the complex groundwater systems and the invisible threat of groundwater contaminations thus groundwater quality assessment and monitoring are highly necessary concerning the potential risk of groundwater contamination and its effects on suitability for human consumption the main principles in efficiently managing and improving groundwater quality are the accurate and reliable forecast of the groundwater resource information where better understanding of the hydrogeological process and behaviour is fundamental li et al 2012a singh et al 2014 however the complex and changeable characteristics of the hydrogeological system require specific tools to develop such predictions among the various approaches groundwater modelling has proven to be a convenient tool to understand the groundwater systems and identify the current groundwater threats bachmat et al 1978 the development of prediction modelling for the short term and long term is crucial to sustain the use and help to reflect on the implications for future groundwater supply typically the classical methods such as conceptual and numerical groundwater models have been applied to predict the varying hydrogeological condition and processes based on the profound knowledge of the observed dynamic behaviour sufficient and proper data for the calibration and validation of the hydrological system are necessary to define the model prediction accuracy and reliability gao and li 2014 however there are a number of limitations to those techniques such as the large number of input parameters needed through the modelling process in the meantime many models are not able to deal with and quantify the predictive hydrogeological uncertainties and non linearity the failure to recognise and evaluate uncertainties and non linearity can result in improper representation of the actual system which contributes to the poor performance of groundwater model and degrades forecasting accuracy guzman et al 2015 the mentioned limitations have led researchers to make use of artificial intelligence ai as an alternative tool for complex nonlinear hydrological modelling due to its ability to cope with the tremendous amount of data remesan and mathew 2015 in recent decades various types of ai particularly artificial neural network ann and fuzzy logic are widely used in modelling in engineering and sciences the evolutions and the applications of artificial intelligence in predicting and monitoring groundwater quality and quantity are rapidly growing khaki et al 2015 mirabbasi 2015 barzegar et al 2016 sakizadeh 2016 bagheri et al 2017 ai offers advantages in reducing the time needed for data sampling and its ability to identify the nonlinear patterns of input and output is more reliable compared to the other classical statistical methods ay and ozyildirim 2018 therefore the high accuracy and stability of ai structure in simulating the complex groundwater systems has attracted the interest of many researchers this review aims to evaluate the state of the art and ascertain the effectiveness of ai tools for groundwater quality assessment this paper concentrates on the most common and active applications of ai in predicting the suitability of groundwater quality for domestic use which include ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis evolutionary algorithm ea and support vector machine svm the review will be focused on the conceptual frameworks and basic theory of ai approach for predicting groundwater quality section 2 in section 3 the performance and accuracy of various ai applications have been reviewed comprehensively the recommendations for future research are discussed in section 4 2 artificial intelligence techniques in groundwater quality assessment 2 1 artificial neural network ann is the simplified image of the mathematical model driven by a biological neural network that simulates the human cognitive abilities haykin 1994 fausett 1994 distinguished the neural network by the connection patterns or architecture of the nodes connection weight configuration methods and the activation function ann is a computational model that is proficient in machine learning pattern recognition optimization and content addressable memory jain et al 1996 besaw and rizzo 2007 ann models consist of at least three layers of interconnected neurons with one or several hidden layers an output and an input layer as shown in fig 1 the parallel distributed processor of anns processes the information from the input to the output through a network structure of interconnected nodes the input data computed in the input layer and the output layer correspond to network response of the existing database or known input pattern kheradpisheh et al 2015 the intermediate or hidden layer plays an important role in representing and computing complicated associations between patterns among the various types of anns back propagation neural network bpnn levenberg marquardt back propagation lmbp and multilayer perceptron mlp algorithms are the most implemented in groundwater modelling due to their accuracy feed forward neural network ffnn is a simple algorithm where the information passes in one direction from the input nodes through the hidden nodes to output nodes wasserman 1989 determined that the bpnn is fundamental in training a neural network to find global minima using statistical method lmbp was created by coupling the less sensitive levenberg marquardt algorithm to the sensitive back propagation algorithm which optimizes the balance between training speed and accuracy of the predictive model ma et al 2010 mlp is known for its effectiveness in predictive model performance using feed forward learning erdogan and geckinli 2003 mlp is able to generalize non linear mapping of input and output variables when there is little known or no training data matignon 2005 radial basis function rbf is the simplest structure of neural network it is composed of conventional approximation theory and was introduced by broomhead and lowe 1988 rbf is the other form of mlp with only a single hidden layer and faster training speed compared to mlp researchers have been actively using ann in hydrology hydraulics and water resources management for water and groundwater level and quality forecasting sediment modelling rainfall runoff estimation and flood management maier and dandy 1996 dawson and wilby 1998 campolo et al 2003 kuo et al 2004 minns and hall 2009 sreekanth et al 2009 shuai et al 2010 ghuman et al 2011 mustafa et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 considering the effectiveness of ann applications in predicting hydrochemical and hydrogeological parameters ann is extensively applied to groundwater modelling singh et al 2004 trichakis et al 2010 yu and liu 2012 ranjithan et al 1993 used the three layer ffnn for identifying the spatial distribution and degree variation of hydraulic conductivity in aquifer remediation those authors found that pattern recognition in ann is particularly useful to distinguish the uncertainty compared to the conventional ann various realizations of pumping were identified by applying back propagation algorithms to a solute transport model rogers and dowla 1994 quasi newton method for non linear optimization problem was proposed in that study resulting in more statistically significant and consistent simulations the unsupervised neural network called self organizing map som is an effective computational mapping tool that uses ffnn approach to conceptually visualize a logical network topology of the output data through the dimension reduction process kohonen 1982 sanchez martos et al 2002 has applied the som methods to evaluate groundwater quality temperature clˉ so₄2 hco₃ˉ no₃ˉ na mg2 ca2 and total dissolved solids tds were selected as input variables considering hydrogeochemical processes that took place in a semiarid area clˉ and so₄2ˉ are used to model the presence of seawater in a confined aquifer system yamanaka and kumagai 2006 som provides a simple interpretation of parameter data in the form of the activation map each value of a parameter in the activation maps was extracted by derived quadrat system the application of som in hydrogeochemical systems is possible due to its ability to interpret data from input and output relationship and store the information in the mathematical expression roussinov and chen 1999 however som application requires the specific and sufficient data to develop a significant cluster tjaden and cohen 2006 the lack of data results in the randomness of grouping and incorrect evaluation especially in nonlinear modelling ray and klindworth 2000 proposed a general bpnn combined with a feed forward neural network ffbp in evaluating groundwater pollution in countryside private wells the models were separated into nitrate contamination and pesticide contamination input parameters were the depth of land surface to the aquifer well depth and distance from cropland the purpose of bpnn implementation is to modify and minimise the weight of error in the feed forward neural network to produce the desired output of prediction accuracy kvaal and mcewan 1996 the trial and error method was applied to find significant input parameters consequently the presence of each parameter was impacted by the type of wells kuo et al 2004 investigated groundwater quality variation in the blackfoot disease area in taiwan using a bpnn the implications of hidden neuron number and learning performance of different input variables for saltwater intrusion and arsenic pollution were evaluated the input variables used for saltwater intrusion were electrical conductivity ec clˉ so₄2ˉ k and mg2 while the variables for arsenic pollution were alkalinity alk arsenic as and total organic carbon toc in this study root mean square error rmse was calculated to evaluate the model performance of ann the performance of ann was not affected by the higher number of hidden neurons but finding the optimal number of hidden layers is important in generalisation neuron mezard and nadal 1989 the current and previous input data are crucial for an accurate and reliable forecast typically the standard bpnn has a slower convergence rate hence the training for large and complicated datasets tends to get trapped at poor local minima hamed et al 2004 to improve the performance of bpnn the second order method is needed which is the utilization of levenberg marquardt lm proposed by hagan and menhaj 1994 and sivanandam et al 2005 yesilnacar et al 2008 developed a computational model based learning system for nitrate prediction in shallow aquifers using the lmbp algorithm four input parameters were used in the simulations ph temperature ec and groundwater level the tan sigmoid transfer function was applied in the hidden layer while the linear transfer function was implemented in the output layer of the two layer network el din and smith 2002 suggested a single hidden layer is acceptable in model simulation but an additional hidden layer facilitates complex function approximation with optimal connections weight toth et al 2000 while selecting the best fitting bpnn the number of neurons was set to be 20 with the constant learning rate and momentum of 0 1 and 0 9 respectively according to hagan et al 1997 momentum allows the network to slide through a shallow local minimum among the 12 bpnns minimum training error and maximum r of the lm algorithm made trainlm the best fitting bpnn the implementation of lm minimised gradient descent convergence rate and the sum of squared error increases the rate of efficiency of the bpnn algorithms in solving a convex optimization error in non linear systems nash and sofer 1996 according to yesilnacar et al 2008 ec was found to be the most critical input parameter kumar 2010 investigated the performance of bpnn to assess groundwater quality indices in india kriging method was used to map ion concentrations in groundwater the trainlm function was used to train the bpnn input variables of clˉ so₄2ˉ and alkalinity and desired output of ph ec na ca2 mg2 and k were used in bpnn model development the dataset was evaluated for pre monsoon and post monsoon where the sampling took place from 2006 to 2008 in achieving the optimum architecture of ann the numbers of hidden neurons and layers were changed to handle the non linearity in the input data the configuration number was decided to be 50 neurons for every two hidden layers the architecture of 4 50 50 6 gave a small value of correlation coefficient and high uniform distribution mean error to the desired data from the analysis of the concentrations of cations and anions quality of groundwater from 79 sampling wells was validated as safe for human consumption the authors indicate that ec was a crucial parameter in model development zhaoxian and yuling 2011 identified the effectiveness of the rbf to develop a multilayer feed forward neural network of groundwater quality ten input parameters were selected based on water quality the optimal network structure of rbf was determined by adding or deleting the hidden nodes according to node activity rate and mutual information the results demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting the groundwater quality gis was used to visualize the spatial distribution in the grading system rbf offers a lower number of iterations due to increase in convergence speed higher prediction accuracy and stability compared to bpnn moradkhani et al 2004 the random selection of the number of neurons may cause an over fitting or under fitting problem which leads to poor model performance the trial and error mechanism is generally applied to evaluate the optimal structure relevant learning rate parameter and momentum chang et al 2011 kheradpisheh et al 2015 employed a trial and error rule in predicting the proper number of hidden neurons and constructing an optimal structure of bpnn modelling and simulating complex environmental systems in ann can be done using simple shells seyam and mogheir 2011 li et al 2012b however the accurate selection of input variables significantly influences the development of data driven models especially for non linear hydrologic model analysis maier and dandy 2000 fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 in the study kheradpisheh et al 2015 set the number of epoch variously according to its suitability in input parameter combinations gradient descent traingd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate traingda gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation traingdx levenberg marquardt trainlm and scaled conjugate gradient back propagation trainscg were the five training algorithms analyzed with a different number of hidden nodes the optimal structure of ec and clˉ were trained by trainscg which gives the lower value of rmse corel nash sutcliffe coefficient and r2 while trainlm was used to structure no₃ˉ the performance was impressively accurate for clˉ ec so₄2ˉ but not for no₃ˉ typically accuracy was achieved by increasing the number of trials while the trial and error technique increased the run time raised the complexity and was relatively expensive sheela and deepa 2013 sakizadeh 2016 conducted a study to compare the performances of three ann algorithms for water quality index forecasting in groundwater systems ann with early stopping ensemble ann eann and ann with bayesian regularisation these techniques are typically applied to bpnn the most common problem encountered while training a deep neural network is poor regularisation resulting from the increasing model complexity with too many parameters early stopping is the simple technique to control the over fitting problem where the iteration stops at a specific number as the generalisation error increases prechelt 2012 sharkey 1996 discovered the way to enhance generalisation proficiency and stability with the eann approach the limited groups of ann with the same objectives were trained with the output formed from one unified prediction bayesian regulation artificial neural network brann and eann are effective to improve generalization of model network by controlling and penalising large weights of model parameters krogh and hertz 1991 the study indicates the success in wqi estimation by both brann and eann with lower error validation mean square error mse 7 71 and mse 9 25 respectively compared to early stopping method mse 17 67 the sensitivity analysis listed so₄2ˉ ec and no₃ˉ as the insignificant parameters of groundwater quality due to lower error ratio of mse sakizadeh 2016 gholami et al 2016 developed a groundwater quality model by implementing mlp algorithm mlp is a deep neural network approach commonly used to determine pattern classification and regression problems anguita et al 2005 chen and zhang 2009 eight groundwater quality index gwqi parameters were chosen as outputs ph tds k na ca2 clˉ mg2 and so₄2ˉ while the input variables were the factors of gwqi water table depth distance from contamination site elevation aquifer formation population and household activity the value of gwqi was classified into high gwqi 0 15 low gwqi 0 04 and suitable 0 04 gwqi 0 15 gis was applied to gather analyse and demonstrate spatial data of groundwater through the trial and error method the hyperbolic tangent is found to be the significant transfer function while the lm algorithm is the most appropriate network structure to train groundwater quality hyperbolic tangent functions impressively discriminate small input variables the steep derivative was considered as an effective and powerful technique for normalization in nonlinear modelling compared to sigmoid baughman and liu 1995 the water table depth distance from contamination and aquifer transmissivity are the optimal input variables which efficiently describe the behaviour of the output variable in predicting groundwater quality gholami et al 2010 though the integration of ann and gis was proven to be useful in groundwater quality forecasting the prediction value of the optimal input variable was incorrect due to limitation of ann in receiving the large input pixel aquifer parameter estimation was performed by zio 1997 and balkhair 2002 using multilayer perceptron with back propagation technique mlpbp mlpbp has also been implemented in modelling groundwater quality nathan et al 2017 the canadian water quality index cwqi was applied to evaluate 10 physicochemical parameters instead of the standard wqi due to its proper and precise index for overall water usage determination the performance of mlpbp then was compared to multilinear regression model mlr the analysis showed that mlpbp is better in complex groundwater quality modelling due to its adaptive data driven and efficient computational tools most of the studies reviewed have applied the bpnn algorithm either for training or modelling ray and klindworth 2000 kuo et al 2004 yesilnacar et al 2008 kumar 2010 kheradpisheh et al 2015 sakizadeh 2016 nathan et al 2017 however there are several limitations to use of bpnn such as empirical risk minimisation low convergence rate and susceptibility to entrapment in local minima for large input data sets the implementation of lm proved to increase convergence speed and time minimise the training error without being stuck at local minima and increase the prediction accuracy latifoglu et al 2015 however the lm algorithm appeared to be fastest in moderately sized samples kisi 2007 at the same time the rbf was discovered to outperform bpnn in recognition speed and efficiency rate several comparative studies between the rbf and mlp were conducted to analyse performance efficiency senthil kumar et al 2005 and mutlu et al 2008 stated rbf is faster and more stable in learning and training rate compared to mlp but resulted in poor generalisation due to the high number of neurons mlp method showed better prediction accuracy in both training and validation process when appropriate input parameters were added kisi 2004 while the performance of rbf models deteriorates during validation process when introduced to input parameters compared to the better performance presented during training process as observed the selection of input variables and the transfer function is critical in structuring the optimal functions in ann the choice of potential input variables in predicting groundwater quality should consider the characteristics of groundwater the optimum input variables are evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient among the potential variables notably the common input variables used are total hardness th cl so₄2 mg2 ec tds and groundwater level gwl the transfer function is essential to shape the relationship of non linear input and linear output ann modelling the trial and error approach has been the most popular method in selecting the optimal structure of ann and the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer for the groundwater quality prediction the most used performance indexes are rmse mse and determination coefficient r2 table 1 shows the summarization of ann criteria used in predicting groundwater quality 2 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems fuzzy logic fl has been combined with ann to solve uncertain and ill defined non linear functions due to limitations of traditional mathematical methods the theory of fuzzy set was first published by zadeh 1965 it is defined as the generalization of a set of vague elements and its function considered as an extension of classical sets fl is implemented in fuzzy inference systems fis to formulate mapping inputs to outputs fuzzy reasoning concepts are straightforward and accommodate imprecise and uncertain reasoning with the employment of if then rules in decision making bardossy and disse 1993 however fl systems do not automatically provide the appropriate mechanisms for decision making while ann shows better prediction in the non linear and complex systems the black box approach generates correlation errors between input and output and ineffectively deals with uncertainty tu 1996 feldman and ballard 1982 proposed the general architecture of unified hybrid systems due to the constraint of single ai models researchers have shown interest in the development of hybrid models to enhance model performance and learning results lange et al 1989 gallant 1993 medsker 1994 hambaba 1996 sun and alexandre 1997 sun 2000 anfis resulted from hybrid intelligent systems combining the advantages of neural networks and fuzzy logic proposed by jang 1993 jang 1993 figured out the anfis technique is flexible in generating effective design of nonlinear mapping and hybrid learning rule functions in parameter identification the initial input parameters benefit from faster learning in defining the system dynamics anfis is composed of five layers fuzzification interface the rule layer the layer of normalization defuzzification interface and the output layer fig 2 shows the five layers structured representing the implementation of fis which are then trained to solve a complex problem via neural network learning du and wolfe 1997 there are two types of commonly used fis namely mamdani and takagi sugeno the more commonly used mamdani system expects the defuzzified output of fuzzy set from aggregation of the if then control rule mamdani and assilian 1975 takagi and sugeno 1985 developed a consequent linear combination input in zero order or first order polynomial function with the weighted linear combination of the consequent being treated as the output the inference system is comprised of three stages fuzzification fuzzy rule based and defuzzification the rules of fuzzy systems are generated in the form of linguistic if then pertaining to the input classification or output controlling riid 2002 the purpose of fuzzification is to define the numerical crisp element and to convert the fuzzy set into grades of membership on the other hand defuzzification is the process of decoding the membership degree of fuzzy elements into a crisp value zimmermann 2010 the most common membership functions are triangular and trapezoidal the linear model of the ts system is more compact and computationally effective than mamdani method dixon 2002 investigated the impact of chemical pesticides on the groundwater quality in northwest arkansas usa the input was divided into two layers to generate the fis model the first input layer consisted of soils and land use and land cover lulc while the second input layer was made up of soil structure hydrologic group of soil and soil profile depth bp algorithm was used to train the fis the four fuzzy sets were distinguished by a trapezoidal membership function mf which is broadly implemented and performs well in real time monitoring due to its simple formula and time development efficiency yen and langari 1998 the neuro fuzzy modelling of spatial distribution of vulnerability showed that the highly vulnerable area is the agricultural land the rule weight was set from 0 to 1 the learning of rule weight of fuzzy set improved accuracy in classification systems compared to no rule system nauck and kruse 1998 ishibuchi and nakashima 2001 dixon 2005 applied back propagation anfis and gis to enhance the spatial distribution of no₃ n at the same location the performance of the three membership functions mfs performance known as trapezoidal mf bell shape mf and triangular mf was analyzed and compared as observed the integration of anfis and gis applications improved robustness of understanding the relationships between input and output parameters besides the fuzzy sets from the trapezoidal function were more stable and performed well on the non linear hydrogeologic system tutmez et al 2006 built an anfis model to study the correlation between ec and tds first order ts systems were applied in a bpnn the selected major ions such as na mg2 ca2 and k were used as input variables the fuzzy sets in antecedents were defined by gaussian mf to determine the input output partition into rule in conclusion the flexible fuzzy model was able to interpret the non linearity of the relationship between selected major cations in groundwater and ec based on tds model compared to conventional techniques neuro fuzzy model and principal component analysis pca were implemented to assess groundwater quality in consideration with wqi in an urban area sahu et al 2011 the input variables were selected through pca which reduced the number of possibly correlated water quality variables into independent uncorrelated variables cadavid et al 2009 the observed groundwater quality parameters during different seasons were found to be within the acceptable limit of is 10500 the result from applying both analytical and statistical regression techniques indicates that the developed anfis model of predicted wqi was significantly positively correlated with verified wqi of groundwater four anfis models were built to investigate the relationships between the input parameters and the concentration of nitrate mousavi and javad 2012 th ec mg2 ca2 and hco₃ˉ were selected as the optimum input variables by applying statistical analysis according to correlation coefficient keskin et al 2004 variable numbers of parameters were set for each of four anfis models anfis 1 included th ec mg2 ca2 and hco₃ˉ anfis 2 included th ec ca2 and hco₃ˉ anfis 3 included th ec and hco₃ˉ anfis 4 included th and ec three mfs were applied to each variable to minimise the number of possibilities in final decision making perez et al 2010 the most practical and effective model to predict groundwater quality was determined by the highest correlation coefficient between the parameters and the number of input variable hence anfis 1 best predicted the nitrate concentration value ashiyani and suryanarayana 2015 investigated the gwqi based on fuzzy model and bp neural network with a time series the ph tds sar ca2 mg2 so₄2ˉ and clˉ were set as input data the analysis was conducted during pre monsoon and post monsoon based on the modelling the groundwater quality during pre monsoon season is better than the post monsoon water the correlation of r value and rmse between the observed and estimated gwqi were analyzed and compared to choose the best anfis model for each area yetilmezsoy et al 2011 stated that there are two types of learning algorithms used in anfis hybrid methods and back propagation the gradient descent algorithm is the most popular optimization algorithm applied to identify the parameters of anfis however the size of learning rate would affect the learning process where the small size of learning rate which is prone to get stuck in the local point due to its slow learning process and too large a learning rate will never converge and overshoot the minimum jang 1993 hence a meta heuristic optimization algorithm was applied to overcome the gradient technique related problems jalalkamali 2015 individually combined genetic algorithm ga and partial swarm optimization pso forecasting models with anfis for space time groundwater quality assessment in a complex aquifer system qualitative parameters such as location coordinates monthly groundwater levels and the monthly average of rainfall were added together with chemical parameters as input data to improve quality assessment accuracy the performance of variable hybrid learning algorithms has been compared for their proper tuned changeable parameters for anfis structures to yield optimization and match the output with training data overall both anfis ga and anfis pso modeled spatiotemporal groundwater quality parameters appropriately anfis pso space time model gave the most accurate and satisfactory results in terms of r2 and rmse gholami et al 2017 employed the co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis and gis in their study canfis was used for complicated multi input multi output mimo non linear groundwater quality forecasting based on anfis structure jang et al 1997 gis was used with pre and post processed data to map the spatial distribution of gwqi in different geographic areas lm algorithm was applied to strengthen the performance of canfis the canfis technique increased the accuracy to solve and interpret modelling vagueness singh et al 2007 results indicate that the proposed canfis model can accurately predict the groundwater quality and three critical factors were distinguished in affecting groundwater quality namely mean water table the aquifer transmissivity and distance from the pollutant centers table 2 shows the summary comparison of the input variables desired output performance index membership functions and inference systems the application of anfis proved to be the excellent prediction tool in nonlinear and multivariable analysis tutmez et al 2006 sahu et al 2011 ashiyani and suryanarayana 2015 according to the reviewed papers the utilization of anfis in predicting groundwater quality involves the structure and parameter identification phases of systems the optimization of anfis model needs to consider the appropriate input data performance index and membership function in order to increase efficiency of desired output in the fuzzy inference algorithm the crisp input is interpreted and mapped out in the set of fuzzy classification kumar 2010 the logical rule decides the proper fis in the form of if then statement to interpret the relationship between input variables and output variables amirkhani et al 2015 if then rules are the most common and proficient linguistic form in the modelling field most of the studies used the first order ts inference system due to its high performance in solving the complicated problem in consequent linear equation form the minimum value of training error decides the optimal structure of anfis model anfis can be a robust predictive tool for modelling space time distribution of groundwater quality but longer time is needed when processing big data sets compared to ann najah et al 2011 hence variable hybrid approaches have been introduced to improve the convergence speed of anfis the reduction of search space dimension increased the convergence speed better than the bp algorithm shoorehdeli et al 2009 the application of a hybrid algorithm such as ga and pso stabilised the non linear system and increased the speed of learning rate fraile ardanuy and zufiria 2005 shoorehdeli et al 2009 the powerful combination of both fuzzy logic theories and ffnn dominates in efficiency in adaptation ability to identify complex and nonlinear data trends and capability to learn in shortest time sahin and erol 2017 2 3 evolutionary computation approaches evolutionary computation commonly known as ea is a stochastic optimization technique pioneered by fogel et al 1966 the main focus of ea is the learning and evolution process of adaptation and optimization which creates a new strategy in problem solving the classification of ea includes evolutionary strategies es ga genetic programming gp and evolutionary programming ep de jong et al 1997 whitley 2001 lozano 2002 these algorithms require calibration to estimate the relevant parameters the initial population is generated randomly and the potential solution or population of individuals is iteratively applied until the fittest individuals are selected they are derived by the same conceptual basis of the evolutionary process via the variation operators selection mutation reproduction and survival of the fittest in this section the evolutionary computation application in groundwater quality is discussed in further detail ea approach is reliable in providing a fast solution to a complex and challenging problem specifically in hydrology and water management simpson et al 1994 franchini 1996 haddad and marino 2011 hashmi et al 2011 fallah mehdipour et al 2012 nourani et al 2012 shiri et al 2013 the most classic and popular type of ea is a ga is originally developed by holland 1975 ga conducts a stochastic random search in solution space by imitations and adaptations of the biological evolution process cartwright 1994 the learning mechanism of ga involves the iteration process to reproduce the generation of offspring from the selection of best adapted individuals through the variation operators such as selection mutation and crossover rowe and roberts 1998 previous application of ga in water resources assessment has proven to be one of the best approaches to search global optimum solutions wang 1991 aral and guan 1996 gumrah et al 2000 singh and datta 2006 yeh et al 2006 built a groundwater quality monitoring structure using the ga method the ga and factorial kriging were integrated to solve the optimal problem of chosen regionalised factors nine variables were selected in designing the groundwater model ec tds clˉ na ca2 mg2 mn2 fe³ and so₄2ˉ the integration of ga and factorial kriging successfully portrayed the spatial variation of groundwater quality patterns of various scale in taiwan zhang and dong 2009 presented a classical exploratory projection method based on the application of ga to evaluate groundwater quality the wqi was constructed based on projection pursuit where the simulation was generated from high dimensional to low dimensional according to groundwater quality criteria however in an objective method some discrimination of the index with the addition of restriction may occur the complex and restricted non linear optimization process leads to frequent fluctuation which decreases the convergence rate speed of ga chipperfield and fleming 1995 hence the hybrid approach of ga and traditional optimization technique was used to overcome the problem accordingly the model applied to the groundwater quality evaluation performed well in determining groundwater quality classification gp has been used universally in global optimization solution classification and automatic variable selection the concept of gp was developed by koza 1992 where the basic approach is closely related to the field of ga gp employs a decision tree structure to illustrate individuals and simplify the optimization problem in the form of mathematical expression the flexible tree structures comprehensively determine the fittest function for the optimal solution where the gp application leads in establishing the best formula potentially for high mathematical complexity janardhanan and datta 2012 proposed the application of gp technique in estimating and evaluating the hydrologic system and groundwater problems recently aryafar and khosravi 2019 presented a method based on gp to evaluate the correlation between the input and output variables the aim was to study the capability of gp in groundwater quality parameter prediction and to compare the prediction performance of gp with other ai techniques ten different functions were applied to an enormous number of generations range from 100 up to 1000 to design the most appropriate formulation with low prediction error the functions consisted of the basic arithmetic operator mathematical functions logical expression and boolean operators fallah mehdipour et al 2013 the population parameters in each tree structure were iteratively modified to measure the fitness value in a specific number of generations the performance values r2 rmse and mean absolute relative error mare of gp were well satisfied compared to ann and anfis showing that the proposed gp method is robust against other ai methods in prediction modelling the practical gp generates the probabilistic formulation of the set of relations between variables khalaj et al 2019 implemented gene expression programming gep technique and grey relational analysis gra to identify and appraise groundwater classification this study focused on the impact of human activities and climate change in the degradation of groundwater quality the main factor that influences the groundwater salinity was determined by gra gep is the extension of the gp algorithm where the individual is expressed in fixed length linear strings ferreira 2002 the simulation of temporal variation in ec by gep was divided into three spatial zones the ideal fit relationship between groundwater level and ec was ranked based on different time scales of input variables during training and testing procedure ec values showed an increasing trend during 1971 2010 which is due to groundwater recharge groundwater level fluctuations due to uncontrolled groundwater extraction intensive agriculture and trends in precipitation and temperature extremes contributed to degradation in water quality results indicate that gep with supervised learning is a promising new method for non linear relations the learning and optimization concept are the same for each type of ea and at the same time the principles are simple yet flexible participation of variation operators facilitates the learning process in the evolutionary process from the review each type of ea has benefits and limitations ga and gp are the most popular algorithms table 3 both types efficiently demonstrate optimised complex behaviour at every level and have the potential to hybridise with other ea methods generating a larger number of efficient solutions martinez estudillo et al 2006 grosan and abraham 2007 despite that ga is sensitive to the population size and the selection of the primary parameter rate such as mutation and crossover the unsatisfactory preference might disrupt the efficiency and increase the time consumed in the evolutionary process meanwhile the gp method suffers from slow execution and swapping process to the main memory due to a large amount of population data overall the application of ea in decision making will benefit in the ability to self adapt to decision principle self efficacy and performance alteration in matching the patterns during the search for optimum solutions reed et al 1967 rosenberg 1970 the application of gp overpowered the other ai methods such as ann svm and anfis shiri et al 2013 aryafar and khosravi 2019 however only a few recent studies reported the assessment of groundwater quality using ea technique hence extensive and thorough research on the groundwater quality assessment and forecasting utilizing ea is encouraged to verify the prediction capability and efficiency 2 4 support vector machine svm svm is another simple supervised learning algorithm introduced by cortes and vapnik 1995 which is used in both pattern classification and regression analysis svm creates a boundary called hyper plane to minimise the generalisation error between the separation of the data class and the data amari and wu 1999 there are four major concepts in classifying prediction known as the separation by hyper plane kernel method the soft margin svm and the hard margin svm cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 due to its well built theoretical framework svm has been successfully applied to solve various problems in surface water and groundwater bray and han 2004 khan and coulibaly 2006 lin et al 2006 cimen 2008 liu et al 2009 liao et al 2011 yoon et al 2011 tabari et al 2012 kisi et al 2015 khalil et al 2005 studied the potential of svm for groundwater quality evaluation in the sumas blaine aquifer the focus of this study was to develop a model of precise input and output variable behaviours to simulate the nitrogen concentrations in the groundwater at the specific receptors the type of kernel function was decided via trial and error methods using the optimal value of the rbf kernel parameter four statistical algorithms svm ann lwpr locally weighted projection regression and rvm relevance vector machines were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and better generalisation through the study svm offered an effective mechanism for avoiding the occurrence of overtraining allowing the svm to achieve the best generalisation however the prediction accuracy of svm was generally low and ann was the most accurate prediction model compared to svm lwpr and rvm overall the responses generated by all four learning algorithms had acceptable accuracy and faster prediction pattern recognition compared to physically based modelling mt3d liu et al 2009 presented the data driven svm technique derived from the theory of structural risk minimisation by applying it to a multivariate non linear system groundwater quality indicators such as ph tds th so₄2ˉ clˉ no₃ n no₂ n and fˉ were randomly selected to process input parameters in achieving robustness an attempt was made to design the desired output of groundwater quality classification the kernel trick class of algorithms for pattern analysis transformed the unified indicator from the input space to higher dimensional space the suggested svm exhibited favourable performance in pattern recognition also the authors validated that svm works well with support vector regression svr algorithm for non linear functions and multi category classification thus the svm model showed significant potential in interpreting and predicting the relationships between complex non linear systems and karst groundwater quality classification and input factor the svm application simulated the level concentration and distribution of nitrate in groundwater arabgol et al 2016 the optimal svm model was developed based on the appropriate input parameter the type of kernel function kernel parameters capacity parameter c and ԑ insensitive loss function powerfully affect the performance of svm based classification task singh et al 2011 there are four types of frequently used kernel functions linear polynomial radial basis rbf and sigmoid among the four types rbf was identified as a significant kernel function due to its smaller estimated error a map of the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration was developed by the integration of the svm model and gis the study showed the robust performance of svm in presenting a simple yet systematic approach for nitrate concentration prediction with minimal input data hybrid svm with gis was acceptable in terms of accuracy plot of nitrate distribution when compared to the fate and transport model results isazadeh et al 2017 demonstrated the svm approach for identifying the statistical distribution of groundwater quality variations the predictions of ec na and so₄2 uncertainties were modeled based on an ann and svm the nine supplementary and five primary inputs in march and september 2002 2014 were used for training gamma test was applied to identify the optimal and most promising input variables ph ec and the concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 clˉ hco₃ˉ and so₄2ˉ in the svm method both of the data points and outputs were plotted in x and y coordinates and the optimal hyper plane predefined classes the estimation of groundwater qualitative parameters relies on the uncertainty propagation techniques where the p and the d factors were used to calibrate the output uncertainties generally the accuracy level is related to the uncertainty value meaning that the lower uncertainty value defines the high accuracy the training result depicts that values of p and d factors of the svm model were lower than for ann which highlights that the uncertainty value of svm is lesser however for forecasting data ann had the best rmse and correlation of efficiency e values yet both svm and ann performed better than geostatistical interpolation techniques for mapping ec na and so₄2 hence svm gave a satisfactory model uncertainty performance with x y coordinate classification function compared to the ann the main advantage of svm modelling is it increases robustness of the classification results for non parametric and non linearly separable datasets and has superior generalisation ability based on the structural risk minimisation which makes it possible to predict unseen data cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 smola et al 2003 comparative studies between svm and ann have shown that the generalisation capability of svm is greater than ann thus yielding higher accuracy yoon et al 2011 yadav et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 svm experiences limitations mostly in determining optimal kernel function and its parameter burges 1998 coicca 2013 even though the generalisation performance is better than conventional techniques of classification problem solving the large size of data sets and too much noise in data sets may lower the computational speed thereby causing overlapping of data points osuna et al 1997 feng et al 2009 the svm with rbf kernel function achieves the best in non linear classification performance ali and smith miles 2006 overall svm is an effective classifier method and offers a significant improvement in the groundwater quality analysis with a suitable selection of kernel function and parameters table 4 shows the details of the reviewed svm 3 evaluation and assessment this review has focused on the implementations of ai for groundwater quality modelling the analysis has led to the following observations 1 among the published state of the art research and critical evaluation of ai tools ann and anfis are the most extensively used for assessing groundwater quality up to now ann has become one of the most promising and popular tools to model and simulate complex hydrogeological systems despite some drawbacks such as local minima problems and long training time the authors believe that further studies or several approaches will help to improve the ann s learning rates and performance accuracy anfis which combines the advantages of ann and fuzzy inference systems exhibits marginally better prediction for smaller data both ann and anfis provide satisfactory results in assessment of groundwater quality however the ann technique is preferable for large and complex hydrogeological data sets due to its stability and flexibility estimation peng and wen 1999 have shown that ann is the most effective tool in estimating and systemizing data in wide and various fields 2 recently ea and svm in predictive model applications have outperformed ann and anfis due to their generalization ability and faster optimization fallah mehdipour et al 2012 isazadeh et al 2017 both ea and svm depend on their capability to independently generate new structural solutions to all types of optimization problems by implementing feature selection technique to transform the input sequences into feature vectors even so limited studies have been done on the individual application of ea and svm related to groundwater quality assessment and forecasting hence it is recommended to perform additional research regarding the suitability and effectiveness of these applications for groundwater quality assessment 3 in ai methods some basic concern arises in developing an efficient modelling structure which includes the selection of the input parameters the impacts of initial uncertainty and the criteria of model structure the selection of input parameters must include considerations such as correlation analysis statistical analysis and the characteristics of study area 4 fig 3 shows the input variables that have been applied in ai modelling for groundwater quality from fig 3 one can conclude that so₄2ˉ is the most frequently used input variable followed by clˉ mg2 ca2 ph ec tds and th the analysis revealed that the mentioned parameters strongly correlated within each other and were frequently selected as the input parameters for groundwater quality adnan et al 2019 rajesh et al 2019 these input parameters are effectively verifying the groundwater quality for both drinking and irrigation 5 ec is said to be the most significant and crucial groundwater quality parameter which is used to predict the concentration of certain ions such as ca2 cl mg2 and na yesilnacar et al 2008 kumar 2010 higher ec and tds values indicate the increase in salinity which leads to decrease in water body health the elevated concentrations of heavy metals and major ions can significantly impact human health soil plants and aquatic life the selection of suitable parameters in response to their purposes and hydrogeologic characteristics notably help to improve the groundwater quality assessment kheradpisheh et al 2015 other parameters such as arsenic soils location of well etc were less commonly used in the reviewed papers 6 generally the predictive model performance was evaluated by using a statistical expression such as e mae mse r r2 cv corel vaf mare nash sutcliffe coefficient and rmse fig 4 shows most of the research analyzed used r2 and rmse as the best metrics to evaluate the groundwater quality prediction the functions of individual statistical metrics vary depending on the model performance aspects and uncertainty analysis the model forecast accuracy could be more robust by applying the effective combination of the goodness of fit and at least one of the relative absolute error measures 4 recommendations this review focuses on the learning mechanism of ai applications in groundwater quality modelling hence the recommendations to improve groundwater quality assessment drawn from the comprehensive review are presented as follows 1 in depth exploration of ai application showed that ann is the most satisfactory structure for complex and large data training especially in hydrology the ann modelling specialised in calibrating the predictive uncertainty with the ability to self adapt and imitate the behaviour of hydrogeological systems using deep ensembles daliakopoulos et al 2005 ann is extensively used in groundwater quality prediction and forecasting with high level of accuracy due to its capability to identify the trends and patterns in non linear data farmaki et al 2010 izeboudjen et al 2014 the trial and error approach is frequently applied to determine the proper architecture of ann among the types of ann models mlp is considered as the best structure of ann due to its capability to handle large input space for classification and regression as well as its stable architecture with excellent representation skill despite the low number of applications in groundwater quality modelling the implementation of mlp with back propagation technique increases the efficiency of the groundwater quality simulation hagan et al 1997 haykin 2007 2 appropriate selection of input for groundwater quality forecasting is essential in improving the accuracy and effectiveness of forecasting models there are two types of input selection model free and model based fernando et al 2009 model free input variable selection is a simple implementation of input without being dependent on the model structure and calibration while model based properly identifies the strongest influence and correlation between model input and output from the reviewed papers the input parameters are mostly selected based on the model based technique and physical analysis despite the efficiency of model based input the input consideration is influenced by some modelling performance such as mse and r2 hence conducting the comparative study between model based and model free is essential to identify the ability and suitability of these techniques in groundwater quality modelling 3 the hybridization or integration method has shown effective positive feedback compared to individual classification tools sahu et al 2011 inthachot et al 2015 jalalkamali and jalalkamali 2018 rajaee et al 2020 hence the hybridization method is suggested to improve the accuracy performance high dimensional and non linear time series data and to overcome the drawbacks of ann ea is established as a potential technique to enhance the uncertainty subjected to random noise and helps to prevent premature convergence and overtraining of ann there are three criteria to optimize the ann model based on ea weight adaptations to create new generations with high fitness value evolution of ann structure and learning rules fig 5 shows the detailed integration of ann and ea the integration of ann and ea involved the learning and evolving of ann as an excellent intelligence tool to solve the problems in design and realization of ann for groundwater quality prediction 4 the ann performance is also impacted by the appropriateness of input parameters the implementation of pca can aid in selection of the most pertinent input variables by reducing a number of correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables preserving the essence of original data 5 conclusion the hydrologic functions and state of groundwater systems are complicated and difficult to interpret without the aid of computational tools this paper provides an in depth review of the various ai approaches techniques and methods from the literature review anns anfis ea and svm have proved to be efficient and precise tools in determining and managing groundwater quality at the same time the hybridization of appropriate machine learning is significantly powerful compared to individual tools consequently ai modelling techniques can be beneficial in designing and planning

11932,the utilization of solar energy to distillate the brackish water is paramount to deal with the environmental downsides along with the inadequate reserve of fossil fuels in recent years many

barely 2 5 of it is potable water gude et al 2011 deng et al 2010 additionally near 40 of the world s population suffers from extreme freshwater scarcity and by the year 2025 the percentage will reach approximately 60 el dessouky and ettouney 2002 the extensive water uses in residential industrial and irrigation sectors lead to over usage of groundwater as well as surface water worsening the environmental and ecological systems in addition arsenic and fluoride contamination and increases in the groundwater salinity cause a serious risk to the human well being das et al 2020 on the other hand global warming largely affects many parts of low lying areas around the world the majority of potable water demand is met by using conventional power sources however limited reserve of conventional fuels and global warming associated with using those fuels driving to integrate renewable energy sources sarker et al 2016 2018 bib sarker et al 2016 najmul hoque and das 2013 das et al 2017 das and al abdeli 2017 bib sarker et al 2018 panchal et al 2016 in this regard solar distillation is considered an important progression for the conversion of salty or brackish water into pure drinking water as an alternative to conventional energy sources this would be more beneficial in those areas where the grid connection is not available and salinity is a major concern the solar desalination process supports to get pure water with a comprehensible mechanism free energy and fresh surroundings fath 1998 nowadays solar stills sss are used in a wide range to meet freshwater demand because of its low energy consumption relatively easy technology and non requirement of greatly experienced labor for sustenance work distillation is an effective thermal energy dependent action applied for removing contaminants from unclean water manchanda and kumar 2018 the most crucial water desalination methods are multi effect distillation med multistage flash distillation msfd reverse osmosis ro vapor compression distillation vc electro dialysis humidification dehumidification process and freezing most of these processes use non renewable energy sources for water desalination immediate actions are needed to preserve the depletable energy sources by using renewable resources the solar distillation system uses solar energy to generate freshwater yield fwy from impure water although seawater is ample in coastal regions drinkable water is not attainable in sufficient quantity in this regard the solar distillation process is beneficial for these areas because of its construction flexibility using locally available materials although the solar distillation process is clean and environment friendly the productivity is lower compared to the traditional desalination system for example a simple ss can provide 2 5 l m2 day fwy velmurugan and srithar 2011 therefore in recent years substantial efforts have been carried out to develop the solar

11932,the utilization of solar energy to distillate the brackish water is paramount to deal with the environmental downsides along with the inadequate reserve of fossil fuels in recent years many developments have been carried out to improve the production yield of solar desalination system due to its low production rate and the inherent seasonal and diurnal fluctuation of solar resources the objective of this paper is to deliver a comprehensive review on the recent advancement of different individual and combined parameters affecting the performance of solar distillation system the integration of fins nanofluids solar collectors phase change materials pcms and energy storing materials into the distillation system are also included in detail in the present work in addition the usage of vacuum technology reflector condenser heat pump refrigeration cycle vibratory harmonic effect and cover cooling method are also considered as efficient modifications it is reported that the

technologies is a sustainable solution for uninterrupted supply of fresh water in off grid remote coastal areas finally the future research directions are also identified in this review work keywords solar distillation nanofluids energy storage renewable sources combined effects 1 introduction the solar distillation process is essential for living beings as 97 5 of the surface water is briny and barely 2 5 of it is potable water gude et al 2011 deng et al 2010 additionally near 40 of the world s population suffers from extreme freshwater scarcity and by the year 2025 the percentage will reach approximately 60 el dessouky and ettouney 2002 the extensive water uses in residential industrial and irrigation sectors lead to over usage of groundwater as well as surface water worsening the environmental and ecological systems in addition arsenic and fluoride contamination and increases in the groundwater salinity cause a serious risk to the human well being das et al 2020 on the other hand global warming largely affects many parts of low lying areas around the world the majority of potable water demand is met by using conventional power sources however limited reserve of conventional fuels and global warming associated with using those fuels driving to integrate renewable energy sources sarker et al 2016 2018 bib sarker et al 2016 najmul hoque and das 2013 das et al 2017 das and al abdeli 2017 bib sarker et al 2018 panchal et al 2016 in this regard solar distillation is considered an important progression for the conversion of salty or brackish water into pure

thermal and electrical efficiency 3 3 corrugated wick type ss cwss with a porous material and inclined reflector matrawy et al 2015 modified the productivity of ss by using corrugated evaporative surface in combination with a porous material and inclined reflector with 30 tilt angle and upright direction black clothes as the porous material decreased the heat capacity and became saturated by the capillary action of water placed on the corrugated surface inclined reflectors increased the incident solar radiation on the sss the proposed wick type ss improved productivity by about 34 in comparison with the simple basin case 3 4 single basin v corrugated absorber solar still vcass using wick and pcm shalaby et al 2016 developed a modern design ss with inherent pcm and v corrugated absorber paraffin wax was taken as a suitable pcm due to the variation of its melting temperature limit between the range of temperature of single absorber plate kind sss and it also contains high latent heat of fusion radhwan 2005 ansari et al 2013 an uncoated jute cloth was also used as wick material for the increment of the thermal output of the ss using 25 kg of basin water the daily do of

process from water to glass was reduced with the use of ec in this work condenser acted as an efficient and additional mass and heat sink and provided 53 2 incremented do the use of aluminum oxide nanoparticles enhanced the fwy by 116 as compared to css when nanofluids were used without the operation of a vacuum fan the productivity was approximately 76 3 8 ss with pcm nanoparticles and several absorbing materials in the basin experiments were directed by shanmugan et al 2018 with the application of c18h36o2 and al2o3 in the basin plate of approaches utilizing a drip button to stream brine water gradually on energy storing materials in the absorber plate in summer and winter this advanced technique was applied by using different absorbing matters namely cotton wick jute wick fin combined with a cotton wick and fin united with jute wick in the basin the production rate varied due to the effect of different types of wick material with pcm the use of c18h36o2 as pcm and al2o3

using fgn fgn and pcm fgn combined with fcm fgn pcm and fcm were 50 28 65 56 15 73 8 respectively the combined effect of fgn and pcm provided hot water and the saturated vapor pressure of water increased with the use of fgn the film cooling method gave a higher value of water glass temperature difference it was also noticed that approximately a 13 enhanced output was achieved when water depth reduction occurred from 2 cm to 0 5 cm 3 10 ss performance enhancement incorporating solar photovoltaic fpc and hot air eltawil et al eltawil and omara 2014 developed a system consisting of a single slope ss ec solar air collector spraying unit fpc and perforated tubes with these modifications productivity was 51 148 higher in developed ss than css the output in developed ss enhanced by 82 and 56 respectively without employing a condenser with the application of distributed hot water in active and passive sprays 3 11 hybrid multiple effect diffusion med ss with wick and waste heat

basin 3 15 continuous solar still coupled with electric water heater ewh battery pv panel and reflector kabeel et al 2021 evaluated the performance of a continuous sds incorporating ewh and pv panel in the ss arrangement fig 4 in order to provide 24 h continuous distillation process an ewh was placed at the ss basin for heating the basin water during night and also in the early morning hours solar batteries charged by pv panels at sunshine periods were employed to power the ewh a thermostat in the ewh ensures the continuous working of the ewh the experimental outcomes reveal that the accumulated fwy varied between 10 631 and 12 087 ml m2 day for 24 h continuous sds the accumulated fwy of the continuous sds improved by 159 3 177 9 compared to ss without ewh 4 ss with pcm and energy storing material 4 1 effects of pcm a pcm is an element which stores and releases a large amount of energy when it is melted and solidified at a certain temperature prakash and velmurugan 2015 heat absorption occurs when the matter alters its state from solid to liquid and heat liberation occurs when the matter alters from a liquid to solid for this reason pcm s are also defined as latent heat thermal energy storage lhtes systems the energetic and exergetic functioning of a sds was enhanced by introducing paraffin wax as pcm and pin finned heat sink yousef and hassan 2019b the black steel mesh fibers were also employed with paraffin wax and the daily fwy was 9 5 16 8 and 13 higher than the css for ss with pcm pcm including pin fins and still with pcm and black steel mesh fibers respectively the use of packaged glass ball layer filled with thermal oil as a lhtes medium in a fpc and parabolic trough collector integrated single slope ss provided 203 and 172 enhanced productivity in summer and winter respectively compared to css madiouli et al 2020 in order to improve the effectiveness and do in the concentrator coupled hemispherical basin cchb ss arunkumar et al 2013 added paraffin wax as pcm six copper balls having a diameter of 28 mm were constructed and filled with paraffin wax productivity increased by 26 when pcm was integrated into the cchb ss a theoretical model was developed by dashtban and tabrizi 2011 for a ss with and without including pcm and the daily do was 6 7 and 5 1 kg m2 day respectively kantesh 2012 used bitumen as pcm and concluded that the efficiency of the ss without pcm was approximately 25 19 and with pcm was 27 the performance of a stepped ss was evaluated utilizing inherent lhtes and the efficiency and overall do of the ss was 57 and 4 6 l day m2 respectively radhwan 2005 a solar concentrator distillation system using paraffin wax as pcm was developed by chaichan et al 2016 the concentrating efficiency system heating efficiency and productivity was enhanced approximately by 50 47 157 8 and 783 respectively beeswax was used as pcm in a single slope sbss integrated with parabolic dish reflector kuhe and edeoja 2016 and the productivity increased by 62 a comparative review of the productivity of ss applying different nanofluids and pcms is represented in fig 5 a maximum productivity of 73 80 is found when fgn pcm and fcm are used yields from various pcm such as paraffin wax bitumen and beeswax are 26 27 and 62 respectively the use of pcm along with al2o3 gives lower productivity of 11 6 thermo physical properties of different pcm used in solar distillation systems are listed in table 4 from reviews it is noted that paraffin wax has been preferred as pcm in most research works the reasons for choosing paraffin wax are its uniform melting characteristics reliability medium storage moderate cost and safety sharma et al 2009 lauric acid al hamadani and shukla 2011 myristic acid al hamadani and shukla 2014 sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate al harahsheh et al 2018 cacl2 6h2o kabeel et al 2018b bitumen khan et al 2019 have also been used as pcm in various researches to enhance ss productivity 4 2 energy storage materials esms the productivity of css was improved by incorporating low cost esms for instance spherical ball salt storage and sponge samuel et al 2016 in this study a sponge was used in the basin plate for providing capillary action both the spherical ball salt storage and sponge enhanced the free surface area of water resulting in higher do from the experimental results maximum fwy was found 3 7 kg m2 for spherical shaped ball salt storage as compared to the css with sponges pebbles calcium stones white marble stones black stones and iron scraps were used as sensible heat storage material shsm in a single slope sbss to augment the do shanmugan et al 2012 the production rates were 1 81 4 28 1 89 2 35 and 1 68 kg m2 hr for pebbles calcium stones white marble stones black stones and iron scraps respectively panchal et al panchal and shah 2014 used pebbles black granite gravel and calcium stones as shsm in a dbss among which maximum do 74 were found from calcium stones as compared to others the use of mild steel pieces as energy storing material rajaseenivasan et al 2015 anburaj et al 2013 in single and double basin sss gave the highest exergy efficiencies of 1 412 and 2 072 respectively black granite gravel improved the pure water yield from a modified ss by 17 20 sakthivel and shanmugasundaram 2008 sponge liners of various thicknesses 3 5 7 10 and 12 mm were used in the inner wall surfaces of a single slope sbss arjunan et al 2011 to augment the productivity and with an optimum thickness 5 cm 35 2 higher output was found than css sponges were added by bassam et al rababa h 2003 to enlarge the exposure area of the water in the ss sponge blocks having 6 cm faces sponge cubes to basin water volume ratio of 20 and 7 cm brine water depth were the favorable conditions for getting maximum productivity do increase from 18 to 273 as compared to the css narayana et al lalitha narayana and ramachandra raju 2019 used tetrahedral sponge in a basin and found that the high evaporation rate and capillary reaction resulted in the incremented do and was varied from 45 to 219 when compared to css the use of graphite as high thermal conductive esm in a sbss improved the daily productivity by 74 89 80 05 than css kabeel et al 2018c the usage of bitumen black ink and charcoal in groundwater desalination system enhanced the fwy by 25 35 6 87 and 18 42 respectively ouar et al 2017 the freshwater production capacity of ss largely depends on the absorbing materials fig 6 depicts the variation of do with different absorbing substances in the ss it is remarked from fig 6 that a maximum yield of 96 is obtained when sponges are used as absorbing material combined with fins in a stepped ss on the other hand the use of dyes gives a minimum yield of 10 5 conclusions the present research has discussed extensive reviews on some key designing and operating factors including individual as well as combined parameters applicable for sdss and impacting the productivity of ss the key findings of this comprehensive review are listed as follows the maximum productivity is found from a single slope sbss in summer and winter when the glass cover inclination angles are 15 and 45 respectively among different condensing layer substances copper provides higher do than glass and plastics because of its high thermal conductivity the fwy is enhanced by using corrugated plate wick materials baffles and drifting absorbers in ss basin a hybrid corrugated double wick absorber sds incorporating internal reflector ec vacuum technology and cu2o nanofluid is found as the most superior corrugated absorber ss design providing maximum fwy of 285 10 compared to css the highest fwys of 7625 and 7275 l m2 day were obtained for cwss with cu2o and al2o3 nanoparticles respectively high thermal conductive nanoparticles for instance al2o3 sno2 zno cuo sic go fe3o4 mno2 tio2 cu2o and carbon nanotubes boost the ss productivity by enhancing the water glass temperature difference the utilization of cuo nanofluid significantly improved the productivity by 300 with maximum fwy of 9220 l m2 in a rotated drum ss integrated with ec and water heater a tubular ss incorporated with parabolic concentrator solar tracking system pcst tss and black cloth provided 676 enhanced fwy a triple basin sds including cover cooling technique and parabolic dish concentrator gave the supreme productivity of 16 94 kg m2 day the use of fresnel lens in a sbss improved the daily efficiency and fwy by 84 7 and 467 respectively the experimentation of a pcm integrated sds can be carried out for an extended period of a day even when the solar intensity fluctuates extremely due to its property of providing invariant output in the thermal field of energy pcms like paraffin wax myristic acid lauric acid stearic acid bitumen beeswax sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and cacl2 6h2o have been used extensively to enhance the fwy of sss out of all sss integrated with pcm the most significant fwy improvement of 783 is found for a concentrator assisted distillation system utilizing paraffin wax as pcm esms namely white marble stones calcium stones metallic wiry sponges sand black rubber gravel black stones pebbles graphite iron scraps and black granite gravel are used to store the heat energy from the sun a single slope ss employing sponge cubes as esm provided the highest do enhancement of 273 in comparison to css recent studies also included condenser heat pump reflector heating element sts refrigeration cycle cover cooling method vacuum technology and vibratory harmonic effect which also help to boost the productivity of sss a hybrid med sds with cotton flannel wick and waste heat source provided maximum fwy of 18 02 kg m2 day among the identified ss designs a tubular ss including wick material and parabolic concentrator solar tracking system is appeared to be very effective with productivity improvement of 676 6 future recommendations although substantial research work has been directed considering the energy efficiency of a ss very few studies analyzed exegetic efficiency further research is warranted considering the effect of irreversibility and exergy destruction on system performance the optimal operating parameters can be obtained using intelligent approaches for instance particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm etc long short term memory lstm and multi layer perceptron mlp neural network model optimized by the imperialist competition algorithm ica can also be employed to predict the fwy of sss the future works can be extended by the computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis to find the optimal design parameters which is lacking in recent literature moreover the system could be evaluated by hybridization with renewable energy resources and battery storage for continuous supply of freshwater throughout 24 h in stand alone applications for the sss integrated with lhtes systems development of physics based mathematical are crucial for the fundamental understanding of transient heat and the mass transfer mechanism energy balance equations for the melting and solidification of pcm momentum equations and water evaporation throughout the process in the system non linear transient numerical models and finite difference methods can be applied to develop such models for properly predicting the physical processes in the sdss future research can be performed through the optimization of film water applied for ccm considering the cooling film types thickness

11933,to understand the current research output on arsenic as removal and research related to the as contamination a bibliometric analysis based on scopus database was carried out the analysis includes the research covering the leading countries and year wise literature outputs bibliometric analysis revealed increasing trend in research published on as removal more than 1200 articles using physico chemical methods during 1995 onwards and united states of america usa as leading contributor among different research institutions chinese academy of sciences has contributed maximally to research articles reaching up to 950 and maximum 635 research articles were published in the journal environmental science and technology with respect to as removal using physico chemical methods with respect to as removal using biological methods around 400 research articles were recorded during 1995 onwards and maximum article contribution 1052 was registered for china followed by usa 964 based on scopus data 2021 maximum 222 articles on as removal using biological methods were recorded for the journal chemosphere the present review emphasizes on currently available physico chemical as well as emerging treatment processes for the removal of as generally occurring as arsenite and arsenate from drinking water it has been suggested by various studies that a combination of low cost physico chemical treatment methodologies like ion exchange reverse osmosis precipitation filtration and adsorption along with biological methods can be a safe alternative for as removal from drinking water overall the study suggests that there is a strong need for further research on efficient processes involving lab to land approaches for as removal from groundwater in order to reduce the toxicity and contamination of as in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic bibliometric analysis bioremediation ion exchange removal technologies ultrafiltration 1 introduction currently a very large population is affected by arsenic as contamination wang et al 2018 therefore the toxicity arising from as enrichment in sedimentary aquifers beyond the recommended limits causing contamination of drinking water is a matter of global concern bhattacharya et al 2004 mcgrory et al 2017 in view of as toxicity to various human organ systems farrell et al 2001 kumar et al 2004 vieira et al 2017 the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency us epa have suggested 10 μg l of as concentration in drinking water as the safety limit for human consumption however health studies performed in netherlands indicated that even the as standard of 10 μg l in drinking water is not safe for human consumption ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a and may induce different kind of toxicity ahmad et al 2020a noteworthy new jersey and denmark have set and adapted the maximum contaminant level for as as 5 μg l starting from the year 2006 and 2017 respectively moreover in netherlands the authorities are trying to achieve the level of as even below 1 μg l ahmad and bhattacharya 2019b ahmad et al 2020a the expenses towards lowering as in drinking water below 1 μg l in comparison to health maintenance of as victims affected by lung cancer would lead to economic benefit thereby justifying the efforts of authorities to reduce the contaminant level below 1 μg l the toxicity of inorganic as within the current standard thereby needs thorough revision based on comprehensive in vitro as well as field studies in order to safeguard the large numbers of exposed population hence most remarkably the level of as in drinking water must be kept as low as possible because of no certainty on impact of lower as content besides the role of as from another source to exert associated hazard and restrictions in expressing the outcomes under experimental conditions therefore 10 μg l standard of as concentration in drinking water cannot be considered completely safe for human and other organisms the exposure of as to humans is reported to be linked with accumulation in keratin rich parts with the appearance of clinical symptoms of raised pigmentation keratosis and different types of cancers kapaj et al 2006 singh et al 2013 most notably the simultaneous occurrence of as with other ions like fluoride and uranium may severely compromise the human health and socio economic status das et al 2017 2018 patel et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 the toxic effect of as enriched water on human chromosome revealing the identification of two cases of klinefelter s syndrome is reported by singh et al 2013 although both natural and anthropogenic sources ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 a b are responsible for as contamination into surface and groundwater singh et al 2018 the main sources of water contamination causing risks to larger populations around the world are natural in origin arsenic contamination of water under natural environmental condition is considerably influenced by geological hydrological and geochemical attributes of associated aquifers thus in depth understanding of aquifer characteristics in prevailing environmental conditions would help in mitigating the hazardous impact through development of low cost as removal technologies bhattacharya et al 1997 on the other hand the anthropogenic processes responsible for as release into different environmental matrices include industrial activities extensive mining operations and employment of as based preservatives and pesticides with the resultant accumulation in atmospheric as well as terrestrial ecosystem bhattacharya et al 2002 nriagu et al 2007 arsenic is released into the environment as the result of natural activities such as volcanic eruptions and rock weathering and anthropogenic activities including industrial operations mining activities and large scale agricultural application of as based herbicides and pesticides wang and mulligan 2006 su et al 2011 garcía carmona et al 2017 microbe assisted mobilization desorption dissolution and disintegration of as bearing minerals like realgar orpiment and arsenopyrite are important natural sources of groundwater as contamination smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sun et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 a b mazumder et al 2020 the changing climatic conditions may also substantially influence mobility and accumulation in various environmental components arsenic in aqueous environment exists as arsenite as iii and arsenate as v the arsenite being more toxic and mobile as compared to arsenate singh and singh 2018 most notably its enrichment in groundwater of developing countries like india bangladesh pakistan sri lanka and nepal is posing serious human health hazard mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2006 bundschuh et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 singh and singh 2018 thakur et al 2020 the contamination of as with heavy metals like chromium in united states and european countries is also presented coyte et al 2020 parrone et al 2020 medunić et al 2020 the co contamination of naturally released as with fluoride and the challenges linked with remediation in light of present scenario is presented by maity et al 2021 the study has presented health hazards of these contaminants along with trace elements in groundwater and current progresses on available removal technologies entire bangladesh and its adjoining indian states are badly affected by as concentrations in groundwater beyond the who prescribed permissible limit both in terms of area and population argos et al 2010 lu et al 2012 singh et al 2015 additionally more than 36 million people in bangladesh are exposed to as level beyond 50 μg l the standard permissible limit for bangladesh drinking water causing more than 7000 arsenicosis cases rahman et al 2017 in india 70 4 million population are facing the risks of as toxicity from groundwater contamination chakraborty et al 2017 singh et al 2019 thus the indian subcontinent is a hotspot for as contamination and warrants active research in this area in addition to humans as contamination is known to affect the agricultural crops soil characteristics and bacterial community structure robson et al 2013 gregory et al 2014 deepika et al 2016 thouin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a incorporation of as in vegetables and rice irrigated with as enriched groundwater is evidenced in bangladesh mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 large population dependence on freshwater reserves therefore necessitates the development of suitable treatment technology for as removal so as to provide as free drinking water thus it is very important to provide as free water to the exposed population kippler et al 2016 bangladesh west bengal in india and some parts of pakistan have achieved remarkable success on such problems by providing low cost treatment technologies to rural population ngai et al 2006 2007 choy and mckay 2012 sarkar and vogt 2015 in conventional treatment plants numbers of methods are currently being used for as removal from contaminated water some most commonly used technologies of interest are plant and microbe assisted processes co precipitation with alum or iron adsorption on oxide surface and nanocomposites sand filtration adsorptive filtration by using activated alumina ion exchange process oxidation with chlorine and ozone lime treatment and membrane processes such as reverse osmosis gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 feistel et al 2016 kobya et al 2016 lata and samadder 2016 mishra and mahato 2016 o farrell et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 2020b maity et al 2020 furthermore low cost treatment methodologies available for surface water rainwater harvesting systems and use of deeper aquifer sources could serve as potential alternatives of as free water singh and singh 2015 maity et al 2020 while considering the problems prospects and limitations associated with various treatment technologies since last few years several important innovative techniques have been developed in the affected indian subcontinent showing good performance in affected rural and urban areas overall several studies have been performed for identifying the spread and depth of as contamination and also several remediation measures have been developed from time to time globally ahmad et al 2017 a b however a comparative account and a holistic technique derived from conventional and emergent remediation technologies for mitigating as contamination is apparently lacking the rationale for this review lies into lack of information in the area of as removal strategies in terms of country wise contribution articles published in different journals year wise trend in research activities and participating research institutes both nationally and internationally in addition recent information on traditional and emerging as removal techniques along with their advantages and disadvantages are not available in a single article therefore in this review we have investigated various available conventional methods like coagulation filtration oxidation adsorption on different materials like activated carbon nanomaterials etc and emerging technologies like bucket treatment unit removal unit attached to hand pump and membrane filtration for the treatment of as contaminated water from various sources and described the importance of conventional as well as emerging physico chemical membrane separation process composite materials and geological materials and biological processes bioremediation so as to provide the latest information in the area of as remediation furthermore in order to evaluate the trends in research on various physico chemical and biological techniques of as removal a bibliometric analysis 1995 2020 is also presented thus provided information could be harnessed for mitigating as contamination in water to alleviate the hazardous impact on natural ecosystem and human health in an ecofriendly manner 2 methodology the bibliometric analysis was carried out using the scopus database scopus was selected due to its wider indexing of journals as compared to other indexing databases such as the web of science and google scholar scopus covering more than 22 000 research journals is one of the largest indexing databases on a wide range of research areas including science and technology a set of keywords was finalized based on the domain knowledge of the researchers engaged in writing this paper subsequently two search queries were formed the search queries were formulated using and and or as the dividing or integrating factors together with the keywords the first search query involves the addressing of as removal through physical and chemical treatment methods while the second search query addresses the biological treatment methods for removal of as present in water the physical and chemical methods of our concern are coagulation filtration lime softening oxidation sedimentation precipitation adsorption ion exchange and osmosis under biological treatment bioremediation and phytoremediation are the two methods of our primary interest the analysis in scopus was carried out for the past years from 1995 to 2020 the date of analysis was 22nd april 2021 the year wise growth of the research on the topic of as removal was considered along with country specific research outputs on the topic for both the search queries further institute wise and journal wise distributions of research on the topics were also analyzed data not presented institute wise distributions with respect to articles on as removal would display the global scenario of active engagement of different nationally and internationally recognized institution to combat the as toxicity resulting from drinking water contamination the gathered information could be helpful in joint collaboration with top institutions to mitigate the negative consequences of as toxicity the data on journal wise distribution using scopus search tool on the other hand would be helpful in disclosing the involvement of various science and technology journals targeting the removal of heavy metals and metalloids like as from contaminated terrestrial and aqueous environment the research output of india was evaluated in order to observe the research activities of the countries actually affected by as pollution overall bibliometric analysis would be helpful in mapping the research activities pertaining to as removal during past decades the analysis provides an overview of research focus on the subject area and the possible way forward it will also help to locate the gap in current research so that funding opportunities could be directed to relevant and significant areas the bibliometric analysis aided us in streamlining the research articles for the detailed review of the available literature on the topic thus after the bibliometric analysis review of selected existing literature was carried out which helped us to assess the research advancements on the as removal techniques during the last decades a review on advanced and sustainable techniques for as removal was carried out in detail in order to provide an in depth understanding of the topic both original research papers and review articles were considered for this purpose only the articles written in english were considered for the analysis thus it eliminates the possible research articles or reviews in other languages 3 researches on as removal a bibliometric analysis as mentioned previously in order to evaluate the trends in research on topics concerned with as and its removal a bibliometric analysis was carried out using different search queries categorized as physico chemical and biological treatments the first search query on physico chemical methods was title abs key arsenic and title abs key coagulation or filtration or softening or oxidation or sedimentation or precipitation or adsorption or ion exchange or osmosis and pubyear 1994 and pubyear 2021 the query results in a total number of 16 474 research documents published during the past years from 1995 to 2020 starting with merely 149 papers on the topic in 1995 the year 2020 observed a total number of 1241 of papers published within a single year fig 1 this signifies the increasing research attention on the topic the usa was the largest contributor of papers under this category with 3594 papers the second ranked china produced around 3519 papers while india stood 3rd with 1404 papers during the same period with respect to physico chemical methods of as removal fig 2 the growing research on as contamination in countries such as india is an encouraging phenomenon as it is a country affected by disastrous as pollution india produced only four research papers on physico chemical treatment of as removal in 1995 which subsequently increased to a remarkable 130 publications in the year 2020 scopus data based on 2021 indicated that indian research institutes such as the indian institute of technology iit kharagpur and roorkee and university of kalyani are pioneers on the topic and contributed largely to the research on this topic nevertheless apart from india the presence of other as pollution affected countries among the most research performing countries is scanty this needs immediate attention both from the global and local research perspectives and policy makers while india still has a long way to go as compared to the usa or china its current research progress concerning as pollution is motivating for the emerging researchers to develop novel approaches to address the continuously rising as contamination problems based on scopus data 2021 among the research institutes and universities globally chinese academy of sciences cas produced the maximum number of papers on physico chemical methods of as removal with a total of 950 papers during the past period from 1995 to 2020 it is interesting to note that although the usa is the largest contributor to the research on the said topic chinese institutes positioned top amongst the institute wise distribution over the years the us epa that produced 172 papers ranked 4th globally and highest among the institutes in the usa among the journals two significant journals in the area of toxic chemicals environmental science and technology and the journal of hazardous materials produced maximum number of papers during the last 25 years data not presented the second search query on biological treatment methods title abs key arsenic and title abs key bioremediation or phytoremediation or remediation and pubyear 1994 and pubyear 2021 results in significant research documents published during past years since 1995 to 2020 fig 3 it is considerably lower than what was published on physico chemical treatment methods thus we observed an increasing emphasis on physico chemical treatment methods as compared to its biological counterpart based on scopus data 2021 china with 1052 published papers ranked first followed by the usa 964 fig 4 in the case of researches on both biological and physico chemical treatment methods we observed that the differences in number of papers published amongst top three contenders are visibly high it signifies an emerging need to fill this vacuum and more research interests by individual countries in order to address this concern as per the data of scopus 2021 again chinese academy of sciences topped among the research institutes producing the most number of papers 315 during this period among the institutes in the usa university of florida ranked 2nd globally with 84 papers published during the previous 25 years which is significantly lower than the numbers of publications contributed by the chinese academy of sciences during the same period here chemosphere is the leading journal with a total number of 222 papers published during the period overall environmental science and technology journal of hazardous materials chemosphere science of the total environment and environmental pollution are some of the leading journals having significant research publications in the field of as contamination and its physico chemical and biological treatment processes as indicated by scopus data 2021 data not presented 4 arsenic treatment techniques several kinds of treatment techniques have been tested for the removal of as from contaminated systems soil and water arsenate as v form of as can be easily removed due to highly adsorptive and less mobile nature as compared to arsenite as iii form for effective treatment of as contaminated water as iii must be transformed first into as v form through pre oxidation the oxidizing agents like cl2 fecl3 and kmno4 effectively oxidize arsenite to arsenate in this review various as removal techniques have been grouped in four different groups viz coagulation filtration adsorption membrane based filtration and biological techniques for the ease of understanding and their removal nature glimpses on the role of different conventional and emerging as removal strategies cost evaluation during purification management of secondary wastes containing as and effluents discharge with particular reference to argentina have been discussed by litter et al 2019 they suggested three major points including 1 information of as contaminated site 2 community sensitivity and 3 research for the development of less expensive arsenic removal procedures the article published by ahmad et al 2017a has provided an overview of various as removal strategies along with their limitations and advantages they have categorized the as treatment into six important techniques i coagulation ii adsorption iii membrane assisted sequestration iv oxidation by oxidizing agents v biological removal and vi source switching i e search for safe groundwater resources the researchers suggested the thorough analysis of groundwater characteristics in terms of ph content of as in different oxidation states and competing ions while targeting the treatment of as contaminated water some important physico chemical as removal techniques are briefly discussed in following sub sections whereas other techniques have been described in the later sections 4 1 physico chemical techniques for as removal 4 1 1 coagulation filtration techniques the process is based on the utilization of chemical substances coagulants like ferric iron catalyzing the conversion of soluble form of as into insoluble ones the coagulation products containing as thereafter are separated simply by using filtration based on gravity or sand the process of coagulation can also be integrated with microfiltration mf technique for effective reduction of as content in water to be treated this is the most efficient technology in which as v adsorption onto coagulated flocs is followed by removal through filtration song et al 2006 if as exists in the form of arsenite as iii it is pre oxidized to arsenate as v prior to its removal kartinen and martin 1995 coagulants to be used for the purpose are rapidly mixed into water to produce their micro flocs of hydroxide nature which further get agglomerated by moderate stirring in this process negatively charged ions including arsenite are electrostatically adsorbed onto precipitated flocs and finally removed from the sample the coagulant type dosage and extreme of ph may affect the efficiency of the process the ph plays a key role in as removal while considering its coagulation by iron as the optimum ph for this process ranges from 6 0 to 8 5 feistel et al 2016 thakur and mondal 2017 the process efficiency is also largely determined by methodology deployed for as coagulation followed by separation hering et al 2017 as well as the oxidation state of the as performance of alum as compared to ferric sulfate is slightly low the most commonly employed coagulation agents are aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 iron chloride fecl3 and ferrous sulfate feso4 however iron salts are one of the most preferred coagulants fecl3 generates relatively larger amounts of flocs as compared to feso4 álvarez ayuso et al 2008 ravenscroft et al 2009 bilici baskan and pala 2010 oehmen et al 2011 under a given range of ph ferric salts have been proved more efficient in removing as v than alum on a weight basis bilici baskan and pala 2010 wang et al 2014 the process can be applied for the treatment of large volumes of contaminated water with as content in several orders of magnitude higher than the permissible limit 10 μg l additionally the coagulation filtration strategy is simultaneously effective in minimizing the high concentrations of commonly occurring co contaminants since coagulation phenomena for as mitigation is not efficient in reducing the level of as below the who permissible limit it is suggested to be used in combination with other methods such as adsorption bora et al 2018 and membrane filtration the cost of precipitation has been calculated as 10 usd per 1000 l volume of as contaminated water the technology is easy as it uses common chemicals low installation costs and its wide applicability to large amounts of water indicating their applicability in poor areas of indian sub continent however the technique suffers limitation because the large amount of sludge is produced during processing further sludge disposal in landfills could be a potent cause of contamination litter et al 2010 moreover the installation of units for large scale treatment of as contaminated water may be considerably affected from the limitations at field scale hering et al 2017 due to spatial changes in water characteristics another technique for as mitigation using electric current mediated precipitation electrocoagulation has been reported to enhance the effectiveness of removal process the technique is affordable and very much efficient in reducing the as content from aqueous media the process of electrocoagulation involving the anodes comprising of metals like aluminium iron and magnesium has shown promising potential in remediation of as contaminated water most remarkably in comparison to the synthetic compounds assisted coagulation for as removal the electrocoagulation is considerably more efficient gandhimathi et al 2015 bandaru et al 2020 moreover with the rise in duration of electrocoagulation process the sulfate content was lowered down considerably as compared to the chemical coagulation relying on introduction of alum the introduction of electric current causes the oxidation of anode resulting in the formation of metal ions as well as the release of electrons moreover the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are generated from the dissociation of water molecules after applying electric current the formation of metal hydroxides caused by the interaction of positively charged metal ions with hydroxyl ions facilitates the adsorption of metal contaminants of interest since the generation of metal hydroxides is substantially regulated by ph of the aqueous medium to be treated the adjustment of ph for optimum as removal is pre requisite in addition the effectiveness of electrocoagulation process is considerably affected by design of reactor and current density applied kobya et al 2020 the process is able to lower the contaminant level well below the who prescribed limit of 10 μg l the maximum cost for as removal per 1000 l of water was determined to range from 0 22 0 31 usd addy et al 2011 suggesting the process utility in poorer areas of the indian sub continent the technical limitations of wide applications appear in the form of electricity demand together with the sludge production the better application in larger plants to provide as free water could be achieved successfully if continuous supply of electricity could be managed 4 1 1 1 lime softening the process of lime softening involves the mixing of samples with lime leading to formation of solid flocs that can be removed simply by sedimentation the softening is facilitated by addition of lime and lime soda very often caustic soda however is also practiced for reducing the amount of sludge produced the selection of lime or other softening material however is based on the characteristics of water samples intended for purification this technique is typically used for water softening in municipal water systems as well as as removal from contaminated water kartinen and martin 1995 lime softening is also effective in reducing as quantity in water and is dependent on the presence of cl2 and ph of the medium arsenic removal is always higher in presence of cl2 than its absence kartinen and martin 1995 have reported as removal up to 15 for water having 400 μg l as but no cl2 while the removal was up to 80 in water containing cl2 at ph higher than 10 5 study of sorg and logsdon 1978 has also shown that as removal by lime softening is ph dependent addition of lime in water increases the ph and oh concentration that removes mg oh 2 and caco3 as precipitates however ph as valence and presence of competing ions such as sulfate phosphate and bicarbonate are the major constraints arising in this technique the major limitation of this process is that the as is not removed up to desired who level 10 μg l and hence it requires secondary treatment ravenscroft et al 2009 further a large amount of lime sludge is produced after addition of multiple chemical substances which is again a major problem for safe disposal the amount of secondary sludge produced after treatment is largely governed by the extent of hardness the additional cost is required for dewatering and thickening of sludge produced thus making the process expensive since the oxidation is effective in minimizing the concentration of as in contaminated water oxidation through cl2 is recommended also addition of acid to treated water is needed to lower the ph of water to an acceptable limit thus the process alone could not be suggested for as removal from contaminated water as well as for further utilization of water for drinking purposes 4 1 2 oxidation oxidation of highly mobile arsenite as iii into comparatively less mobile form arsenate as v can be achieved by oxidative process in groundwater both as iii and as v are present however most of the treatment techniques effectively remove only as v hering et al 1996 hence the pre oxidation step is required to transform as iii to as v this oxidation happens slowly in the presence of air or oxygen and takes around a week hug et al 2003 the rate can be increased by the use of oxidizing agents such as ozone chlorine hypochlorite chlorine dioxide h2o2 yang et al 1999 or sand coated manganese oxide or by other advanced oxidation processes bissen and frimmel 2003 like fenton s reagent driehaus et al 1995 hypochlorite meng et al 2001 and permanganate oxidants like chlorine lytle et al 2005 and permanganate jekel 1994 could be preferred for the fast oxidation of as iii to as v under a wide range of experimental conditions pierce and moore 1982 in general the term oxidation applies for the removal of iron and manganese from contaminated water oxidation of these elements produces insoluble oxides of strong scavenging activity the oxidized as thereafter is eliminated from the contaminated water via sorption jain and singh 2012 onto iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides further the oxide of iron and manganese facilitates the oxidation of as iii to less toxic as v form under these conditions quantity of soluble iron regulates the as removal efficiency through oxidation the iron and as weight ratio up to 20 1 has been demonstrated to give as removal rate up to 80 95 in addition the as removal by manganese oxides is also recognized manganese oxides catalyze the oxidation and subsequent scavenging of as very efficiently and can be applied for in situ remediation of contaminated aquifers driehaus et al 1995 have demonstrated the second order reaction kinetics for arsenite conversion into arsenate through the catalytic action of manganese oxides recently zhang et al 2017 have synthesized ti iv and mn iv based metal oxide complex for simultaneous arsenite oxidation and removal via sorption at neutral ph in the range of 2 60 μg l the methodology was efficient in arsenite 107 0 mg g metal oxide removal as compared to arsenate 87 2 mg g binary metal oxide most importantly some of the naturally occurring oxides of mn such as birnessite are known to rapidly catalyze the as oxidation and subsequent removal these naturally present mineral forms if could be synthesized under laboratory conditions may give a novel approach to mitigate the as calamity however the process is expensive in nature and could not be suggested for in situ remediation of as contamination in poorer areas of the indian subcontinent the weak oxidation through chlorine and other oxidants may result in formation of hazardous by products and elevate the overall cost of the process recently cu doped zno material has been prepared through precipitation methods for oxidation of as under the presence of sunlight vaiano et al 2018 the prepared materials reflected good as binding affinity in real groundwater conditions the arsenite was oxidized completely within 2 h of treatment the effectiveness of advanced oxidation coagulation filtration aocf for treating arsenic contaminated water below 1 μg l concentration relying on batch and pilot studies at varying ph doses of oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate and ferric chloride unmodified and metal oxide laden sand and grain size has been documented by ahmad et al 2017b the metal oxide coated sand was more effective in lowering the as concentration remarkably the aocf process did not influence the removal of commonly occurring drinking water contaminants including iron manganese and ammonium the importance of sequential treatment with mno4 and fe3 with an objective to oxidize the arsenite to more adsorptive arsenate form is highlighted by ahmad et al 2018 the purification of groundwater in an aeration rapid sand filtration unit based on oxidizing agent 1 2 mg l permanganate and 1 8 mg l ferric ions lowered the arsenic content well below 1 μg l without perturbing the removal of ferrous and manganous ions as well as the microbiological activity of nitrifying prokaryotes interestingly different oxidation and precipitation products of fe and mn can reveal the complex sequestration process and facilitate in optimizing the removal of contaminant of interest ahmad et al 2019 in another investigation ahmad et al 2020b reported the arsenic sequestration potential of rapid sand filtration media rendered by manganese oxide and microbial activity of arsenic oxidizing microbes for artificially recharged water the arsenic removal below 1 μg l may be achieved either by treating the influent or effluent of rapid sand filter by sequential addition of permanganate and ferric iron and only ferric chloride respectively reduction in ph of water dominated with arsenate ions was found as an important step for accelerating the as precipitation during treatment process rapid sand filter directs the rapid conversion of arsenite to arsenate form thereby producing the effluent enriched with arsenate ions ahmad et al 2020a below 1 μg l the oxidation triggered by rapid sand filter media is influenced substantially by nature of filter grain size in addition to the depth of supernatant the research and development of newer oxidizing substances such as metal complexes of non hazardous nature may improve the overall as removal efficiencies of currently existing technologies table 1 lists some methods of as oxidation for efficient removal 4 1 2 1 oxidation of naturally occurring iron and as and its removal arsenic oxidation and its removal using naturally present iron in groundwater are an attractive and emerging methodology more than 65 as affected areas in bangladesh have been reported to contain iron up to 2 mg l at a few of the as contaminated sites iron concentrations up to 15 mg l have also been reported however in most of the cases no correlation was found between iron and as arsenic is very efficiently adsorbed and sequestered onto precipitates of fe oh 3 and oxidation product of fe oh 2 thus aeration and sedimentation of such tube wells possessing higher iron content remove as effectively small scale applicable iron removal plants irps have been developed based on the process of aeration followed by precipitation sedimentation and filtration which can remove as from contaminated sources such irps plants also behave as as removal systems as demonstrated in noakhali because of arsenite oxidation to arsenate dahi and liang 1998 various oxidation strategies for as minimization are shown in table 1 4 1 3 adsorption adsorption refers to the surface binding of liquid or gaseous molecules to solid or liquid substratum depending upon the type of interactions involved the adsorption can be categorized as physical or chemical the adsorption is dependent on different factors such as temperature pressure porosity and surface area physical adsorption is characterized by reversible binding accompanied with the release of energy the characteristic feature of physical adsorption lies into multilayer binding of adsorbate through van der waal s interactions onto the adsorbent surface mckay 1995 dąbrowski 2001 adsorption has been widely exploited for as removal due to process simplicity high efficiency and low cost in nature arsenic removal through adsorption is affected by content of as oxidation state temperature ph of the medium presence of common competing ions and contact time usepa 2000 in most of the observed cases arsenate has been found to exhibit strong adsorption affinity toward a particular adsorbent as compared to arsenite the adsorption of as onto an adsorbent is better explained by adsorption isotherm models in which langmuir and freundlich are the most common one the adsorption isotherms readily and suitably describes the phenomenon underlying metal metalloid mobilization and sorption foo and hameed 2010 chakraborty et al 2017 arsenic removal by adsorption is a highly efficient and cost effective method as compared to other methods like membrane techniques foam floatation solvent extraction bioremediation etc historically adsorption by charcoal has been used for treatment of drinking water agrafioti et al 2014 some of the important adsorption strategies for arsenic removal from contaminated water are presented below 4 1 3 1 activated alumina based adsorption activated alumina al2o3 possesses good ability to sorb the as due to its higher surface area it is an important area of research on which a search on scopus with keywords activated alumina and arsenic results in 157 documents since the year 1994 column containing activated alumina has revealed good as removal efficiency together with other impurities tripathy and raichur 2008 with the time elapse the column begins to saturate with metal ions of interest firstly in the upper zone and reaching thereafter in the lower column zone arsenic binding to column materials saturates the column that needs to be regenerated for effective as removal su et al 2008 ghosh and gupta 2012 regeneration of saturated alumina performed by treating the column with dilute solution of sodium hydroxide 4 releases the wastewater containing higher amount of as washed out naoh is discarded and the column is neutralized by using a very dilute solution of sulfuric acid 2 studies on activated alumina for as removal include those conducted by shi and yan 2015 karmacharya et al 2016 lata and samadder 2016 lee et al 2017 and wendimu et al 2017 thus column saturation and washing as well as washout management is the major constraint for this method 4 1 3 2 cartridge filter based as adsorption cartridge filters containing easily available adsorbent materials including resins have demonstrated efficient separation of as together with dissolved ions contaminated water bearing impurities other than iron and as saturate the filter media very quickly which needs to be regenerated to achieve better performance of cartridge filter village level installation and performance were tested for such filters named as chiyoda arsenic removal unit japan and coolmart water purifier korea bangladesh university of engineering and technology buet have tested as remediation from groundwater using a unit possessing iron coated sand effective iron content to be loaded on sand has been determined as 25 mg g joshi and choudhuri 1996 contaminated water containing as up to the 300 mg l has been treated through 350 bed volume iron coated sand to reach drinking water as level as prescribed by bangladesh but not up to the level as suggested by who iron encrusted brick dust similar to iron coated sand has also been tested to purify as enriched water since the process is costly it could not be afforded by the poorer people of developing nations 4 1 3 3 activated carbon based as removal allen and whitten 1998 presented generation and characterization of activated carbon from various carbonaceous materials literature reviews have been published on methodologies and uses of charcoal mohan and pittman jr 2007 mohan et al 2007 for instance a basic search in scopus database using the keywords activated carbon and arsenic results in 546 research documents in the year 1994 activated carbons have been tested for both arsenite and arsenate removal from water use of activated carbon for remediation of as and antimony originated from the electroplating industry has also been evaluated higher as adsorption efficiency 2860 mg g has been reported for coal based activated carbon complexes with metals like silver and copper lorenzen et al 1995 demonstrated that the process was not effective in reducing as content below the who standard limit payne and abdel fattah 2005 studied the importance of ph and temperature on arsenite and arsenate removal by activated carbon it plays an important role for the adsorption of as there are considerable chances of failure of this technology because of the spatial changes in water characteristics such as ph temperature as well as ion and mineral contents moreover as desorption by using suitable acidic or alkaline solution to reuse the activated carbon may significantly affect their adsorption behavior only a few of available activated charcoal have been known to be effective for as sequestration vitela rodriguez and rangel mendez 2013 gong et al 2015 karmacharya et al 2016 indicating the major shortcomings of the technology for production of as free water 4 1 3 4 arsenic adsorption and removal by geological materials remediation of as by naturally occurring geological materials such as iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides clay materials limestone feldspar laterites and soils have been explored in several studies these materials possess the potential of adsorbing as at ph under different natural aqueous environment the utilization of geological materials has emerged as promising solution at small level for the rural settlement of various developing and under developed countries bundschuh et al 2010 the researchers reported the major limitations of emerging methodologies due to financial problems and support from authorities use of these materials has gained a great attention due to less costly nature and easy accessibility suggesting their wide applicability in poor regions of developing countries various naturally occurring zeolites baskan and pala 2011 pizarro et al 2021 are reported but only few of them have been utilized for as removal purposes because of differences in purity and availability suggesting differential behavior in as removal from contaminated water however in few cases they can be preferred for as mitigation due to their characteristics such as highly adsorptive nature conferred by iron manganese and aluminum oxides and hydroxides ion exchange process and coagulation ability depending on the nature of pollutant and toxicity use of modified zeolites generated by ion exchange process can serve as better alternative for sequestration of metals of interest including as but application at larger scale would be very much costly thus limiting the employment of technology in poorer regions of the indian subcontinent overall the as removal using geological materials is highly influenced by the characteristics of the materials used as content and its oxidation states regulatory limits of different countries and the most importantly expenses required for installing the unit 4 1 3 5 arsenic removal using nanomaterials 4 1 3 5 1 batch mixed iron and their nanomaterials for as treatment role of iron in as sorption and removal is experienced in many experimental studies batch studies have indicated that 1 iron filling ranging from 250 to 625 mg l can remove up to 2000 mg l arsenate from the medium in very short duration ramaswami et al 2001 2 medium containing sulfate was found to induce as removal while presence of phosphate inhibited the as removal process 3 iron filling strongly absorbing the as can be reutilized for minimum 100 times while employed for as removal 4 biologically produced iron and manganese oxide serve as very good scavenger for as and 5 already dissolved iron present in the range of 100 300 mg l may facilitate the process of adsorption being efficient simple in nature and reusability of iron filling the process makes the technique attractive for large scale application to provide as free water system works well even in the presence of dissolved sulfate ions with no requirement of oxygenation mohan and pittman jr 2007 have summarized different adsorbents used for as sequestration various synthetic and commercial activated carbons and less expensive as well as efficient adsorbents have been discussed several adsorbents have been prepared so far to remove the as level up to who permissible limit hajji et al 2019 have elucidated the simultaneous sorption of as and chromium onto nano sized minerals of iron there was partial oxidation of arsenite into arsenate without involvement of external oxidant indicating its suitability for industrial scale decontamination improvement in binding affinity and changes at nano structured level give development of novel adsorbents for efficient as recovery from contaminated water application of nanomaterials has revolutionized the water purification technology synthesis of novel nanomaterials with strong as binding efficiency has been recently reported uppal et al 2019 the developed nanomaterials had as removal efficiency up to 100 in the medium with ph ranging from 2 to 10 the nano adsorbent was able to efficiently sequester the dissolved as approximately 300 mg as removal was observed with 1 g of adsorbent interestingly the zinc based nanomaterials were reusable up to five times several workers have reported binary nano composites for treatment of as laden water yttrium ferric based adsorbent for arsenate removal is reported by yu et al 2019 the higher removal was observed at acidic ph however the process of as removal was hindered in the presence of competing ions recently eslami et al 2019 have shown the binary nano oxide consisting of iron and manganese for arsenate removal from contaminated water interestingly the composite was able to remove the as content well below the who permissible limit of 10 μg l apart from these adsorbents other plant derived adsorbents has been prepared to eliminate as from contaminated water most of the adsorbents developed so far are not very much successful at industrial scale calling for further improvement in the area further the regeneration of used adsorbent may be time consuming and costly in most of the cases 4 1 3 5 2 nanoparticle based as adsorption and removal nanotechnology has influenced water treatment technology at a great extent it is widely used in developing sensors for detection of as contamination kaur et al 2015 in view of smaller size and larger surface areas nanomaterials have considerably received the worldwide attention of researchers actively engaged in water purification technology through nanotechnology many of the challenges associated with currently practiced as removal technologies can be solved in a better way together with the development of low cost water treatment methodology for sustainable management of contaminated groundwater and surface water the key search word application of nanoparticle in arsenic removal displayed a total of 1510 results for the year 2018 only indicating the rapid interest and application of nanotechnology in the field of as remediation most importantly many of these technologies rely on iron oxide based nanomaterials prathna et al 2018 the iron oxide based nanomaterials are not only efficient in removing as but also for decontamination of other commonly occurring pollutants of inorganic and organic nature feng et al 2012 have reported the removal of arsenite as well as arsenate using fe3o4 nanoparticles one gram of nanomaterial was able to sequester 46 06 and 16 56 mg of arsenite and arsenate respectively since most of the adsorbent materials developed so far are much effective in removing arsenate the higher adsorption affinity of nanomaterials toward reduced form of as i e as iii thus indicates in situ suitability of iron based nano adsorbent for the treatment of predominantly as iii contaminated aquifers due to prevailing reducing environmental conditions apart from iron based nanomaterials nano adsorbent utilizing mno2 gupta et al 2012 and cuo2 goswami et al 2012 have also been tested recently mishra and rai 2019 have explored the applicability of newly synthesized nanomaterials gel consisting of cerium and titanium for fast adsorption and removal of as the adsorbent was effective in reducing total as concentration below 7 μg l a total of 99 as removal was attained within 10 min the researchers claimed the suitability of nanomaterials under varying ph range and in presence of common competing ions the bound as was not released into the medium from the adsorbent even after 24 h indicating strong affinity of synthesized nano adsorbents abundance of interconnected pores in nanomaterials and oxidation of as iii were described to be responsible for very fast removal of as from the medium nevertheless the nanomaterials based as removal technology too can suffer from limitations for example under field conditions the efficacy may be altered because of variations in physico chemical characteristics of water intended to be purified during the deposition process of iron nanoparticles on filter media there are also the chances of agglomeration culminating into reduced sorption efficiency the cost for the development of a particular nano adsorbent may be higher further the adsorbent developed may be saturated at certain cycle of treatment which would need the replenishment with fresh nano adsorbent in addition there are also the chances of leaching of nanomaterials in the treated water suggesting the requirement of strong binding of adsorbent with the wall materials leaching of the nanomaterials into treated water may prove harmful to humans and other mammalian systems if consumed beyond the threshold limit list of different adsorbents along with plant derived ones for as removal are presented in tables 2 4 4 1 3 5 3 arsenic adsorption onto nano zerovalent iron nzvi composites adsorption onto nano zerovalent iron nzvi has emerged as an efficient technology for rapid removal of as from contaminated water systems application of nzvi for as removal is less expensive and an environmental process for as mitigation arsenic removal by nzvi may be based on processes like adsorption oxidation reduction physico chemical characteristics of adsorbate ph and availability of oxygen in the vicinity as well as the proportions of adsorbent and adsorbate powders synthesized from zerovalent iron have been implicated in permeable reactive barriers prbs in order to sequester the as present in plumes of aquifers bang et al 2005 they have also been used for as removal in man made household filters as reported for developing countries leupin and hug 2005 it has promising in situ as removal potential kanel et al 2005 because of larger surface area thus higher rate of as retention onto its surface zhu et al 2009 since application of nzvi as such for as remediation purposes may result into loss of nanomaterials nzvi because of the nano size and may suffer from enrichment of iron content in drinking water its adsorption onto suitable supporting substratum is inevitable step for its better performance zhou et al 2014 has demonstrated the efficiency of biochar immobilized nzvi for removal of different metals including as biochar integrated with the nzvi wang et al 2017 removed arsenate mainly due to electrostatic interactions the adsorbed arsenate present on biochar nzvi composite could be easily separated from the medium because of magnetic properties of adsorbent arsenic sorption onto zvi supported on biochar is recently described bakshi et al 2018 the ph of medium could have considerable impacts on as sequestration but wu et al 2017 have recently described minimal effects of ph variation on as sorbing capacity of nzvi as compared to zvi they explained that corrosion of nzvi had a significant contribution towards more effective as binding in contrast to electrostatic interaction the nzvi may be successfully deployed for as decontamination at varying ph range due to nano range size and magnetic properties of nzvi there are ample chances of particle aggregation that may significantly reduce their as binding affinity such problems however can be managed effectively by fixing them onto suitable support material of non toxic nature 4 2 emerging as removal technologies 4 2 1 bucket treatment unit btu bucket treatment unit btu depending on coagulation process could be helpful in providing as free water at smaller scale the department of public health engineering dphe danida project assessed the as removal based on coagulation and adsorption processes in a sequential manner separate bucket of red and green color each with 20 l volume was stacked together vertically for the purpose of treatment chemicals necessary for coagulation are mixed manually in the upper bucket containing contaminated water and shaken rapidly followed by gentle stirring for 90 s precipitated substance is allowed to settle down for 2 h content of the upper bucket is released slowly through a sand filter into the lower bucket flow is maintained by adjusting the valve situated above the bottom in a way that does not disturb the established flocs thus treated water is received into the lower green bucket results under field as well as laboratory conditions showed good efficiency in as removal kohnhorst and paul 2000 sarkar et al 2010 large scale investigation project under bamwsp dfid water aid 2001 and rapid assessment program demonstrated differential performance in some instances the treatment procedure was insufficient to reduce the as content below the prescribed limits probably due to the differences in water quality characteristics however the treatment unit can be simply manufactured at minimum cost by employing easily available low cost materials and proper operation was found to give satisfactory results ahmed 2001 the technology could be recommended for future application at small scale in poorer regions of indian subcontinent 4 2 2 bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir filter unit coagulation co precipitation based systems manufactured by bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir to minimize the as content employed iron mediated flocculation followed by sand filtration however the treatment unit did not participate during exhaustive testing programmes hassan et al 2009 the filter is easy for use at small scale only and suitable for utilization in poorer areas of indian subcontinent 4 2 3 arsenic removal unit attached to hand pump this is the most attractive and sustainable method for the as removal the unit employs sequential coagulation in the presence of alum followed by sedimentation and filtration in a simple unit to facilitate water treatment at household level in various states of india including west bengal the as treatment unit attached with hand pumps effectively removes up to 90 as when subjected to contaminated water containing its content of 300 mg l but not up to the who prescribed limit the technology could be modified for small scale application to provide as free water 4 2 4 membrane based as removal techniques currently membrane based purification systems to minimize the contaminant level are being preferred worldwide some commonly used membrane based techniques to reduce the concentration of heavy metal oid s such as iron manganese as and dissolved solids include electro dialysis reverse osmosis nanofiltration etc here the membrane filters act as a physical barrier to restrict the movement of solutes but allow the movement of water membrane separation techniques depend on the driving force available in the operation to carry out the removal of impurities from feed water classification of membrane based separations on the basis of driving force is as follows 1 pressure driven operations such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and microfiltration 2 operations in electrical potential gradient such as electro dialysis and electro filtration and 3 operations including temperature gradient such as membrane distillation various techniques with important advantages and limitations are described in table 5 4 2 4 1 reverse osmosis ro among various high pressure membrane techniques reverse osmosis ro has the promising application in as rejection from the feed water dropping off its concentration from 1000 μg l to 10 μg l ideal working parameters like high pressure range of 75 250 psi or even higher can yield the 95 efficiency in as removal letterman 1999 the pore size of membranes is appropriate for removal of solvated as ro operating in lateral configuration permeates only 10 15 feed water through it in household systems where only a small volume of contaminant free water is needed for culinary work and drinking purposes this slow purification may be satisfactory rejection of as in ro is independent of ph but arsenite at higher ph value 8 is very easily rejected in the ro system due to charged nature as compared to lower ph value narasimhan et al 2005 the limitation of the ro system can be assessed in terms of its cost and highly concentrated salts containing heavy pollutant load which is not easy to handle with pollutant removal from water with different sources possesses variations in physico chemical properties which again limits its wider applicability even in developed countries 4 2 4 2 electrodialysis ed electrodialysis ed is a widely accepted technique as it segregates both cations and anions that helps in elimination of metals of interest from wastewater and produces potable water from brackish water being ecofriendly and economical ed gives advantage of reusing as in the pharmaceutical industry and pesticide production so far ed reports limited literature on as removal however ribeiro et al 2000 used this method for removal from 26 7 to 98 7 of as from chromated copper arsenate cca treated wood by applying water and different concentrations of oxalic acid up to 99 of as removal has been reported by using this process critical investigations of the ph temperature and co contaminants along with the as should be conducted to produce the water either free from as or well below the who prescribed limits the process is not suitable for poorer regions of the indian subcontinent where electricity is a major limiting factor 4 2 4 3 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration uf a competitive treatment as compared to conventional ones is used worldwide for as removal from various water resources pal 2015 although having prominent use in medical sciences its application in wastewater treatment has shown remarkable results uf as a low pressure membrane operating in the range of 0 5 bars 5 0 bars is capable of removing macromolecules colloids and some particulate constituents in case of pore size ranging from 10 to 200 μm uf may not be a viable technology but with the application of electric repulsion the efficiency of the process can be enhanced uf technique can be used for pollutant removal simultaneously with efficient as oxidation followed by its adsorption onto ferric iron for less costly as remediation molinari and argurio 2017 the technique is not only efficient in removal of inorganic pollutants but also for effective removal of pathogenic microbes such as bacteria and viruses agarwal et al 2013 suggesting their wider applicability however the technique has been reported inefficient in removing the as content to maximum allowable contaminant level of 10 μg l gecol et al 2004 the addition of surfactant however improved the as removal efficiency with produced water having as content well below the who prescribed limits 4 2 4 4 microfiltration mf microfiltration mf is a physical process depending on the membrane s pore size that removes the contaminants mainly in the form of suspended solids and colloids usually ferric chloride is added in the water containing as ferric chloride hydrolyses and precipitates as ferric hydroxide which is filtered out prominent results are obtained for as removal with pore size ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 μm koyuncu et al 2015 chellam and sari 2016 molinari and argurio 2017 the successfulness of mf process has been claimed for reduction of as content in treated water limiting up to 2 μg l atkinson 2006 the study demonstrated the feasibility of uf as one of the economical and successful techniques in sequestration of as from contaminated regions however the larger application for generating as free water is not achieved so far since the process could not apply equally for as contaminated surface and groundwater with varying ph conditions different oxidation states and redox environment sracek et al 2004 therefore research should be conducted to optimize the pore size in order to have the maximum as removal efficiency the suspended solids may clog the pores and limit the as removal process hence techniques should be developed to revive the clogged pores for better as removal without affecting the nature of membrane 4 2 4 5 nanofiltration nf nanofiltration nf is an emerging pressure driven technique in the water purification process because of its capability in removing a broad spectrum of contaminants in a single treatment process siddique et al 2020 boussouga et al 2021 the considerable effectiveness of metal derived nanoparticles in water purification via nf is critically reviewed by pradeep 2009 the author has pointed out the potential of noble metal nanoparticles enabled by less reactiveness in combating the global menace of water contamination recently the group of author has designed and developed the nanomaterials assisted water purification technology known as amrit arsenic and metal removal through indian technology the appropriateness of the technique not only lies in removal of inorganic contaminants but also for organic contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms further the group has worked on biological material supported composite nanomaterials for the process of water decontamination sankar et al 2013 the technique achieves high permeability as compared to ro technique used for desalination variations in process parameters such as increase in ph decrease in operating temperature and as feed concentration lead to higher as removal permeate flux can reach to its maximum value at ph 8 0 with optimum variation in temperature and pressure pal et al 2014 jadhav et al 2016 gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 harisha et al 2010 have reported 99 8 removal of arsenate ions meeting the who standard along with dissolved solid and other co occurring contaminants with the help of nanofiltration technology optimization of different parameters such as pressure feed concentration and run time using mathematical modeling along with small scale tests could serve as an important step for improving the application of nanofiltration technology at larger community level further the daily maintenance by a skilled person required for continuous maximum efficiency of the process is one of the major limitations in poorer areas of the indian subcontinent 4 2 4 6 electrofiltration ef membrane processes when actuated with the passage of electric charge across membrane filtration enhance the contaminant removal efficiency arsenic as a negatively charged ion as v can readily be removed by applying the electric charge in electro ultra filtration euf lohokare et al 2008 sánchez and rivas 2010 hsieh et al 2008 reported the as removal efficiency up to 79 during ef the reduction of as concentration from 49 μg l to 8 4 μg l through the ef process is reported earlier hsieh et al 2008 however at higher concentration the treatment could not produce the water with as concentration within the limits of who standards the requirement of electricity makes the process expensive and unsuitable for larger scale application in poorer locations of developing countries furthermore due to considerable changes in water characteristics from place to place the process is not effective under natural conditions thus limiting their wider applicability and calls for further research in this direction 4 2 4 7 membrane distillation md during the membrane distillation md process only vapor phase molecules are allowed to pass through the membrane it produces ultrapure water from feed at quite high concentration being a thermally driven process its efficiency decreases with increase in solute concentration because of decrease in vapor pressure direct contact md process has higher as removal efficiency as compared to other pressure driven membrane processes ashoor et al 2016 manna and pal 2016 manna et al 2010 have described the applicability of solar light assisted generation of 100 as free water without membrane fouling the high cost of electricity based processes limits its application however solar light driven processes could be a viable option for as affected poorer areas of the indian subcontinent the geographical regions across the globe receiving low light could not employ the solar light driven membrane distillation process for as mitigation furthermore the process is also susceptible to limitations imposed by characteristics of membrane used optimization of different process parameters with as contaminated water from different locations could be extensively conducted to enhance the efficiency of developed methodology 4 2 4 8 ion exchange membrane iem this technique is based on utilization of especially designed resins with strong ion exchange properties ion exchange membranes iem are among the most commonly practiced technique for removal of dissolved metal ions from aqueous medium pessoa lopes et al 2016 lee et al 2017 binding of metals ions saturates the adsorption sites available in iem and thus requires the treatment of resins with sodium chloride to regenerate the available sites the process suitability may have more attractive metal sequestration features if resins showing substantial affinity with as could be developed employment of resins for water purification has been represented in bangladesh the process also utilizes the application of sodium hypochlorite naocl the use of naocl in the process not only enhances arsenite oxidation to achieve higher levels of adsorption but also kills the harmful pathogenic bacteria present in the contaminated water in iem hybrid ion exchange and membrane technology targeting as removal from drinking water consists of arsenate movement via ion exchange membrane followed by precipitation and separation the advantage associated with this technique is freshwater production by ph adjustment and coagulant dose selection of particular ion exchange membranes depends on the valence state of as ions to be transported together with iron and aluminum based coagulant dose to maintain the effectiveness 4 2 5 biological as removal methodologies bioremediation is a biological agent aided environment friendly process aimed for both organic and inorganic contaminant removal microbes can be very effectively employed in a given environment for toxic compound detoxification thereby minimizing the effect singh et al 2021 although metals cannot be degraded they can be transformed in such a way to make them immobile or unavailable stucker et al 2013 bioremediation involves the exploitation of biological agents including bacteria algae fungi and their products for the decontamination of soil and water pokhrel and viraraghavan 2008 raj et al 2013 plant aided remediation i e phytoremediation for treatment of as polluted sites bears advantages of environment friendliness and less costlier nature valls and de lorenzo 2002 wang and zhao 2009 various microbiological processes are involved for as detoxification including transport through membrane protein immobilization volatile form production by methylation surface adsorption and oxido reduction reactions under the influence of microbiological activity triggered by sulphur iron manganese and organic material as mobilization in an environment is greatly affected in addition in many anaerobic reactions as can be respired by a variety of microbes many microorganisms in nature are equipped with the property of metal transformation into volatile forms challenger et al 1955 biovolatilization is the process mediated by several bacterial and fungal species converting inorganic arsenicals to less toxic methylated as species such as monomethylarsenic species and dimethylarsenic species rodriguez et al 1999 cernansky et al 2009 majumder et al 2013 biologically produced metal oxides and sulfides such as iron and manganese oxides and iron sulfides are another precipitation based mechanisms used by microorganisms for as removal this process is simple attractive and low cost in nature omoregie et al 2013 diverse group of microorganisms inhabiting in a higher as concentration environment have been represented oremland and stolz 2003 because of tolerance to higher as concentration transformation ability role in biogeochemical cycling these microbial communities can be preferred for remediation practices arsenic tolerance and resistance by selected bacterial species makes them attractive candidates for as removal from contaminated groundwater liu et al 2013a the microorganisms exhibiting as removal potential are shown in table 6 with their mechanisms bacteria utilized for as remediation purposes can be grouped into ferrous oxidizing manganese oxidizing sulfate reducing and as resistant type pennesi et al 2012 and mattes et al 2013 isolated neutrophilic iron oxidizing autotrophic bacteria respiring on nitrate and used for remediation of zinc and as in industrial landfill sites at british columbia biological oxidation of iron singh et al 2018 and manganese is also being considered as an emerging treatment process for the bioremediation of as from contaminated groundwater most of the bacterial species removing as can maintain themselves in a higher as environment but one possessing the property of arsenate conversion to arsenite and their accumulation inside the cell are better called as as resistant type genes such as arsr and arsc present either on chromosome and plasmid or both and expressing the regulatory protein arsr and enzyme arsenate reductase govern as resistance in the bacterial system respectively other literatures of significant importance are wang et al 2012 ye et al 2012 bachate et al 2013 y chen et al 2013a 2013b guardiola et al 2013 hamzah et al 2013 kruger et al 2013 liao et al 2013 and liu et al 2013b list of various bacterial and fungal species employed for as removal is presented in table 6 some of the hyperaccumulators reported for as removal from contaminated environment are presented in table 7 the cost of producing as free water for some techniques available based on shan et al 2018 are presented in table 8 most of the bioremediation processes under laboratory conditions were able to produce as free water meeting the standards of who limits important organisms mechanisms and factors along with the limitations of as bioremediation techniques are included in fig 5 4 2 6 community based as removal systems more than 100 million people in bangladesh and india are severely affected by consumption of contaminated groundwater containing as levels beyond 50 μg l the groundwater as contamination has emerged as a natural calamity affecting a very large population across the globe more than 200 as purifying units have been installed in the indian subcontinent under the collaborative programme of bengal engineering and science university besu india and lehigh university usa regularly about two lacks people get access to as free drinking water by these purification systems the purified water contains the dissolved solids different nutrient ions iron and manganese in acceptable limits after certain duration of running villagers regenerate the adsorbing materials of installed system for efficient working of purifying unit cost of purification is made by contribution among villagers trained persons of villages are involved in such material regeneration regeneration process improves the efficiency of the purification system and reduces solid waste generation by two times to minimize the as loss by leaching solid waste containing as is stored in sand filters kurniawan et al 2012 so far many modifications in the unit have been done to enhance the performance maintenance metal recovery and safe disposal of solid waste having concentrated as the purification unit is very much successful in remote locations because of safety easy and fast regeneration ability the unit is promising and applicable to as affected south east asian countries because of local management and purification by less trained villagers and low cost regeneration 4 2 7 mitigating the water contaminated with arsenic through public awareness arsenic toxicity effect in most of these regions across the globe is natural in origin that needs the public awareness involvement of local action and public pressure to respective governments to support the as affected regions thakur et al 2020 electronic media such as television and radio play important role in such activities by providing information related to as toxicity and their local specific removal technologies and methods awareness programs by activities like folk dances nukkad natak and region specific songs may help a lot among the local population in mitigations of as associated health problems special attention is needed for the women and children of remote areas that do not have access to the media the awareness programs should be conducted in a proper manner so that people may share information without any pressure and hesitation awareness among local people should be done about the easily available low cost novel materials and easy maintenance of treatment units attention on these factors should be kept in mind while suggesting the use of small scale as removal units timely checking of units installed for as removal should be performed for better operation and management better training on maintenance of these as purification units is of utmost importance 5 conclusions arsenic contamination of water is a serious problem across the globe posing serious threat to a larger population especially those inhabiting in asian countries this problem would worsen the conditions of people inhabiting such areas day by day if proper and efficient treatment technologies are not adopted bibliometric analysis revealed the need of extensive research for the abatement of as toxicity in affected areas across the globe the present review has made an effort to summarize the physical chemical and biological aspects of as removal moreover pros and cons of different methods in use have also been highlighted the analysis revealed integration of physico chemical and biological techniques for the efficient treatment of as contaminated water since as removal by different processes is considerably affected by chemical characteristics of water and design of reactors there is a need for more research and development activities to achieve the lab to land approach the extensive bibliometric analysis on individual physico chemical and biological process for removal of as would impart necessary information needed for enhancing the removal of as from contaminated water under natural environmental conditions bibliometric information pertinent to actively engaged research institutions along with countries increasingly participating in low cost as removal strategies as evidenced by research publications could be helpful in joint collaboration to alleviate the global menace of as contamination in water development of low cost on site as determination tools would further help to galvanize the remediation of as affected areas for ecofriendly management of as induced toxicity in human and on natural environment technological advancement should be implemented in such a way that can be beneficial for the as affected population in the developing and underdeveloped nations of the world further interdisciplinary research and public awareness should be promoted to achieve the goal of as mitigation by sustainable approaches in affected regions author s agreement all the authors

11933,to understand the current research output on arsenic as removal and research related to the as contamination a bibliometric analysis based on scopus database was carried out the analysis includes the research covering the leading countries and year wise literature outputs bibliometric analysis revealed increasing trend in research published on as removal more than 1200 articles using physico chemical methods during 1995 onwards and united states of america usa as leading contributor among different research institutions chinese academy of sciences has contributed maximally to research articles reaching up to 950 and maximum 635 research articles were published in the journal environmental science and technology with respect to as removal using physico chemical methods with respect to as removal using biological methods around 400 research articles were recorded during 1995 onwards and maximum article contribution 1052 was registered for china followed by usa 964 based on scopus data 2021 maximum 222 articles on as removal using biological methods were recorded for the journal chemosphere the present review emphasizes on currently available physico chemical as well as emerging treatment processes for the removal of as generally occurring as arsenite and arsenate from drinking water it has been suggested by various studies that a combination of low cost physico chemical treatment methodologies like ion exchange reverse osmosis precipitation filtration and adsorption along with biological methods can be a safe alternative for as removal from drinking water overall the study suggests that there is a strong need for further research on efficient processes involving lab to land approaches for as removal from groundwater in order to reduce the toxicity and contamination of as in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic bibliometric analysis bioremediation ion exchange removal technologies ultrafiltration 1 introduction currently a very large population is affected by arsenic as contamination wang et al 2018 therefore the toxicity arising from as enrichment in sedimentary aquifers beyond the recommended limits causing contamination of drinking water is a matter of global concern bhattacharya et al 2004 mcgrory et al 2017 in view of as toxicity to various human organ systems farrell et al 2001 kumar et al 2004 vieira et al 2017 the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency us epa have suggested 10 μg l of as concentration in drinking water as the safety limit for human consumption however health studies performed in netherlands indicated that even the as standard of 10 μg l in drinking water is not safe for human consumption ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a and may induce different kind of toxicity ahmad et al 2020a noteworthy new jersey and denmark have set and adapted the maximum contaminant level for as as 5 μg l starting from the year 2006 and 2017 respectively moreover in netherlands the authorities are trying to achieve the level of as even below 1 μg l ahmad and bhattacharya 2019b ahmad et al 2020a the expenses towards lowering as in drinking water below 1 μg l in comparison to health maintenance of as victims affected by lung cancer would lead to economic benefit thereby justifying the efforts of authorities to reduce the contaminant level below 1 μg l the toxicity of inorganic as within the current standard thereby needs thorough revision based on comprehensive in vitro as well as field studies in order to safeguard the large numbers of exposed population hence most remarkably the level of as in drinking water must be kept as low as possible because of no certainty on impact of lower as content besides the role of as from another source to exert associated hazard and restrictions in expressing the outcomes under experimental conditions therefore 10 μg l standard of as concentration in drinking water cannot be considered completely safe for human and other organisms the exposure of as to humans is reported to be linked with accumulation in keratin rich parts with the appearance of clinical symptoms of raised pigmentation keratosis and different types of cancers kapaj et al 2006 singh et al 2013 most notably the simultaneous occurrence of as with other ions like fluoride and uranium may severely compromise the human health and socio economic status das et al 2017 2018 patel et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 the toxic effect of as enriched water on human chromosome revealing the identification of two cases of klinefelter s syndrome is reported by singh et al 2013 although both natural and anthropogenic sources ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 a b are responsible for as contamination into surface and groundwater singh et al 2018 the main sources of water contamination causing risks to larger populations around the world are natural in origin arsenic contamination of water under natural environmental condition is considerably influenced by geological hydrological and geochemical attributes of associated aquifers thus in depth understanding of aquifer characteristics in prevailing environmental conditions would help in mitigating the hazardous impact through development of low cost as removal technologies bhattacharya et al 1997 on the other hand the anthropogenic processes responsible for as release into different environmental matrices include industrial activities extensive mining operations and employment of as based preservatives and pesticides with the resultant accumulation in atmospheric as well as terrestrial ecosystem bhattacharya et al 2002 nriagu et al 2007 arsenic is released into the environment as the result of natural activities such as volcanic eruptions and rock weathering and anthropogenic activities including industrial operations mining activities and large scale agricultural application of as based herbicides and pesticides wang and mulligan 2006 su et al 2011 garcía carmona et al 2017 microbe assisted mobilization desorption dissolution and disintegration of as bearing minerals like realgar orpiment and arsenopyrite are important natural sources of groundwater as contamination smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sun et al 2011 kumar et al 2016 a b mazumder et al 2020 the changing climatic conditions may also substantially influence mobility and accumulation in various environmental components arsenic in aqueous environment exists as arsenite as iii and arsenate as v the arsenite being more toxic and mobile as compared to arsenate singh and singh 2018 most notably its enrichment in groundwater of developing countries like india bangladesh pakistan sri lanka and nepal is posing serious human health hazard mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2006 bundschuh et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 singh and singh 2018 thakur et al 2020 the contamination of as with heavy metals like chromium in united states and european countries is also presented coyte et al 2020 parrone et al 2020 medunić et al 2020 the co contamination of naturally released as with fluoride and the challenges linked with remediation in light of present scenario is presented by maity et al 2021 the study has presented health hazards of these contaminants along with trace elements in groundwater and current progresses on available removal technologies entire bangladesh and its adjoining indian states are badly affected by as concentrations in groundwater beyond the who prescribed permissible limit both in terms of area and population argos et al 2010 lu et al 2012 singh et al 2015 additionally more than 36 million people in bangladesh are exposed to as level beyond 50 μg l the standard permissible limit for bangladesh drinking water causing more than 7000 arsenicosis cases rahman et al 2017 in india 70 4 million population are facing the risks of as toxicity from groundwater contamination chakraborty et al 2017 singh et al 2019 thus the indian subcontinent is a hotspot for as contamination and warrants active research in this area in addition to humans as contamination is known to affect the agricultural crops soil characteristics and bacterial community structure robson et al 2013 gregory et al 2014 deepika et al 2016 thouin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019a incorporation of as in vegetables and rice irrigated with as enriched groundwater is evidenced in bangladesh mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 large population dependence on freshwater reserves therefore necessitates the development of suitable treatment technology for as removal so as to provide as free drinking water thus it is very important to provide as free water to the exposed population kippler et al 2016 bangladesh west bengal in india and some parts of pakistan have achieved remarkable success on such problems by providing low cost treatment technologies to rural population ngai et al 2006 2007 choy and mckay 2012 sarkar and vogt 2015 in conventional treatment plants numbers of methods are currently being used for as removal from contaminated water some most commonly used technologies of interest are plant and microbe assisted processes co precipitation with alum or iron adsorption on oxide surface and nanocomposites sand filtration adsorptive filtration by using activated alumina ion exchange process oxidation with chlorine and ozone lime treatment and membrane processes such as reverse osmosis gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 feistel et al 2016 kobya et al 2016 lata and samadder 2016 mishra and mahato 2016 o farrell et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 2020b maity et al 2020 furthermore low cost treatment methodologies available for surface water rainwater harvesting systems and use of deeper aquifer sources could serve as potential alternatives of as free water singh and singh 2015 maity et al 2020 while considering the problems prospects and limitations associated with various treatment technologies since last few years several important innovative techniques have been developed in the affected indian subcontinent showing good performance in affected rural and urban areas overall several studies have been performed for identifying the spread and depth of as contamination and also several remediation measures have been developed from time to time globally ahmad et al 2017 a b however a comparative account and a holistic technique derived from conventional and emergent remediation technologies for mitigating as contamination is apparently lacking the rationale for this review lies into lack of information in the area of as removal strategies in terms of country wise contribution articles published in different journals year wise trend in research activities and participating research institutes both nationally and internationally in addition recent information on traditional and emerging as removal techniques along with their advantages and disadvantages are not available in a single article therefore in this review we have investigated various available conventional methods like coagulation filtration oxidation adsorption on different materials like activated carbon nanomaterials etc and emerging technologies like bucket treatment unit removal unit attached to hand pump and membrane filtration for the treatment of as contaminated water from various sources and described the importance of conventional as well as emerging physico chemical membrane separation process composite materials and geological materials and biological processes bioremediation so as to provide the latest information in the area of as remediation furthermore in order to evaluate the trends in research on various physico chemical and biological techniques of as removal a bibliometric analysis 1995 2020 is also presented thus provided information could be harnessed for mitigating as contamination in water to alleviate the hazardous impact on natural ecosystem and human health in an ecofriendly manner 2 methodology the bibliometric analysis was carried out using the scopus database scopus was selected due to its wider indexing of journals as compared to other indexing databases such as the web of science and google scholar scopus covering more than 22 000 research journals is one of the largest indexing databases on a wide range of research areas including science and technology a set of keywords was finalized based on the domain knowledge of the researchers engaged in writing this paper subsequently two search queries were formed the search queries were formulated using and and or as the dividing or integrating factors together with the keywords the first search query involves the addressing of as removal through physical and chemical treatment methods while the second search query addresses the biological treatment methods for removal of as present in water the physical and chemical methods of our concern are coagulation filtration lime softening oxidation sedimentation precipitation adsorption ion exchange and osmosis under biological treatment bioremediation and phytoremediation are the two methods of our primary interest the analysis in scopus was carried out for the past years from 1995 to 2020 the date of analysis was 22nd april 2021 the year wise growth of the research on the topic of as removal was considered along with country specific research outputs on the topic for both the search queries further institute wise and journal wise distributions of research on the topics were also analyzed data not presented institute wise distributions with respect to articles on as removal would display the global scenario of active engagement of different nationally and internationally recognized institution to combat the as toxicity resulting from drinking water contamination the gathered information could be helpful in joint collaboration with top institutions to mitigate the negative consequences of as toxicity the data on journal wise distribution using scopus search tool on the other hand would be helpful in disclosing the involvement of various science and technology journals targeting the removal of heavy metals and metalloids like as from contaminated terrestrial and aqueous environment the research output of india was evaluated in order to observe the research activities of the countries actually affected by as pollution overall bibliometric analysis would be helpful in mapping the research activities pertaining to as removal during past decades the analysis provides an overview of research focus on the subject area and the possible way forward it will also help to locate the gap in current research so that funding opportunities could be directed to relevant and significant areas the bibliometric analysis aided us in streamlining the research articles for the detailed review of the available literature on the topic thus after the bibliometric analysis review of selected existing literature was carried out which helped us to assess the research advancements on the as removal techniques during the last decades a review on advanced and sustainable techniques for as removal was carried out in detail in order to provide an in depth understanding of the topic both original research papers and review articles were considered for this purpose only the articles written in english were considered for the analysis thus it eliminates the possible research articles or reviews in other languages 3 researches on as removal a bibliometric analysis as mentioned previously in order to evaluate the trends in research on topics concerned with as and its removal a bibliometric analysis was carried out using different search queries categorized as physico chemical and biological treatments the first search query on physico chemical methods was title abs key arsenic and title abs key coagulation or filtration or softening or oxidation or sedimentation or precipitation or adsorption or ion exchange or osmosis and pubyear 1994 and pubyear 2021 the query results in a total number of 16 474 research documents published during the past years from 1995 to 2020 starting with merely 149 papers on the topic in 1995 the year 2020 observed a total number of 1241 of papers published within a single year fig 1 this signifies the increasing research attention on the topic the usa was the largest contributor of papers under this category with 3594 papers the second ranked china produced around 3519 papers while india stood 3rd with 1404 papers during the same period with respect to physico chemical methods of as removal fig 2 the growing research on as contamination in countries such as india is an encouraging phenomenon as it is a country affected by disastrous as pollution india produced only four research papers on physico chemical treatment of as removal in 1995 which subsequently increased to a remarkable 130 publications in the year 2020 scopus data based on 2021 indicated that indian research institutes such as the indian institute of technology iit kharagpur and roorkee and university of kalyani are pioneers on the topic and contributed largely to the research on this topic nevertheless apart from india the presence of other as pollution affected countries among the most research performing countries is scanty this needs immediate attention both from the global and local research perspectives and policy makers while india still has a long way to go as compared to the usa or china its current research progress concerning as pollution is motivating for the emerging researchers to develop novel approaches to address the continuously rising as contamination problems based on scopus data 2021 among the research institutes and universities globally chinese academy of sciences cas produced the maximum number of papers on physico chemical methods of as removal with a total of 950 papers during the past period from 1995 to 2020 it is interesting to note that although the usa is the largest contributor to the research on the said topic chinese institutes positioned top amongst the institute wise distribution over the years the us epa that produced 172 papers ranked 4th globally and highest among the institutes in the usa among the journals two significant journals in the area of toxic chemicals environmental science and technology and the journal of hazardous materials produced maximum number of papers during the last 25 years data not presented the second search query on biological treatment methods title abs key arsenic and title abs key bioremediation or phytoremediation or remediation and pubyear 1994 and pubyear 2021 results in significant research documents published during past years since 1995 to 2020 fig 3 it is considerably lower than what was published on physico chemical treatment methods thus we observed an increasing emphasis on physico chemical treatment methods as compared to its biological counterpart based on scopus data 2021 china with 1052 published papers ranked first followed by the usa 964 fig 4 in the case of researches on both biological and physico chemical treatment methods we observed that the differences in number of papers published amongst top three contenders are visibly high it signifies an emerging need to fill this vacuum and more research interests by individual countries in order to address this concern as per the data of scopus 2021 again chinese academy of sciences topped among the research institutes producing the most number of papers 315 during this period among the institutes in the usa university of florida ranked 2nd globally with 84 papers published during the previous 25 years which is significantly lower than the numbers of publications contributed by the chinese academy of sciences during the same period here chemosphere is the leading journal with a total number of 222 papers published during the period overall environmental science and technology journal of hazardous materials chemosphere science of the total environment and environmental pollution are some of the leading journals having significant research publications in the field of as contamination and its physico chemical and biological treatment processes as indicated by scopus data 2021 data not presented 4 arsenic treatment techniques several kinds of treatment techniques have been tested for the removal of as from contaminated systems soil and water arsenate as v form of as can be easily removed due to highly adsorptive and less mobile nature as compared to arsenite as iii form for effective treatment of as contaminated water as iii must be transformed first into as v form through pre oxidation the oxidizing agents like cl2 fecl3 and kmno4 effectively oxidize arsenite to arsenate in this review various as removal techniques have been grouped in four different groups viz coagulation filtration adsorption membrane based filtration and biological techniques for the ease of understanding and their removal nature glimpses on the role of different conventional and emerging as removal strategies cost evaluation during purification management of secondary wastes containing as and effluents discharge with particular reference to argentina have been discussed by litter et al 2019 they suggested three major points including 1 information of as contaminated site 2 community sensitivity and 3 research for the development of less expensive arsenic removal procedures the article published by ahmad et al 2017a has provided an overview of various as removal strategies along with their limitations and advantages they have categorized the as treatment into six important techniques i coagulation ii adsorption iii membrane assisted sequestration iv oxidation by oxidizing agents v biological removal and vi source switching i e search for safe groundwater resources the researchers suggested the thorough analysis of groundwater characteristics in terms of ph content of as in different oxidation states and competing ions while targeting the treatment of as contaminated water some important physico chemical as removal techniques are briefly discussed in following sub sections whereas other techniques have been described in the later sections 4 1 physico chemical techniques for as removal 4 1 1 coagulation filtration techniques the process is based on the utilization of chemical substances coagulants like ferric iron catalyzing the conversion of soluble form of as into insoluble ones the coagulation products containing as thereafter are separated simply by using filtration based on gravity or sand the process of coagulation can also be integrated with microfiltration mf technique for effective reduction of as content in water to be treated this is the most efficient technology in which as v adsorption onto coagulated flocs is followed by removal through filtration song et al 2006 if as exists in the form of arsenite as iii it is pre oxidized to arsenate as v prior to its removal kartinen and martin 1995 coagulants to be used for the purpose are rapidly mixed into water to produce their micro flocs of hydroxide nature which further get agglomerated by moderate stirring in this process negatively charged ions including arsenite are electrostatically adsorbed onto precipitated flocs and finally removed from the sample the coagulant type dosage and extreme of ph may affect the efficiency of the process the ph plays a key role in as removal while considering its coagulation by iron as the optimum ph for this process ranges from 6 0 to 8 5 feistel et al 2016 thakur and mondal 2017 the process efficiency is also largely determined by methodology deployed for as coagulation followed by separation hering et al 2017 as well as the oxidation state of the as performance of alum as compared to ferric sulfate is slightly low the most commonly employed coagulation agents are aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 iron chloride fecl3 and ferrous sulfate feso4 however iron salts are one of the most preferred coagulants fecl3 generates relatively larger amounts of flocs as compared to feso4 álvarez ayuso et al 2008 ravenscroft et al 2009 bilici baskan and pala 2010 oehmen et al 2011 under a given range of ph ferric salts have been proved more efficient in removing as v than alum on a weight basis bilici baskan and pala 2010 wang et al 2014 the process can be applied for the treatment of large volumes of contaminated water with as content in several orders of magnitude higher than the permissible limit 10 μg l additionally the coagulation filtration strategy is simultaneously effective in minimizing the high concentrations of commonly occurring co contaminants since coagulation phenomena for as mitigation is not efficient in reducing the level of as below the who permissible limit it is suggested to be used in combination with other methods such as adsorption bora et al 2018 and membrane filtration the cost of precipitation has been calculated as 10 usd per 1000 l volume of as contaminated water the technology is easy as it uses common chemicals low installation costs and its wide applicability to large amounts of water indicating their applicability in poor areas of indian sub continent however the technique suffers limitation because the large amount of sludge is produced during processing further sludge disposal in landfills could be a potent cause of contamination litter et al 2010 moreover the installation of units for large scale treatment of as contaminated water may be considerably affected from the limitations at field scale hering et al 2017 due to spatial changes in water characteristics another technique for as mitigation using electric current mediated precipitation electrocoagulation has been reported to enhance the effectiveness of removal process the technique is affordable and very much efficient in reducing the as content from aqueous media the process of electrocoagulation involving the anodes comprising of metals like aluminium iron and magnesium has shown promising potential in remediation of as contaminated water most remarkably in comparison to the synthetic compounds assisted coagulation for as removal the electrocoagulation is considerably more efficient gandhimathi et al 2015 bandaru et al 2020 moreover with the rise in duration of electrocoagulation process the sulfate content was lowered down considerably as compared to the chemical coagulation relying on introduction of alum the introduction of electric current causes the oxidation of anode resulting in the formation of metal ions as well as the release of electrons moreover the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are generated from the dissociation of water molecules after applying electric current the formation of metal hydroxides caused by the interaction of positively charged metal ions with hydroxyl ions facilitates the adsorption of metal contaminants of interest since the generation of metal hydroxides is substantially regulated by ph of the aqueous medium to be treated the adjustment of ph for optimum as removal is pre requisite in addition the effectiveness of electrocoagulation process is considerably affected by design of reactor and current density applied kobya et al 2020 the process is able to lower the contaminant level well below the who prescribed limit of 10 μg l the maximum cost for as removal per 1000 l of water was determined to range from 0 22 0 31 usd addy et al 2011 suggesting the process utility in poorer areas of the indian sub continent the technical limitations of wide applications appear in the form of electricity demand together with the sludge production the better application in larger plants to provide as free water could be achieved successfully if continuous supply of electricity could be managed 4 1 1 1 lime softening the process of lime softening involves the mixing of samples with lime leading to formation of solid flocs that can be removed simply by sedimentation the softening is facilitated by addition of lime and lime soda very often caustic soda however is also practiced for reducing the amount of sludge produced the selection of lime or other softening material however is based on the characteristics of water samples intended for purification this technique is typically used for water softening in municipal water systems as well as as removal from contaminated water kartinen and martin 1995 lime softening is also effective in reducing as quantity in water and is dependent on the presence of cl2 and ph of the medium arsenic removal is always higher in presence of cl2 than its absence kartinen and martin 1995 have reported as removal up to 15 for water having 400 μg l as but no cl2 while the removal was up to 80 in water containing cl2 at ph higher than 10 5 study of sorg and logsdon 1978 has also shown that as removal by lime softening is ph dependent addition of lime in water increases the ph and oh concentration that removes mg oh 2 and caco3 as precipitates however ph as valence and presence of competing ions such as sulfate phosphate and bicarbonate are the major constraints arising in this technique the major limitation of this process is that the as is not removed up to desired who level 10 μg l and hence it requires secondary treatment ravenscroft et al 2009 further a large amount of lime sludge is produced after addition of multiple chemical substances which is again a major problem for safe disposal the amount of secondary sludge produced after treatment is largely governed by the extent of hardness the additional cost is required for dewatering and thickening of sludge produced thus making the process expensive since the oxidation is effective in minimizing the concentration of as in contaminated water oxidation through cl2 is recommended also addition of acid to treated water is needed to lower the ph of water to an acceptable limit thus the process alone could not be suggested for as removal from contaminated water as well as for further utilization of water for drinking purposes 4 1 2 oxidation oxidation of highly mobile arsenite as iii into comparatively less mobile form arsenate as v can be achieved by oxidative process in groundwater both as iii and as v are present however most of the treatment techniques effectively remove only as v hering et al 1996 hence the pre oxidation step is required to transform as iii to as v this oxidation happens slowly in the presence of air or oxygen and takes around a week hug et al 2003 the rate can be increased by the use of oxidizing agents such as ozone chlorine hypochlorite chlorine dioxide h2o2 yang et al 1999 or sand coated manganese oxide or by other advanced oxidation processes bissen and frimmel 2003 like fenton s reagent driehaus et al 1995 hypochlorite meng et al 2001 and permanganate oxidants like chlorine lytle et al 2005 and permanganate jekel 1994 could be preferred for the fast oxidation of as iii to as v under a wide range of experimental conditions pierce and moore 1982 in general the term oxidation applies for the removal of iron and manganese from contaminated water oxidation of these elements produces insoluble oxides of strong scavenging activity the oxidized as thereafter is eliminated from the contaminated water via sorption jain and singh 2012 onto iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides further the oxide of iron and manganese facilitates the oxidation of as iii to less toxic as v form under these conditions quantity of soluble iron regulates the as removal efficiency through oxidation the iron and as weight ratio up to 20 1 has been demonstrated to give as removal rate up to 80 95 in addition the as removal by manganese oxides is also recognized manganese oxides catalyze the oxidation and subsequent scavenging of as very efficiently and can be applied for in situ remediation of contaminated aquifers driehaus et al 1995 have demonstrated the second order reaction kinetics for arsenite conversion into arsenate through the catalytic action of manganese oxides recently zhang et al 2017 have synthesized ti iv and mn iv based metal oxide complex for simultaneous arsenite oxidation and removal via sorption at neutral ph in the range of 2 60 μg l the methodology was efficient in arsenite 107 0 mg g metal oxide removal as compared to arsenate 87 2 mg g binary metal oxide most importantly some of the naturally occurring oxides of mn such as birnessite are known to rapidly catalyze the as oxidation and subsequent removal these naturally present mineral forms if could be synthesized under laboratory conditions may give a novel approach to mitigate the as calamity however the process is expensive in nature and could not be suggested for in situ remediation of as contamination in poorer areas of the indian subcontinent the weak oxidation through chlorine and other oxidants may result in formation of hazardous by products and elevate the overall cost of the process recently cu doped zno material has been prepared through precipitation methods for oxidation of as under the presence of sunlight vaiano et al 2018 the prepared materials reflected good as binding affinity in real groundwater conditions the arsenite was oxidized completely within 2 h of treatment the effectiveness of advanced oxidation coagulation filtration aocf for treating arsenic contaminated water below 1 μg l concentration relying on batch and pilot studies at varying ph doses of oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate and ferric chloride unmodified and metal oxide laden sand and grain size has been documented by ahmad et al 2017b the metal oxide coated sand was more effective in lowering the as concentration remarkably the aocf process did not influence the removal of commonly occurring drinking water contaminants including iron manganese and ammonium the importance of sequential treatment with mno4 and fe3 with an objective to oxidize the arsenite to more adsorptive arsenate form is highlighted by ahmad et al 2018 the purification of groundwater in an aeration rapid sand filtration unit based on oxidizing agent 1 2 mg l permanganate and 1 8 mg l ferric ions lowered the arsenic content well below 1 μg l without perturbing the removal of ferrous and manganous ions as well as the microbiological activity of nitrifying prokaryotes interestingly different oxidation and precipitation products of fe and mn can reveal the complex sequestration process and facilitate in optimizing the removal of contaminant of interest ahmad et al 2019 in another investigation ahmad et al 2020b reported the arsenic sequestration potential of rapid sand filtration media rendered by manganese oxide and microbial activity of arsenic oxidizing microbes for artificially recharged water the arsenic removal below 1 μg l may be achieved either by treating the influent or effluent of rapid sand filter by sequential addition of permanganate and ferric iron and only ferric chloride respectively reduction in ph of water dominated with arsenate ions was found as an important step for accelerating the as precipitation during treatment process rapid sand filter directs the rapid conversion of arsenite to arsenate form thereby producing the effluent enriched with arsenate ions ahmad et al 2020a below 1 μg l the oxidation triggered by rapid sand filter media is influenced substantially by nature of filter grain size in addition to the depth of supernatant the research and development of newer oxidizing substances such as metal complexes of non hazardous nature may improve the overall as removal efficiencies of currently existing technologies table 1 lists some methods of as oxidation for efficient removal 4 1 2 1 oxidation of naturally occurring iron and as and its removal arsenic oxidation and its removal using naturally present iron in groundwater are an attractive and emerging methodology more than 65 as affected areas in bangladesh have been reported to contain iron up to 2 mg l at a few of the as contaminated sites iron concentrations up to 15 mg l have also been reported however in most of the cases no correlation was found between iron and as arsenic is very efficiently adsorbed and sequestered onto precipitates of fe oh 3 and oxidation product of fe oh 2 thus aeration and sedimentation of such tube wells possessing higher iron content remove as effectively small scale applicable iron removal plants irps have been developed based on the process of aeration followed by precipitation sedimentation and filtration which can remove as from contaminated sources such irps plants also behave as as removal systems as demonstrated in noakhali because of arsenite oxidation to arsenate dahi and liang 1998 various oxidation strategies for as minimization are shown in table 1 4 1 3 adsorption adsorption refers to the surface binding of liquid or gaseous molecules to solid or liquid substratum depending upon the type of interactions involved the adsorption can be categorized as physical or chemical the adsorption is dependent on different factors such as temperature pressure porosity and surface area physical adsorption is characterized by reversible binding accompanied with the release of energy the characteristic feature of physical adsorption lies into multilayer binding of adsorbate through van der waal s interactions onto the adsorbent surface mckay 1995 dąbrowski 2001 adsorption has been widely exploited for as removal due to process simplicity high efficiency and low cost in nature arsenic removal through adsorption is affected by content of as oxidation state temperature ph of the medium presence of common competing ions and contact time usepa 2000 in most of the observed cases arsenate has been found to exhibit strong adsorption affinity toward a particular adsorbent as compared to arsenite the adsorption of as onto an adsorbent is better explained by adsorption isotherm models in which langmuir and freundlich are the most common one the adsorption isotherms readily and suitably describes the phenomenon underlying metal metalloid mobilization and sorption foo and hameed 2010 chakraborty et al 2017 arsenic removal by adsorption is a highly efficient and cost effective method as compared to other methods like membrane techniques foam floatation solvent extraction bioremediation etc historically adsorption by charcoal has been used for treatment of drinking water agrafioti et al 2014 some of the important adsorption strategies for arsenic removal from contaminated water are presented below 4 1 3 1 activated alumina based adsorption activated alumina al2o3 possesses good ability to sorb the as due to its higher surface area it is an important area of research on which a search on scopus with keywords activated alumina and arsenic results in 157 documents since the year 1994 column containing activated alumina has revealed good as removal efficiency together with other impurities tripathy and raichur 2008 with the time elapse the column begins to saturate with metal ions of interest firstly in the upper zone and reaching thereafter in the lower column zone arsenic binding to column materials saturates the column that needs to be regenerated for effective as removal su et al 2008 ghosh and gupta 2012 regeneration of saturated alumina performed by treating the column with dilute solution of sodium hydroxide 4 releases the wastewater containing higher amount of as washed out naoh is discarded and the column is neutralized by using a very dilute solution of sulfuric acid 2 studies on activated alumina for as removal include those conducted by shi and yan 2015 karmacharya et al 2016 lata and samadder 2016 lee et al 2017 and wendimu et al 2017 thus column saturation and washing as well as washout management is the major constraint for this method 4 1 3 2 cartridge filter based as adsorption cartridge filters containing easily available adsorbent materials including resins have demonstrated efficient separation of as together with dissolved ions contaminated water bearing impurities other than iron and as saturate the filter media very quickly which needs to be regenerated to achieve better performance of cartridge filter village level installation and performance were tested for such filters named as chiyoda arsenic removal unit japan and coolmart water purifier korea bangladesh university of engineering and technology buet have tested as remediation from groundwater using a unit possessing iron coated sand effective iron content to be loaded on sand has been determined as 25 mg g joshi and choudhuri 1996 contaminated water containing as up to the 300 mg l has been treated through 350 bed volume iron coated sand to reach drinking water as level as prescribed by bangladesh but not up to the level as suggested by who iron encrusted brick dust similar to iron coated sand has also been tested to purify as enriched water since the process is costly it could not be afforded by the poorer people of developing nations 4 1 3 3 activated carbon based as removal allen and whitten 1998 presented generation and characterization of activated carbon from various carbonaceous materials literature reviews have been published on methodologies and uses of charcoal mohan and pittman jr 2007 mohan et al 2007 for instance a basic search in scopus database using the keywords activated carbon and arsenic results in 546 research documents in the year 1994 activated carbons have been tested for both arsenite and arsenate removal from water use of activated carbon for remediation of as and antimony originated from the electroplating industry has also been evaluated higher as adsorption efficiency 2860 mg g has been reported for coal based activated carbon complexes with metals like silver and copper lorenzen et al 1995 demonstrated that the process was not effective in reducing as content below the who standard limit payne and abdel fattah 2005 studied the importance of ph and temperature on arsenite and arsenate removal by activated carbon it plays an important role for the adsorption of as there are considerable chances of failure of this technology because of the spatial changes in water characteristics such as ph temperature as well as ion and mineral contents moreover as desorption by using suitable acidic or alkaline solution to reuse the activated carbon may significantly affect their adsorption behavior only a few of available activated charcoal have been known to be effective for as sequestration vitela rodriguez and rangel mendez 2013 gong et al 2015 karmacharya et al 2016 indicating the major shortcomings of the technology for production of as free water 4 1 3 4 arsenic adsorption and removal by geological materials remediation of as by naturally occurring geological materials such as iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides clay materials limestone feldspar laterites and soils have been explored in several studies these materials possess the potential of adsorbing as at ph under different natural aqueous environment the utilization of geological materials has emerged as promising solution at small level for the rural settlement of various developing and under developed countries bundschuh et al 2010 the researchers reported the major limitations of emerging methodologies due to financial problems and support from authorities use of these materials has gained a great attention due to less costly nature and easy accessibility suggesting their wide applicability in poor regions of developing countries various naturally occurring zeolites baskan and pala 2011 pizarro et al 2021 are reported but only few of them have been utilized for as removal purposes because of differences in purity and availability suggesting differential behavior in as removal from contaminated water however in few cases they can be preferred for as mitigation due to their characteristics such as highly adsorptive nature conferred by iron manganese and aluminum oxides and hydroxides ion exchange process and coagulation ability depending on the nature of pollutant and toxicity use of modified zeolites generated by ion exchange process can serve as better alternative for sequestration of metals of interest including as but application at larger scale would be very much costly thus limiting the employment of technology in poorer regions of the indian subcontinent overall the as removal using geological materials is highly influenced by the characteristics of the materials used as content and its oxidation states regulatory limits of different countries and the most importantly expenses required for installing the unit 4 1 3 5 arsenic removal using nanomaterials 4 1 3 5 1 batch mixed iron and their nanomaterials for as treatment role of iron in as sorption and removal is experienced in many experimental studies batch studies have indicated that 1 iron filling ranging from 250 to 625 mg l can remove up to 2000 mg l arsenate from the medium in very short duration ramaswami et al 2001 2 medium containing sulfate was found to induce as removal while presence of phosphate inhibited the as removal process 3 iron filling strongly absorbing the as can be reutilized for minimum 100 times while employed for as removal 4 biologically produced iron and manganese oxide serve as very good scavenger for as and 5 already dissolved iron present in the range of 100 300 mg l may facilitate the process of adsorption being efficient simple in nature and reusability of iron filling the process makes the technique attractive for large scale application to provide as free water system works well even in the presence of dissolved sulfate ions with no requirement of oxygenation mohan and pittman jr 2007 have summarized different adsorbents used for as sequestration various synthetic and commercial activated carbons and less expensive as well as efficient adsorbents have been discussed several adsorbents have been prepared so far to remove the as level up to who permissible limit hajji et al 2019 have elucidated the simultaneous sorption of as and chromium onto nano sized minerals of iron there was partial oxidation of arsenite into arsenate without involvement of external oxidant indicating its suitability for industrial scale decontamination improvement in binding affinity and changes at nano structured level give development of novel adsorbents for efficient as recovery from contaminated water application of nanomaterials has revolutionized the water purification technology synthesis of novel nanomaterials with strong as binding efficiency has been recently reported uppal et al 2019 the developed nanomaterials had as removal efficiency up to 100 in the medium with ph ranging from 2 to 10 the nano adsorbent was able to efficiently sequester the dissolved as approximately 300 mg as removal was observed with 1 g of adsorbent interestingly the zinc based nanomaterials were reusable up to five times several workers have reported binary nano composites for treatment of as laden water yttrium ferric based adsorbent for arsenate removal is reported by yu et al 2019 the higher removal was observed at acidic ph however the process of as removal was hindered in the presence of competing ions recently eslami et al 2019 have shown the binary nano oxide consisting of iron and manganese for arsenate removal from contaminated water interestingly the composite was able to remove the as content well below the who permissible limit of 10 μg l apart from these adsorbents other plant derived adsorbents has been prepared to eliminate as from contaminated water most of the adsorbents developed so far are not very much successful at industrial scale calling for further improvement in the area further the regeneration of used adsorbent may be time consuming and costly in most of the cases 4 1 3 5 2 nanoparticle based as adsorption and removal nanotechnology has influenced water treatment technology at a great extent it is widely used in developing sensors for detection of as contamination kaur et al 2015 in view of smaller size and larger surface areas nanomaterials have considerably received the worldwide attention of researchers actively engaged in water purification technology through nanotechnology many of the challenges associated with currently practiced as removal technologies can be solved in a better way together with the development of low cost water treatment methodology for sustainable management of contaminated groundwater and surface water the key search word application of nanoparticle in arsenic removal displayed a total of 1510 results for the year 2018 only indicating the rapid interest and application of nanotechnology in the field of as remediation most importantly many of these technologies rely on iron oxide based nanomaterials prathna et al 2018 the iron oxide based nanomaterials are not only efficient in removing as but also for decontamination of other commonly occurring pollutants of inorganic and organic nature feng et al 2012 have reported the removal of arsenite as well as arsenate using fe3o4 nanoparticles one gram of nanomaterial was able to sequester 46 06 and 16 56 mg of arsenite and arsenate respectively since most of the adsorbent materials developed so far are much effective in removing arsenate the higher adsorption affinity of nanomaterials toward reduced form of as i e as iii thus indicates in situ suitability of iron based nano adsorbent for the treatment of predominantly as iii contaminated aquifers due to prevailing reducing environmental conditions apart from iron based nanomaterials nano adsorbent utilizing mno2 gupta et al 2012 and cuo2 goswami et al 2012 have also been tested recently mishra and rai 2019 have explored the applicability of newly synthesized nanomaterials gel consisting of cerium and titanium for fast adsorption and removal of as the adsorbent was effective in reducing total as concentration below 7 μg l a total of 99 as removal was attained within 10 min the researchers claimed the suitability of nanomaterials under varying ph range and in presence of common competing ions the bound as was not released into the medium from the adsorbent even after 24 h indicating strong affinity of synthesized nano adsorbents abundance of interconnected pores in nanomaterials and oxidation of as iii were described to be responsible for very fast removal of as from the medium nevertheless the nanomaterials based as removal technology too can suffer from limitations for example under field conditions the efficacy may be altered because of variations in physico chemical characteristics of water intended to be purified during the deposition process of iron nanoparticles on filter media there are also the chances of agglomeration culminating into reduced sorption efficiency the cost for the development of a particular nano adsorbent may be higher further the adsorbent developed may be saturated at certain cycle of treatment which would need the replenishment with fresh nano adsorbent in addition there are also the chances of leaching of nanomaterials in the treated water suggesting the requirement of strong binding of adsorbent with the wall materials leaching of the nanomaterials into treated water may prove harmful to humans and other mammalian systems if consumed beyond the threshold limit list of different adsorbents along with plant derived ones for as removal are presented in tables 2 4 4 1 3 5 3 arsenic adsorption onto nano zerovalent iron nzvi composites adsorption onto nano zerovalent iron nzvi has emerged as an efficient technology for rapid removal of as from contaminated water systems application of nzvi for as removal is less expensive and an environmental process for as mitigation arsenic removal by nzvi may be based on processes like adsorption oxidation reduction physico chemical characteristics of adsorbate ph and availability of oxygen in the vicinity as well as the proportions of adsorbent and adsorbate powders synthesized from zerovalent iron have been implicated in permeable reactive barriers prbs in order to sequester the as present in plumes of aquifers bang et al 2005 they have also been used for as removal in man made household filters as reported for developing countries leupin and hug 2005 it has promising in situ as removal potential kanel et al 2005 because of larger surface area thus higher rate of as retention onto its surface zhu et al 2009 since application of nzvi as such for as remediation purposes may result into loss of nanomaterials nzvi because of the nano size and may suffer from enrichment of iron content in drinking water its adsorption onto suitable supporting substratum is inevitable step for its better performance zhou et al 2014 has demonstrated the efficiency of biochar immobilized nzvi for removal of different metals including as biochar integrated with the nzvi wang et al 2017 removed arsenate mainly due to electrostatic interactions the adsorbed arsenate present on biochar nzvi composite could be easily separated from the medium because of magnetic properties of adsorbent arsenic sorption onto zvi supported on biochar is recently described bakshi et al 2018 the ph of medium could have considerable impacts on as sequestration but wu et al 2017 have recently described minimal effects of ph variation on as sorbing capacity of nzvi as compared to zvi they explained that corrosion of nzvi had a significant contribution towards more effective as binding in contrast to electrostatic interaction the nzvi may be successfully deployed for as decontamination at varying ph range due to nano range size and magnetic properties of nzvi there are ample chances of particle aggregation that may significantly reduce their as binding affinity such problems however can be managed effectively by fixing them onto suitable support material of non toxic nature 4 2 emerging as removal technologies 4 2 1 bucket treatment unit btu bucket treatment unit btu depending on coagulation process could be helpful in providing as free water at smaller scale the department of public health engineering dphe danida project assessed the as removal based on coagulation and adsorption processes in a sequential manner separate bucket of red and green color each with 20 l volume was stacked together vertically for the purpose of treatment chemicals necessary for coagulation are mixed manually in the upper bucket containing contaminated water and shaken rapidly followed by gentle stirring for 90 s precipitated substance is allowed to settle down for 2 h content of the upper bucket is released slowly through a sand filter into the lower bucket flow is maintained by adjusting the valve situated above the bottom in a way that does not disturb the established flocs thus treated water is received into the lower green bucket results under field as well as laboratory conditions showed good efficiency in as removal kohnhorst and paul 2000 sarkar et al 2010 large scale investigation project under bamwsp dfid water aid 2001 and rapid assessment program demonstrated differential performance in some instances the treatment procedure was insufficient to reduce the as content below the prescribed limits probably due to the differences in water quality characteristics however the treatment unit can be simply manufactured at minimum cost by employing easily available low cost materials and proper operation was found to give satisfactory results ahmed 2001 the technology could be recommended for future application at small scale in poorer regions of indian subcontinent 4 2 2 bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir filter unit coagulation co precipitation based systems manufactured by bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir to minimize the as content employed iron mediated flocculation followed by sand filtration however the treatment unit did not participate during exhaustive testing programmes hassan et al 2009 the filter is easy for use at small scale only and suitable for utilization in poorer areas of indian subcontinent 4 2 3 arsenic removal unit attached to hand pump this is the most attractive and sustainable method for the as removal the unit employs sequential coagulation in the presence of alum followed by sedimentation and filtration in a simple unit to facilitate water treatment at household level in various states of india including west bengal the as treatment unit attached with hand pumps effectively removes up to 90 as when subjected to contaminated water containing its content of 300 mg l but not up to the who prescribed limit the technology could be modified for small scale application to provide as free water 4 2 4 membrane based as removal techniques currently membrane based purification systems to minimize the contaminant level are being preferred worldwide some commonly used membrane based techniques to reduce the concentration of heavy metal oid s such as iron manganese as and dissolved solids include electro dialysis reverse osmosis nanofiltration etc here the membrane filters act as a physical barrier to restrict the movement of solutes but allow the movement of water membrane separation techniques depend on the driving force available in the operation to carry out the removal of impurities from feed water classification of membrane based separations on the basis of driving force is as follows 1 pressure driven operations such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and microfiltration 2 operations in electrical potential gradient such as electro dialysis and electro filtration and 3 operations including temperature gradient such as membrane distillation various techniques with important advantages and limitations are described in table 5 4 2 4 1 reverse osmosis ro among various high pressure membrane techniques reverse osmosis ro has the promising application in as rejection from the feed water dropping off its concentration from 1000 μg l to 10 μg l ideal working parameters like high pressure range of 75 250 psi or even higher can yield the 95 efficiency in as removal letterman 1999 the pore size of membranes is appropriate for removal of solvated as ro operating in lateral configuration permeates only 10 15 feed water through it in household systems where only a small volume of contaminant free water is needed for culinary work and drinking purposes this slow purification may be satisfactory rejection of as in ro is independent of ph but arsenite at higher ph value 8 is very easily rejected in the ro system due to charged nature as compared to lower ph value narasimhan et al 2005 the limitation of the ro system can be assessed in terms of its cost and highly concentrated salts containing heavy pollutant load which is not easy to handle with pollutant removal from water with different sources possesses variations in physico chemical properties which again limits its wider applicability even in developed countries 4 2 4 2 electrodialysis ed electrodialysis ed is a widely accepted technique as it segregates both cations and anions that helps in elimination of metals of interest from wastewater and produces potable water from brackish water being ecofriendly and economical ed gives advantage of reusing as in the pharmaceutical industry and pesticide production so far ed reports limited literature on as removal however ribeiro et al 2000 used this method for removal from 26 7 to 98 7 of as from chromated copper arsenate cca treated wood by applying water and different concentrations of oxalic acid up to 99 of as removal has been reported by using this process critical investigations of the ph temperature and co contaminants along with the as should be conducted to produce the water either free from as or well below the who prescribed limits the process is not suitable for poorer regions of the indian subcontinent where electricity is a major limiting factor 4 2 4 3 ultrafiltration uf ultrafiltration uf a competitive treatment as compared to conventional ones is used worldwide for as removal from various water resources pal 2015 although having prominent use in medical sciences its application in wastewater treatment has shown remarkable results uf as a low pressure membrane operating in the range of 0 5 bars 5 0 bars is capable of removing macromolecules colloids and some particulate constituents in case of pore size ranging from 10 to 200 μm uf may not be a viable technology but with the application of electric repulsion the efficiency of the process can be enhanced uf technique can be used for pollutant removal simultaneously with efficient as oxidation followed by its adsorption onto ferric iron for less costly as remediation molinari and argurio 2017 the technique is not only efficient in removal of inorganic pollutants but also for effective removal of pathogenic microbes such as bacteria and viruses agarwal et al 2013 suggesting their wider applicability however the technique has been reported inefficient in removing the as content to maximum allowable contaminant level of 10 μg l gecol et al 2004 the addition of surfactant however improved the as removal efficiency with produced water having as content well below the who prescribed limits 4 2 4 4 microfiltration mf microfiltration mf is a physical process depending on the membrane s pore size that removes the contaminants mainly in the form of suspended solids and colloids usually ferric chloride is added in the water containing as ferric chloride hydrolyses and precipitates as ferric hydroxide which is filtered out prominent results are obtained for as removal with pore size ranging from 0 1 to 1 0 μm koyuncu et al 2015 chellam and sari 2016 molinari and argurio 2017 the successfulness of mf process has been claimed for reduction of as content in treated water limiting up to 2 μg l atkinson 2006 the study demonstrated the feasibility of uf as one of the economical and successful techniques in sequestration of as from contaminated regions however the larger application for generating as free water is not achieved so far since the process could not apply equally for as contaminated surface and groundwater with varying ph conditions different oxidation states and redox environment sracek et al 2004 therefore research should be conducted to optimize the pore size in order to have the maximum as removal efficiency the suspended solids may clog the pores and limit the as removal process hence techniques should be developed to revive the clogged pores for better as removal without affecting the nature of membrane 4 2 4 5 nanofiltration nf nanofiltration nf is an emerging pressure driven technique in the water purification process because of its capability in removing a broad spectrum of contaminants in a single treatment process siddique et al 2020 boussouga et al 2021 the considerable effectiveness of metal derived nanoparticles in water purification via nf is critically reviewed by pradeep 2009 the author has pointed out the potential of noble metal nanoparticles enabled by less reactiveness in combating the global menace of water contamination recently the group of author has designed and developed the nanomaterials assisted water purification technology known as amrit arsenic and metal removal through indian technology the appropriateness of the technique not only lies in removal of inorganic contaminants but also for organic contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms further the group has worked on biological material supported composite nanomaterials for the process of water decontamination sankar et al 2013 the technique achieves high permeability as compared to ro technique used for desalination variations in process parameters such as increase in ph decrease in operating temperature and as feed concentration lead to higher as removal permeate flux can reach to its maximum value at ph 8 0 with optimum variation in temperature and pressure pal et al 2014 jadhav et al 2016 gaikwad and balomajumder 2017 harisha et al 2010 have reported 99 8 removal of arsenate ions meeting the who standard along with dissolved solid and other co occurring contaminants with the help of nanofiltration technology optimization of different parameters such as pressure feed concentration and run time using mathematical modeling along with small scale tests could serve as an important step for improving the application of nanofiltration technology at larger community level further the daily maintenance by a skilled person required for continuous maximum efficiency of the process is one of the major limitations in poorer areas of the indian subcontinent 4 2 4 6 electrofiltration ef membrane processes when actuated with the passage of electric charge across membrane filtration enhance the contaminant removal efficiency arsenic as a negatively charged ion as v can readily be removed by applying the electric charge in electro ultra filtration euf lohokare et al 2008 sánchez and rivas 2010 hsieh et al 2008 reported the as removal efficiency up to 79 during ef the reduction of as concentration from 49 μg l to 8 4 μg l through the ef process is reported earlier hsieh et al 2008 however at higher concentration the treatment could not produce the water with as concentration within the limits of who standards the requirement of electricity makes the process expensive and unsuitable for larger scale application in poorer locations of developing countries furthermore due to considerable changes in water characteristics from place to place the process is not effective under natural conditions thus limiting their wider applicability and calls for further research in this direction 4 2 4 7 membrane distillation md during the membrane distillation md process only vapor phase molecules are allowed to pass through the membrane it produces ultrapure water from feed at quite high concentration being a thermally driven process its efficiency decreases with increase in solute concentration because of decrease in vapor pressure direct contact md process has higher as removal efficiency as compared to other pressure driven membrane processes ashoor et al 2016 manna and pal 2016 manna et al 2010 have described the applicability of solar light assisted generation of 100 as free water without membrane fouling the high cost of electricity based processes limits its application however solar light driven processes could be a viable option for as affected poorer areas of the indian subcontinent the geographical regions across the globe receiving low light could not employ the solar light driven membrane distillation process for as mitigation furthermore the process is also susceptible to limitations imposed by characteristics of membrane used optimization of different process parameters with as contaminated water from different locations could be extensively conducted to enhance the efficiency of developed methodology 4 2 4 8 ion exchange membrane iem this technique is based on utilization of especially designed resins with strong ion exchange properties ion exchange membranes iem are among the most commonly practiced technique for removal of dissolved metal ions from aqueous medium pessoa lopes et al 2016 lee et al 2017 binding of metals ions saturates the adsorption sites available in iem and thus requires the treatment of resins with sodium chloride to regenerate the available sites the process suitability may have more attractive metal sequestration features if resins showing substantial affinity with as could be developed employment of resins for water purification has been represented in bangladesh the process also utilizes the application of sodium hypochlorite naocl the use of naocl in the process not only enhances arsenite oxidation to achieve higher levels of adsorption but also kills the harmful pathogenic bacteria present in the contaminated water in iem hybrid ion exchange and membrane technology targeting as removal from drinking water consists of arsenate movement via ion exchange membrane followed by precipitation and separation the advantage associated with this technique is freshwater production by ph adjustment and coagulant dose selection of particular ion exchange membranes depends on the valence state of as ions to be transported together with iron and aluminum based coagulant dose to maintain the effectiveness 4 2 5 biological as removal methodologies bioremediation is a biological agent aided environment friendly process aimed for both organic and inorganic contaminant removal microbes can be very effectively employed in a given environment for toxic compound detoxification thereby minimizing the effect singh et al 2021 although metals cannot be degraded they can be transformed in such a way to make them immobile or unavailable stucker et al 2013 bioremediation involves the exploitation of biological agents including bacteria algae fungi and their products for the decontamination of soil and water pokhrel and viraraghavan 2008 raj et al 2013 plant aided remediation i e phytoremediation for treatment of as polluted sites bears advantages of environment friendliness and less costlier nature valls and de lorenzo 2002 wang and zhao 2009 various microbiological processes are involved for as detoxification including transport through membrane protein immobilization volatile form production by methylation surface adsorption and oxido reduction reactions under the influence of microbiological activity triggered by sulphur iron manganese and organic material as mobilization in an environment is greatly affected in addition in many anaerobic reactions as can be respired by a variety of microbes many microorganisms in nature are equipped with the property of metal transformation into volatile forms challenger et al 1955 biovolatilization is the process mediated by several bacterial and fungal species converting inorganic arsenicals to less toxic methylated as species such as monomethylarsenic species and dimethylarsenic species rodriguez et al 1999 cernansky et al 2009 majumder et al 2013 biologically produced metal oxides and sulfides such as iron and manganese oxides and iron sulfides are another precipitation based mechanisms used by microorganisms for as removal this process is simple attractive and low cost in nature omoregie et al 2013 diverse group of microorganisms inhabiting in a higher as concentration environment have been represented oremland and stolz 2003 because of tolerance to higher as concentration transformation ability role in biogeochemical cycling these microbial communities can be preferred for remediation practices arsenic tolerance and resistance by selected bacterial species makes them attractive candidates for as removal from contaminated groundwater liu et al 2013a the microorganisms exhibiting as removal potential are shown in table 6 with their mechanisms bacteria utilized for as remediation purposes can be grouped into ferrous oxidizing manganese oxidizing sulfate reducing and as resistant type pennesi et al 2012 and mattes et al 2013 isolated neutrophilic iron oxidizing autotrophic bacteria respiring on nitrate and used for remediation of zinc and as in industrial landfill sites at british columbia biological oxidation of iron singh et al 2018 and manganese is also being considered as an emerging treatment process for the bioremediation of as from contaminated groundwater most of the bacterial species removing as can maintain themselves in a higher as environment but one possessing the property of arsenate conversion to arsenite and their accumulation inside the cell are better called as as resistant type genes such as arsr and arsc present either on chromosome and plasmid or both and expressing the regulatory protein arsr and enzyme arsenate reductase govern as resistance in the bacterial system respectively other literatures of significant importance are wang et al 2012 ye et al 2012 bachate et al 2013 y chen et al 2013a 2013b guardiola et al 2013 hamzah et al 2013 kruger et al 2013 liao et al 2013 and liu et al 2013b list of various bacterial and fungal species employed for as removal is presented in table 6 some of the hyperaccumulators reported for as removal from contaminated environment are presented in table 7 the cost of producing as free water for some techniques available based on shan et al 2018 are presented in table 8 most of the bioremediation processes under laboratory conditions were able to produce as free water meeting the standards of who limits important organisms mechanisms and factors along with the limitations of as bioremediation techniques are included in fig 5 4 2 6 community based as removal systems more than 100 million people in bangladesh and india are severely affected by consumption of contaminated groundwater containing as levels beyond 50 μg l the groundwater as contamination has emerged as a natural calamity affecting a very large population across the globe more than 200 as purifying units have been installed in the indian subcontinent under the collaborative programme of bengal engineering and science university besu india and lehigh university usa regularly about two lacks people get access to as free drinking water by these purification systems the purified water contains the dissolved solids different nutrient ions iron and manganese in acceptable limits after certain duration of running villagers regenerate the adsorbing materials of installed system for efficient working of purifying unit cost of purification is made by contribution among villagers trained persons of villages are involved in such material regeneration regeneration process improves the efficiency of the purification system and reduces solid waste generation by two times to minimize the as loss by leaching solid waste containing as is stored in sand filters kurniawan et al 2012 so far many modifications in the unit have been done to enhance the performance maintenance metal recovery and safe disposal of solid waste having concentrated as the purification unit is very much successful in remote locations because of safety easy and fast regeneration ability the unit is promising and applicable to as affected south east asian countries because of local management and purification by less trained villagers and low cost regeneration 4 2 7 mitigating the water contaminated with arsenic through public awareness arsenic toxicity effect in most of these regions across the globe is natural in origin that needs the public awareness involvement of local action and public pressure to respective governments to support the as affected regions thakur et al 2020 electronic media such as television and radio play important role in such activities by providing information related to as toxicity and their local specific removal technologies and methods awareness programs by activities like folk dances nukkad natak and region specific songs may help a lot among the local population in mitigations of as associated health problems special attention is needed for the women and children of remote areas that do not have access to the media the awareness programs should be conducted in a proper manner so that people may share information without any pressure and hesitation awareness among local people should be done about the easily available low cost novel materials and easy maintenance of treatment units attention on these factors should be kept in mind while suggesting the use of small scale as removal units timely checking of units installed for as removal should be performed for better operation and management better training on maintenance of these as purification units is of utmost importance 5 conclusions arsenic contamination of water is a serious problem across the globe posing serious threat to a larger population especially those inhabiting in asian countries this problem would worsen the conditions of people inhabiting such areas day by day if proper and efficient treatment technologies are not adopted bibliometric analysis revealed the need of extensive research for the abatement of as toxicity in affected areas across the globe the present review has made an effort to summarize the physical chemical and biological aspects of as removal moreover pros and cons of different methods in use have also been highlighted the analysis revealed integration of physico chemical and biological techniques for the efficient treatment of as contaminated water since as removal by different processes is considerably affected by chemical characteristics of water and design of reactors there is a need for more research and development activities to achieve the lab to land approach the extensive bibliometric analysis on individual physico chemical and biological process for removal of as would impart necessary information needed for enhancing the removal of as from contaminated water under natural environmental conditions bibliometric information pertinent to actively engaged research institutions along with countries increasingly participating in low cost as removal strategies as evidenced by research publications could be helpful in joint collaboration to alleviate the global menace of as contamination in water development of low cost on site as determination tools would further help to galvanize the remediation of as affected areas for ecofriendly management of as induced toxicity in human and on natural environment technological advancement should be implemented in such a way that can be beneficial for the as affected population in the developing and underdeveloped nations of the world further interdisciplinary research and public awareness should be promoted to achieve the goal of as mitigation by sustainable approaches in affected regions author s agreement all the authors

11934,applying conventional numerical techniques for solving advection dominated problems especially in the presence of sharp gradients produces inaccurate results this paper presents a robust numerical scheme for approximating the advection equation the proposed scheme is based on the method of characteristics and lagrange interpolation the accuracy and validity of the developed model have been verified through several test cases the comparison between numerical outcomes and the exact solutions revealed the great capability of the proposed scheme to simulate the sharp gradient of the initial distribution and the rotating velocity field besides it indicated deploying higher order polynomials can lead to obtaining an accurate solution for the advection dominated problem the stability analysis of different lagrange interpolation polynomials has been carried out by comparing both amplification factor and relative phase error of the polynomials under different courant numbers the results can serve as a prominent indication for choosing a perfect algebraic polynomial interpolation to solve advection dominated problems graphical abstract image 1 keywords advection dominated problems numerical scheme method of characteristics lagrange interpolation stability analysis 1 introduction over the past several decades the human population has sharply increased bringing about a great number of environmental issues one of these problems is pollution which has a great number of forms such as air pollution soil contamination water pollution and thermal pollution during the previous decades not only the amount of contamination has been raising but also the contents of the pollutants have been getting more and more complex investigation of water air and soil pollution requires a detailed simulation of contaminant transport based on mathematical modelling techniques the advection diffusion reaction adr equation is commonly used to model the behavior of contaminant transport mclaughlin et al 2016 this equation consists of three different terms including advection hyperbolic diffusion parabolic and reaction source and sink each of these processes has a unique mechanism as a result each of the terms has its own challenges therefore the method of fractional steps is a suitable technique to solve the adr equation this method makes it possible to employ different separate numerical schemes for various terms providing an accurate numerical approximation is significant due to the fact that this equation normally does not have closed form analytical solutions al lawatia et al 1999 advection dominated problem is a special kind of partial differential equation pde in which other terms may be quite small in contrast to advection thus advection plays a more significant role than other terms linge and langtangen 2017 when the advection term dominates numerical methods will encounter some difficulties especially in the presence of sharp gradients in these such states standard finite element and finite difference methods produce excessive numerical diffusion or oscillation cao et al 2017 in this case using an efficient and accurate numerical model has ever increasing importance utilizing a mathematical numerical technique to approximate an equation inevitably contains errors which can even defile the entire solution zikanov 2019 to increase the accuracy of the approximation of advection dominated problems the advection equation should be solved by an accurate numerical scheme for this reason many researchers developed different methods to solve the advection equation these methods include classical finite difference method appadu 2013 nair 2019 method of characteristic with galerkin method szymkiewicz 1993 high order finite element method price et al 1968 high order finite difference methods mohebbi and dehghan 2010 gurarslan et al 2013 2014 green element method taigbenu and onyejekwe 1997 cubic and extended b spline collocation methods mittal and jain 2012 goh and ismail 2013 irk et al 2015 cubic quartic and quintic b spline differential quadrature methods korkmaz and dağ 2012 2016 method of characteristics unified with splines holly and preissmann 1977 tsai et al 2004 2006 cubic trigonometric b spline approach nazir et al 2016 taylor collocation and taylor galerkin methods lin et al 2011 least squares finite element

classical approaches are incapable of considering some more general environmental conditions observed in heterogeneous environments and capturing shock zhao et al 2018 positivity preserving can be regarded as a great property of the numerical scheme which has been widely investigated in the past several methods to assuring numerical positivity exist in the literature such as positivity property for flux splitting schemes wang and liu 2003 fan et al 2017 positivity preserving and energy stable schemes yang and zha 2017 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 second order positivity preserving scheme chertock and kurganov 2008 gao and wu 2015 dong et al 2020 in the present paper a new scheme has been proposed to solve the advection dominated problems based on the method of characteristics and lagrange interpolation this numerical scheme systematically constructs algebraic polynomial interpolation api containing different order of accuracy furthermore the stability and accuracy of different apis have been investigated the movement of contaminants in groundwater systems can be considered as an advection dominated problem ahmadi et al 2016 therefore the present numerical model can be extensively employed in numerical simulation of groundwater contaminant transport 2 governing equation the main aim of the present paper is to construct a higher order efficient numerical scheme for the advection equation in the conservative form 1 c x t t u x t c x t x 0 where t is time x is space coordinate c x t is concentration and u x t is velocity of water flow respectively this equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation that has a wide variety of applications in science and engineering such as fluid motion heat transfer astrophysics oceanography meteorology semiconductors hydraulics sediment transport and chemical engineering the major trouble in solving this equation is the numerical oscillations in the solution appearing when an improper scheme is applied nassiri and babarutsi 1997 this paper developed an efficient scheme to overcome this problem 3 numerical model 3 1 method of characteristics method of characteristics moc is a one of great technique for solving hyperbolic pdes the method involves the determination of special curves called characteristic curves or characteristics 3 2 from the chain rule of differentiation 2 d c x t d t c x t x d x d t c x t t d t d t c x t t c x t x d x d t 3 d x d t u x t 4 x t a t ξ where 1 a is the slope of a given characteristic line and ξ is the x intercept of the curve fig 1 as c x t is a constant along a the characteristic curve its value can be determined from the initial data the eigenvalue of the hyperbolic pdes is the slope of the characteristics curve formaggia et al 2012 in the advection equation the slope of the characteristics line is the velocity of water flow 5 c x t c ξ 0 f ξ f x a t from eq 5 is derived 6 c x t δ t f x a t δ t f x δ x a t c x δ x t as this method uses lagrangian point of view the trajectory line of the concentration should be determined by this method the concentration at the next time step can be found with the aid of concentration at the previous time step fig 2 to obtain the concentration values at the next time step the interpolation approach can be deployed as a great technique moc is independent of time consequently there is no time discretization error and the accuracy of the numerical scheme greatly depends on the accuracy of the algebraic polynomial interpolations 3 3 lagrange interpolation lagrange interpolation is commonly used for finding apis which take on certain values at arbitrary points by considering given a set n data points x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x i y i x n y n where no two x i are the same lagrange interpolation is obtained by a linear combination 7 l x i 1 n y i l i 8 l i x j 1 j i n x j x x j x i this method is well suited for the interpolation of a given data set since it is applicable even for unequally spaced values of x this method uses n points supporting points to derive an interpolation passing through the n points for estimating a new data point 3 4 derivation of the proposed scheme the procedure of the proposed scheme for solving advection dominated problems is explained for 1d cases nevertheless it has been designed to be a fully multi dimensional algorithm as it is mentioned earlier the present scheme uses moc and lagrange interpolation polynomial in this present scheme the number of both front points right hand points and back points left hand points can be chosen thus the degree of the obtained polynomial can be designated it is crystal clear that the increase of the degree of an interpolation polynomial is accompanied by the rise of the accuracy of the interpolation however the computation time grows too for the same space evenly value of x the lagrange coefficients can be written as a dimensionless formula 9 l i x j 1 j i n j c r j i where c r is courant number which is defined as u δ t δ x an example of this scheme to obtain the interpolation by the use of 2 back points and 2 front points for equal space of value of x is illustrated in this section it should be noted that the number of points can be changed and new interpolation polynomials can be extracted by this method the properties of these four supporting points are described in table 1 lagrange coefficients are obtained as follow 10 l 2 1 c r c r 1 c r 1 2 2 1 2 c r 3 c r 6 11 l 1 2 c r c r 1 c r 2 1 1 1 1 c r 3 c r 2 2 c r 2 12 l 0 2 e p s 1 e p s 1 e p s 2 1 1 c r 3 2 c r 2 c r 2 2 13 l 1 2 c r 1 c r c r 2 1 1 1 0 1 c r 3 3 c r 2 2 c r 6 therefore concentration at the next time step can be obtained as follows 14 c i n 1 c r 3 c r 6 c i 2 n c r 3 c r 2 2 c r 2 c i 1 n c r 3 2 c r 2 c r 2 2 c i n c r 3 3 c r 2 2 c r 6 c i 1 n eq 14 finds concentration by a polynomial that passes four supporting points and has a third order of accuracy this equation is called the quickest method leonard 1979 4 validation a series of test cases have been designed to verify the accuracy of the developed numerical model in order to get an acute understanding of the performances of the proposed schemes in various conditions three statistical indices have been used the very indices are absolute peak error ape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse 15 a p e c m a x e x c m a x n u m c m a x e x 16 m a e 1 n i 1 n c i e x c i n u m 17 r m s e i 1 n c i e x c i n u m 2 n the superscripts ex and num denote the exact and numerical concentration respectively and n is the number of data points ape is related to either numerical dissipation of peak value or overshooting value if it is negative both mae and rmse takes into account the difference of numerical and exact solution for all computational calls so they are suitable criteria to assess the global performance of the scheme 4 1 gaussian initial condition the first test case includes a smooth interface of initial concentration the initial condition is a gaussian wave which is the form of 18 c x t 0 a e x x 0 2 2 σ 2 the initial concentration is a characteristic symmetric bell curve shape a is the height of the curve peak x 0 demonstrates the center of the peak position and σ controls the width of the curve the initial condition values for the first test case are described in table 2 and shown in fig 3 for solving the advection equation lagrange interpolations by equal number of back and front points were implemented in this test case the comparisons between numerical outcome and the exact solution of the first test case are shown in fig 4 in order to have a detailed judgment about the performance of the numerical schemes in different situations the results of the mentioned statistical indices are shown in table 3 it should be noted that all the statistical indices have been calculated after half an hour this table clearly illustrates the great performance of the numerical scheme to predict the concentration with the gaussian initial concentration furthermore it indicates that an increase in the number of supporting points of lagrange interpolation is accompanied by the reduction of the numerical result error and guarantee the positivity preserving property for this test case using ten supporting points for deriving a polynomial can be regarded as a great interpolation to approximate concentration at the next time step 4 2 square initial condition the second test case has a sharp interface of condition a square wave was considered as the initial distribution of concentration for this test case this pulse wave has a fixed amplitude eq 19 19 c x t 0 a x 1 x x 2 where a is the amplitude and x 2 x 1 represents the width of the wave the initial condition values for the second test case are described in table 4 and the initial concentration of which is shown in fig 5 the comparisons between numerical results and the exact solution for the second test case are shown in fig 6 the comparisons between the various interpolations at 1500 s are shown in table 5 this table demonstrates the capability of the proposed scheme to accurately predict the concentration with a sharp interface of initial concentration a higher order polynomial more than 30 supporting points can track the shock wave with only negligible oscillations and satisfy the positivity of the numerical solution 4 3 two dimensional test case in the last test case a two dimensional test case was investigated to assess the numerical behavior for simulating concentrating in a rotating velocity field the numerical model uses the method of fractional steps to solve the 2d advection equation in a couple of stages for every time step in the first stage concentration is advected in x direction and the following stage advects the concentration in y direction the details of such this method can be found in ahmadi et al 2016 the computational domain of the very test case is a 100 100 m 2 square which was filled by 101 101 cells the initial condition and the velocity field for the 2d test case are defined as 20 c x y t 0 exp x x 0 2 y y 0 2 2 σ 2 21 u y y m ω 22 v x x m ω the initial concentration is a gaussian hump and the velocity domain consists of a rotating velocity field where ω is the angular velocity u and v are horizontal and vertical component of the velocity field respectively the parameters values of the 2d test case are described in table 6 at the time 600 s the initial values have carried out one full rotation and returned to their initial position so the exact solution is identical to the initial condition after each full rotation both initial condition and rotating velocity field are shown in fig 7 in this test case an interpolation with ten supporting points 5 back and 5 front points was obtained to predict the initial concentration at various time intervals and the results of which are shown in fig 8 the numerical results indicate that the numerical model produces reasonable outcomes after 1 h six rotations there is only 12 numerical diffusion of peak concentration moreover the peak concentration is located in the cell 49 24 instead of 50 25 which reveals an acceptable phase error of the present scheme 5 stability analysis the problem of stability is pervasive in the numerical solution of partial differential equations lack of stability in the numerical solution makes the numerical outcomes inaccurate in this section the stability of the lagrange interpolations is investigated by the von neumann approach the von neumann stability analysis employs the fourier theorem to investigate the stability of pdes in this approach the solution of each numerically discretized scheme can be written as a fourier series it is in a complex exponential form for any time level as follows 23 c j n a n e i k α j where a k n represents the time dependence of the solution and the exponential represents the spatial dependence in the exponential α j represents the position along the grid and k is the spatial wave number and α is defined 24 α 2 π n where n is the number of nodes per wavelength by this approach the amplification factor and phase error are defined 25 a f a n 1 a n af is amplification factor which a complex number including real number a f r e and imaginary unite a f i m 26 θ arctan a f r e a f i m α c r θ represents phase response of the numerical solution thus relative phase error rpe is given 27 r p e θ 1 100 the numerical solution is stable provided that amplification factor will be less than or equal to 1 the closer the amplification factor is to the one the more accurate and meaningful results numerical solution obtains the stability of lagrange interpolations with various supporting points with a gaussian initial condition has been studied by considering the amplification factor and relative phase error of which to evaluate the impact of interpolation polynomials on the stability of the numerical solution various lagrange interpolations with different numbers of back and front points have been considered in the advection dominated problems concentration moves along its initial condition therefore in such problems upwind scheme can be used as a more appropriate numerical technique to precisely approximate the advection equation for meeting such demand in most of the implemented lagrange interpolations number of back points exceed than the number of front points and the backward scheme was used the information about the implemented langrage interpolations are shown in table 7 the impact of all the above mentioned lagrange interpolations was investigated under different courant numbers for a better look just six of the lagrange interpolations are shown in fig 9 and more details about the lagrange interpolations are presented in tables 8 and 9 tables 8 and 9 describe the change of the amplification factor and relative phase error of different lagrange interpolations under cr 1 25 respectively with extensive details the results indicate that by increasing the number of points per wavelength stability of the numerical solution rises since the amplification factor gets closer to 1 and relative phase error decreases almost zero therefore by increasing the number of nodes in a computational domain the performance of the numerical solution well grows lagrange interpolations with identical numbers of back and front points provide better the amplification factor and relative phase error thus for obtaining an accurate approximation the difference in the number of back points of the drawback scheme should not exceed the number of front points the lagrange interpolations constructed by identical numbers of back and front points frequently produce positive relative phase error which means oscillations happen after the exact solution as a result of faster advection in the numerical scheme on the contrary the lagrange interpolations including more back points regarding front points regularly contain negative relative phase error bringing about oscillation occurs before the exact solution if the relative phase error equals zero the numerical oscillation will exhibit the same pattern after and before the exact solution deploying a higher order of polynomial prepares better results consequently even convection with sharp concentration can be precisely simulated by the lagrange interpolations with adequate supporting points implementing lagrange interpolations with a great number of supporting points bestows an outstanding opportunity of applying the proposed numerical scheme when c r 1 this special feature can remarkably decline the computation cost by increasing the time step size or increase the performances of the numerical model through diminishing the grid size when the courant number equals one the amplification factor and phase error of almost all the lagrange interpolations will be one and zero respectively since in such cases the concentration of each point at the next step directly derives just from the back point at the previous time step order of accuracy of the lagrange interpolations utterly depends on the number of supporting points it is perceived the order of accuracy of a lagrange interpolation is merely one less than the number of used points for the interpolation 6 conclusions in the advection dominated problems ordinary numerical schemes do not give sufficiently accurate results and produce highly oscillatory numerical results which causes instability and deterioration of the numerical solution the present paper proposed an efficient numerical scheme to make an accurate approximation of the advection equation this developed scheme is based on the method of characteristics and lagrange interpolation this numerical model was verified against the exact solution of both 1d and 2d test cases the results revealed that the proposed scheme is highly capable of simulation the advection even for either shock wave or rotating velocity field therefore this scheme can serve as an outstanding numerical technique for a wide range of environmental problems such as underground water flow chemical floods of oil fields and air pollution problems the investigation of the various lagrange interpolation polynomials demonstrated that the increase in the number of nodes in the computation domain causes the numerical solution to show perfect performances also the implementation of higher order polynomials not only provides accurate results but it also can be applied when the courant number exceeds one furthermore using an identical number of supporting points at the right and left hand of the given point of lagrange interpolation yields to increase the stability of the numerical solution through the growth of the amplification factor and reduction of the relative phase error moreover employing a higher polynomial with identical numbers of back and front points can preserve the positivity property for the concentration variable in the proposed numerical method the results of this paper can be used as a great aid to optimize polynomials to solve the advection dominated problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

dominated problems numerical scheme method of characteristics lagrange interpolation stability analysis 1 introduction over the past several decades the human population has sharply increased bringing about a great number of environmental issues one of these problems is pollution which has a great number of forms such as air pollution soil contamination water pollution and thermal pollution during the previous decades not only the amount of contamination has been raising but also the contents of the pollutants have been getting more and more complex investigation of water air and soil pollution requires a detailed simulation of contaminant transport based on mathematical modelling techniques the advection diffusion reaction adr equation is commonly used to model the behavior of contaminant transport mclaughlin et al 2016 this equation consists of three different terms including advection hyperbolic diffusion parabolic and reaction source and sink each of these processes has a unique mechanism as a result each of the terms has its own challenges therefore the method of fractional steps is a suitable technique to solve the adr equation this method makes it possible to employ different separate numerical schemes for various terms providing an accurate numerical approximation is significant due to the fact that this equation normally does not have closed form analytical solutions al lawatia et al 1999 advection dominated problem is a special kind of partial differential equation pde in which other terms may be quite small in contrast to advection thus advection plays a more significant role than other terms linge and langtangen 2017 when the advection term dominates numerical methods will encounter some difficulties especially in the presence of sharp gradients in these such states standard finite element and finite difference methods produce excessive numerical diffusion or oscillation cao et al 2017 in this case using an efficient and accurate numerical model has ever increasing importance utilizing a mathematical numerical technique to approximate an equation inevitably contains errors which can even defile the entire solution zikanov 2019 to increase the accuracy of the approximation of advection dominated problems the advection equation should be solved by an accurate numerical scheme for this reason many researchers developed different methods to solve the advection equation these methods include classical finite difference method appadu 2013 nair 2019 method of characteristic with galerkin method szymkiewicz 1993 high order finite element

classical approaches are incapable of considering some more general environmental conditions observed in heterogeneous environments and capturing shock zhao et al 2018 positivity preserving can be regarded as a great property of the numerical scheme which has been widely investigated in the past several methods to assuring numerical positivity exist in the literature such as positivity property for flux splitting schemes wang and liu 2003 fan et al 2017 positivity preserving and energy stable schemes yang and zha 2017 chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 second order positivity preserving scheme chertock and kurganov 2008 gao and wu 2015 dong et al 2020 in the present paper a new scheme has been proposed to solve the advection dominated problems based on the method of characteristics and lagrange interpolation this numerical scheme systematically constructs algebraic polynomial interpolation api containing different order of accuracy furthermore the stability and accuracy of different apis have been investigated the movement of contaminants in groundwater systems can be considered as an advection dominated problem ahmadi et al 2016 therefore the present numerical model can be extensively employed in numerical simulation of groundwater contaminant transport 2 governing equation the main aim of the present paper is to construct a higher order efficient numerical scheme for the advection equation in the conservative form 1 c x t t u x t c x t x 0 where t is time x is space coordinate c x t is concentration and u x t is velocity of water flow respectively this equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation that has a wide variety of applications in science and engineering such as fluid motion heat transfer astrophysics oceanography meteorology semiconductors hydraulics sediment transport and chemical engineering the major trouble in solving this equation is the numerical oscillations in the solution appearing when an improper scheme is applied nassiri and babarutsi 1997 this paper developed an efficient scheme to overcome this problem 3 numerical model 3 1 method of characteristics method of characteristics moc is a one of great technique for solving hyperbolic pdes the method involves the determination of special curves called characteristic curves or characteristics 3 2 from the chain rule of differentiation 2 d c x t d t c x t x d x d t c x t t d t d t c x t t c x t x d x d t 3 d x d t u x t 4 x t a t ξ where 1 a is the slope of a given characteristic line and ξ is the x intercept of the curve fig 1 as c x t is a constant along a the characteristic curve its value can be determined from the initial data the eigenvalue of the hyperbolic pdes is the slope of the characteristics curve formaggia et al 2012 in the advection equation the slope of the characteristics line is the velocity of water flow 5 c x t c ξ 0 f ξ f x a t from eq 5 is derived 6 c x t δ t f x a t δ t f x δ x a t c x δ x t as this method uses lagrangian point of view the trajectory line of the concentration should be determined by this method the concentration at the next time step can be found with the aid of concentration at the previous time step fig 2 to obtain the concentration values at the next time step the interpolation approach can be deployed as a great technique moc is independent of time consequently there is no time discretization error and the accuracy of the numerical scheme greatly depends on the accuracy of the algebraic polynomial interpolations 3 3 lagrange interpolation lagrange interpolation is commonly used for finding apis which take on certain values at arbitrary points by considering given a set n data points x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x i y i x n y n where no two x i are the same lagrange interpolation is obtained by a linear combination 7 l x i 1 n y i l i 8 l i x j 1 j i n x j x x j x i this method is well suited for the interpolation of a given data set since it is applicable even for unequally spaced values of x this method uses n points supporting points to derive an interpolation passing through the n points for estimating a new data point 3 4 derivation of the proposed scheme the procedure of the proposed scheme for solving advection dominated problems is explained for 1d cases nevertheless it has been designed to be a fully multi dimensional algorithm as it is mentioned earlier the present scheme uses moc and lagrange interpolation polynomial in this present scheme the number of both front points right hand points and back points left hand points can be chosen thus the degree of the obtained polynomial can be designated it is crystal clear that the increase of the degree of an interpolation polynomial is accompanied by the rise of the accuracy of the interpolation however the computation time grows too for the same space evenly value of x the lagrange coefficients can be written as a dimensionless formula 9 l i x j 1 j i n j c r j i where c r is courant number which is defined as u δ t δ x an example of this scheme to obtain the interpolation by the use of 2 back points and 2 front points for equal space of value of x is illustrated in this section it should be noted that the number of points can be changed and new interpolation polynomials can be extracted by this method the properties of these four supporting points are described in table 1 lagrange coefficients are obtained as follow 10 l 2 1 c r c r 1 c r 1 2 2 1 2 c r 3 c r 6 11 l 1 2 c r c r 1 c r 2 1 1 1 1 c r 3 c r 2 2 c r 2 12 l 0 2 e p s 1 e p s 1 e p s 2 1 1 c r 3 2 c r 2 c r 2 2 13 l 1 2 c r 1 c r c r 2 1 1 1 0 1 c r 3 3 c r 2 2 c r 6 therefore concentration at the next time step can be obtained as follows 14 c i n 1 c r 3 c r 6 c i 2 n c r 3 c r 2 2 c r 2 c i 1 n c r 3 2 c r 2 c r 2 2 c i n c r 3 3 c r 2 2 c r 6 c i 1 n eq 14 finds concentration by a polynomial that passes four supporting points and has a third order of accuracy this equation is called the quickest method leonard 1979 4 validation a series of test cases have been designed to verify the accuracy of the developed numerical model in order to get an acute understanding of the performances of the proposed schemes in various conditions three statistical indices have been used the very indices are absolute peak error ape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse 15 a p e c m a x e x c m a x n u m c m a x e x 16 m a e 1 n i 1 n c i e x c i n u m 17 r m s e i 1 n c i e x c i n u m 2 n the superscripts ex and num denote the exact and numerical concentration respectively and n is the number of data points ape is related to either numerical dissipation of peak value or overshooting value if it is negative both mae and rmse takes into account the difference of numerical and exact solution for all computational calls so they are suitable criteria to assess the global performance of the scheme 4 1 gaussian initial condition the first test case includes a smooth interface of initial concentration the initial condition is a gaussian wave which is the form of 18 c x t 0 a e x x 0 2 2 σ 2 the initial concentration is a characteristic symmetric bell curve shape a is the height of the curve peak x 0 demonstrates the center of the peak position and σ controls the width of the curve the initial condition values for the first test case are described in table 2 and shown in fig 3 for solving the advection equation lagrange interpolations by equal number of back and front points were implemented in this test case the comparisons between numerical outcome and the exact solution of the first test case are shown in fig 4 in order to have a detailed judgment about the performance of the numerical schemes in different situations the results of the mentioned statistical indices are shown in table 3 it should be noted that all the statistical indices have been calculated after half an hour this table clearly illustrates the great performance of the numerical scheme to predict the concentration with the gaussian initial concentration furthermore it indicates that an increase in the number of supporting points of lagrange interpolation is accompanied by the reduction of the numerical result error and guarantee the positivity preserving property for this test case using ten supporting points for deriving a polynomial can be regarded as a great interpolation to approximate concentration at the next time step 4 2 square initial condition the second test case has a sharp interface of condition a square wave was considered as the initial distribution of concentration for this test case this pulse wave has a fixed amplitude eq 19 19 c x t 0 a x 1 x x 2 where a is the amplitude and x 2 x 1 represents the width of the wave the initial condition values for the second test case are described in table 4 and the initial concentration of which is shown in fig 5 the comparisons between numerical results and the exact solution for the second test case are shown in fig 6 the comparisons between the various interpolations at 1500 s are shown in table 5 this table demonstrates the capability of the proposed scheme to accurately predict the concentration with a sharp interface of initial concentration a higher order polynomial more than 30 supporting points can track the shock wave with only negligible oscillations and satisfy the positivity of the numerical solution 4 3 two dimensional test case in the last test case a two dimensional test case was investigated to assess the numerical behavior for simulating concentrating in a rotating velocity field the numerical model uses the method of fractional steps to solve the 2d advection equation in a couple of stages for every time step in the first stage concentration is advected in x direction and the following stage advects the concentration in y direction the details of such this method can be found in ahmadi et al 2016 the computational domain of the very test case is a 100 100 m 2 square which was filled by 101 101 cells the initial condition and the velocity field for the 2d test case are defined as 20 c x y t 0 exp x x 0 2 y y 0 2 2 σ 2 21 u y y m ω 22 v x x m ω the initial concentration is a gaussian hump and the velocity domain consists of a rotating velocity field where ω is the angular velocity u and v are horizontal and vertical component of the velocity field respectively the parameters values of the 2d test case are described in table 6 at the time 600 s the initial values have carried out one full rotation and returned to their initial position so the exact solution is identical to the initial condition after each full rotation both initial condition and rotating velocity field are shown in fig 7 in this test case an interpolation with ten supporting points 5 back and 5 front points was obtained to predict the initial concentration at various time intervals and the results of which are shown in fig 8 the numerical results indicate that the numerical model produces reasonable outcomes after 1 h six rotations there is only 12 numerical diffusion of peak concentration moreover the peak concentration is located in the cell 49 24 instead of 50 25 which reveals an acceptable phase error of the present scheme 5 stability analysis the problem of stability is pervasive in the numerical solution of partial differential equations lack of stability in the numerical solution makes the numerical outcomes inaccurate in this section the stability of the lagrange interpolations is investigated by the von neumann approach the von neumann stability analysis employs the fourier theorem to investigate the stability of pdes in this approach the solution of each numerically discretized scheme can be written as a fourier series it is in a complex exponential form for any time level as follows 23 c j n a n e i k α j where a k n represents the time dependence of the solution and the exponential represents the spatial dependence in the exponential α j represents the position along the grid and k is the spatial wave number and α is defined 24 α 2 π n where n is the number of nodes per wavelength by this approach the amplification factor and phase error are defined 25 a f a n 1 a n af is amplification factor which a complex number including real number a f r e and imaginary unite a f i m 26 θ arctan a f r e a f i m α c r θ represents phase response of the numerical solution thus relative phase error rpe is given 27 r p e θ 1 100 the numerical solution is stable provided that amplification factor will be less than or equal to 1 the closer the amplification factor is to the one the more accurate and meaningful results numerical solution obtains the stability of lagrange interpolations with various supporting points with a gaussian initial condition has been studied by considering the amplification factor and relative phase error of which to evaluate the impact of interpolation polynomials on the stability of the numerical solution various lagrange interpolations with different numbers of back and front points have been considered in the advection dominated problems concentration moves along its initial condition therefore in such problems upwind scheme can be used as a more appropriate numerical technique to precisely approximate the advection equation for meeting such demand in most of the implemented lagrange interpolations number of back points exceed than the number of front points and the backward scheme was used the information about the implemented langrage interpolations are shown in table 7 the impact of all the above mentioned lagrange interpolations was investigated under different courant numbers for a better look just six of the lagrange interpolations are shown in fig 9 and more details about the lagrange interpolations are presented in tables 8 and 9 tables 8 and 9 describe the change of the amplification factor and relative phase error of different lagrange interpolations under cr 1 25 respectively with extensive details the results indicate that by increasing the number of points per wavelength stability of the numerical solution rises since the amplification factor gets closer to 1 and relative phase error decreases almost zero therefore by increasing the number of nodes in a computational domain the performance of the numerical solution well grows lagrange interpolations with identical numbers of back and front points provide better the amplification factor and relative phase error thus for obtaining an accurate approximation the difference in the number of back points of the drawback scheme should not exceed the number of front points the lagrange interpolations constructed by identical numbers of back and front points frequently produce positive relative phase error which means oscillations happen after the exact solution as a result of faster advection in the numerical scheme on the contrary the lagrange interpolations including more back points regarding front points regularly contain negative relative phase error bringing about oscillation occurs before the exact solution if the relative phase error equals zero the numerical oscillation will exhibit the same pattern after and before the exact solution deploying a higher order of polynomial prepares better results consequently even convection with sharp concentration can be precisely simulated by the lagrange interpolations with adequate supporting points implementing lagrange interpolations with a great number of supporting points bestows an outstanding opportunity of applying the proposed numerical scheme when c r 1 this special feature can remarkably decline the computation cost by increasing the time step size or increase the performances of the numerical model through diminishing the grid size when the courant number equals one the amplification factor and phase error of almost all the lagrange interpolations will be one and zero respectively since in such cases the concentration of each point at the next step directly derives just from the back point at the previous time step order of accuracy of the lagrange interpolations utterly depends on the number of supporting points it is perceived the order of accuracy of a lagrange interpolation is merely one less than the number of used points for the interpolation 6 conclusions in the advection dominated problems ordinary numerical schemes do not give sufficiently accurate results and produce highly oscillatory numerical results which causes instability and deterioration of the numerical solution the present paper proposed an efficient numerical scheme to make an accurate approximation of the advection equation this developed scheme is based on the method of characteristics and lagrange interpolation this numerical model was verified against the exact solution of both 1d and 2d test cases the results revealed that the proposed scheme is highly capable of simulation the advection even for either shock wave or rotating velocity field therefore this scheme can serve as an outstanding numerical technique for a wide range of environmental problems such as underground water flow chemical floods of oil fields and air pollution problems the investigation of the various lagrange interpolation polynomials demonstrated that the increase in the number of nodes in the computation domain causes the numerical solution to show perfect performances also the implementation of higher order polynomials not only provides accurate results but it also can be applied when the courant number exceeds one furthermore using an identical number of supporting points at the right and left hand of the given point of lagrange interpolation yields to increase the stability of the numerical solution through the growth of the amplification factor and reduction of the relative phase error moreover employing a higher polynomial with identical numbers of back and front points can preserve the positivity property for the concentration variable in the proposed numerical method the results of this paper can be used as a great aid to optimize polynomials to solve the advection dominated problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
