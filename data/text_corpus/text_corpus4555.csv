22775,dock tuning is a crucial stage in the rig service life and in the sailing management such operation is necessary for safety and structural stability reasons the applied pretension has the purpose to increase the stiffness of the whole rig reducing large displacements caused by aerodynamic and inertial loads furthermore since the rig is aimed at supporting sails its deformation significantly affects aerodynamic performances so that dock tuning has also a relevant impact on the propulsion especially in racing however the complexity of the problem and the peculiarities of each different system are the causes of the lack of specific dock tuning procedures in rules and guidelines of classification societies the present work developed in collaboration with the italian shipyard perini navi s p a consists in the validation of a dock tuning numerical procedure adopting a finite element method fem applied to a 67 m long mast a detailed comparison with real scale experimental results has been carried out highlighting the importance of a reliable modelling to accurately predict the non linear behaviour of the structure technical guidelines for dock tuning simulation of large rigs are also provided for the first time in open literature to the best of the authors knowledge keywords dock tuning rig design sail yachts non linear fea experimental data classification societies 1 introduction a sail propulsion system represents a typical fluid structure interaction fsi issue since structural deformations and aerodynamic loads are highly correlated in fact because of the slenderness of sails masts and rigging such structures are rather flexible and are undergoing large displacements such structural deformations induced by aerodynamic and inertial loads the latter mainly caused by ship motions strongly affect the pressure field developed around the sails which on the other hand affect the structural response in an iterative way hence predicting and controlling the stiffness of such structures is of paramount importance for sail and rig designers noticeably sails and rigs design is carried out by different professional figures despite the optimization of a sail propulsion system should go through an integrated design procedure between aerodynamic and structural fields in this sense the dock tuning stage has a prominent importance since the whole rig is pre tensioned in order to increase its stiffness thus being able to withstand relevant loads in fact without any initial pretensioning aerodynamic and inertial loads might induce severe displacements especially at the mast head possibly causing a catastrophic buckling collapse several dock tuning procedures can be followed which are generally based on the experience of riggers or shipyards and can differ depending on rig s typology and dimensions for instance on small boats dock tuning is generally carried out by tightening shrouds and stays by means of turnbuckles whilst for large yachts where dimensions and loads reach high values a mast jack is also used to push up the mast from its step thus further tension is applied to the whole rigging however because the rig structural system is highly non linear even if the same global pretension load is applied on the mast different sequences and procedures in the load application could generate different tensional states and final deformed shapes thus affecting structural and aerodynamic performances as well for instance applying a preload to vertical shrouds before diagonal ones generates a different deformed shape than loading diagonal shrouds first similarly the sequence of pretension load application on shrouds and stays largely affect the obtained rig final stiffness and shape despite the importance of such procedure especially from the safety and structural integrity perspectives no particular specifications are provided in rules and guidelines of classification societies this lack is due to the complexity and specificity of the dock tuning procedure which can differ in a relevant way depending on the ship and rig typology this is very important also when considering the system s limit states because of the slenderness of such structures buckling is the driving limit state excessively increasing pretension loads of the rig can cause compressive actions exceeding or getting close to the critical point load thus buckle the mast and represent a risk for the structural integrity therefore it is understood that dock tuning analysis is crucial for the rig scantling design the purpose of this work is to validate a numerical finite element analysis fea procedure being able to simulate a real dock tuning process to set up a reliable tool for the definition of dock tuning loads that are the basis for further analyses taking into account service loads aerodynamic and inertial the study has been developed considering the 67 m long main mast of a 60 m perini navi ketch yacht fig 1 noticeably to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first work in open literature specifically facing the dock tuning problem and providing a first principles based guideline 2 literature review because of the complexity and peculiarity of the topic in the old days mast design was almost entirely based on empiricism and observation despite the adoption of empirical rules still persists in the field e g skene 1904 is still the basis of the design approach during the years more and more designers started approaching the matter in a more scientific way e g by adopting fea for rig scantling as required by recently issued rules dnvgl 2016 or to analyse specific problems gaiotti and rizzo 2014 however especially regarding dock tuning literature is quite limited and poor as already stated in rizzo and boote 2010 as aforementioned rig s pretension is necessary to stiffen the whole structure however when sailing at large heeling angles the tension of leeward shrouds can be lost possibly leading to dangerous lateral deformations because of the missing spreaders support on the mast therefore one of the classical scantling criteria for the mast is defined by calculating the heeling moment at the maximum safe heeling angle typically chosen equal to 30 which generates the supposed maximum load which the structure is subjected to such approach is based on the analytical method proposed by the nordic boat standard and described in larsson and eliasson 1997 in which formulae for small rig scantling are reported the approach derives from the one century old method presented in skene 1904 and it is limited to small rigs having one or two spreaders pairs only however aerodynamic and inertial loads due to rig s mass should be considered in large yachts since they can be a further source of tension loss an interesting study has been published by van der werff and keuning 1988 where the variations of rigging forces were studied depending on the heeling angle the study also took into account the hull girder flexibility in grabe 2002 a description of the design of the 10 m research boat dyna of the tu berlin university is reported the mast having 2 pairs of spreaders only was 15 4 m long preliminary experimental results were presented and compared with the ones from fe mono dimensional models a description of the tuning is also reported in the adopted fe procedure turnbuckles action was simulated by applying initial strains to shrouds and stays in several steps whilst in reality also a mast jack was used to lift the mast and increasing compression largest difference between experimental and numerical results was measured on the headstay and it was below 25 later on grabe 2004 adopted the same tuning procedure on a 26 m long boat followed by the analyses of several load cases in different sailing conditions however no comparison with experimental data was reported in this case in wallace et al 2006 a rig optimization procedure is reported by adopting fem aerodynamic loads were modelled like concentrated forces acting along the mast length the optimization procedure was aimed at reducing structural weights an evaluation on best pretension loads was also carried out by adopting an objective function with the purpose to minimize the total pretension load in the rig simply applied as a force at the mast step and possibly leading to inaccurate results as shown in the following being able to avoid slack leeward cap shrouds eventually the paper outline the importance of a correct tuning in order to guarantee the structural integrity in pallu de la barri√®re et al 2008 a fem code dedicated to rig structural design was presented the software adopted one dimensional beam and truss elements as regards rig s tuning the possible strategies were applying a displacement at the mast foot along the vertical axis simulating the action of a mast jack or applying a relative displacement between the mast foot and deck collar along the longitudinal symmetry plane simulating thus simulating the action of turnbuckles however no comparisons have been carried out between such simulation strategies in carrera et al 2009 the development of monitoring systems for large sail ships is reported including several data and comparison of results among others mast compression force was directly measured together with shrouds stays and ship motions providing rather comprehensive time histories results were used to validate numerical fe models a study based on the use of an unsteady fluid structure interaction fsi tool aimed at investigating the cause of the dismasting of the vor 70 groupama 4 is reported in menotti et al 2013 tuning values were reported but no information about the procedure was presented results showed like the loss of different structural elements of the rigging caused the mast failure a further fsi study was presented in malpede and nasato 2010 the paper reports the set up a numerical tool adopting a vortex lattice method vlm software to solve the aerodynamic field and a fem one to solve the structural issue dock tuning loads could be simulated by imposing displacement loads at the base of the mast and shrouds and stays thus simulating the presence of a mast jack and or turnbuckles trimarchi and rizzo 2009 presented an own developed shareware fem software to support the sail and cable structural design in view of its application to scantling design and fsi analyses a general scantling procedure for mast and rigging have been presented by rizzo and boote 2010 to support the use of fea in this field the aforementioned researches show that different strategies are available to simulate rig dock tuning but no comparisons have been carried out in order to assess which is the best one to represent in a realistic way the structural behaviour of the rig as regards scantling rules proposed by classification societies no specific indications are given only fairly vague and concise sections are dedicated to rig dock tuning often suggesting the boat designer to follow established practices in fact tuning procedure setting is generally left to the experience of professional rig designer in particular dnvgl 2016 which provides the most detailed standards among rulers for rig scantling states that pretensioning mast shall be set in order to avoid slack leeward cap shrouds with an appropriate reserve when sailing at heeling angles at or below the safe working angle swa which is generally equal to 30 however even if less detailed rather comprehensive guidelines for rig scantling can be found also in lr 2016 but still no specific indications are given as regards the rig tuning it is worth noting that a few class rules were issued in past years only applicable to small crafts hull length under 24 m and not explicitly considered in this work though even these do not support sufficiently the dock tuning issue which may be even modified by the crew during the yacht service life simply by adjusting turnbuckles and lifting the mast step this proves that despite its importance the present topic shows wide non investigated areas as regards the assessment of the rig dock tuning both in terms of structural safety and of aerodynamic performances in the following a dock tuning simulation procedure validated against real data and showing some practical tricks and drawbacks is described which is believed useful for designers and sailmakers as none is openly available for the time being it is also worth to outline that from the structural modelling point of view little importance has been given in previous works to the effect of local reinforcements pulleys and filler therefore authors analysed the impact that such elements can have on the structural response showing that small increment of material stiffness and limited variations of cross sectional geometry can significantly affect the flexural response of the mast section 5 it should be eventually and again stressed that very limited open literature is available on the dock tuning issue despite its paramount importance for both safety and structural efficiency 3 experimental dock tuning the present study regards the 67 m long main mast of a perini navi ketch yacht the aluminium mast ideally subdivided into six panels presents a rake of 2 5 and has five orders of spreaders fig 2 swept back by 23 fig 3 spreaders and rigging have been made by carbon fiber composite laminates it should be noted that v and d indicate vertical and diagonal shrouds respectively the mast has a tapered cross section above panel 3 material characteristics are reported in table 1 in the case of the aluminium mast a density value based on the shipyards knowledge and including the effect of local reinforcements pulleys filler and paint has been used such is considered confidential by the shipyard nevertheless for readers information the adopted figure is not so different from the density of an aluminium alloy generally used for mast building i e al 6082 it should be outlined that the dock tuning has the purpose to maintain tensioned the leeward diagonal shrouds until heeling angles of about 25 30 are reached whilst it is preferable to have caps tensioned even for larger angles in order to avoid excessive torsional end flexural deformations and oscillations a further purpose is to obtain a suitable pre bend of the mast i e a longitudinal deflection which is very important since it affects aerodynamic performances too in fact the sweep back angle of the spreaders generates a forward force component which together with the backstay tension longitudinally bends the mast without such initial deformation working loads generated during sailing might induce an inverse deflection of the mast possibly causing the structural collapse for large sailing yachts a common way to tune the rig is by lifting the mast step by means of a mast jack whilst stays and shrouds are further tensioned with turnbuckles in several subsequent steps after unloading the mast step force by the mast jack the reason of this procedure is due to the fact that excessively long stroke turnbuckles would be necessary to suitably tighten the rigging in order to generate the desired compression at the mast step but they can be operated only when not in tension in the present case caps and innerstay were pre tensioned by means of turnbuckles at first afterwards the mast was lifted up in several steps up to a total lift of about 120 mm thus tensioning the diagonal shrouds from the d5s to d1s using turnbuckles at each unloading step eventually outer stay and backstay were regulated by means of hydraulic actuators in order to reach the desired mast design compression load every time the mast was lifted up thick plates were added under the mast step to maintain the step lifted when removing the jack force then shrouds are tensioned by turning turnbuckles and eventually the pressure of the jack was removed so that the mast was lowered again until the step touched the inserted thick plates at that point the force at the mast step was checked against the design value if the measured value was correct the procedure was repeated for the next tuning step for each load step the increment of vertical displacement of the mast step has been measured with a ruler at the base of the mast from a reference point located on the mast in its lowest part the accuracy of the measurements was assumed 0 5 mm fig 4 shows the mast jack and its step support the adopted mast jack has a cylinder capacity of 1390 kn with a stroke of 150 mm pressure transducer have been employed to measure the applied load to mast and rigging instrumentation manufacturer estimates a possible error around 1 in the pressure measurements in the first dock tuning phase caps have been tensioned by means of turnbuckles followed by the lift of the mast up to 50 mm circa pressure measurements at the mast step and at the inner stay were taken until the design value was achieved however several attempts were necessary proceeding by lowering the mast and increasing the shrouds pretension by means of turnbuckles iteratively and lifting up the mast again up to 50 mm circa three attempts have been necessary at the first step cases i ii and iii in fig 5 afterwards the mast was lift up to 100 mm approximately and in the last step from 50 to 120 mm again following an iterative procedure fig 5 shows the load increment at the mast step in percentage terms with respect to the total design load against the vertical displacements fig 6 reports pressure time histories of the measurements at the mast step and at the inner stay base in the last displacement step 50 120 mm in the second tuning stage diagonal shrouds have been tensioned using turnbuckles starting from the d5s also in this case the mast has been iteratively lowered in order to reduce the tension of the shrouds to be tensioned and then lifted up again fig 7 reports the trend of the compressive load increment at the mast step in percentage terms against the mast vertical displacement it can be noted that the slope of the curves increases for each step this indicates the increment of the global structural stiffness of the rig due to the tensioning of further orders of shrouds fig 8 shows the pressure time histories measured at the mast step and at the inner stay base in this stage when tensioning the diagonal shrouds one by one it can be noted that the pressures increase almost simultaneously since lifting the mast the head moves back towards the aft thus tensioning the inner stay eventually in the last tuning phase the backstay was tensioned checking the achievement of the design value for inner and outer stays as well fig 9 afterwards the mast prebend has been measured taking measurements at each spreader pair and at half of each mast panel fig 10 it should be noted that measurements start from the point of attack of the vang on the mast 4 finite element model 4 1 non linear fea the present section has been introduced in order to highlight a few aspects on the non linear behaviour of rigs in non linear problems the superposition principle is not valid i e the response of a system loaded by two or more actions is not simply given by the sum of the single responses caused by each individual action whatever the order of application in fact the sequence of application of the actions significantly affects the final response of the system since large displacements are involved in rig scantling linear models cannot be used in this case hence the sequence of application of the dock tuning forces becomes of paramount importance to predict the correct structural behaviour especially focusing on the mast pre bend which is one of the most important parameters to check in order to assess the tensional state and the mast working configuration under a certain load case accordingly application sequence of the different external loads is crucial in fea to simulate the rig s behaviour replicating the real experimental procedure as far as possible from a mathematical point of view a linear mechanical system can be described according eq 1 1 f k u where f is the vector of external forces u is the displacements vector and k is the stiffness operator which includes the material and geometrical properties of the analysed body in non linear analysis the stiffness matrix is dependent both on the displacements of the structure as well as on the external forces eq 2 2 f k f u u this means that the stiffness characteristics of the structure depends on the tensional and deformation state of the structure itself equation 2 can be expanded in order to highlight the different sub matrices which compose the stiffness operator as follows eq 3 3 f k l k l d k œÉ u where kl represents the linear stiffness operators while kld is the large displacements stiffness matrix and kœÉ is the load geometry matrix such equation is usually presented in compact form where all the stiffness arrays are included in the well known tangent stiffness matrix k t eq 4 4 f k t u in order to solve such non linear issue different numerical strategies can be adopted however modern fe software generally use mixed incremental iterative schemes in order to decompose the problem in smaller issues e g by applying the external loads in several consecutive steps in order to reach the equilibrium among internal and external actions in each solution step through several iterations updating iteratively the stiffness operator in order to reach the final convergence in the present work a modified newton algorithm has been used to solve the issue adina 2017 at iteration i of a generic solution step t Œ¥t the software solves the following equilibrium equation eq 5 5 r t Œ¥ t f i 1 t Œ¥ t k t œÑ Œ¥ u i where r is the vector of the internal forces f is the vector of the external loads œÑkt is the tangent stiffness matrix computed at a time œÑ t and Œ¥u is the increment of nodal displacements computed as in eq 6 6 Œ¥ u i Œ¥ u i t Œ¥ t Œ¥ u i 1 t Œ¥ t this method widely used in literature proved to be reliable and consistent but several further algorithms could be used to solve nonlinear problems the interested reader can deepen non linear fea theory e g in bathe 1996 in the next section the adopted simulation and modelization strategies will be presented as applied to the analysed case 4 2 numerical model once the experimental dock tuning stage was completed a numerical mono dimensional model was developed with the commercial software adina adina 2017 mast and spreaders were modelled with 6 dofs beam elements based on euler bernoulli theory as regards shrouds and stays non linear truss elements were employed having null stiffness under compressive loads the model accounts for a total number of 325 elements fig 11 shrouds and stays have been modelled with one single element the mast was constrained on the keel while the main deck represents a further degree of constraint such condition has been simulated by fixing all the dofs at the mast step but the rotations around the transversal y axis whilst translations along longitudinal and transversal axis were not allowed as well as rotation around the vertical axis to simulate the deck passage fixity chain plates simulated as simple supports fix truss elements at the deck level material characteristics in table 1 are used the own weight of the structure has been considered in the computation it should be remembered that in numerical simulation common practice dock tuning is generally carried out by applying a vertical force at the mast step thus simulating the action of a jack lifting the mast however such modelization of the process is rather simplified with respect to real experimental procedures as reported in section 3 therefore in order to evaluate the best way to simulate dock tuning process three different simulation strategies including all nonlinearities as well as accounting for the correct sequence of tensioning the cables and step lifting applications have been considered a in the first one the tuning has been carried out by applying initial strains on the rigging at different fictitious time steps however in contrast to approaches generally applied by classification societies a birth algorithm called tbirth in adina 2017 has been used for each cable element in order to introduce it in the computation at each step allowing to apply the tensioning in the correct sequence rather than tensioning all shrouds at the same initial time the procedure has been divided into seven phases as follows fig 12 in the first step in addition to mast and spreaders only caps and inner stay were modelled in the following five steps diagonal shrouds were introduced in the model one after the other starting from d5 ones eventually following the experimental procedure outer stay and backstay were modelled it should be pointed out that in this simulation the mast step has been kept fixed and only shrouds and stays tensioned by initial strain application when elements born b in the second approach the vertical translation fixity has been removed at the mast foot and a vertical force has been applied simulating the action of the jack tbirth algorithm has not been used in this case meaning that all the cables were modelled from the beginning of the simulation furthermore no initial strains have been applied to them this is also a usual approach in similar simulations non correctly considering the actual load and boundary condition application sequence that is significant for a highly nonlinear structural system c in the third case a tuning procedure very similar to the real one has been reproduced by applying a displacement at the mast foot in several steps at the same time introducing shrouds and stays with the mentioned tbirth algorithm in the right time step essentially following the actual experimental procedure 4 3 fea results at first an evaluation on the axial forces and longitudinal deflection have been carried out for each adopted dock tuning procedure fig 12 shows axial force distribution and longitudinal deformation of the rig computed according to the pre tensioning procedure described at point a above axial forces values have not been reported for confidential reasons the birth of new elements can be noted in the several subsequent time steps it is worth to outline that the second load step corresponding to the birth of d5s has a larger extension with respect to the other steps for calculation convergence reasons as regards the second procedure described at point b above the force applied at the lifted mast step caused an inverse aftward deflection of the mast fig 13 therefore in the analysed case such procedure was clearly not satisfactory in order to simulate the dock tuning actually the real tensioning sequence is not correctly simulated since shrouds were tensioned altogether this caused the unacceptable simulation result eventually the results of the procedure described at point c above are reported in fig 14 a structural behaviour similar to the one of approach a has been observed similarly to the experimental procedure fig 15 shows the load increment at the mast step in percentage terms with respect to the total design load against the vertical displacements referring to simulation approach c it should be noted that in order to find a trend similar to the experimental one the birth time of the different shrouds is crucial in the simulation a comparison between numerical and experimental results will be presented in the next section afterwards an evaluation among the tensions on each cable element and for each tuning simulation strategy has been carried out table 2 results are reported in percentage terms computed with respect to the breaking load provided by the cable supplier and working load set on the base of the shipyard s experience despite case b is less significant in practice it has been reported for sake of completeness indeed it highlights that evaluation of mast shape is of paramount importance values have been considered acceptable according to the shipyard experience eventually fig 16 shows a numerical experimental comparison in terms of the mast longitudinal deflection it can be noted that case c is the one better representing the experimental shape though displacement values are still rather different this point will be further discussed in the next section focusing on the importance of the modelling accuracy in particular the importance of modelling filler and internal reinforcements will be assessed 5 experimental vs numerical comparison in the present section a comparison between numerical procedure c and experimental results is reported a first comparison relates the increment of stiffness of the rig during the dock tuning process see figs 7 and 15 results report the percentage error of the load increment at the mast step for each tuning step by increasing the mast vertical displacement fig 17 a general decreasing trend of the error can be observed meaning that increasing the mast step vertical displacement the stiffness of the numerical model increases with a higher rate with respect to the experimental one in absolute terms the highest average error was in the case of the tuning phase after introducing d4 shrouds being equal to 4 9 furthermore total average percentage error is equal to 4 1 such values have been deemed acceptable considering the adopted modelling strategies in a following stage the mast pre bend has been assessed comparing experimental and numerical results see fig 18 the percentage error shows a peak of 46 2 at the lowest measurement point whilst its average value is equal to 23 0 therefore if on one hand a very good agreement has been found about the compressive load at the mast step difference around 5 a rather different deformed shape of the mast has been observed new computations have been carried out increasing the shrouds and stay stiffness but no particular improvements have been found on the mast pre bend therefore it has been thought to improve the modelization implicitly including in the computation the filler effect applied on the mast shell by increasing the young modulus of the mast material 5 gpa more as estimated according to the classical laminate theory reddy 2003 considering the metal filler layers nebbia et al 2015 and updating the geometrical characteristics of the mast cross section area inertias etc accordingly it is worth noting that in such structures filler is generally used to obtain shiny and smoothed surfaces before final painting process therefore a filler thickness on the cross section of 10 mm was considered as this was an average value noted during mast construction eventually an increment of 0 5 mm of the aluminium mast shell plating has been added also accounting for possible differences with respect to the nominal values of aluminium plates used to build up the mast tube results are reported in fig 19 it can be noted that the accuracy of the simulation significantly improved in the lower part of the mast a slight overestimation of the deflection can be observed in opposition to the upper part however percentage error drastically reduced having a maximum value of 18 2 at 50 m height but showing an average of 7 2 such difference could be also due to manufacturing imperfection in the mast tube which have been proved to be relevant in the correct simulation of such structures lorenzetti et al 2017 however such simulation demonstrated the importance of taking into account the filler effect as well as the thickness increase of shell plating in the modelling of such slender structures since small increment of young modulus and cross sectional areas and inertias can significantly modify the flexural response indeed such increment of areas increased also the global weight of the structure and the compression at the mast step consequently values of pretension of shrouds and stays have been slightly modified with a trial and error procedure until the same compression at the mast foot was found therefore the current comparison has been carried out having the same compression at the mast step obtained in the real dock tuning fig 20 shows the limited difference of the tensional state of stays and shrouds in the two cases in percentage terms of total applied load at the end of the adjustment procedure 6 conclusions the present work was aimed at studying a suitable method to simulate with numerical structural analyses the dock tuning procedure of a rig of a large sail yacht in fact rig s tuning strongly influences the structural response in service conditions as well as the aerodynamic performances of the sail plan therefore a correct prediction of the mast pre bend and of the initial tensional state of the rig is crucial to conduct reliable feas or fsi analyses under realistic loading conditions the analysed case regarded the 67 m long main mast of a 60 m perini navi ketch yacht a description of the experimental tuning method carried out by the shipyard has been reported afterwards a mono dimensional fe model has been set up in order to simulate the experimental process three different techniques have been used in the first one the mast step was kept fixed and the tuning has been carried out by introducing in the calculation shrouds and stays at different fictitious time steps corresponding to the moment in which the same were tensioned this was carried out by means of the tbirth algorithm available in the commercial software adina a second strategy consisted in removing the vertical displacement constraint at the mast step and applying a vertical force to lift up and tensioning the rig thus simulating the action of a mast jack in the last case the experimental procedure has been reproduced thus suitably combining the two strategies described previously comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones the best outcomes in terms of mast pre bend and global tensional state have been provided by the third technique which replicates the experimental tuning process overall behaviour however still rather large differences were observed especially as far as the mast longitudinal deflection is concerned average error 23 0 therefore the mast modelling has been improved by introducing the filler covering its external surface thus increasing the young modulus of the mast material by 5 mpa and updating the geometrical characteristics of the mast cross section plate thickness cross sectional area inertias etc as a result the calculated mast deformed shape significantly improved showing an average error with respect to the experimental one of 7 2 approximately a possible reason of this residual discrepancy may lay in small manufacturing imperfections in the mast tube which have been proved to have an important influence on the structural response of such structures the present study showed the importance of properly simulating the real dock tuning procedure in order to correctly predict the deformed shape of the rig and its initial loading conditions in fact since the problem is highly non linear the reproduction of the real procedure is essential to accurately simulate all the effects of the involved non linearities induced by the slenderness of the structural elements so that simplified simulation strategies may lead to incorrect results while the computation burden of each numerical simulation of the dock tuning procedure is relatively limited there is a huge number of different possible sequences for tensioning shrouds and stays leading to completely different results only a few have been presented in this paper selected among those usually carried out by the shipyard on the one hand the established numerical simulation procedure may be useful to avoid physical testing of all of them without a prediction of the outcomes thus saving time and avoiding risk of sail system failures during the dock tuning on the other hand it would be practically impossible to numerically analyse such a huge number of dock tuning sequences and empirical guidance and criteria are still necessary on average each run of dock tuning simulation takes less than a minute on a standard laptop but analysis of results imply further consideration of service loads and limit states in order to provide appropriate engineering judgment and to accurately assess them several runs may be necessary to completely set up a dock tuning procedure to be later carried out onboard furthermore the study showed the importance to introduce in the simulation the effects of the filler applied onto the mast shell surface in fact despite filler s young modulus is an order of magnitude lower with respect to the one of the aluminium its thick layer appreciably contribute in terms of cross sectional inertias and areas considering the high slenderness of the structure as regards future developments the authors believe that further assessments should be carried out on the importance of manufacturing imperfections on the structural response in this sense three dimensional models may be adopted to assess in detail the behaviour of the rig taking into account local effects e g local buckling which might be highly influenced by local imperfections also studying the non linear post buckling collapse response even in the dynamic range furthermore investigations on the influence of the dock tuning on aerodynamic performances could be carried out by means of fsi numerical simulations 
22775,dock tuning is a crucial stage in the rig service life and in the sailing management such operation is necessary for safety and structural stability reasons the applied pretension has the purpose to increase the stiffness of the whole rig reducing large displacements caused by aerodynamic and inertial loads furthermore since the rig is aimed at supporting sails its deformation significantly affects aerodynamic performances so that dock tuning has also a relevant impact on the propulsion especially in racing however the complexity of the problem and the peculiarities of each different system are the causes of the lack of specific dock tuning procedures in rules and guidelines of classification societies the present work developed in collaboration with the italian shipyard perini navi s p a consists in the validation of a dock tuning numerical procedure adopting a finite element method fem applied to a 67 m long mast a detailed comparison with real scale experimental results has been carried out highlighting the importance of a reliable modelling to accurately predict the non linear behaviour of the structure technical guidelines for dock tuning simulation of large rigs are also provided for the first time in open literature to the best of the authors knowledge keywords dock tuning rig design sail yachts non linear fea experimental data classification societies 1 introduction a sail propulsion system represents a typical fluid structure interaction fsi issue since structural deformations and aerodynamic loads are highly correlated in fact because of the slenderness of sails masts and rigging such structures are rather flexible and are undergoing large displacements such structural deformations induced by aerodynamic and inertial loads the latter mainly caused by ship motions strongly affect the pressure field developed around the sails which on the other hand affect the structural response in an iterative way hence predicting and controlling the stiffness of such structures is of paramount importance for sail and rig designers noticeably sails and rigs design is carried out by different professional figures despite the optimization of a sail propulsion system should go through an integrated design procedure between aerodynamic and structural fields in this sense the dock tuning stage has a prominent importance since the whole rig is pre tensioned in order to increase its stiffness thus being able to withstand relevant loads in fact without any initial pretensioning aerodynamic and inertial loads might induce severe displacements especially at the mast head possibly causing a catastrophic buckling collapse several dock tuning procedures can be followed which are generally based on the experience of riggers or shipyards and can differ depending on rig s typology and dimensions for instance on small boats dock tuning is generally carried out by tightening shrouds and stays by means of turnbuckles whilst for large yachts where dimensions and loads reach high values a mast jack is also used to push up the mast from its step thus further tension is applied to the whole rigging however because the rig structural system is highly non linear even if the same global pretension load is applied on the mast different sequences and procedures in the load application could generate different tensional states and final deformed shapes thus affecting structural and aerodynamic performances as well for instance applying a preload to vertical shrouds before diagonal ones generates a different deformed shape than loading diagonal shrouds first similarly the sequence of pretension load application on shrouds and stays largely affect the obtained rig final stiffness and shape despite the importance of such procedure especially from the safety and structural integrity perspectives no particular specifications are provided in rules and guidelines of classification societies this lack is due to the complexity and specificity of the dock tuning procedure which can differ in a relevant way depending on the ship and rig typology this is very important also when considering the system s limit states because of the slenderness of such structures buckling is the driving limit state excessively increasing pretension loads of the rig can cause compressive actions exceeding or getting close to the critical point load thus buckle the mast and represent a risk for the structural integrity therefore it is understood that dock tuning analysis is crucial for the rig scantling design the purpose of this work is to validate a numerical finite element analysis fea procedure being able to simulate a real dock tuning process to set up a reliable tool for the definition of dock tuning loads that are the basis for further analyses taking into account service loads aerodynamic and inertial the study has been developed considering the 67 m long main mast of a 60 m perini navi ketch yacht fig 1 noticeably to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first work in open literature specifically facing the dock tuning problem and providing a first principles based guideline 2 literature

in the field e g skene 1904 is still the basis of the design approach during the years more and more designers started approaching the matter in a more scientific way e g by adopting fea for rig scantling as required by recently issued rules dnvgl 2016 or to analyse specific problems gaiotti and rizzo 2014 however especially regarding dock tuning literature is quite limited and poor as already stated in rizzo and boote 2010 as aforementioned rig s pretension is necessary to stiffen the whole structure however when sailing at large heeling angles the tension of leeward shrouds can be lost possibly leading to dangerous lateral deformations because of the missing spreaders support on the mast therefore one of the classical scantling criteria for the mast is defined by calculating the heeling moment at the maximum safe heeling angle typically chosen equal to 30 which generates the supposed maximum load which the structure is subjected to such approach is based on the analytical method proposed by the nordic boat standard and described in larsson and eliasson 1997 in which formulae for small rig scantling are reported the approach derives from the one century old method presented in skene 1904 and it is limited to small rigs having one or two spreaders pairs only however aerodynamic and inertial loads due to rig s mass should be considered in large yachts since they can be a further source of tension loss an interesting study has been published by van der werff and keuning 1988 where the variations of rigging forces were studied depending on the heeling angle the study also took into account the hull girder flexibility in grabe 2002 a description of the design of the 10 m research boat dyna of the tu berlin university is reported the mast having 2 pairs of spreaders only was 15 4 m long preliminary experimental results were presented and compared with the ones from fe mono dimensional models a description of the tuning is also reported in the adopted fe procedure turnbuckles action was simulated by applying initial strains to shrouds and stays in several steps whilst in reality also a mast jack was used to lift the mast and increasing compression largest difference between experimental and numerical results was measured on the headstay and it was below 25 later on grabe 2004 adopted the same tuning procedure on a 26 m long boat followed by the analyses of several load cases in different sailing conditions however no comparison with experimental data was reported in this case in wallace et al 2006 a rig optimization procedure is reported by adopting fem aerodynamic loads were modelled like concentrated forces acting along the mast length the optimization procedure was aimed at reducing structural weights an evaluation on best pretension loads was also carried out by adopting an objective function with the purpose to minimize the total pretension load in the rig simply applied as a force at the mast step and possibly leading to inaccurate results as shown in the following being able to avoid slack leeward cap shrouds eventually the paper outline the importance of a correct tuning in order to guarantee the structural integrity in pallu de la barri√®re et al 2008 a fem code dedicated to rig structural design was presented the software adopted one dimensional beam and truss elements as regards rig s tuning the possible strategies were applying a displacement at the mast foot along the vertical axis simulating the action of a mast jack or applying a relative displacement between the mast foot and deck collar along the longitudinal symmetry plane simulating thus simulating the action of turnbuckles however no comparisons have been carried out between such simulation strategies in carrera et al 2009 the development of monitoring systems for large sail ships is reported including several data and comparison of results among others mast compression force was directly measured together with shrouds stays and ship motions providing rather comprehensive time histories results were used to validate numerical fe models a study based on the use of an unsteady fluid structure interaction fsi tool aimed at investigating the cause of the dismasting of the vor 70 groupama 4 is reported in menotti et al 2013 tuning values were reported but no information about the procedure was presented results showed like the loss of different structural elements of the rigging caused the mast failure a further fsi study was presented in malpede and nasato 2010 the paper reports the set up a numerical tool adopting a vortex lattice method vlm software to solve the aerodynamic field and a fem one to solve the structural issue dock tuning loads could be simulated by imposing displacement loads at the base of the mast and shrouds and stays thus simulating the presence of a mast jack and or turnbuckles trimarchi and rizzo 2009 presented an own developed shareware fem software to support the sail and cable structural design in view of its application to scantling design and fsi analyses a general scantling procedure for mast and rigging have been presented by rizzo and boote 2010 to support the use of fea in this field the aforementioned researches show that different strategies are available to simulate rig dock tuning but no comparisons have been carried out in order to assess which is the best one to represent in a realistic way the structural behaviour of the rig as regards scantling rules proposed by classification societies no specific indications are given only fairly vague and concise sections are dedicated to rig dock tuning often suggesting the boat designer to follow established practices in fact tuning procedure setting is generally left to the experience of professional rig designer in particular dnvgl 2016 which provides the most detailed standards among rulers for rig scantling states that pretensioning mast shall be set in order to avoid slack leeward cap shrouds with an appropriate reserve when sailing at heeling angles at or below the safe working angle swa which is generally equal to 30 however even if less detailed rather comprehensive guidelines for rig scantling can be found also in lr 2016 but still no specific indications are given as regards the rig tuning it is worth noting that a few class rules were issued in past years only applicable to small crafts hull length under 24 m and not explicitly considered in this work though even these do not support sufficiently the dock tuning issue which may be even modified by the crew during the yacht service life simply by adjusting turnbuckles and lifting the mast step this proves that despite its importance the present topic shows wide non investigated areas as regards the assessment of the rig dock tuning both in terms of structural safety and of aerodynamic performances in the following a dock tuning simulation procedure validated against real data and showing some practical tricks and drawbacks is described which is believed useful for designers and sailmakers as none is openly available for the time being it is also worth to outline that from the structural modelling point of view little importance has been given in previous works to the effect of local reinforcements pulleys and filler therefore authors analysed the impact that such elements can have on the structural response showing that small increment of material stiffness and limited variations of cross sectional geometry can significantly affect the flexural response of the mast section 5 it should be eventually and again stressed that very limited open literature is available on the dock tuning issue despite its paramount importance for both safety and structural efficiency 3 experimental dock tuning the present study regards the 67 m long main mast of a perini navi ketch yacht the aluminium mast ideally subdivided into six panels presents a rake of 2 5 and has five orders of spreaders fig 2 swept back by 23 fig 3 spreaders and rigging have been made by carbon fiber composite laminates it should be noted that v and d indicate vertical and diagonal shrouds respectively the mast has a tapered cross section above panel 3 material characteristics are reported in table 1 in the case of the aluminium mast a density value based on the shipyards knowledge and including the effect of local reinforcements pulleys filler and paint has been used such is considered confidential by the shipyard nevertheless for readers information the adopted figure is not so different from the density of an aluminium alloy generally used for mast building i e al 6082 it should be outlined that the dock tuning has the purpose to maintain tensioned the leeward diagonal shrouds until heeling angles of about 25 30 are reached whilst it is preferable to have caps tensioned even for larger angles in order to avoid excessive torsional end flexural deformations and oscillations a further purpose is to obtain a suitable pre bend of the mast i e a longitudinal deflection which is very important since it affects aerodynamic performances too in fact the sweep back angle of the spreaders generates a forward force component which together with the backstay tension longitudinally bends the mast without such initial deformation working loads generated during sailing might induce an inverse deflection of the mast possibly causing the structural collapse for large sailing yachts a common way to tune the rig is by lifting the mast step by means of a mast jack whilst stays and shrouds are further tensioned with turnbuckles in several subsequent steps after unloading the mast step force by the mast jack the reason of this procedure is due to the fact that excessively long stroke turnbuckles would be necessary to suitably tighten the rigging in order to generate the desired compression at the mast step but they can be operated only when not in tension in the present case caps and innerstay were pre tensioned by means of turnbuckles at first afterwards the mast was lifted up in several steps up to a total lift of about 120 mm thus tensioning the diagonal shrouds from the d5s to d1s using turnbuckles at each unloading step eventually outer stay and backstay were regulated by means of hydraulic actuators in order to reach the desired mast design compression load every time the mast was lifted up thick plates were added under the mast step to maintain the step lifted when removing the jack force then shrouds are tensioned by turning turnbuckles and eventually the pressure of the jack was removed so that the mast was lowered again until the step touched the inserted thick plates at that point the force at the mast step was checked against the design value if the measured value was correct the procedure was repeated for the next tuning step for each load step the increment of vertical displacement of the mast step has been measured with a ruler at the base of the mast from a reference point located on the mast in its lowest part the accuracy of the measurements was assumed 0 5 mm fig 4 shows the mast jack and its step support the adopted mast jack has a cylinder capacity of 1390 kn with a stroke of 150 mm pressure transducer have been employed to measure the applied load to mast and rigging instrumentation manufacturer estimates a possible error around 1 in the pressure measurements in the first dock tuning phase caps have been tensioned by means of turnbuckles followed by the lift of the mast up to 50 mm circa pressure measurements at the mast step and at the inner stay were taken until the design value was achieved however several attempts were necessary proceeding by lowering the mast and increasing the shrouds pretension by means of turnbuckles iteratively and lifting up the mast again up to 50 mm circa three attempts have been necessary at the first step cases i ii and iii in fig 5 afterwards the mast was lift up to 100 mm approximately and in the last step from 50 to 120 mm again following an iterative procedure fig 5 shows the load increment at the mast step in percentage terms with respect to the total design load against the vertical displacements fig 6 reports pressure time histories of the measurements at the mast step and at the inner stay base in the last displacement step 50 120 mm in the second tuning stage diagonal shrouds have been tensioned using turnbuckles starting from the d5s also in this case the mast has been iteratively lowered in order to reduce the tension of the shrouds to be tensioned and then lifted up again fig 7 reports the trend of the compressive load increment at the mast step in percentage terms against the mast vertical displacement it can be noted that the slope of the curves increases for each step this indicates the increment of the global structural stiffness of the rig due to the tensioning of further orders of shrouds fig 8 shows the pressure time histories measured at the mast step and at the inner stay base in this stage when tensioning the diagonal shrouds one by one it can be noted that the pressures increase almost simultaneously since lifting the mast the head moves back towards the aft thus tensioning the inner stay eventually in the last tuning phase the backstay was tensioned checking the achievement of the design value for inner and outer stays as well fig 9 afterwards the mast prebend has been measured taking measurements at each spreader pair and at half of each mast panel fig 10 it should be noted that measurements start from the point of attack of the vang on the mast 4 finite element model 4 1 non linear fea the present section has been introduced in order to highlight a few aspects on the non linear behaviour of rigs in non linear problems the superposition principle is not valid i e the response of a system loaded by two or more actions is not simply given by the sum of the single responses caused by each individual action whatever the order of application in fact the sequence of application of the actions significantly affects the final response of the system since large displacements are involved in rig scantling linear models cannot be used in this case hence the sequence of application of the dock tuning forces becomes of paramount importance to predict the correct structural behaviour especially focusing on the mast pre bend which is one of the most important parameters to check in order to assess the tensional state and the mast working configuration under a certain load case accordingly application sequence of the different external loads is crucial in fea to simulate the rig s behaviour replicating the real experimental procedure as far as possible from a mathematical point of view a linear mechanical system can be described according eq 1 1 f k u where f is the vector of external forces u is the displacements vector and k is the stiffness operator which includes the material and geometrical properties of the analysed body in non linear analysis the stiffness matrix is dependent both on the displacements of the structure as well as on the external forces eq 2 2 f k f u u this means that the stiffness characteristics of the structure depends on the tensional and deformation state of the structure itself equation 2 can be expanded in order to highlight the different sub matrices which compose the stiffness operator as follows eq 3 3 f k l k l d k œÉ u where kl represents the linear stiffness operators while kld is the large displacements stiffness matrix and kœÉ is the load geometry matrix such equation is usually presented in compact form where all the stiffness arrays are included in the well known tangent stiffness matrix k t eq 4 4 f k t u in order to solve such non linear issue different numerical strategies can be adopted however modern fe software generally use mixed incremental iterative schemes in order to decompose the problem in smaller issues e g by applying the external loads in several consecutive steps in order to reach the equilibrium among internal and external actions in each solution step through several iterations updating iteratively the stiffness operator in order to reach the final convergence in the present work a modified newton algorithm has been used to solve the issue adina 2017 at iteration i of a generic solution step t Œ¥t the software solves the following equilibrium equation eq 5 5 r t Œ¥ t f i 1 t Œ¥ t k t œÑ Œ¥ u i where r is the vector of the internal forces f is the vector of the external loads œÑkt is the tangent stiffness matrix computed at a time œÑ t and Œ¥u is the increment of nodal displacements computed as in eq 6 6 Œ¥ u i Œ¥ u i t Œ¥ t Œ¥ u i 1 t Œ¥ t this method widely used in literature proved to be reliable and consistent but several further algorithms could be used to solve nonlinear problems the interested reader can deepen non linear fea theory e g in bathe 1996 in the next section the adopted simulation and modelization strategies will be presented as applied to the analysed case 4 2 numerical model once the experimental dock tuning stage was completed a numerical mono dimensional model was developed with the commercial software adina adina 2017 mast and spreaders were modelled with 6 dofs beam elements based on euler bernoulli theory as regards shrouds and stays non linear truss elements were employed having null stiffness under compressive loads the model accounts for a total number of 325 elements fig 11 shrouds and stays have been modelled with one single element the mast was constrained on the keel while the main deck represents a further degree of constraint such condition has been simulated by fixing all the dofs at the mast step but the rotations around the transversal y axis whilst translations along longitudinal and transversal axis were not allowed as well as rotation around the vertical axis to simulate the deck passage fixity chain plates simulated as simple supports fix truss elements at the deck level material characteristics in table 1 are used the own weight of the structure has been considered in the computation it should be remembered that in numerical simulation common practice dock tuning is generally carried out by applying a vertical force at the mast step thus simulating the action of a jack lifting the mast however such modelization of the process is rather simplified with respect to real experimental procedures as reported in section 3 therefore in order to evaluate the best way to simulate dock tuning process three different simulation strategies including all nonlinearities as well as accounting for the correct sequence of tensioning the cables and step lifting applications have been considered a in the first one the tuning has been carried out by applying initial strains on the rigging at different fictitious time steps however in contrast to approaches generally applied by classification societies a birth algorithm called tbirth in adina 2017 has been used for each cable element in order to introduce it in the computation at each step allowing to apply the tensioning in the correct sequence rather than tensioning all shrouds at the same initial time the procedure has been divided into seven phases as follows fig 12 in the first step in addition to mast and spreaders only caps and inner stay were modelled in the following five steps diagonal shrouds were introduced in the model one after the other starting from d5 ones eventually following the experimental procedure outer stay and backstay were modelled it should be pointed out that in this simulation the mast step has been kept fixed and only shrouds and stays tensioned by initial strain application when elements born b in the second approach the vertical translation fixity has been removed at the mast foot and a vertical force has been applied simulating the action of the jack tbirth algorithm has not been used in this case meaning that all the cables were modelled from the beginning of the simulation furthermore no initial strains have been applied to them this is also a usual approach in similar simulations non correctly considering the actual load and boundary condition application sequence that is significant for a highly nonlinear structural system c in the third case a tuning procedure very similar to the real one has been reproduced by applying a displacement at the mast foot in several steps at the same time introducing shrouds and stays with the mentioned tbirth algorithm in the right time step essentially following the actual experimental procedure 4 3 fea results at first an evaluation on the axial forces and longitudinal deflection have been carried out for each adopted dock tuning procedure fig 12 shows axial force distribution and longitudinal deformation of the rig computed according to the pre tensioning procedure described at point a above axial forces values have not been reported for confidential reasons the birth of new elements can be noted in the several subsequent time steps it is worth to outline that the second load step corresponding to the birth of d5s has a larger extension with respect to the other steps for calculation convergence reasons as regards the second procedure described at point b above the force applied at the lifted mast step caused an inverse aftward deflection of the mast fig 13 therefore in the analysed case such procedure was clearly not satisfactory in order to simulate the dock tuning actually the real tensioning sequence is not correctly simulated since shrouds were tensioned altogether this caused the unacceptable simulation result eventually the results of the procedure described at point c above are reported in fig 14 a structural behaviour similar to the one of approach a has been observed similarly to the experimental procedure fig 15 shows the load increment at the mast step in percentage terms with respect to the total design load against the vertical displacements referring to simulation approach c it should be noted that in order to find a trend similar to the experimental one the birth time of the different shrouds is crucial in the simulation a comparison between numerical and experimental results will be presented in the next section afterwards an evaluation among the tensions on each cable element and for each tuning simulation strategy has been carried out table 2 results are reported in percentage terms computed with respect to the breaking load provided by the cable supplier and working load set on the base of the shipyard s experience despite case b is less significant in practice it has been reported for sake of completeness indeed it highlights that evaluation of mast shape is of paramount importance values have been considered acceptable according to the shipyard experience eventually fig 16 shows a numerical experimental comparison in terms of the mast longitudinal deflection it can be noted that case c is the one better representing the experimental shape though displacement values are still rather different this point will be further discussed in the next section focusing on the importance of the modelling accuracy in particular the importance of modelling filler and internal reinforcements will be assessed 5 experimental vs numerical comparison in the present section a comparison between numerical procedure c and experimental results is reported a first comparison relates the increment of stiffness of the rig during the dock tuning process see figs 7 and 15 results report the percentage error of the load increment at the mast step for each tuning step by increasing the mast vertical displacement fig 17 a general decreasing trend of the error can be observed meaning that increasing the mast step vertical displacement the stiffness of the numerical model increases with a higher rate with respect to the experimental one in absolute terms the highest average error was in the case of the tuning phase after introducing d4 shrouds being equal to 4 9 furthermore total average percentage error is equal to 4 1 such values have been deemed acceptable considering the adopted modelling strategies in a following stage the mast pre bend has been assessed comparing experimental and numerical results see fig 18 the percentage error shows a peak of 46 2 at the lowest measurement point whilst its average value is equal to 23 0 therefore if on one hand a very good agreement has been found about the compressive load at the mast step difference around 5 a rather different deformed shape of the mast has been observed new computations have been carried out increasing the shrouds and stay stiffness but no particular improvements have been found on the mast pre bend therefore it has been thought to improve the modelization implicitly including in the computation the filler effect applied on the mast shell by increasing the young modulus of the mast material 5 gpa more as estimated according to the classical laminate theory reddy 2003 considering the metal filler layers nebbia et al 2015 and updating the geometrical characteristics of the mast cross section area inertias etc accordingly it is worth noting that in such structures filler is generally used to obtain shiny and smoothed surfaces before final painting process therefore a filler thickness on the cross section of 10 mm was considered as this was an average value noted during mast construction eventually an increment of 0 5 mm of the aluminium mast shell plating has been added also accounting for possible differences with respect to the nominal values of aluminium plates used to build up the mast tube results are reported in fig 19 it can be noted that the accuracy of the simulation significantly improved in the lower part of the mast a slight overestimation of the deflection can be observed in opposition to the upper part however percentage error drastically reduced having a maximum value of 18 2 at 50 m height but showing an average of 7 2 such difference could be also due to manufacturing imperfection in the mast tube which have been proved to be relevant in the correct simulation of such structures lorenzetti et al 2017 however such simulation demonstrated the importance of taking into account the filler effect as well as the thickness increase of shell plating in the modelling of such slender structures since small increment of young modulus and cross sectional areas and inertias can significantly modify the flexural response indeed such increment of areas increased also the global weight of the structure and the compression at the mast step consequently values of pretension of shrouds and stays have been slightly modified with a trial and error procedure until the same compression at the mast foot was found therefore the current comparison has been carried out having the same compression at the mast step obtained in the real dock tuning fig 20 shows the limited difference of the tensional state of stays and shrouds in the two cases in percentage terms of total applied load at the end of the adjustment procedure 6 conclusions the present work was aimed at studying a suitable method to simulate with numerical structural analyses the dock tuning procedure of a rig of a large sail yacht in fact rig s tuning strongly influences the structural response in service conditions as well as the aerodynamic performances of the sail plan therefore a correct prediction of the mast pre bend and of the initial tensional state of the rig is crucial to conduct reliable feas or fsi analyses under realistic loading conditions the analysed case regarded the 67 m long main mast of a 60 m perini navi ketch yacht a description of the experimental tuning method carried out by the shipyard has been reported afterwards a mono dimensional fe model has been set up in order to simulate the experimental process three different techniques have been used in the first one the mast step was kept fixed and the tuning has been carried out by introducing in the calculation shrouds and stays at different fictitious time steps corresponding to the moment in which the same were tensioned this was carried out by means of the tbirth algorithm available in the commercial software adina a second strategy consisted in removing the vertical displacement constraint at the mast step and applying a vertical force to lift up and tensioning the rig thus simulating the action of a mast jack in the last case the experimental procedure has been reproduced thus suitably combining the two strategies described previously comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones the best outcomes in terms of mast pre bend and global tensional state have been provided by the third technique which replicates the experimental tuning process overall behaviour however still rather large differences were observed especially as far as the mast longitudinal deflection is concerned average error 23 0 therefore the mast modelling has been improved by introducing the filler covering its external surface thus increasing the young modulus of the mast material by 5 mpa and updating the geometrical characteristics of the mast cross section plate thickness cross sectional area inertias etc as a result the calculated mast deformed shape significantly improved showing an average error with respect to the experimental one of 7 2 approximately a possible reason of this residual discrepancy may lay in small manufacturing imperfections in the mast tube which have been proved to have an important influence on the structural response of such structures the present study showed the importance of properly simulating the real dock tuning procedure in order to correctly predict the deformed shape of the rig and its initial loading conditions in fact since the problem is highly non linear the reproduction of the real procedure is essential to accurately simulate all the effects of the involved non linearities induced by the slenderness of the structural elements so that simplified simulation strategies may lead to incorrect results while the computation burden of each numerical simulation of the dock tuning procedure is relatively limited there is a huge number of different possible sequences for tensioning shrouds and stays leading to completely different results only a few have been presented in this paper selected among those usually carried out by the shipyard on the one hand the established numerical simulation procedure may be useful to avoid physical testing of all of them without a prediction of the outcomes thus saving time and avoiding risk of sail system failures during the dock tuning on the other hand it would be practically impossible to numerically analyse such a huge number of dock tuning sequences and empirical guidance and criteria are still necessary on average each run of dock tuning simulation takes less than a minute on a standard laptop but analysis of results imply further consideration of service loads and limit states in order to provide appropriate engineering judgment and to accurately assess them several runs may be necessary to completely set up a dock tuning procedure to be later carried out onboard furthermore the study showed the importance to introduce in the simulation the effects of the filler applied onto the mast shell surface in fact despite filler s young modulus is an order of magnitude lower with respect to the one of the aluminium its thick layer appreciably contribute in terms of cross sectional inertias and areas considering the high slenderness of the structure as regards future developments the authors believe that further assessments should be carried out on the importance of manufacturing imperfections on the structural response in this sense three dimensional models may be adopted to assess in detail the behaviour of the rig taking into account local effects e g local buckling which might be highly influenced by local imperfections also studying the non linear post buckling collapse response even in the dynamic range furthermore investigations on the influence of the dock tuning on aerodynamic performances could be carried out by means of fsi numerical simulations 
22776,a study of the energy losses of tsunami like waves due to the formation of large eddies near the underwater barriers has been gaining importance in recent years however the conditions of the birth of the large scale vortex behind the barriers are not yet fully understood the paper presents the results of theoretical experimental and numerical studies of the interaction between the long gravitational tsunami like waves and the impermeable underwater barrier the proposed mathematical model is based on the approximation of two dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations the openfoam toolbox is used to perform the numerical simulation with the method of finite volumes the air water interface is identified by the volume of fluid method vof the numerical simulation is tested via a comparison with test activities and experiments carried out in a hydrodynamic wave flume at the institute of applied mechanics russian academy of sciences the efficiency of the underwater barrier is assessed as the percentage of the energy loss to the incident wave energy it is shown that the barrier effectiveness depends on its relative height and the incident wave parameters new experimental and numerical results are consistent with the theoretical model proposed earlier and research results of other authors keywords tsunami wave wave flume impermeable underwater barrier navier stokes equations experimental investigations numerical simulation 1 introduction tsunamis are one of the most unforeseen and devastating natural calamities in most of the coastal sea and ocean areas the extended and expensive obstacles and barriers are constructed to protect the coastal areas from natural hazards a construction of such barriers is based on the condition of the total reflection of the most probable wave height however the barrier submerges when the wave height exceeds the half height of the barrier above sea level in this case the barrier effectiveness sharply drops since any artificial barrier is rather thin relative to a tsunami wavelength that can reach tens and hundreds of kilometers levin and nosov 2005 li et al 2015 therefore research into the improvement of the submerged barrier effectiveness is relevant and substantiated since a progress in accurate analytical solutions concerning the interaction between gravity tsunami waves and thin submerged barrier has been achieved only for model equations of vortex free flows in ideal incompressible liquid li et al 2015 detailed physical experiments and numerical simulation in this field are of great importance thus irtem et al 2011 studied the impact of various factors on the effectiveness of a submerged barrier the plane section of that barrier was trapezoidal and normal to the wave front it was demonstrated that owing to the internal friction losses a permeable submerged barrier reduced the height of waves running up onto the beach with a slope of one vertical to five horizontal this reduction varied between 8 and 15 as compared to the impermeable barrier a 15 reduction was observed when the barrier height equaled the depth of water in the wave flume according to irtem et al 2011 the effectiveness of the submerged barrier sharply decreased when the wavelength l was much greater than the barrier thickness b however in their experiments researchers did not indicate the ratio between the water depth h and the wavelength l in later research irtem et al 2012 described the parameters of the incident wave so it can be concluded that h l 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 b l 0 3 note that h l 0 001 and b l 0 001 madsen et al 2008 for natural tsunami waves where tsunami barriers are usually installed saprykina et al 2015 investigated the nonlinear effects observed during the interaction between the gravity waves and the rectangular underwater barriers with a 0 5h height and 0 2l b 0 6l thickness the transmission coefficient was measured i e k t h t h where h is the average height of the incident wave h t is the average height of the transmitted wave behind the barrier in this work we are interested in the experimental results obtained only for thin impermeable barriers according to the experiments the wave transmission coefficient is k t 0 94 data spread from 0 87 to 1 02 at the barrier height and thickness h h 0 2 and 0 22l b 0 25l respectively thus the barrier effectiveness 1 k t 2 100 is about 10 the investigations also include very short waves where h l 0 6 wu et al 2012 presented numerical and experimental studies of the solitary wave propagation over a rectangular impermeable barrier 0 1 m high and 0 02 m thick installed in the wave flume the water depth h in the wave flume was 0 14 m while the amplitude h of the incident wave varied such that 0 1 h h 0 5 experiments showed that a complex vortex field formed behind the barrier interacting with the free surface thereby generating in some cases a standing wave behind the barrier with it subsequently breaking the coefficients of the wave reflection k r w r w transmission k t w t w and vortex loss k v 1 k r 2 k t 2 were calculated using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k Œµ turbulence model w w r and w t are the incident reflected and transmitted wave energy respectively it was found that the maximum energy dissipation was achieved at h h 0 15 the effectiveness of the barrier was 1 k t 2 100 32 note that according to wu et al 2012 the wavelength was merely six times larger than the depth of water h l 0 15 madsen et al 2008 and qu et al 2017a b criticized the popular practice of modeling tsunami waves using a solitary wave since its wavelength decreases with the increasing height so when h h 0 2 the relative wavelength h l 0 15 the authors reported that in a number of cases such a modeling resulted in a wrong estimation of the non linear and viscous effects due to the insufficient wavelength of solitary waves this conclusion was confirmed by qu et al 2017b who conducted a comparative analysis of forces acting on the underwater cylinder with a diameter d l during its interaction with solitary h l 0 2 and tsunami like waves h l 0 03 their calculations at h h 0 2 showed that when the cylinder was placed at a depth exceeding its diameter the force of its interaction with the solitary wave was two times less than with the tsunami like wave thus in the formation of the large scale vortex structures near the underwater objects the wavelength parameter h l plays an important role there is however no information in the literature about the studies of the underwater barriers effectiveness in their interaction with a wave whose length is l 10h the hallmark of our research is that the wave flume designed at the institute of applied mechanics of the russian academy of sciences iam ras boshenyatov and zhiltsov 2016 zhiltsov et al 2017 and the high precision method of measuring the water level provide quite a complete simulation of tsunami waves boshenyatov et al 2011 boshenyatov et al 2013 in particular the wave generator creates a long gravity wave when the h l parameter is 0 03 is amplitude being set to high accuracy at the same time the dimensionless simulation parameters with the exception to the reynolds number are close to real ones for tsunami waves in previous studies boshenyatov 2013 first found that at 0 04 h h 0 1 the optimum barrier height was d 0 85h in this case the maximum vortex energy w v accumulated in large scale vortex structures behind a thin impermeable barrier however a rather significant spread in values was observed for the relative reflected energy w r w and the vortex energy loss w v w during the wave barrier interaction in some cases this led to a 30 reduction in the barrier effectiveness these experimental facts indicated that in addition to the optimum barrier height more detailed research is necessary to identify other conditions and parameters affecting the effectiveness of underwater barriers the main objective of this study is to clarify the optimal conditions at which the maximum total effect of suppressing tsunami like waves can be achieved another purpose is to further verify the proposed theoretical model for the efficiency assessment of the vortex induced wave suppression by underwater barriers boshenyatov 2017 we utilize the integrated approach combining the theoretical analysis with physical and numerical experiments in experiments the height of the incident wave varies while the wavelength the water depth in the hydrodynamic wave flume and the height of barrier are constant 2 research methods 2 1 basic equations let us consider the unsteady two dimensional flow of incompressible viscous liquid with the free surface in the

Œæ x t where Œæ x t is the free surface displacement in the traditional formulation the kinematic condition is observed 4 d t u i d x u j the dynamic conditions of the free boundary determine the equality between the normal stress and the external pressure as well as the absence of tangential stresses p n n p a t m p n s 0 the initial condition at t 0 is determined by the distribution function d x 0 corresponding to the initial difference of the water level in the channel at 0 x 1 5 m the distribution function d x 0 h 2h at 1 5 m x 15 m d x 0 h the flow is considered to be laminar this approach is conditioned by rather a high reynolds number for the transition to the turbulent condition obtained in experiments with the rectangular wave flume kutateladze et al 1975 thus the critical reynolds number is re œÅ u m h Œº where u m is the depth averaged velocity u x of the liquid the re value increases with the decreasing distance x from the flume input thus at x h 60 the transition into the turbulent condition starts at re1 8 103 and ends at re2 1 8 104 as is known when the initial flow perturbation decreases the transition reynolds number increases in our case at the wavelength of l 3 m and h 0 1 m the values of x h 30 and the initial flow perturbation in front of the wave are close to zero 2 2 numerical approach a finite volume method is used to solve equations 1 and 2 with the initial and boundary conditions interfoam solver of open source software openfoam greenshields 2018 is used for the numerical approach in order to ensure stability of the solution procedure the calculations are performed with a self adapting time step which is adjusted on the courant number not over 0 6 the vof method is used to calculate the displacement of the liquid free surface proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the vof transportation equation can be written as 5 Œ≥ t u i Œ≥ x i 0 where Œ≥ is the volume fraction of water in the computational cell which varies linearly from 0 to 1 in accordance with the following conditions 6 Œ≥ Œ≥ 0 a i r 0 Œ≥ 1 i n t e r f a c e Œ≥ 1 w a t e r the density and viscosity weighted averages in the computational cell depend on Œ≥ parameter and can be obtained from 7 œÅ Œ≥ œÅ 1 1 Œ≥ œÅ 2 Œº Œ≥ Œº 1 1 Œ≥ Œº 2 where 1 and 2 are the water and air indices respectively discretization of the spatial terms is carried out by the second order accuracy schemes using the gauss method the time discretization is performed by the euler method of the first order of accuracy in transient calculations the piso procedure is used for the pressure velocity coupling according to the vof method the distribution algorithm of the volume fraction Œ≥ is specified in the computational domain once the calculation starts the gravitation force initiates the wave motion at t 0 the velocity distribution throughout the computational domain is assumed to be zero a schematic drawing of the numerical wave generation and the water barrier interaction is presented in fig 1 the barrier is installed in the center of the wave flume the length of the computational domain is selected to be rather long to exclude the influence of waves reflecting from end walls of the flume the overall size of the computational domain corresponds to that of the experimental wave flume the physical time of the wave propagation over the flume is 20 s 2 3 mesh description let us describe the influence of the rectangular mesh size on the calculation results the mesh size is not changed during the calculations three mesh types with different size are used in this experiment the fine mesh contains 900 000 cells with the size of 0 002 m on x axis and 0 001 m on y axis the size of the medium mesh with 450 000 cells is 0 002 m on x and y axes and the coarse mesh comprises 112 000 cells with a 0 004 m size on x and y axes the numerical calculations are carried out in the computational domain 15 m long and 0 120 m high the height of the incident wave is h 3 5 mm the initial water level in the channel is h 0 103 mm fig 2 plots the time dependence of the water level d t it should be noted that the real wave generator has a solid front wall which distinguishes it from the theoretical ideal generator in spite of this fact in the case of using a fine mesh the numerically obtained value of the average wave h 1 t t 1 t 2 Œæ t d t differs from the experimentally measured by only 2 65 in our calculations we use the fine mesh because it provides the highest accuracy and speed 2 4 experimental setup and measuring techniques the experiments are carried out in the hydrodynamic wave flume at the iam ras the flume parameters are 15 m length 0 26 m width and 0 35 m height two dimensional wave processes are simulated in the x y plane such that a horizontal x axis is directed along the wave flume and the wave propagation and the vertical y axis is directed along the wave height the generation of the long gravity wave at l h is based on the theory of breakdown breakup of an arbitrary discontinuity of the water level in the wave flume at zero time this method is implemented in the caisson type wave generator without moving elements boshenyatov and lisin 2013 this generator creates a wave of the given height similar to an undular bore without breaking its length equals about a double length of the wave generator the black circles in fig 2 indicate the typical time dependence d x t h Œæ x t resulting from measuring at a 3 0 m distance to the wave generator and the initial depth of h 0 103 m the nonlinearity is then h h 0 034 and the wave velocity is 1 m s the latter matches the velocity estimated in accordance with the shallow water linear theory as can be seen from fig 2 the average amplitude of the incident wave h 3 5 mm equals Œ¥h 2 and the wavelength is 3 m at time t 3 s that matches l 3 m 2–∞ here –∞ is the length of the wave generator this value also corresponds to calculation results obtained by the shallow water linear theory the numerical simulation is also verified by a more complicated strongly non linear problem of the wave transformation and breaking during its propagation over flat shoal the experimental results are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations boshenyatov and lisin 2013 in our experiments the barrier is installed at a 9 04 m distance from the flume start its height d is 95 mm and thickness b is 10 mm fig 1 the water depth in the wave flume and the generating wavelength are constant and equal respectively h 0 103 m and l 3 m the height of the incident wave ranges from 0 5 to 16 5 mm i e within the range wider than described in boshenyatov 2013 three water level sensors are placed in the wave flume at distances of 4 5 6 and 12 m to the flume start the fourth sensor is placed in the wave generator to measure the initial water level difference in it and the main section of the wave flume the suggested x t diagrams of the free surface displacement allow us to accurately identify the incident reflected and transmitted energies of tsunami like waves moving over the barrier and measure their velocity for each experiment coefficients of the wave reflection k r transmission k t and vortex loss k v are determined via the total energy 8 k r w r w k t w t w k v 1 w r w w t w the total energy of the gravity wave is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies i e w w p w k 9 w

and discussion 3 1 experimental results and numerical calculations we focus on the determination of optimum conditions for the wave propagation over the impermeable underwater barrier when the total energy of the wave suppression is the highest this energy for a thin impermeable barrier is a sum of the reflected energy and the vortex energy accumulated behind the barrier at first we study the physical effects produced by the interaction of weak gravity waves with the barrier h h 0 1 high since the time of the wave barrier interaction is rather long h l 0 03 the large scale vortex structures behind the barrier can fully stabilize fig 3 presents the dependence between the relative vortex energy w v w accumulated behind the thin impermeable barrier and the relative barrier height d h h this dependence is obtained from experimental data and numerical calculations boshenyatov 2013 according to fig 3 the vortex energy w v w gradually increases with the increasing barrier height within the range of 0 d h h 0 87 when the vortex energy achieves its maximum of about 50 of the incident energy it sharply reduces to zero thus even for the weak gravity waves the vortex energy considerably depends on the barrier height and the wave barrier interaction is non linear it is important to note that at a given barrier height the spread in experimental values reaches 30 and over that indicates to the influence of an unaccounted parameter on the vortex generation more detailed studies of the barrier height close to the optimum d 0 87 h h show that both the vortex and reflected energies strongly depend on the nonlinearity parameter new numerical and experimental investigations suggest the dependences between the wave reflection k r and nonlinearity h h presented in fig 4 these dependences are obtained for the waves reflected from the thin impermeable barrier with a height of 0 8 d h h 0 9 dashes indicate the tsunami like wave reflection from the barrier of the same height but infinite thickness b which is calculated by the shallow water linear theory levin and nosov 2005 k r h h d h h d 0 564 at a given barrier height the wave reflection coefficient increases from 0 2 to its maximum of 0 564 within 0 05 h h 0 15 as shown in fig 4 for comparison we add the estimated results from works of wu et al 2012 and wu and hsiao 2017 obtained during the solitary wave propagation over the thin barrier d h h 0 65 high in this case the wave reflection coefficient does not exceed 0 22 and is 25 lower than the maximum value at the same barrier height estimated for the infinite thickness b the similar dependence is observed between the relative vortex energy w v w and nonlinearity h h this is shown in fig 5 which describes both w v w f h h dependence for the optimum barrier height and that obtained in wu et al 2012 according to fig 5 at h h 0 1 and the barrier height close to the optimum value d the vortex energy is almost twice higher than at d h h 0 65 this fact is in line with our early research results boshenyatov 2013 presented in fig 3 therefore the conditions for the generation of vortex structures described by wu et al 2012 wu and hsiao 2017 and huang and dong 2001 are not optimum because the barrier height does not correspond to the optimum value moreover some of researchers simulate the tsunami wave using the solitary wave its length is insufficient for a large scale development of the vortex structures qu et al 2017a this explains the lower efficiency of impermeable underwater barriers observed by other researchers in the energy suppression of solitary waves fig 6 illustrates the results of numerical simulation of the generation and evolution of the vortex structures behind the impermeable barrier with the optimum height d 0 85 h h at h h 0 068 behind this barrier the maximum energy accumulates in the large scale vortex structures and amounts to 50 of the incident energy see fig 5 according to fig 6 at 7 s the gravity wave front approaches to the barrier the gravity wave velocity behind the wave front increases proportionally to the time dependent water level Œæ t fig 2 at 7 2 s the wave pattern is symmetrical the wave moves over the barrier at 7 4 s the wave pattern becomes asymmetrical and the vortex arises at the angular point of the barrier after 7 6 s the wave velocity is close to its maximum behind the wave front see fig 2 and at 7 6 s the vortex structure completely forms further it takes the energy from the wave moving over the barrier thereby growing in size up to the largest diameter equaling the water depth h in the wave flume and at 9 5 s the second vortex structure froms with the opposite rotation at 11 s the large scale vortex structures appear behind the barrier the total energy of the vortex structures is 50 of the incident energy i e a theoretically calculated maximum boshenyatov 2017 at this time the gravitational wave tail appears at a 1 m distance from the barrier all that we see is the liquid velocity approaching to zero outside the vortex structures during 11 14 s the vortex structures behave their own way interacting with each other and breaking into smaller vortices then they gradually lose energy due to the internal liquid friction fig 7 contains the plots of the velocity distribution behind the barrier depending on the depth of water in cross sections normal to the direction of the wave propagation and passing across the vortex axes according to fig 7 the rotation of the first vortex near the barrier is clockwise while the second rotates anti clockwise and at the tangency point of the vortices the velocity direction is the same in fig 7 a the vortices still have asymmetrical shape typical for growing vortices which take energy from the liquid flow the vortex axes locate at a height of y 0 041 m 0 4h and slowly shift toward the barrier in 3 s vortices are completely symmetrical y 0 5h as shown in fig 7 b the maximum liquid velocity in the first vortex is almost 2 5 times higher than the total wave velocity fig 8 illustrates the generation and evolution of the vortex structures behind the impermeable underwater barrier at h h 0 0048 one can see that a symmetrical vortex free wave flow over the barrier takes more than 1 s as shown in fig 8 a b the vortex formation lasts for only 9 5 s at 11 s the rear gravitational wave tail is already at a 1 m distance from the barrier that means a cease of the wave barrier interaction the liquid velocity outside the vortex structure is close to zero in this case according to fig 5 only about 10 of the incident energy accumulates in the vortex near the barrier fig 9 contains the plots similar to that shown in fig 7 for the velocity distribution at h h 0 0048 and d 0 85 h h in two cross sections the first cross section passes across the vortex axis while the second locates at 2h distance to the barrier i e on the second vortex axis at h h 0 068 in fig 9 a at 11 s the upper part of the vortex structure is fuller that is typical for its growth the velocity distribution in the second cross section is uniform that is typical for the gravity tsunami like wave when t 14 s the same vortex locates at a height of —É 0 8h being already symmetrical and the vortex flow velocity is not over 25 of the wave velocity as can be seen in fig 9 b in cross section 2 the flow velocity is zero throughout the fluid height except for the upper level where disturbances are insignificant 4 theoretical model based on the integral laws of mass flow and energy conservations boshenyatov 2017 proposed a theoretical model explaining the anomalous wave suppression by the thin underwater barrier at b l the borda carnot equation was used to close equations of conservation this equation is an empirical description of the energy loss of fluid induced by a sudden flow expansion according to the borda carnot equation the loss of kinetic energy equals the energy of velocities lost in the approximation of the linear shallow water theory the wave reflection k r and transmission k t coefficients are determined by 11 k r 2 1 k 1 k p 2 4 1 k 1 k p 2 where p h h 1 h h 12 k t 1 k r in equation 11 0 k 1 is the coefficient of recovery at k 0 the impact is absolutely inelastic and at k 1 it is absolutely elastic in all other cases the coefficient of recovery can be obtained both from numerical calculations and physical experiments it should be noted that equation 11 has the limits to applicability in previous research boshenyatov and lisin 2013 we showed that at h l 0 03 the shallow water linear approximation is valid for h h 0 1 zhao et al 2019 calculated the incompressible flow using the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k œâ turbulence model they calculated the flow velocity behind the tsunami like wave at h 10 m and l 500 m for different wave heights of 1 m 2 m 3 m and 4 m fig 10 shows the dependence of the flow velocity behind the tsunami wave on the nonlinearity parameter h h dashed line indicates the linear shallow water calculation u x h h g h that gives a good speed estimate for at least h h 0 2 using the results of the numerical simulation of the wave reflection k r as given in fig 4 and equation 11 we obtain the coefficient of recovery k depending on the nonlinearity h h as plotted in fig 11 13 k 1 3 36 h h 11 15 h h 2 this dependence provides the theoretical calculation of all the necessary hydrodynamic coefficients for the experimental conditions in fig 5 the solid line denotes the theoretical dependence w v w obtained from eqns 11 13 this dependence is in good agreement with results of numerical and physical experiments fig 12 shows the percentage effectiveness of the impermeable underwater barrier as a sum of the reflected energy and the vortex energy i e the total energy loss of the wave when it passes over the barrier according to this figure the barrier effectiveness dramatically grows at 0 h h 0 1 while at h h 0 1 it changes insignificantly the total energy loss at h h 0 01 of the long gravitational wave is less than 10 even at the optimum barrier height this explains the fact that the energy of the real tsunami waves with h h 0 0002 does not decrease when propagating over high altitude submarine ridges at h h 0 15 the optimum height barrier effectiveness is about 80 whereas at d 0 71h wu et al 2012 it is 2 7 times lower i e the energy loss on the barrier is less than 30 of the incident energy in fig 13 we plot the theoretical dependences between the relative vortex energy accumulated behind the underwater barrier and its height d h at nonlinearity h h equaling 0 0001 0 02 0 1 and 0 15 this figure shows that when the wave with a low relative height of h h 0 0001 specific to real tsunami waves away from shallow water moves over the barrier the vortex energy is other than zero only at the barrier height of d 0 9h with the relative height increasing within 0 0001 h h 0 1 0 15 the maximum vortex energy shifts toward d 0 85h the theoretical calculations presented in fig 13 explain a considerable spread in the experimental values in boshenyatov 2013 obtained within 0 04 h h 0 1 where the height of the incident wave is not controlled see fig 3 the theoretical dependences between the barrier effectiveness 1 w t w 100 and its height d h are plotted in fig 14 at the nonlinearity values similar to those presented in fig 13 one can see that the obtained experimental data and the numerical simulation results on the optimum barrier height are in good agreement with the theoretical dependences derived from eqns 11 13 additionally fig 14 presents the research results obtained by wu et al 2012 and saprykina et al 2015 which also correlate with our theoretical calculations although were obtained for short waves 5 conclusions it was demonstrated that in some cases large scale vortex structures arose when long gravitational waves interact with thin underwater impermeable barriers in those cases the wave energy loss was determined not only by the reflected wave energy but also by the energy accumulated in the vortex structures it was shown that the optimum barrier height at which the energy absorbed by the vortex structures was maximum 50 of the incident wave energy depended on the ratio between the incident wave and the water depth h h at h h 0 0001 typical for tsunami waves in deep water the maximum eddy loss was observed near d h barrier height at d 0 8h the potential flow occurred near the barrier and tsunami waves overcame it without the energy loss at 0 15 h h 0 1 the optimum barrier height was about 0 85h and weakly depended on the nonlinearity h h in that case the wave reflection coefficient also reached the maximum value equaling to the wave reflection from the barrier of the same height but infinite thickness the wave suppression efficiency was found to be 80 of the incident wave energy the obtained results were based not only on the physical and numerical experiments but also on the earlier proposed semi empirical theory further research is necessary to extend our knowledge of the recovery coefficient for different underwater barriers including permeable acknowledgement this work was carried out within the framework of the competitiveness enhancement program of national research tomsk state university project n 8 2 12 2018 fundamental research programs of the institute of applied mechanics of russian academy of sciences project n –∞–∞–∞–∞ –∞19 119012290136 7 
22776,a study of the energy losses of tsunami like waves due to the formation of large eddies near the underwater barriers has been gaining importance in recent years however the conditions of the birth of the large scale vortex behind the barriers are not yet fully understood the paper presents the results of theoretical experimental and numerical studies of the interaction between the long gravitational tsunami like waves and the impermeable underwater barrier the proposed mathematical model is based on the approximation of two dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations the openfoam toolbox is used to perform the numerical simulation with the method of finite volumes the air water interface is identified by the volume of fluid method vof the numerical simulation is tested via a comparison with test activities and experiments carried out in a hydrodynamic wave flume at the institute of applied mechanics russian academy of sciences the efficiency of the underwater barrier is assessed as the percentage of the energy loss to the incident wave energy it is shown that the barrier effectiveness depends on its relative height and the incident wave parameters new experimental and numerical results are consistent with the theoretical model proposed earlier and research results of other authors keywords tsunami wave wave flume impermeable underwater barrier navier stokes equations experimental investigations numerical simulation 1 introduction tsunamis are one of the most unforeseen and devastating natural calamities in most of the coastal sea and ocean areas the extended and expensive obstacles and barriers are constructed to protect the coastal areas from natural hazards a construction of such barriers is based on the condition of the total reflection of the most probable wave height however the barrier submerges when the wave height exceeds the half height of the barrier above sea level in this case the barrier effectiveness sharply drops since any artificial barrier is rather thin relative to a tsunami wavelength that can reach tens and hundreds of kilometers levin and nosov 2005 li et al 2015 therefore research into the improvement of the submerged barrier effectiveness is relevant and substantiated since a progress in accurate analytical solutions concerning the interaction between gravity tsunami waves and thin submerged barrier has been achieved only for model equations of vortex free flows in ideal incompressible liquid li et al 2015 detailed physical experiments and numerical simulation in this field are of great importance thus irtem et al 2011 studied the impact of various factors on the effectiveness of a submerged barrier the plane section of that barrier was trapezoidal and normal to the wave front it was demonstrated that owing to the internal friction losses a permeable submerged barrier reduced the height of waves running up onto the beach with a slope of one vertical to five horizontal this reduction varied between 8 and 15 as compared to the impermeable barrier a 15 reduction was observed when the barrier height equaled the depth of water in the wave flume according to irtem et al 2011 the effectiveness of the submerged barrier sharply decreased when the wavelength l was much greater than the barrier thickness b however in their experiments researchers did not indicate the ratio between the water depth h and the wavelength l in later research irtem et al 2012 described the parameters of the incident wave so it can be concluded that h l 0 5 0 3 and 0 2 b l 0 3 note that h l 0 001 and b l 0 001 madsen et al 2008 for natural tsunami waves where tsunami barriers are usually installed saprykina et al 2015 investigated the nonlinear effects observed during the interaction between the gravity waves and the rectangular underwater barriers with a 0 5h height and 0 2l b 0 6l thickness the transmission coefficient was measured i e k t h t h where h is the average height of the incident wave h t is the average height of the transmitted wave behind the barrier in this work we are interested in the experimental results obtained only for thin impermeable barriers according to the experiments the wave transmission coefficient is k t 0 94 data spread from 0 87 to 1 02 at the barrier height and thickness h h 0 2 and 0 22l b 0 25l respectively thus the barrier effectiveness 1 k t 2 100 is about 10 the investigations also include very short waves where h l 0 6 wu et al 2012 presented numerical and experimental studies of the solitary wave propagation over a rectangular impermeable barrier 0 1 m high and 0 02 m thick installed in the wave flume the water depth h in the wave flume was 0 14 m while the amplitude h of the incident wave varied such that 0 1 h h 0 5 experiments showed that a complex vortex field formed behind the barrier interacting with the free surface thereby generating in some cases a standing wave behind the barrier with it subsequently breaking the coefficients of the wave reflection k r w r w transmission k t w t w and vortex loss k v 1 k r 2 k t 2 were calculated using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k Œµ turbulence model w w r and w t are the incident reflected and transmitted wave energy respectively it was found that the maximum energy dissipation was achieved at h h 0 15 the effectiveness of the barrier was 1 k t 2 100 32 note that according to wu et al 2012 the wavelength was merely six times larger than the depth of water h l 0 15 madsen et al 2008 and qu et al 2017a b criticized the popular practice of modeling tsunami waves using a solitary wave since its wavelength decreases with the increasing height so when h h 0 2 the relative wavelength h l 0 15 the authors reported that in a number of cases such a modeling resulted in a wrong estimation of the non linear and viscous effects due to the insufficient wavelength of solitary waves this conclusion was confirmed by qu et al 2017b who conducted a comparative analysis of forces acting on the underwater cylinder with a diameter d l during its interaction with solitary h l 0 2 and tsunami like waves h l 0 03 their calculations at h h 0 2 showed that when the cylinder was placed at a depth exceeding its diameter the force of its interaction with the solitary wave was two times less than with the tsunami like wave thus in the formation of the large scale vortex structures near the underwater objects the wavelength parameter h l plays an important role there is however no information in the literature about the studies of the underwater barriers effectiveness in their interaction with a wave whose length is l 10h the hallmark of our research is that the wave flume designed at the institute of applied mechanics of the russian academy of sciences iam ras boshenyatov and zhiltsov 2016 zhiltsov et al 2017 and the high precision method of measuring the water level provide quite a complete simulation of tsunami waves boshenyatov et al 2011 boshenyatov et al 2013 in particular the wave generator creates a long gravity wave when the h l parameter is 0 03 is amplitude being set to high accuracy at the same time the dimensionless simulation parameters with the exception to the reynolds number are close to real ones for tsunami waves in previous studies boshenyatov 2013 first found that at 0 04 h h 0 1 the optimum barrier height was d 0 85h in this case the maximum vortex energy w v accumulated in large scale vortex structures behind a thin impermeable barrier however a rather significant spread in values was observed for the relative reflected energy w r w and the vortex energy loss w v w during the wave barrier interaction in some cases this led to a 30 reduction in the barrier effectiveness these experimental facts indicated that in addition to the optimum barrier height more detailed research is necessary to identify other conditions and parameters affecting the effectiveness of underwater barriers the main objective of this study is to clarify the optimal conditions at which the maximum total effect of suppressing tsunami like waves can be achieved another purpose is to further verify the proposed theoretical model for the efficiency assessment of the vortex induced wave suppression by underwater barriers boshenyatov 2017 we utilize the integrated approach combining the theoretical analysis with physical and numerical experiments in experiments the height of the incident wave varies while the wavelength the water depth in the hydrodynamic wave flume and the height of barrier are constant 2 research methods 2 1 basic equations let us consider the unsteady two dimensional flow of incompressible viscous liquid with the free surface in the channel with the installed barrier the system of equations consists of momentum equation 1 and continuity equation 2 1 œÅ u i t u j u i x j p x i Œº 2 u i x j 2 œÅ g i 2 u i x i 0 where i and j are

Œæ x t where Œæ x t is the free surface displacement in the traditional formulation the kinematic condition is observed 4 d t u i d x u j the dynamic conditions of the free boundary determine the equality between the normal stress and the external pressure as well as the absence of tangential stresses p n n p a t m p n s 0 the initial condition at t 0 is determined by the distribution function d x 0 corresponding to the initial difference of the water level in the channel at 0 x 1 5 m the distribution function d x 0 h 2h at 1 5 m x 15 m d x 0 h the flow is considered to be laminar this approach is conditioned by rather a high reynolds number for the transition to the turbulent condition obtained in experiments with the rectangular wave flume kutateladze et al 1975 thus the critical reynolds number is re œÅ u m h Œº where u m is the depth averaged velocity u x of the liquid the re value increases with the decreasing distance x from the flume input thus at x h 60 the transition into the turbulent condition starts at re1 8 103 and ends at re2 1 8 104 as is known when the initial flow perturbation decreases the transition reynolds number increases in our case at the wavelength of l 3 m and h 0 1 m the values of x h 30 and the initial flow perturbation in front of the wave are close to zero 2 2 numerical approach a finite volume method is used to solve equations 1 and 2 with the initial and boundary conditions interfoam solver of open source software openfoam greenshields 2018 is used for the numerical approach in order to ensure stability of the solution procedure the calculations are performed with a self adapting time step which is adjusted on the courant number not over 0 6 the vof method is used to calculate the displacement of the liquid free surface proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 the vof transportation equation can be written as 5 Œ≥ t u i Œ≥ x i 0 where Œ≥ is the volume fraction of water in the computational cell which varies linearly from 0 to 1 in accordance with the following conditions 6 Œ≥ Œ≥ 0 a i r 0 Œ≥ 1 i n t e r f a c e Œ≥ 1 w a t e r the density and viscosity weighted averages in the computational cell depend on Œ≥ parameter and can be obtained from 7 œÅ Œ≥ œÅ 1 1 Œ≥ œÅ 2 Œº Œ≥ Œº 1 1 Œ≥ Œº 2 where 1 and 2 are the water and air indices respectively discretization of the spatial terms is carried out by the second order accuracy schemes using the gauss method the time discretization is performed by the euler method of the first order of accuracy in transient calculations the piso procedure is used for the pressure velocity coupling according to the vof method the distribution algorithm of the volume fraction Œ≥ is specified in the computational domain once the calculation starts the gravitation force initiates the wave motion at t 0 the velocity distribution throughout the computational domain is assumed to be zero a schematic drawing of the numerical wave generation and the water barrier interaction is presented in fig 1 the barrier is installed in the center of the wave flume the length of the computational domain is selected to be rather long to exclude the influence of waves reflecting from end walls of the flume the overall size of the computational domain corresponds to that of the experimental wave flume the physical time of the wave propagation over the flume is 20 s 2 3 mesh description let us describe the influence of the rectangular mesh size on the calculation results the mesh size is not changed during the calculations three mesh types with different size are used in this experiment the fine mesh contains 900 000 cells with the size of 0 002 m on x axis and 0 001 m on y axis the size of the medium mesh with 450 000 cells is 0 002 m on x and y axes and the coarse mesh comprises 112 000 cells with a 0 004 m size on x and y axes the numerical calculations are carried out in the computational domain 15 m long and 0 120 m high the height of the incident wave is h 3 5 mm the initial water level in the channel is h 0 103 mm fig 2 plots the time dependence of the water level d t it should be noted that the real wave generator has a solid front wall which distinguishes it from the theoretical ideal generator in spite of this fact in the case of using a fine mesh the numerically obtained value of the average wave h 1 t t 1 t 2 Œæ t d t differs from the experimentally measured by only 2 65 in our calculations we use the fine mesh because it provides the highest accuracy and speed 2 4 experimental setup and measuring techniques the experiments are carried out in the hydrodynamic wave flume at the iam ras the flume parameters are 15 m length 0 26 m width and 0 35 m height two dimensional wave processes are simulated in the x y plane such that a horizontal x axis is directed along the wave flume and the wave propagation and the vertical y axis is directed along the wave height the generation of the long gravity wave at l h is based on the theory of breakdown breakup of an arbitrary discontinuity of the water level in the wave flume at zero time this method is implemented in the caisson type wave generator without moving elements boshenyatov and lisin 2013 this generator creates a wave of the given height similar to an undular bore without breaking its length equals about a double length of the wave generator the black circles in fig 2 indicate the typical time dependence d x t h Œæ x t resulting from measuring at a 3 0 m distance to the wave generator and the initial depth of h 0 103 m the nonlinearity is then h h 0 034 and the wave velocity is 1 m s the latter matches the velocity estimated in accordance with the shallow water linear theory as can be seen from fig 2 the average amplitude of the incident wave h 3 5 mm equals Œ¥h 2 and the wavelength is 3 m at time t 3 s that matches l 3 m 2–∞ here –∞ is the length of the wave generator this value also corresponds to calculation results obtained by the shallow water linear theory the numerical simulation is also verified by a more complicated strongly non linear problem of the wave transformation and breaking during its propagation over flat shoal the experimental results are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations boshenyatov and lisin 2013 in our experiments the barrier is installed at a 9 04 m distance from the flume start its height d is 95 mm and thickness b is 10 mm fig 1 the water depth in the wave flume and the generating wavelength are constant and equal respectively h 0 103 m and l 3 m the height of the incident wave ranges from 0 5 to 16 5 mm i e within the range wider than described in boshenyatov 2013 three water level sensors are placed in the wave flume at distances of 4 5 6 and 12 m to the flume start the fourth sensor is placed in the wave generator to measure the initial water level difference in it and the main section of the wave flume the suggested x t diagrams of the free surface displacement allow us to accurately identify the incident reflected and transmitted energies of tsunami like waves moving over the barrier and measure their velocity for each experiment coefficients of the wave reflection k r transmission k t and vortex loss k v are determined via the total energy 8 k r w r w k t w t w k v 1 w r w w t w the total energy of the gravity wave is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies i e w w p w k 9 w

and discussion 3 1 experimental results and numerical calculations we focus on the determination of optimum conditions for the wave propagation over the impermeable underwater barrier when the total energy of the wave suppression is the highest this energy for a thin impermeable barrier is a sum of the reflected energy and the vortex energy accumulated behind the barrier at first we study the physical effects produced by the interaction of weak gravity waves with the barrier h h 0 1 high since the time of the wave barrier interaction is rather long h l 0 03 the large scale vortex structures behind the barrier can fully stabilize fig 3 presents the dependence between the relative vortex energy w v w accumulated behind the thin impermeable barrier and the relative barrier height d h h this dependence is obtained from experimental data and numerical calculations boshenyatov 2013 according to fig 3 the vortex energy w v w gradually increases with the increasing barrier height within the range of 0 d h h 0 87 when the vortex energy achieves its maximum of about 50 of the incident energy it sharply reduces to zero thus even for the weak gravity waves the vortex energy considerably depends on the barrier height and the wave barrier interaction is non linear it is important to note that at a given barrier height the spread in experimental values reaches 30 and over that indicates to the influence of an unaccounted parameter on the vortex generation more detailed studies of the barrier height close to the optimum d 0 87 h h show that both the vortex and reflected energies strongly depend on the nonlinearity parameter new numerical and experimental investigations suggest the dependences between the wave reflection k r and nonlinearity h h presented in fig 4 these dependences are obtained for the waves reflected from the thin impermeable barrier with a height of 0 8 d h h 0 9 dashes indicate the tsunami like wave reflection from the barrier of the same height but infinite thickness b which is calculated by the shallow water linear theory levin and nosov 2005 k r h h d h h d 0 564 at a given barrier height the wave reflection coefficient increases from 0 2 to its maximum of 0 564 within 0 05 h h 0 15 as shown in fig 4 for comparison we add the estimated results from works of wu et al 2012 and wu and hsiao 2017 obtained during the solitary wave propagation over the thin barrier d h h 0 65 high in this case the wave reflection coefficient does not exceed 0 22 and is 25 lower than the maximum value at the same barrier height estimated for the infinite thickness b the similar dependence is observed between the relative vortex energy w v w and nonlinearity h h this is shown in fig 5 which describes both w v w f h h dependence for the optimum barrier height and that obtained in wu et al 2012 according to fig 5 at h h 0 1 and the barrier height close to the optimum value d the vortex energy is almost twice higher than at d h h 0 65 this fact is in line with our early research results boshenyatov 2013 presented in fig 3 therefore the conditions for the generation of vortex structures described by wu et al 2012 wu and hsiao 2017 and huang and dong 2001 are not optimum because the barrier height does not correspond to the optimum value moreover some of researchers simulate the tsunami wave using the solitary wave its length is insufficient for a large scale development of the vortex structures qu et al 2017a this explains the lower efficiency of impermeable underwater barriers observed by other researchers in the energy suppression of solitary waves fig 6 illustrates the results of numerical simulation of the generation and evolution of the vortex structures behind the impermeable barrier with the optimum height d 0 85 h h at h h 0 068 behind this barrier the maximum energy accumulates in the large scale vortex structures and amounts to 50 of the incident energy see fig 5 according to fig 6 at 7 s the gravity wave front approaches to the barrier the gravity wave velocity behind the wave front increases proportionally to the time dependent water level Œæ t fig 2 at 7 2 s the wave pattern is symmetrical the wave moves over the barrier at 7 4 s the wave pattern becomes asymmetrical and the vortex arises at the angular point of the barrier after 7 6 s the wave velocity is close to its maximum behind the wave front see fig 2 and at 7 6 s the vortex structure completely forms further it takes the energy from the wave moving over the barrier thereby growing in size up to the largest diameter equaling the water depth h in the wave flume and at 9 5 s the second vortex structure froms with the opposite rotation at 11 s the large scale vortex structures appear behind the barrier the total energy of the vortex structures is 50 of the incident energy i e a theoretically calculated maximum boshenyatov 2017 at this time the gravitational wave tail appears at a 1 m distance from the barrier all that we see is the liquid velocity approaching to zero outside the vortex structures during 11 14 s the vortex structures behave their own way interacting with each other and breaking into smaller vortices then they gradually lose energy due to the internal liquid friction fig 7 contains the plots of the velocity distribution behind the barrier depending on the depth of water in cross sections normal to the direction of the wave propagation and passing across the vortex axes according to fig 7 the rotation of the first vortex near the barrier is clockwise while the second rotates anti clockwise and at the tangency point of the vortices the velocity direction is the same in fig 7 a the vortices still have asymmetrical shape typical for growing vortices which take energy from the liquid flow the vortex axes locate at a height of y 0 041 m 0 4h and slowly shift toward the barrier in 3 s vortices are completely symmetrical y 0 5h as shown in fig 7 b the maximum liquid velocity in the first vortex is almost 2 5 times higher than the total wave velocity fig 8 illustrates the generation and evolution of the vortex structures behind the impermeable underwater barrier at h h 0 0048 one can see that a symmetrical vortex free wave flow over the barrier takes more than 1 s as shown in fig 8 a b the vortex formation lasts for only 9 5 s at 11 s the rear gravitational wave tail is already at a 1 m distance from the barrier that means a cease of the wave barrier interaction the liquid velocity outside the vortex structure is close to zero in this case according to fig 5 only about 10 of the incident energy accumulates in the vortex near the barrier fig 9 contains the plots similar to that shown in fig 7 for the velocity distribution at h h 0 0048 and d 0 85 h h in two cross sections the first cross section passes across the vortex axis while the second locates at 2h distance to the barrier i e on the second vortex axis at h h 0 068 in fig 9 a at 11 s the upper part of the vortex structure is fuller that is typical for its growth the velocity distribution in the second cross section is uniform that is typical for the gravity tsunami like wave when t 14 s the same vortex locates at a height of —É 0 8h being already symmetrical and the vortex flow velocity is not over 25 of the wave velocity as can be seen in fig 9 b in cross section 2 the flow velocity is zero throughout the fluid height except for the upper level where disturbances are insignificant 4 theoretical model based on the integral laws of mass flow and energy conservations boshenyatov 2017 proposed a theoretical model explaining the anomalous wave suppression by the thin underwater barrier at b l the borda carnot equation was used to close equations of conservation this equation is an empirical description of the energy loss of fluid induced by a sudden flow expansion according to the borda carnot equation the loss of kinetic energy equals the energy of velocities lost in the approximation of the linear shallow water theory the wave reflection k r and transmission k t coefficients are determined by 11 k r 2 1 k 1 k p 2 4 1 k 1 k p 2 where p h h 1 h h 12 k t 1 k r in equation 11 0 k 1 is the coefficient of recovery at k 0 the impact is absolutely inelastic and at k 1 it is absolutely elastic in all other cases the coefficient of recovery can be obtained both from numerical calculations and physical experiments it should be noted that equation 11 has the limits to applicability in previous research boshenyatov and lisin 2013 we showed that at h l 0 03 the shallow water linear approximation is valid for h h 0 1 zhao et al 2019 calculated the incompressible flow using the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the k œâ turbulence model they calculated the flow velocity behind the tsunami like wave at h 10 m and l 500 m for different wave heights of 1 m 2 m 3 m and 4 m fig 10 shows the dependence of the flow velocity behind the tsunami wave on the nonlinearity parameter h h dashed line indicates the linear shallow water calculation u x h h g h that gives a good speed estimate for at least h h 0 2 using the results of the numerical simulation of the wave reflection k r as given in fig 4 and equation 11 we obtain the coefficient of recovery k depending on the nonlinearity h h as plotted in fig 11 13 k 1 3 36 h h 11 15 h h 2 this dependence provides the theoretical calculation of all the necessary hydrodynamic coefficients for the experimental conditions in fig 5 the solid line denotes the theoretical dependence w v w obtained from eqns 11 13 this dependence is in good agreement with results of numerical and physical experiments fig 12 shows the percentage effectiveness of the impermeable underwater barrier as a sum of the reflected energy and the vortex energy i e the total energy loss of the wave when it passes over the barrier according to this figure the barrier effectiveness dramatically grows at 0 h h 0 1 while at h h 0 1 it changes insignificantly the total energy loss at h h 0 01 of the long gravitational wave is less than 10 even at the optimum barrier height this explains the fact that the energy of the real tsunami waves with h h 0 0002 does not decrease when propagating over high altitude submarine ridges at h h 0 15 the optimum height barrier effectiveness is about 80 whereas at d 0 71h wu et al 2012 it is 2 7 times lower i e the energy loss on the barrier is less than 30 of the incident energy in fig 13 we plot the theoretical dependences between the relative vortex energy accumulated behind the underwater barrier and its height d h at nonlinearity h h equaling 0 0001 0 02 0 1 and 0 15 this figure shows that when the wave with a low relative height of h h 0 0001 specific to real tsunami waves away from shallow water moves over the barrier the vortex energy is other than zero only at the barrier height of d 0 9h with the relative height increasing within 0 0001 h h 0 1 0 15 the maximum vortex energy shifts toward d 0 85h the theoretical calculations presented in fig 13 explain a considerable spread in the experimental values in boshenyatov 2013 obtained within 0 04 h h 0 1 where the height of the incident wave is not controlled see fig 3 the theoretical dependences between the barrier effectiveness 1 w t w 100 and its height d h are plotted in fig 14 at the nonlinearity values similar to those presented in fig 13 one can see that the obtained experimental data and the numerical simulation results on the optimum barrier height are in good agreement with the theoretical dependences derived from eqns 11 13 additionally fig 14 presents the research results obtained by wu et al 2012 and saprykina et al 2015 which also correlate with our theoretical calculations although were obtained for short waves 5 conclusions it was demonstrated that in some cases large scale vortex structures arose when long gravitational waves interact with thin underwater impermeable barriers in those cases the wave energy loss was determined not only by the reflected wave energy but also by the energy accumulated in the vortex structures it was shown that the optimum barrier height at which the energy absorbed by the vortex structures was maximum 50 of the incident wave energy depended on the ratio between the incident wave and the water depth h h at h h 0 0001 typical for tsunami waves in deep water the maximum eddy loss was observed near d h barrier height at d 0 8h the potential flow occurred near the barrier and tsunami waves overcame it without the energy loss at 0 15 h h 0 1 the optimum barrier height was about 0 85h and weakly depended on the nonlinearity h h in that case the wave reflection coefficient also reached the maximum value equaling to the wave reflection from the barrier of the same height but infinite thickness the wave suppression efficiency was found to be 80 of the incident wave energy the obtained results were based not only on the physical and numerical experiments but also on the earlier proposed semi empirical theory further research is necessary to extend our knowledge of the recovery coefficient for different underwater barriers including permeable acknowledgement this work was carried out within the framework of the competitiveness enhancement program of national

22777,the paper examines the possibilities for using the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc framework in stability assessment and calculation of operational limitations of the river sea ships the level 2 vulnerability assessment procedures for dead ship condition dsc and excessive accelerations ea are used to derive the operational limitations of a typical european inland container vessel in the north sea coastal zone the results are in good agreement with the operational experience in the designated area but provide additional insights into safety of river sea ships that could not have been observed by the classic stability analysis it is shown that the approach used by the sgisc could be successfully applied to river sea ships provided that appropriate modifications of the criteria are introduced keywords river sea ships second generation intact stability criteria operational limitations dead ship condition excessive accelerations 1 introduction the river sea ships are primarily inland vessels which are supposed to make short sea trips in coastal zones on a regular basis provided that certain technical and environmental conditions are met such vessels are in operation in coastal areas of france belgium russia india china etc a particular concept of operational limitations is very well known in the river sea navigation the existing regulations limit operation of river sea ships in seaway by taking into account ship stability seakeeping criteria and hull strength the operational limitations of river sea ships imposed by such regulations are typically related to wave height however a common international regulatory framework for river sea ships does not exist not even at european level instead national regulations and classification rules employing very dissimilar approaches are being used throughout the world see baƒçkalov 2012 and chatelier et al 2017 such regulations being location specific are inevitably semi empirical and tailored so as to take into account the design features of typical ships used in the designated navigation area as well as the particular operational experience with such ships in other words the regulations successfully applied in one coastal zone may not be appropriate for different ships sailing in another area on the other hand the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc framework foresees the introduction of operational limitations ol which could be regarded as limitations on the overall operability of the vessel in specific loading conditions baƒçkalov et al 2016 at the time when the research presented in this paper was conducted there was no precise definition of operational limitations but there was a general agreement that ol could be developed using either vulnerability assessment level 2 l2 or direct stability assessment imo 2016a it should be noted that some clarifications in this respect as well as more detailed procedures for calculation of operational limitations were recently provided see imo 2018a imo 2018b furthermore considering that the river sea ships are unconventional both in terms of design and operation the sgisc could represent a suitable option for stability assessment of such vessels therefore the present paper explores the possibilities for using the sgisc framework as a basis for a coherent approach to calculation of operational limitations of river sea ships independent of their area specific design features and in line with the current developments of ship stability criteria 2 sample ship the present investigation is conducted on a typical european inland container vessel sailing along the belgian shoreline in the southern north sea coastal zone the main particulars of the ship corresponding to the design draught are given in table 1 it should be noted that such vessel is normally not equipped with bilge keels which is why both the vessel without bilge keels and with virtually added bilge keels is examined the natural roll period of the sample ship is determined using the formula prescribed by the weather criterion see imo 2008 the body plan of the vessel is presented in fig 1 the cross sections are equally spaced at 500 mm distance whereby 0 represents the aftmost station the ship has a single box shaped cargo hold without hatch covers when passing below bridges the wheelhouse has to be lowered whereas in regular sailing conditions the wheelhouse has to be positioned sufficiently high in order to fulfil the visibility requirements set forth by the regulations therefore as is often the case with inland vessels the sample ship has a hydraulically operated retractable wheelhouse when fully loaded the ship carries 192 teus in four tiers four rows and 12 bays 3 issues in application of the sgisc framework to river sea ships the operational limitations are calculated taking into account stability failure modes relevant for the examined river sea ship due to low froude numbers at which they operate the river sea ships are not vulnerable to surf riding and broaching considering the hull form features of the typical river sea ships the large variations of the righting arm in longitudinal waves which could lead to parametric roll or pure loss of stability are not to be expected either it should be noted that most of the existing safety regulations for river sea ships require assessment of stability in beam wind and waves i e in the weather criterion scenario and that some regulations pay particular attention to the level of lateral accelerations for instance according to the rules of the russian river register rrr the navigation area of the river sea ships is determined by the so called acceleration criterion which requires verification of lateral accelerations and imposes 0 3g where g 9 81 m s2 as the limiting value see russian river register 2015 in fact the concept of excessive accelerations has been long known in the rrr regulations for the river sea ships see lesyukov 1974 from the point of view of the sgisc the draft regulations for excessive accelerations vulnerability assessment imo 2016b imo 2018a foresee that the stability of a ship should be checked with respect to this stability failure mode in case that the distance from the waterline to the highest location along the length of the ship where passengers or crew may be present exceeds 70 of the breadth of the ship and the metacentric height exceeds 8 of the breadth of the ship both conditions are satisfied for the examined ship at design draught given that the helmsman position in the wheelhouse is around 10 m above the waterline 88 of the ship s breadth while the realistic metacentric heights are in range of 15 26 of the ship s breadth therefore the focus of the present investigation is on the large amplitudes of roll that could be attained in beam wind and waves i e in the dead ship condition and on excessive lateral accelerations in beam seas the vulnerability to these two stability failure modes is assessed by calculating the dead ship stability failure index ci and the exceedance index ei respectively in order to derive the ci and the ei for the sample ship the sgisc formulas and procedures were used as far as it was possible however this was not a straightforward process due to a range of issues related to both the design and the operational features of the river sea ships the issues encountered in application of the sgisc to river sea ships are herein discussed 3 1 roll damping of river sea ships within the sgisc framework the use of simplified ikeda s method for roll damping assessment is recommended in absence of either experimental data or another more suitable method such approach would also apply to inland vessels for which the available experimental data are scarce and unreliable on the other hand the sample ship falls out of scope of application of the simplified ikeda s method due to high values of beam to draught ratio b d block coefficient c b and mid ship coefficient c m in addition og d values where og is the distance of the center of gravity from the calm water level may also be out of range of method application in general this holds for almost all inland vessels the applicability of simplified ikeda s method on inland vessels was the subject of the study by rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 where an adjustment of the eddy making damping component was proposed in order to deal with the inconsistencies in roll damping prediction that arise at c b 0 74 thus in the present paper the simplified ikeda s method with the eddy damping component modification as proposed by rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 was adopted adjustment of the simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component is briefly explained in appendix a nevertheless the problem of appropriate roll damping assessment of river sea ships is not completely resolved and deserves more attention 3 2 wind and wave climate the sgisc define the standard or reference environmental conditions that ought to be applied in stability assessment but make provisions for using alternative environmental conditions that is other data that are deemed to be more appropriate in the case of restricted navigation or operational limitations see imo 2016c imo 2018a for the purposes of the present analysis use was made of the available wind and wave measurements in the belgian coastal zone see chatelier et al 2017 the wave scatter diagram is given in appendix b to this paper furthermore for the purposes of this paper the following relation between the mean wind speed u w and significant wave height h s was established based on the measurements given by chatelier et al 2017 1 u w 11 75 h s 0 375 in fig 2 equation 1 is compared to the wind wave relation as given in the draft vulnerability criteria of level 2 for the dead ship condition stability failure mode imo 2015 it may be noticed that the same significant wave height in the coastal zone is associated with stronger winds than in the open sea the jonswap wave spectrum was adopted as the alternative to the standard spectrum foreseen by vulnerability criteria imo 2015 the use of jonswap spectrum has proved to be successful when addressing the north sea coastal environment see van essen and peters 2017 chatelier et al 2017 and verwaest et al 2008 3 3 applicability of standards and acceptable thresholds the subject of the relevant stability failures and acceptable probability of their occurrence is probably the most delicate issue in this analysis for inland container vessels which do not have hatch covers the critical stability failure is usually the heeling to the angle of submergence of the hatch coaming thus in such cases the dead ship stability failure index which according to imo 2018a could be regarded as the long term probability index calculated as weighted average of the short term measure of the probability that the ship will exceed a specified heel angle at least once in the considered exposure time is actually the index of flooding of unprotected cargo hold concerning the limiting value of ci within the sgisc framework acceptable safety level for the dead ship condition has been sought upon the grounds of consistency between the vulnerability levels 1 and 2 see umeda and francescutto 2016 in that case the severe wind and rolling criterion weather criterion as given in intact stability is code part a 2 3 imo 2008 but with the modified wave steepness factor s forms the vulnerability level 1 since the final value of ci was still not adopted at the time when the investigation presented in this paper was carried out 0 04 and 0 06 were discussed as possible thresholds it should be noted that this dilemma was only recently resolved see imo 2018a it was already pointed out that the existing safety regulations for river sea ships contain mandatory assessment of dynamic stability which follows the concept of the is code weather criterion see baƒçkalov 2012 nevertheless although the scenario of these weather criteria is for the most part the same as in the is code some specific aspects such as wind pressure resonant roll amplitude assessment etc may differ moreover the weather criteria used are not uniform across the regulations for river sea ships this is not surprising because the rules are area specific therefore establishing the acceptable dead ship stability failure index of river sea ships based on consistency of two vulnerability levels could be a challenging task with respect to excessive accelerations presently the proposed l2 standard is derived based on the chicago express accident during which lateral accelerations in the wheelhouse attained 1g bsu 2009 the long term attained exceedance index which according to imo 2018a could be regarded as the long term probability index calculated as weighted average of the short term measure of the probability that the ship will exceed a specified lateral acceleration calculated for chicago express in the loading condition at the time of accident is ei 1 094 10 4 see imo 2016b although the same standards and thresholds proposed for the seagoing ships in imo 2016b and imo 2016c may not be applicable to inland vessels in maritime operations ci 0 04 and ei 1 10 4 are maintained in the current investigation their influence on the outcome of the study will be also the subject of the analysis 3 4 other issues some other practical issues may also arise in application of the sgisc framework to the river sea ships for instance the estimation of the natural roll period of the sample ship depends on the roll radius of gyration which is presently calculated using the formula prescribed by the weather criterion see imo 2008 and developed for the seagoing ships similarly the effective wave slope function is calculated using the standard methodology as given in the draft explanatory notes imo 2016c although the suitability of this method for inland vessels is yet to be ascertained 4 discussion of results the dead ship stability failure index ci and exceedance index ei of the sample ship are determined as weighted averages of short term indices ci s and ei s which are calculated for each sea state in the wave scatter diagram 2 c i i 1 n w i c i s i 3 e i i 1 n w i e i s i where w i represents the probability of occurrence of a sea state it is considered that the procedures for calculation of ci and ei are well described in explanatory notes imo 2016c and imo 2016b and therefore need not to be reproduced here the calculations are carried out for the complete scatter diagram up to h s 3 6 m as well as for the scatter diagram limited by the following wave heights 3 0 m 2 5 m 2 0 m 1 5 m 1 0 m and 0 5 m whenever the wave height limitation is introduced the wave scatter diagram is re normalized in such way that the total probability of occurrence of sea states is equal to 1 both ci and ei are calculated for a series of metacentric heights the goal is to determine a range of loading conditions for which both ci and ei are below the limiting values in navigation up to a given significant wave height for instance if indices ci and ei calculated for the examined ship in a given loading condition do not exceed critical levels in waves up to h s 3 6 m then the navigation in the designated area would be unrestricted in the loading case considered on the other hand if either ci or ei are above the threshold values in e g waves up to h s 2 m the navigation should not be permitted in the given loading condition if this significant wave height is exceeded the efficiency of the following options for improvement of operability of river sea ships is examined the addition of bilge keels as a cost effective design measure as well as the lowering of metacentric height and the reduction of the draught as possible operational measures in sea voyages 4 1 the influence of bilge keels as inland vessels typically do not have bilge keels ci and ei are calculated for the sample vessel both without and with bilge keels the results are given in fig 3 6 where each curve corresponds to a limiting significant wave height the shaded areas in the charts correspond to ci 0 04 and ei 1 10 4 the angle of flooding of cargo hold is 21 3 the calculations are performed in range gm 0 3 m whereby it should be noted that the metacentric heights above gm 3 m are virtually unrealistic for loading cases with four container tiers while gm 1 7 m corresponds to a uniform vertical distribution of cargo weight i e a case in which loaded containers have equal weight therefore gm 1 7 m marked in fig 3 6 with a dashed vertical line could be regarded as the minimal metacentric height from the point of view of the conventional loading practice as discussed later in the paper as expected the bilge keels have a positive effect on safety of the sample ship for instance the dead ship stability failure index for gm 1 7 m in waves up to h s 1 5 m decreases from unacceptable ci 1 1 10 1 for the ship without bilge keels fig 3 to acceptable ci 1 1 10 2 for the ship equipped with bilge keels fig 4 the effect of bilge keels on stability of the examined vessel in higher significant wave heights becomes noticeable at lower values of gm such loading cases however deserve to be analysed separately the influence of bilge keels is even more obvious when it comes to excessive accelerations vulnerability assessment in waves up to h s 2 m the ship equipped with bilge keels could be considered as safe from excessive accelerations in the complete range of possible metacentric heights fig 6 within the same range of weather conditions the maximal metacentric height of the ship without bilge keels would be limited to 1 7 m fig 5 the unrestricted service in the area i e in waves up to h s 3 6 m would require that the metacentric height of the ship without bilge keels does not exceed 1 2 m fig 5 which is below the value that could be attained by uniform vertical distribution of cargo weight if the bilge keels are installed however the unrestricted service becomes possible in the complete range of technically attainable metacentric heights fig 6 4 2 the influence of reduced gm the performed analysis indicates that the ol of the vessel could be further expanded by employing an operational measure quite different from the ones anticipated namely fig 3 6 show that the optimal metacentric height from the point of view of ship stability in waves would be in range of gm 0 5 0 8 m these values are far below the usual metacentric heights for inland container vessels of this class loaded with four container tiers and sailing at the design draught indeed the metacentric heights below 1 7 m could not be attained unless heavier containers are loaded atop of lighter ones the very minimal metacentric height that could be achieved by placing heavier containers in top tiers is gm 0 6 m this metacentric height is marked by the full red vertical line in fig 3 6 although such unconventional vertical distribution of cargo contradicts standard loading practices it would be clearly beneficial for the stability of the examined river sea ship in seaway however care should be taken that the structural loads due to such cargo distribution are not dangerously increased the contribution of bilge keels and reduced metacentric heights to safety of the sample ship in sea voyages is evident from the ol given in figs 7 and 8 the shaded areas in the figures represent the range of attainable and acceptable metacentric heights for which both ci and ei are below the adopted safety levels plotted as a function of h s as in fig 3 6 the dashed line corresponds to minimal metacentric height with respect to the usual loading practices gm 1 7 m while full red line represents the minimal metacentric height gm 0 6 m that could be achieved by an un conventional vertical distribution of cargo weight at gm 1 4 m the navigation of the ship equipped with bilge keels would be practically unrestricted in the designated area on the other hand with the same metacentric height the examined vessel without bilge keels could not be considered as safe from the stability point of view if operated with limiting significant wave height greater than h s 1 6 m however if by a proper distribution of container weights the metacentric height is reduced below 1 m the sample ship would have an acceptable average safety level for unlimited operation in the considered area even without bilge keels it should be noted that the operational limitations derived from the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment are in the present case stricter in comparison to the limitations imposed by the excessive accelerations this interesting outcome will be discussed later in more detail 4 3 the influence of reduced draught in some coastal zones draught restrictions are imposed on inland vessels when operating in maritime stretches the vessel is required to sail with the draught which is reduced in comparison to the design draught intended for inland navigation to examine the effectiveness of such operational measure ci and ei are calculated for the sample vessel equipped with bilge keels sailing at d 2 m loaded with four container tiers in this case the angle of flooding of cargo hold is 25 9 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 the dead ship stability failure indices decrease in comparison to the design draught the exceedance indices of lateral accelerations in general decrease as well for any value of gm the ship would be safer from the point of view of stability in seaway at reduced draught than at the design draught however the range of metacentric heights that could be attained by varying vertical distribution of cargo weight changes too to gm 2 8 3 8 m again the lower value in the range is achieved by the uniform distribution of container weight over the tiers within this range of metacentric heights the vessel with four container tiers at d 2 m would be considered as safe in seaway only if operated with limiting h s lower than 1 5 m see fig 9 further reduction of metacentric height is possible only if heavier containers are loaded in top tiers the minimal metacentric height which could be attained in this way is gm 1 8 m full red line in fig 9 11 loading of heavier containers in top tiers could indeed considerably expand the ol of the ship at reduced draught fig 11 nevertheless the ol derived for the examined case show that for limiting h s 2 m the range of acceptable metacentric heights would be rather narrow between Œ¥gm 0 2 m for limiting h s 3 6 m and Œ¥gm 0 5 m for limiting h s 2 m making stability of the vessel susceptible to e g loading errors in order to quantify the effectiveness of the examined design and operational measures some indicators could be introduced the vessel operational limitations index oli could be defined as the ratio of the calculated operational limitations the hatched areas in figs 7 fig 8 figs 11 and 12 and the theoretical maximum of operational limitations gray rectangular area bounded by the range of possible metacentric heights and the range of significant wave heights that occur in the designated region see fig 12 thus it would be oli max 1 in case that the unrestricted service in the specified coastal area would be possible with any technically viable vertical cargo distribution at a given draught if the analyzed vessel sails at d 2 46 m the addition of bilge keels would increase the operational limitations index from oli 0 46 corresponding to ol given in fig 7 to oli 0 64 corresponding to ol given in fig 8 however if the vessel sails at d 2 m then the operational limitations index would decrease to oli 0 5 even with the bilge keels installed see table 2 the position of the centroid of the hatched area with respect to the abscissa of the ol chart x c fig 12 could be used as an additional information on the vessel operational limitations table 2 x c increases if the bilge keels are installed indicating the expansion of operational limitations towards the higher significant wave heights on the other hand x c considerably decreases with the reduction of the draught x c could be also expressed in a dimensionless form x c obtained by normalizing x c with the half of the maximal significant wave height in the wave scatter diagram table 2 consequently in case of unrestricted service in a specified coastal area it would be x c max 1 based on the values of indicators given in table 2 it could be concluded that reduction of draught would not improve the vessel operability in comparison to the navigation at the design draught additionally considering that the payload at d 2 m would be decreased by some 500 t sailing at reduced draught would come at a cost which could not be justified 4 4 the influence of adopted standards and thresholds the results indicate that the lateral accelerations would not present the main limiting factor in operation of the sample ship if the same stability failure i e the lateral acceleration of 1g and related threshold ei 1 10 4 as foreseen by the vulnerability criteria for the seagoing ships given in imo 2016b are adopted for the river sea vessels too indeed in all of the examined cases the maximal metacentric heights calculated using the excessive accelerations vulnerability criterion are greater than the maximal gm values obtained by the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment see figs 7 figs 8 and 11 in other words the excessive accelerations criterion is less stringent than the dead ship condition vulnerability criterion at least for the examined vessel such outcome is somewhat unexpected and in contrast with some regulations e g the russian river register which use the level of estimated lateral accelerations to define the operational limitations of river sea ships this potential inconsistency between the sgisc approach and operational experience with the examined type of vessels highlights the issue of appropriate stability standards and thresholds for river sea ships thus there are two possibilities which should be considered on one hand it is possible that the threshold for dead ship condition stability failure ci 0 04 is too stringent if a higher dead ship stability failure index e g ci 0 06 is applied the dead ship condition would remain the prevailing stability failure for the ship with bilge keels fig 14 however if the ship is not equipped with bilge keels the difference between the two examined vulnerability criteria would be negligible at higher significant wave heights fig 13 in fact it should be noted that ci 0 06 was recently adopted as the threshold for dead ship stability failure of seagoing ships see imo 2018a nevertheless another threshold for excessive accelerations stability failure was simultaneously adopted as well as ei 3 9 10 4 consequently if these thresholds are applied to the examined river sea ship dead ship stability failure would still be the dominant stability failure the effect of eventually adopted thresholds for the seagoing ships on the operational limitations of the analyzed vessel is addressed in figs 15 and 16 on the other hand the question is whether accelerations of 1g could be too high for inland vessels and if a lower more probable and thus more limiting value could be more appropriate namely the effect of lateral accelerations on people onboard is normally related to motion induced interruption mii i e sliding and tipping events in the wheelhouse such events could be prevented or diminished by design measures that is by appropriate bridge ergonomics including sufficient number and a proper arrangement of handhelds however european technical standards for inland vessels cesni 2015 do not contain particular requirements for bridge ergonomics that would address the safety of crew due to mii on the other hand as baƒçkalov et al 2016 emphasized the safety cannot be achieved by design measures only in fact the safety by design is complemented by skills knowledge appropriate training and experience of master and crew which is often referred to as prudent seamanship the question is however whether masters and crews of inland vessels which spend just a fraction of sailing time at sea have a level of prudent seamanship sufficient to compensate for inadequate design in addition increased physical efforts required to maintain the posture due to vessel motion could lead to mental fatigue decreased attention and cognitive performance of the crew therefore it seems that neither suitable design nor appropriate operational safety measures are in place that would justify the same critical level of lateral accelerations as on the seagoing ships 5 conclusions the present paper investigated the use of the second generation intact stability criteria framework in calculation of operational limitations of river sea ships from the stability point of view the paper is an updated and revised version of the original research presented at the 13th international conference on stability of ships and ocean vehicles stab2018 the river sea ships are actually vessels intended for navigation on inland waterways and suitable for restricted navigation at sea chatelier et al 2017 as such the river sea ships in general do not comply with the major international safety regulations such as solas and icll consequently the river sea ships are unconventional from the design point of view with respect to the typical hull forms main dimensions and their ratios and compliance of the design with the maritime safety regulations furthermore the river sea ships are unconventional from the operational point of view as well with respect to the very notion of inland vessels sailing at sea and prudent seamanship of their crews hence the authors believe that the safety assessment of inland vessels in maritime operations should be performed by methods taking into account as far as practicable ship dynamics in realistic weather conditions it is considered that a necessary balance of complexity of calculations and accuracy of physical modelling is achieved by the vulnerability assessment level 2 of the second generation intact stability criteria however the application of the sgisc to the river sea ships requires some modifications related to roll damping assessment the use of location specific environmental conditions estimation of natural roll period etc although the present analysis is performed on one sample vessel only in a specific navigation area the outlined approach along with the dilemmas related to its use apply to river sea ships in general the results of the analysis are generally in good agreement with the operational experience in the southern north sea coastal zone where the river sea ships nowadays operate in h s 1 6 2 m as expected a modest modification of the hull such as addition of bilge keels proved to be beneficial for the safety of the vessel however it was demonstrated that the draught reduction which is sometimes imposed as an operational safety measure would not expand the operational limitations of the vessel in realistic loading conditions furthermore it was shown that an unconventional vertical distribution of cargo weight i e loading of heavier containers in top tiers resulting in lower metacentric heights would have a positive effect on the behavior of the examined vessel in seaway from a stability perspective it should be emphasized that such results could not have been obtained by means of classic ship stability analysis which is used in many existing regulations for river sea ships the analysis indicated that the main limiting factor in operation of the sample ship from the ship stability point of view would be the large amplitudes of roll attained in beam wind and waves that is the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment would be the prevailing stability criterion this outcome is the consequence of adopted stability failures and thresholds which were developed for the purposes of stability assessment of seagoing ships the critical stability failures and levels of corresponding indices that would be adequate for stability assessment of the river sea ships need to be further investigated from the point of view of implementation in the regulatory framework the examined approach could be classified as a pre computation and approval in the design stage option for preparation of ol see the proposal for guidelines for the preparation and approval of operational limitations imo 2017 a relatively large number of calculations that ought to be performed for a series of relevant loading cases and draughts could be a potential drawback of the approach additionally unlike for seagoing ships the verification of container mass prior to loading is still not mandatory for inland vessels therefore there are uncertainties related to vertical center of gravity and natural roll period in a given loading condition affecting the accuracy of stability assessment notwithstanding these practical yet solvable difficulties the authors believe that the second generation intact stability criteria could be a promising solution for a common approach to assessment of operational limitations of river sea ships acknowledments the paper is part of the project development of next generation of safe efficient ecological se eco ships executed by department of naval architecture faculty of mechanical engineering university of belgrade the project is partly financed by ministry of education science and technology development of republic of serbia contract no tr35009 the authors would like to thank professor milan hofman university of belgrade for valuable suggestions and comments in course of the study furthermore the authors would like to express their gratitude to the organizers of the 13th international conference on stability of ships and ocean vehicles stab 2018 kobe japan for the opportunity to present the original version of this work appendix a adjustment of the simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component typically european inland vessels have full hull forms with values of block coefficient in range c b 0 82 0 94 when applying the simplified ikeda s method to inland vessels it was noticed that inconsistencies in roll damping prediction may arise at c b 0 74 it was found that these inconsistencies are to be attributed to eddy damping component which in some cases may even attain negative values even though the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability i e c b 0 85 therefore rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 proposed the modification of eddy damping component based on results obtained by classic ikeda s method applied to four inland vessels c b 0 798 0 851 and two seagoing ships c b 0 843 and c b 0 798 according to simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component is calculated as a 1 b ÀÜ e 4 œâ ÀÜ œï a 3 œÄ x 2 x 1 3 c r where a 2 c r a e exp b e 1 b e 2 x 3 b e 3 and a e f x 1 x 2 b e 1 f x 1 x 2

of the center of gravity from the calm water level downwards positive from formulas a 1 and a 2 it may be concluded that eddy damping could be negative only if c r becomes negative which happens only if a e attains negative values this occurs in case that c b 0 84 hence the proposed adjustment concerns the modification of one of the components of a e according to the following formula a 3 a e n e

22777,the paper examines the possibilities for using the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc framework in stability assessment and calculation of operational limitations of the river sea ships the level 2 vulnerability assessment procedures for dead ship condition dsc and excessive accelerations ea are used to derive the operational limitations of a typical european inland container vessel in the north sea coastal zone the results are in good agreement with the operational experience in the designated area but provide additional insights into safety of river sea ships that could not have been observed by the classic stability analysis it is shown that the approach used by the sgisc could be successfully applied to river sea ships provided that appropriate modifications of the criteria are introduced keywords river sea ships second generation intact stability criteria operational limitations dead ship condition excessive accelerations 1 introduction the river sea ships are primarily inland vessels which are supposed to make short sea trips in coastal zones on a regular basis provided that certain technical and environmental conditions are met such vessels are in operation in coastal areas of france belgium russia india china etc a particular concept of operational limitations is very well known in the river sea navigation the existing regulations limit operation of river sea ships in seaway by taking into account ship stability seakeeping criteria and hull strength the operational limitations of river sea ships imposed by such regulations are typically related to wave height however a common international regulatory framework for river sea ships does not exist not even at european level instead national regulations and classification rules employing very dissimilar approaches are being used throughout the world see baƒçkalov 2012 and chatelier et al 2017 such regulations being location specific are inevitably semi empirical and tailored so as to take into account the design features of typical ships used in the designated navigation area as well as the particular operational experience with such ships in other words the regulations successfully applied in one coastal zone may not be appropriate for different ships sailing in another area on the other hand the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc framework foresees the introduction of operational limitations ol which could be regarded as limitations on the overall operability of the vessel in specific loading conditions baƒçkalov et al 2016 at the time when the research presented in this paper was conducted there was no precise definition of operational limitations but there was a general agreement that ol could be developed using either vulnerability assessment level 2 l2 or direct stability assessment imo 2016a it should be noted that some clarifications in this respect as well as more detailed procedures for calculation of operational limitations were recently provided see imo 2018a imo 2018b furthermore considering that the river sea ships are unconventional both in terms of design and operation the sgisc could represent a suitable option for stability assessment of such vessels therefore the present paper explores the possibilities for using the sgisc framework as a basis for a coherent approach to calculation of operational limitations of river sea ships independent of their area specific design features and in line with the current developments of ship stability criteria 2 sample ship the present investigation is conducted on a typical european inland container vessel sailing along the belgian shoreline in the southern north sea coastal zone the main particulars of the ship corresponding to the design draught are given in table 1 it should be noted that such vessel is normally not equipped with bilge keels which is why both the vessel without bilge keels and with virtually added bilge keels is examined the natural roll period of the sample ship is determined using the formula prescribed by the weather criterion see imo 2008 the body plan of the vessel is presented in fig 1 the cross sections are equally spaced at 500 mm distance whereby 0 represents the aftmost station the ship has a single box shaped cargo hold without hatch covers when passing below bridges the wheelhouse has to be lowered whereas in regular sailing conditions the wheelhouse has to be positioned sufficiently high in order to fulfil the visibility requirements set forth by the regulations therefore as is often the case with inland vessels the sample ship has a hydraulically operated retractable wheelhouse when fully loaded the ship carries 192 teus in four tiers four rows and 12 bays 3 issues in application of the sgisc framework to river sea ships the operational limitations are calculated taking into account stability failure modes relevant for the examined river sea ship due to low froude numbers at which they operate the river sea ships are not vulnerable to surf riding and broaching considering the hull form features of the typical river sea ships the large variations of the righting arm in longitudinal waves which could lead to parametric roll or pure loss of stability are not to be expected either it should be noted that most of the existing safety regulations for river sea ships require assessment of stability in beam wind and waves i e in the weather criterion scenario and that some regulations pay particular attention to the level of lateral accelerations for instance according to the rules of the russian river register rrr the navigation area of the river sea ships is determined by the so called acceleration criterion which requires verification of lateral accelerations and imposes 0 3g where g 9 81 m s2 as the limiting value see russian river register 2015 in fact the concept of excessive accelerations has been long known in the rrr regulations for the river sea ships see lesyukov 1974 from the point of view of the sgisc the draft regulations for excessive accelerations vulnerability assessment imo 2016b imo 2018a foresee that the stability of a ship should be checked with respect to this stability failure mode in case that the distance from the waterline to the highest location along the length of the ship where passengers or crew may be present exceeds 70 of the breadth of the ship and the metacentric height exceeds 8 of the breadth of the ship both conditions are satisfied for the examined ship at design draught given that the helmsman position in the wheelhouse is around 10 m above the waterline 88 of the ship s breadth while the realistic metacentric heights are in range of 15 26 of the ship s breadth therefore the focus of the present investigation is on the large amplitudes of roll that could be attained in beam wind and waves i e in the dead ship condition and on excessive lateral accelerations in beam seas the vulnerability to these two stability failure modes is assessed by calculating the dead ship stability failure index ci and the exceedance index ei respectively in order to derive the ci and the ei for the sample ship the sgisc formulas and procedures were used as far as it was possible however this was not a straightforward process due to a range of issues related to both the design and the operational features of the river sea ships the issues encountered in application of the sgisc to river sea ships are herein discussed 3 1 roll damping of river sea ships within the sgisc framework the use of simplified ikeda s method for roll damping assessment is recommended in absence of either experimental data or another more suitable method such approach would also apply to inland vessels for which the available experimental data are scarce and unreliable on the other hand the sample ship falls out of scope of application of the simplified ikeda s method due to high values of beam to draught ratio b d block coefficient c b and mid ship coefficient c m in addition og d values where og is the distance of the center of gravity from the calm water level may also be out of range of method application in general this holds for almost all inland vessels the applicability of simplified ikeda s method on inland vessels was the subject of the study by rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 where an adjustment of the eddy making damping component was proposed in order to deal with the inconsistencies in roll damping prediction that arise at c b 0 74 thus in the present paper the simplified ikeda s method with the eddy damping component modification as proposed by rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 was adopted adjustment of the simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component is briefly explained in appendix a nevertheless the problem of appropriate roll damping assessment of river sea ships is not completely resolved and deserves more attention 3 2 wind and wave climate the sgisc define the standard or reference environmental conditions that ought to be applied in stability assessment but make provisions for using alternative environmental conditions that is other data that are deemed to be more appropriate in the case of restricted navigation or operational limitations see imo 2016c imo 2018a for the purposes of the present analysis use was made of the available wind and wave measurements in the belgian coastal zone see chatelier et al 2017 the wave scatter diagram is given in appendix b to this paper furthermore for the purposes of this paper the following relation between the mean wind speed u w and significant wave height h s was established based on the measurements given by chatelier et al 2017 1 u w 11 75 h s 0 375 in fig 2 equation 1 is compared to the wind wave relation as given in the draft vulnerability criteria of level 2 for the dead ship condition stability failure mode imo 2015 it may be noticed that the same significant wave height in the coastal zone is associated with stronger winds than in the open sea the jonswap wave spectrum was adopted as the alternative to the standard spectrum foreseen by vulnerability criteria imo 2015 the use of jonswap spectrum has proved to be successful when addressing the north sea coastal environment see van essen and peters 2017 chatelier et al 2017 and verwaest et al 2008 3 3 applicability of standards and acceptable thresholds the subject of the relevant stability failures and acceptable probability of their occurrence is probably the most delicate issue in this analysis for inland container vessels which do not have hatch covers the critical stability failure is usually the heeling to the angle of submergence of the hatch coaming thus in such cases the dead ship stability failure index which according to imo 2018a could be regarded as the long term probability index calculated as weighted average of the short term measure of the probability that the ship will exceed a specified heel angle at least once in the considered exposure time is actually the index of flooding of unprotected cargo hold concerning the limiting value of ci within the sgisc framework acceptable safety level for the dead ship condition has been sought upon the grounds of consistency between the vulnerability levels 1 and 2 see umeda and francescutto 2016 in that case the severe wind and rolling criterion weather criterion as given in intact stability is code part a 2 3 imo 2008 but with the modified wave steepness factor s forms the vulnerability level 1 since the final value of ci was still not adopted at the time when the investigation presented in this paper was carried out 0 04 and 0 06 were discussed as possible thresholds it should be noted that this dilemma was only recently resolved see imo 2018a it was already pointed out that the existing safety regulations for river sea ships contain mandatory assessment of dynamic stability which follows the concept of the is code weather criterion see baƒçkalov 2012 nevertheless although the scenario of these weather criteria is for the most part the same as in the is code some specific aspects such as wind pressure resonant roll amplitude assessment etc may differ moreover the weather criteria used are not uniform across the regulations for river sea ships this is not surprising because the rules are area specific therefore establishing the acceptable dead ship stability failure index of river sea ships based on consistency of two vulnerability levels could be a challenging task with respect to excessive accelerations presently the proposed l2 standard is derived based on the chicago express accident during which lateral accelerations in the wheelhouse attained 1g bsu 2009 the long term attained exceedance index which according to imo 2018a could be regarded as the long term probability index calculated as weighted average of the short term measure of the probability that the ship will exceed a specified lateral acceleration calculated for chicago express in the loading condition at the time of accident is ei 1 094 10 4 see imo 2016b although the same standards and thresholds proposed for the seagoing ships in imo 2016b and imo 2016c may not be applicable to inland vessels in maritime operations ci 0 04 and ei 1 10 4 are maintained in the current investigation their influence on the outcome of the study will be also the subject of the analysis 3 4 other issues some other practical issues may also arise in application of the sgisc framework to the river sea ships for instance the estimation of the natural roll period of the sample ship depends on the roll radius of gyration which is presently calculated using the formula prescribed by the weather criterion see imo 2008 and developed for the seagoing ships similarly the effective wave slope function is calculated using the standard methodology as given in the draft explanatory notes imo 2016c although the suitability of this method for inland vessels is yet to be ascertained 4 discussion of results the dead ship stability failure index ci and exceedance index ei of the sample ship are determined as weighted averages of short term indices ci s and ei s which are calculated for each sea state in the wave scatter diagram 2 c i i 1 n w i c i s i 3 e i i 1 n w i e i s i where w i represents the probability of occurrence of a sea state it is considered that the procedures for calculation of ci and ei are well described in explanatory notes imo 2016c and imo 2016b and therefore need not to be reproduced here the calculations are carried out for the complete scatter diagram up to h s 3 6 m as well as for the scatter diagram limited by the following wave heights 3 0 m 2 5 m 2 0 m 1 5 m 1 0 m and 0 5 m whenever the wave height limitation is introduced the wave scatter diagram is re normalized in such way that the total probability of occurrence of sea states is equal to 1 both ci and ei are calculated for a series of metacentric heights the goal is to determine a range of loading conditions for which both ci and ei are below the limiting values in navigation up to a given significant wave height for instance if indices ci and ei calculated for the examined ship in a given loading condition do not exceed critical levels in waves up to h s 3 6 m then the navigation in the designated area would be unrestricted in the loading case considered on the other hand if either ci or ei are above the threshold values in e g waves up to h s 2 m the navigation should not be permitted in the given loading condition if this significant wave height is exceeded the efficiency of the following options for improvement of operability of river sea ships is examined the addition of bilge keels as a cost effective design measure as well as the lowering of metacentric height and the reduction of the draught as possible operational measures in sea voyages 4 1 the influence of bilge keels as inland vessels typically do not have bilge keels ci and ei are calculated for the sample vessel both without and with bilge keels the results are given in fig 3 6 where each curve corresponds to a limiting significant wave height the shaded areas in the charts correspond to ci 0 04 and ei 1 10 4 the angle of flooding of cargo hold is 21 3 the calculations are performed in range gm 0 3 m whereby it should be noted that the metacentric heights above gm 3 m are virtually unrealistic for loading cases with four container tiers while gm 1 7 m corresponds to a uniform vertical distribution of cargo weight i e a case in which loaded containers have equal weight therefore gm 1 7 m marked in fig 3 6 with a dashed vertical line could be regarded as the minimal metacentric height from the point of view of the conventional loading practice as discussed later in the paper as expected the bilge keels have a positive effect on safety of the sample ship for instance the dead ship stability failure index for gm 1 7 m in waves up to h s 1 5 m decreases from unacceptable ci 1 1 10 1 for the ship without bilge keels fig 3 to acceptable ci 1 1 10 2 for the ship equipped with bilge keels fig 4 the effect of bilge keels on stability of the examined vessel in higher significant wave heights becomes noticeable at lower values of gm such loading cases however deserve to be analysed separately the influence of bilge keels is even more obvious when it comes to excessive accelerations vulnerability assessment in waves up to h s 2 m the ship equipped with bilge keels could be considered as safe from excessive accelerations in the complete range of possible metacentric heights fig 6 within the same range of weather conditions the maximal metacentric height of the ship without bilge keels would be limited to 1 7 m fig 5 the unrestricted service in the area i e in waves up to h s 3 6 m would require that the metacentric height of the ship without bilge keels does not exceed 1 2 m fig 5 which is below the value that could be attained by uniform vertical distribution of cargo weight if the bilge keels are installed however the unrestricted service becomes possible in the complete range of technically attainable metacentric heights fig 6 4 2 the influence of reduced gm the performed analysis indicates that the ol of the vessel could be further expanded by employing an operational measure quite different from the ones anticipated namely fig 3 6 show that the optimal metacentric height from the point of view of ship stability in waves would be in range of gm 0 5 0 8 m these values are far below the usual metacentric heights for inland container vessels of this class loaded with four container tiers and sailing at the design draught indeed the metacentric heights below 1 7 m could not be attained unless heavier containers are loaded atop of lighter ones the very minimal metacentric height that could be achieved by placing heavier containers in top tiers is gm 0 6 m this metacentric height is marked by the full red vertical line in fig 3 6 although such unconventional vertical distribution of cargo contradicts standard loading practices it would be clearly beneficial for the stability of the examined river sea ship in seaway however care should be taken that the structural loads due to such cargo distribution are not dangerously increased the contribution of bilge keels and reduced metacentric heights to safety of the sample ship in sea voyages is evident from the ol given in figs 7 and 8 the shaded areas in the figures represent the range of attainable and acceptable metacentric heights for which both ci and ei are below the adopted safety levels plotted as a function of h s as in fig 3 6 the dashed line corresponds to minimal metacentric height with respect to the usual loading practices gm 1 7 m while full red line represents the minimal metacentric height gm 0 6 m that could be achieved by an un conventional vertical distribution of cargo weight at gm 1 4 m the navigation of the ship equipped with bilge keels would be practically unrestricted in the designated area on the other hand with the same metacentric height the examined vessel without bilge keels could not be considered as safe from the stability point of view if operated with limiting significant wave height greater than h s 1 6 m however if by a proper distribution of container weights the metacentric height is reduced below 1 m the sample ship would have an acceptable average safety level for unlimited operation in the considered area even without bilge keels it should be noted that the operational limitations derived from the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment are in the present case stricter in comparison to the limitations imposed by the excessive accelerations this interesting outcome will be discussed later in more detail 4 3 the influence of reduced draught in some coastal zones draught restrictions are imposed on inland vessels when operating in maritime stretches the vessel is required to sail with the draught which is reduced in comparison to the design draught intended for inland navigation to examine the effectiveness of such operational measure ci and ei are calculated for the sample vessel equipped with bilge keels sailing at d 2 m loaded with four container tiers in this case the angle of flooding of cargo hold is 25 9 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 the dead ship stability failure indices decrease in comparison to the design draught the exceedance indices of lateral accelerations in general decrease as well for any value of gm the ship would be safer from the point of view of stability in seaway at reduced draught than at the design draught however the range of metacentric heights that could be attained by varying vertical distribution of cargo weight changes too to gm 2 8 3 8 m again the lower value in the range is achieved by the uniform distribution of container weight over the tiers within this range of metacentric heights the vessel with four container tiers at d 2 m would be considered as safe in seaway only if operated with limiting h s lower than 1 5 m see fig 9 further reduction of metacentric height is possible only if heavier containers are loaded in top tiers the minimal metacentric height which could be attained in this way is gm 1 8 m full red line in fig 9 11 loading of heavier containers in top tiers could indeed considerably expand the ol of the ship at reduced draught fig 11 nevertheless the ol derived for the examined case show that for limiting h s 2 m the range of acceptable metacentric heights would be rather narrow between Œ¥gm 0 2 m for limiting h s 3 6 m and Œ¥gm 0 5 m for limiting h s 2 m making stability of the vessel susceptible to e g loading errors in order to quantify the effectiveness of the examined design and operational measures some indicators could be introduced the vessel operational limitations index oli could be defined as the ratio of the calculated operational limitations the hatched areas in figs 7 fig 8 figs 11 and 12 and the theoretical maximum of operational limitations gray rectangular area bounded by the range of possible metacentric heights and the range of significant wave heights that occur in the designated region see fig 12 thus it would be oli max 1 in case that the unrestricted service in the specified coastal area would be possible with any technically viable vertical cargo distribution at a given draught if the analyzed vessel sails at d 2 46 m the addition of bilge keels would increase the operational limitations index from oli 0 46 corresponding to ol given in fig 7 to oli 0 64 corresponding to ol given in fig 8 however if the vessel sails at d 2 m then the operational limitations index would decrease to oli 0 5 even with the bilge keels installed see table 2 the position of the centroid of the hatched area with respect to the abscissa of the ol chart x c fig 12 could be used as an additional information on the vessel operational limitations table 2 x c increases if the bilge keels are installed indicating the expansion of operational limitations towards the higher significant wave heights on the other hand x c considerably decreases with the reduction of the draught x c could be also expressed in a dimensionless form x c obtained by normalizing x c with the half of the maximal significant wave height in the wave scatter diagram table 2 consequently in case of unrestricted service in a specified coastal area it would be x c max 1 based on the values of indicators given in table 2 it could be concluded that reduction of draught would not improve the vessel operability in comparison to the navigation at the design draught additionally considering that the payload at d 2 m would be decreased by some 500 t sailing at reduced draught would come at a cost which could not be justified 4 4 the influence of adopted standards and thresholds the results indicate that the lateral accelerations would not present the main limiting factor in operation of the sample ship if the same stability failure i e the lateral acceleration of 1g and related threshold ei 1 10 4 as foreseen by the vulnerability criteria for the seagoing ships given in imo 2016b are adopted for the river sea vessels too indeed in all of the examined cases the maximal metacentric heights calculated using the excessive accelerations vulnerability criterion are greater than the maximal gm values obtained by the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment see figs 7 figs 8 and 11 in other words the excessive accelerations criterion is less stringent than the dead ship condition vulnerability criterion at least for the examined vessel such outcome is somewhat unexpected and in contrast with some regulations e g the russian river register which use the level of estimated lateral accelerations to define the operational limitations of river sea ships this potential inconsistency between the sgisc approach and operational experience with the examined type of vessels highlights the issue of appropriate stability standards and thresholds for river sea ships thus there are two possibilities which should be considered on one hand it is possible that the threshold for dead ship condition stability failure ci 0 04 is too stringent if a higher dead ship stability failure index e g ci 0 06 is applied the dead ship condition would remain the prevailing stability failure for the ship with bilge keels fig 14 however if the ship is not equipped with bilge keels the difference between the two examined vulnerability criteria would be negligible at higher significant wave heights fig 13 in fact it should be noted that ci 0 06 was recently adopted as the threshold for dead ship stability failure of seagoing ships see imo 2018a nevertheless another threshold for excessive accelerations stability failure was simultaneously adopted as well as ei 3 9 10 4 consequently if these thresholds are applied to the examined river sea ship dead ship stability failure would still be the dominant stability failure the effect of eventually adopted thresholds for the seagoing ships on the operational limitations of the analyzed vessel is addressed in figs 15 and 16 on the other hand the question is whether accelerations of 1g could be too high for inland vessels and if a lower more probable and thus more limiting value could be more appropriate namely the effect of lateral accelerations on people onboard is normally related to motion induced interruption mii i e sliding and tipping events in the wheelhouse such events could be prevented or diminished by design measures that is by appropriate bridge ergonomics including sufficient number and a proper arrangement of handhelds however european technical standards for inland vessels cesni 2015 do not contain particular requirements for bridge ergonomics that would address the safety of crew due to mii on the other hand as baƒçkalov et al 2016 emphasized the safety cannot be achieved by design measures only in fact the safety by design is complemented by skills knowledge appropriate training and experience of master and crew which is often referred to as prudent seamanship the question is however whether masters and crews of inland vessels which spend just a fraction of sailing time at sea have a level of prudent seamanship sufficient to compensate for inadequate design in addition increased physical efforts required to maintain the posture due to vessel motion could lead to mental fatigue decreased attention and cognitive performance of the crew therefore it seems that neither suitable design nor appropriate operational safety measures are in place that would justify the same critical level of lateral accelerations as on the seagoing ships 5 conclusions the present paper investigated the use of the second generation intact stability criteria framework in calculation of operational limitations of river sea ships from the stability point of view the paper is an updated and revised version of the original research presented at the 13th international conference on stability of ships and ocean vehicles stab2018 the river sea ships are actually vessels intended for navigation on inland waterways and suitable for restricted navigation at sea chatelier et al 2017 as such the river sea ships in general do not comply with the major international safety regulations such as solas and icll consequently the river sea ships are unconventional from the design point of view with respect to the typical hull forms main dimensions and their ratios and compliance of the design with the maritime safety regulations furthermore the river sea ships are unconventional from the operational point of view as well with respect to the very notion of inland vessels sailing at sea and prudent seamanship of their crews hence the authors believe that the safety assessment of inland vessels in maritime operations should be performed by methods taking into account as far as practicable ship dynamics in realistic weather conditions it is considered that a necessary balance of complexity of calculations and accuracy of physical modelling is achieved by the vulnerability assessment level 2 of the second generation intact stability criteria however the application of the sgisc to the river sea ships requires some modifications related to roll damping assessment the use of location specific environmental conditions estimation of natural roll period etc although the present analysis is performed on one sample vessel only in a specific navigation area the outlined approach along with the dilemmas related to its use apply to river sea ships in general the results of the analysis are generally in good agreement with the operational experience in the southern north sea coastal zone where the river sea ships nowadays operate in h s 1 6 2 m as expected a modest modification of the hull such as addition of bilge keels proved to be beneficial for the safety of the vessel however it was demonstrated that the draught reduction which is sometimes imposed as an operational safety measure would not expand the operational limitations of the vessel in realistic loading conditions furthermore it was shown that an unconventional vertical distribution of cargo weight i e loading of heavier containers in top tiers resulting in lower metacentric heights would have a positive effect on the behavior of the examined vessel in seaway from a stability perspective it should be emphasized that such results could not have been obtained by means of classic ship stability analysis which is used in many existing regulations for river sea ships the analysis indicated that the main limiting factor in operation of the sample ship from the ship stability point of view would be the large amplitudes of roll attained in beam wind and waves that is the dead ship condition vulnerability assessment would be the prevailing stability criterion this outcome is the consequence of adopted stability failures and thresholds which were developed for the purposes of stability assessment of seagoing ships the critical stability failures and levels of corresponding indices that would be adequate for stability assessment of the river sea ships need to be further investigated from the point of view of implementation in the regulatory framework the examined approach could be classified as a pre computation and approval in the design stage option for preparation of ol see the proposal for guidelines for the preparation and approval of operational limitations imo 2017 a relatively large number of calculations that ought to be performed for a series of relevant loading cases and draughts could be a potential drawback of the approach additionally unlike for seagoing ships the verification of container mass prior to loading is still not mandatory for inland vessels therefore there are uncertainties related to vertical center of gravity and natural roll period in a given loading condition affecting the accuracy of stability assessment notwithstanding these practical yet solvable difficulties the authors believe that the second generation intact stability criteria could be a promising solution for a common approach to assessment of operational limitations of river sea ships acknowledments the paper is part of the project development of next generation of safe efficient ecological se eco ships executed by department of naval architecture faculty of mechanical engineering university of belgrade the project is partly financed by ministry of education science and technology development of republic of serbia contract no tr35009 the authors would like to thank professor milan hofman university of belgrade for valuable suggestions and comments in course of the study furthermore the authors would like to express their gratitude to the organizers of the 13th international conference on stability of ships and ocean vehicles stab 2018 kobe japan for the opportunity to present the original version of this work appendix a adjustment of the simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component typically european inland vessels have full hull forms with values of block coefficient in range c b 0 82 0 94 when applying the simplified ikeda s method to inland vessels it was noticed that inconsistencies in roll damping prediction may arise at c b 0 74 it was found that these inconsistencies are to be attributed to eddy damping component which in some cases may even attain negative values even though the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability i e c b 0 85 therefore rudakoviƒá and baƒçkalov 2017 proposed the modification of eddy damping component based on results obtained by classic ikeda s method applied to four inland vessels c b 0 798 0 851 and two seagoing ships c b 0 843 and c b 0 798 according to simplified ikeda s method eddy damping component is calculated as a 1 b ÀÜ e 4 œâ ÀÜ œï a 3 œÄ x 2 x 1 3 c r where a 2 c r a e exp b e 1 b e 2 x 3 b e 3 and a e f x 1 x 2 b e 1 f x 1 x 2 x 4 b e 2 f x 2 x 4 b e 3 f x 1 x 2 while x 1 b d x 2 c b x 3 c m x 4 o g d where b is ship breadth d is ship draught c b is block coefficient c m is midship section coefficient and og is the distance of the center of gravity from the calm water level downwards positive from formulas a 1 and a 2 it may be concluded that eddy damping could be negative only if c r becomes negative which happens only if a e attains negative values this occurs in case that c b 0 84 hence the proposed adjustment concerns the modification of one of the components of a e according to the following formula a 3 a e n e

22778,this paper presents comparisons between a non hydrostatic free surface model and openfoam for predicting wave structure interactions the non hydrostatic model solves the incompressible euler equations by the use of an explicit projection method and treats free surface elevations as a single valued function of the horizontal position the immersed boundary method is incorporated in the model to deal with structures three test cases related to wave interactions with a fixed floating structure or a submerged structure are considered in the comparison very good agreement between the results from the two models is obtained in terms of free surface elevations and wave forces demonstrating that the presented non hydrostatic model is comparable to the openfoam in wave structure interactions involving single valued free surface flows keywords wave structure interactions non hydrostatic model immersed boundary method openfoam 1 introduction wave structure interaction has been an important issue in the community of ocean engineering for structural design and safety assessment it is of considerable interest for researchers and designers to present accurate predictions of wave transmission and reflection induced by structures or wave forces exerted on structures it is therefore necessary to develop numerical models that are capable of predicting interaction between waves and structures there are mainly two groups of numerical models for wave structure interaction namely potential flow models ma and yan 2009 liu et al 2009 and navier stokes equations nse based models hayatdavoodi et al 2015 higuera et al 2013 2014 hu et al 2016 seiffert et al 2014 potential flow models cannot well resolve velocity fields around structures because it is derived under the assumption of irrotational motion and vortex often occurs during wave interactions with structures with the improvement of computing power numerical models based on euler equations or nse attract more attention openfoam is one of such numerical models it is an open source software and employs the vof method to track the free surface flow open c f d 2012 at present openfoam is widely applied in the study of wave structure interactions hayatdavoodi et al 2015 higuera et al 2013 2014 hu et al 2016 seiffert et al 2014 in addition another option for predicting wave structure interactions is to use an incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph model gui et al 2015 liu et al 2014 which solves nse in lagrangian form non hydrostatic models are also based on euler equations or nse but it treat the free surface elevation as a single valued function of horizontal position with the use of a free surface equation to track the moving water surface non hydrostatic models are relatively computationally efficient the development of non hydrostatic models has been more than two decades nowadays it is widely used in the predictions of short surface waves ai et al 2014 ai and jin 2012 ai

referred to bai and cheung 2015 2018 and bai et al 2018 in contrast to openfoam a non hydrostatic model is more computationally efficient because it only considers a single phase flow water and employs a free surface equation to determine the free surface as a result a non hydrostatic model cannot deal with overturning flows however comparisons between non hydrostatic models and openfoam are rare to access the reliability of non hydrostatic models in the present study we will present an in house non hydrostatic model to simulate wave structure interactions and compare the developed model with openfoam the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the non hydrostatic model and openfoam are presented in section 2 then simulations of several test cases are conducted and results from the two models are presented in section 3 finally conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 numerical models in this section the two numerical models for wave structure interactions namely non hydrostatic model and openfoam are introduced 2 1 non hydrostatic model in a non hydrostatic model the free surface flow is governed by the following incompressible euler equations 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 œÅ w p where t is the time u u v w t is the velocity vector p is the pressure and œÅ w denotes the water density the free surface is determined by integrating the continuity equation 1 over water depth and using kinematic conditions at the free surface and bottom 3 Œ∑ t h h x y Œ∑ x y t v d z 0 where h is the horizontal divergence operator v is the horizontal velocity vector with components u v Œ∑ x y t is the free surface elevation and z h x y is the bottom surface the overall numerical algorithm for the non hydrostatic model consists of the following two steps the first step is to solve the euler equations by using an explicit projection method which is subdivided into two stages ai and jin 2010 the first stage is to project intermediate velocities by means of solving the momentum equations that contain the non hydrostatic pressure at the previous time level in this stage to get a momentum conservative scheme in the discretization of the advection terms the governing equations 1 and 2 are firstly integrated over a vertical layer then the resulting momentum equations in question are obtained by subtracting the integrated continuity equation from the integrated momentum equations finally a finite volume method with a combination of first order upwind scheme and second order central differencing scheme is used to discretize the advection terms of the momentum equations in the second stage the new velocities are computed by correcting the projected values after including the non hydrostatic pressure terms which are obtained by solving the discretized poisson equation in the second step by substituting the resulting velocities into the discretized form of the free surface equation 3 we can obtain the new free surface elevation to generate waves in the non hydrostatic model theoretical wave velocities need to be specified at the inflow boundary to weaken wave reflection a sponge layer technique is employed in the non hydrostatic model the immersed boundary method is adopted to deal with various types of structures in this method a solid body in a flow field is removed from the computation domain and replaced by immersed boundary forces imposed f ib on its boundary this force is defined as dirac delta function and only has a non zero value at the solid boundary the discrete function of f ib can be written as 4 f i b u i n 1 u i n 1 2 Œ¥ t 1 œÅ w n 1 p i n 1 x i on or near the solid boundary 0 elsewhere in eq 4 the virtual ib velocity u i n 1 is employed to enforce no slip boundary conditions at solid boundary to obtain the virtual fore term the virtual ib velocity which is closest to the solid node should be solved first in general interpolation is required to obtain these value in this study we use linear approximation which is mentioned in fadlun et al 2000 to interpolate the ib velocities the virtual ib velocities in fig 1 can be obtained using following linear approximation 5 u i 1 2 j k n 1 Œ¥ x Œ¥ x i Œ¥ x u i 1 2 j k n 1 2 6 w i 1 j k 1 n 1 Œ¥ z Œ¥ z k 2 Œ¥ z w i 1 j k 2 n 1 2 therefore the ib method allows for the reconstruction of complex structures without the use of boundary fitted meshes details about the immersed boundary method can be referred to fadlun et al 2000 2 2 openfoam interfoam solver in openfoam is adopted to predict wave structure interactions here in the interfoam solver both air and water are assumed to be incompressible the continuity equation is very identical to eq 1 used in the non hydrostatic model the momentum equation needs to consider different fluids and is written as follows 7 œÅ u t œÅ u u p where œÅ is the density in openfoam free surfaces are tracked by the vof interface capturing method in which density is determined as follows 8 œÅ Œ± œÅ w 1 Œ± œÅ a where Œ± is the indicator phase function and œÅ a denotes the air density the calculation of Œ± can be found in rusche 2002 and is not provided for brevity the governing equations employed in openfoam are discretized with finite volume method the velocity convection term is discretized by using the upwind scheme the toolbox named waves2foam open c f d 2012 is used to generate incident waves the relaxation zone is used to absorb waves at the outflow boundary in openfoam blockmesh generator open c f d 2012 is employed to generate the mesh covering the computational domain in which the structure is not included 3 numerical results 3 1 solitary wave interacting with a fixed rectangular obstacle the first test designed by lin 2006 concerns interactions between a solitary wave and a fixed floating structure in the test the still water depth is h 1 0 m and the incoming solitary wave has a wave height h 0 0 1 m the computational domain in the x direction ranges from 0 m to 100 m a rectangular obstacle with dimensions of 5 0 m 0 6 m floats on the top of the water the center of the obstacle is located at 32 5 m 0 9 m a schematic diagram showing a solitary wave past the rectangular obstacle is depicted in fig 2 in this computation both the non hydrostatic model and openfoam employ the horizontal grid spacing Œ¥ x 0 1 m and the vertical grid spacing Œ¥ z 0 025 m to discretize the computational domain comparisons of time histories of the free surface elevation at x 1 m and 59 m between the non hydrostatic model and openfoam are shown in fig 3 at the first gauging point x 1 m the incident solitary wave and the reflected wave are recorded at the other gauging point x 59 m the transmitted wave with reduced height is observed it is found that the non hydrostatic model results are in good agreement with the openfoam results fig 4 shows comparisons of time histories of the horizontal and vertical forces exerted on the obstacle although the non hydrostatic model slightly overpredicts the horizontal maximum positive and maximum negative forces the results of the two models fit well for both the horizontal and vertical forces fig 5 shows non hydrostatic model results of the vortex development during the interaction process it can be seen that a small vortex first forms near the bottom left of the obstacle and then the other vortex is generated behind it both vortices always persist after their generation during the simulation time of 40 s 3 2 solitary wave interacting with a submerged horizontal plate in this example we consider a non breaking solitary wave propagation through a submerged horizontal plate measured data from the experiment of lo and liu 2014 are used for comparison based on the experimental setup the wave flume is 11 m long with the still water depth h 0 2 m a thin plate of length l 1 156 m and thickness Œ¥ 0 01 m is placed with the submerged depth measured from the top of the plate to the still water surface of d 0 05 m as shown in fig 6 the incoming solitary wave has a wave height h 0 04 m with h d 0 8 where nonlinear effects becomes significant it is should be noted that wave breaking above the plate was observed in which h d 0 8 in this computation a grid of Œ¥ x 0 004 m and Œ¥ z 0 002 m is used for the both models fig 7 shows comparisons of water surface elevations between two sets of numerical results and experimental data t t 0 is consistently defined as time when the wave crest passed the second gauge location x 4 1 m the measured profiles are very well captured by the present non hydrostatic model and openfoam as propagation distance increases the predicted results of the non hydrostatic model are slightly better than openfoam in wave phase as shown in fig 7 d which is mainly due to the fact that openfoam slightly underestimates the wave crest at the first gauge location x 3 525 m fig 8 and fig 9 present the comparisons of pressures on the top of and beneath the plate respectively it is noticeable that both numerical models overestimate the maximum pressure on the top of the plate at different locations see fig 8 and underestimates the maximum pressure beneath the plate see fig 9 despite of the discrepancy the overall trend of the both models is highly consistent with the experimental data this discrepancy may be due to boundary layer effects and relatively low resolution and sensitivity of the pressure sensors lo and liu 2014 fig 10 shows comparisons of the net vertical force normalized by f s œÅ w g h l on the plate between the two sets of numerical results and the experimental data both simulation results are very similar in terms of maximum positive and negative forces however the numerical results apparently overestimate the maximum negative force 3 3 cnoidal waves interacting with a submerged horizontal plate in the final example we focus on the performance of the present non hydrostatic model and openfoam in the case of cnoidal waves travelling over a submerged horizontal plate the experimental data provided by hayatdavoodi et al 2015 is used for comparison in this test the wave flume has a length 7 0 m with the still water depth h 0 071 m the ratio of wave height and water depth is about h h 0 3 the horizontal plate has its length b 0 0305 m width l p 0 0149 m and thickness t p 0 0127 m submerged depth of the plate is d 0 05 m measured from the top of the plate to the still water surface wave gauges are placed two plate lengths wg1 and one plate length wg2 upward of the leading edge of the plate respectively and two plate widths downward of the trailing edge of the plate wg3 as shown in fig 11 in the computation with the non hydrostatic model the horizontal grid spacing of Œ¥ x 0 005 m and the vertical grid spacing of Œ¥ z 0 0025 m are used the openfoam results published in hayatdavoodi et al 2015 are employed for comparison it is worth mentioning that the openfoam results were obtained by a more refined grid fig 12 presents comparisons of surface elevations and dimensionless forces in the horizontal and vertical directions the two dimensional forces are scaled by 9 f x f h œÅ w gh t p l p 10 f z f v œÅ w gh 2 l p where f h and f v stand for horizontal and vertical forces respectively the present non hydrostatic model results agree well with the openfoam results in terms of the surface elevations and wave forces both model results show good agreements with the measured surface elevation and vertical wave force however the horizontal wave force is underestimated by the both models 4 conclusions this paper presents preliminary comparisons between an in house non hydrostatic model and openfoam for wave structure interactions it is found that the two models show very good agreement in terms of free surface elevations and wave forces exerted on structures therefore it can be concluded that the non hydrostatic model is comparable to the openfoam in the wave structure interactions involving single valued free surface flows moreover the non hydrostatic model also can predict vortex related velocity fields around structures because only two dimensional vertical test cases were considered in this study the advantage of non hydrostatic model in computational efficiency is not very remarkable in the future work we will conduct comparisons of three dimensional wave structure interactions between the non hydrostatic model and openfoam in terms of accuracy and efficiency acknowledgements this research is supported financially by the national nature science foundation grant no 51679031

interactions involving single valued free surface flows keywords wave structure interactions non hydrostatic model immersed boundary method openfoam 1 introduction wave structure interaction has been an important issue in the community of ocean engineering for structural design and safety assessment it is of considerable interest for researchers and designers to present accurate predictions of wave transmission and reflection induced by structures or wave forces exerted on structures it is therefore necessary to develop numerical models that are capable of predicting interaction between waves and structures there are mainly two groups of numerical models for wave structure interaction namely potential flow models ma and yan 2009 liu et al 2009 and navier stokes equations nse based models hayatdavoodi et al 2015 higuera et al 2013 2014 hu et al 2016 seiffert et al 2014 potential flow models cannot well resolve velocity fields around structures because it is derived under the assumption of irrotational motion and vortex often occurs during wave interactions with structures with the improvement of computing power numerical models based on euler equations or nse attract more attention openfoam is one of such numerical models it is an open source software and employs the vof method to track the free surface flow open c f d 2012 at present openfoam is widely applied in the study of wave structure interactions hayatdavoodi et al 2015 higuera et al 2013 2014 hu et al 2016 seiffert et al 2014 in addition another option for predicting wave structure interactions is to use an incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph model gui et al 2015 liu et al 2014 which solves nse in lagrangian form non hydrostatic models are also based on euler equations or nse but it

22779,an innovative floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf has recently been proposed the facility consists of several modular floating hydrocarbon storage tanks fhsts surrounded by floating barges with compliant mooring system hydrodynamic loads on the fhst and its dynamic response are important for the global design to validate the concept of the single fhst model tests at 1 48 7 scale is performed in the coastal basin in national university of singapore two models of single fhst with different bottom slab shapes are tested one of which has bottom skirts the mooring fenders to support the model were mimicked by a flexible beam system fresh water is used to fill the tank at different filling ratios decay tests regular wave tests and irregular wave tests under design sea states are performed the rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom and the sum fender reaction forces were measured numerical model of the single fhst is established and analyzed in frequency domain and time domain the effect of the bottom skirt internal liquid and the fender system were considered viscous damping is calculated based on the empirical formula and adjusted by comparing with measured results numerical results are comparative to the experimental results this paper shows the motions of the tested fhsts are mild even in the 100 year storm and the bottom skirts effectively reduce the hydrodynamic responses keywords hydrodynamic responses very large floating structure hydrocarbon storage tank model test 1 introduction in recent years the demand for developable land around coastal countries such as japan and singapore has increased significantly for residential purposes as well as industrial and logistics uses in addition with the sea level increase due to climate change these countries have to face the potential risk of losing land area in the coming decades one feasible option is to reclaim the land from the sea nevertheless the cost of land reclamation in deeper waters are more expensive and time consuming land reclamation may also introduce irreversible influence on the ecosystem and be limited by the territorial boundary in this case very large floating structure vlfs can provide eco friendly flexible and economical solution there have been various types of vlfs constructed or proposed worldwide for many different applications for instance the mega float project in japan watanabe et al 2004 the very large offshore aquaculture floating structures proposed by sulaiman et al 2013 the floating bridges in e39 projects in norway eidem 2017 and many other applications on floating breakwaters dai et al 2018 in singapore constructing a large floating structure is feasible because of the benign sea state conditions a successful application of a floating structure in singapore is the floating platform in marina bay wang and tay 2011 there can be many other potential applications for large floating structure in singapore such as floating fuel storage facilities floating lng regasification facilities floating cities etc as singapore locates nearby the busiest shipping strait there is a huge demand for the oil storage facilities which can occupy a considerable land area recently an innovative concept on the floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf has been developed by the joint research team from the national university of singapore nus and sintef ocean norway sponsored by l2nic directorate and jtc corporation singapore the preliminary conceptual design of the system was briefly introduced in wan et al 2018 while the updated conceptual design of the fhsf is shown in fig 1 a the concept is inspired by the successful application of two floating fuel storage facilities in japan which locate at the shirashima island and kamigoto island as shown in fig 2 a and 2 b respectively the novel fhsf concept was proposed to be at modular design aiming at the storage of different types of oil product and bring down the construction cost by modular design the facility can be easily scaled up or down according to the customer s needs for such a complicated soft connected multibody system there are challenges to investigate the whole concept in terms of hydrodynamic analysis which involves sloshing multi body interactions hydro elasticity etc which has pushed current numerical model to its boundaries in this case the hydrodynamic investigation starts from the single fhst a well designed fhst will contribute to the reduction of the hydrodynamic responses of the complete system in the initial stage a double hull concept was investigated numerically by wan et al 2018 the results show a good performance of the structure for a totally new conceptual design an experimental study is usually important for the verification work as pointed out by faltinsen 1993 a series of model tests have been designed and performed in the coastal basin of the hydraulic lab in nus for the single fhst under various environmental conditions in these tests a single fhst is supported by special designed mooring fender system the details on the mooring fender system and its behavior are investigated numerically by wan et al 2018 and han et al 2017 based on the preliminary concept while zhang et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic responses of a single fhst supported by fenders by means of experiment in this paper the latest conceptual design is introduced firstly in part 2 the detailed setup of the model test is introduced in part 3 and part 4 and the model test matrix is presented in part 5 the numerical model including the description of the bottom skirt linear sloshing model and the fender model is provided in part 6 the results from the experiments are compared with the numerical results in part 7 followed by the uncertainty analysis in part 8 finally the conclusions and the future work are summarized 2 concept description the overall dimensions of the entire fhsf system are around 300 m long by 310 m wide with a total storage capacity of 300 000 m3 the entire fhsf is composed of the floating hydrocarbon storage tanks fhsts and the floating barges there are two types of fhst proposed in the design small tank with a storage capacity from 5000 m3 to 15000 m3 and large tank with a storage capacity from 30 000 m3 to 35 000m3s as shown in fig 1 b the small fhst is composed of a central cylinder named as the central tank for hydrocarbon storage and 4 side cylinders called floaters which provide extra buoyancy and increase the hydrostatic stability as well as protect the central tank the large fhst has a similar design but with an octagonal outer shape and 8 cylindrical floaters the fhsts are single hull structures made of concrete to ensure a 60 year design life one advantage of the single hull design is the hydrostatic pressure inside and outside of the tank can balance with each other thus can reduce the wall thickness the fhsts will be restrained by the mooring system such as mooring fenders or mooring hawsers and the mooring system will be connected to the floating barges in addition to provide anchor points the other functions of these barges include protection on the fhsts against potential ship collision working as a breakwater and supporting the pipelines and daily operational access the floating barges are also made of concrete but the wave bending may cause a problem for the very flat wide concrete structure which has a length at around 310 m and a depth of around 6 8 m thus the barge is also proposed to employ modular design and the modules will be connected through flexible connectors these softer connectors are expected to reduce the sectional bending moments on the barges and the stress on the deck and bottom significantly the floating barges will be restrained by mooring dolphins connected to the seafloor and the horizontal motion of the entire floating barges will be restrained the entire system will be free floating in the vertical direction which is effective in dealing with tidal influence although the system is designed for shielded coastal water the concept can be extended to other applications in open sea it can also be extended for other different purposes with minor modifications thus it serves as an example for other modular compliant structures 3 fhst models and the test facility the fhst with a storage capacity of 5000 m3 is the prototype model tested in the experiment as it is considered to be easily affected by the environmental conditions among all the different fhsts the prototype is initially proposed to be scaled down by a scale factor of 1 48 7 based on froude scaling law the scaling factors of the main parameters under froude scaling are shown in table 1 for a single fhst its character diameter d is 30 9 m and the h s of the extreme sea state is 1 8 m by assuming h max 2 h s the keulegan carpenter number k c œÄ h max d which reflects the ratio of drag force and gravity force dnvgl 2014 is only around 0 36 it indicates that the drag force is not dominating thus adopting froude scaling is proper in this model test the single fhst tests are all performed in waves only without wind and current and the incident waves come from one direction there are two models designed and tested in the experiments as shown in fig 3 a and b the only difference between them is the bottom slab part called bottom skirts as shown in fig 3 b the idea of adding these bottom skirts is borrowed from the successful application of the heave plates on spars magee 2000 intensive research work done by molin 2011 tao and cai 2004 an and faltinsen 2013 and tian et al 2017 show the effectiveness of the heave plate on increasing the damping and added mass in heave the bottom skirts are also expected to increase the viscous damping on the pitch in the present case similar to the bilge keels on ship however it is a concern that the bottom skirt will also increase the wave excitation force in the shallower draft condition the effects from the bottom skirts should be carefully checked for ease of recognition the model with bottom skirts and its prototype will be denoted as model sq and the other one without bottom skirts will be denoted as model rd respectively the measured dimensions and the mass properties of the two models are presented in table 2 and table 3 due to the manufacture uncertainty some dimensions in model scale do not follow the scale strictly the difference is analyzed in part 8 the radiuses of gyration in table 3 are all with reference to the center of gravity cog and the vertical cog is measured from the lower surface of the bottom slab the mass difference caused by the bottom skirt is only around 8 both models are assembled of transparent acrylic tubes and plates the water tightness is ensured by checking the draft of the model before and during the model tests frequently to ensure the same structural mass and mass distributions the solid ballast was set in the floaters and the internal liquid is simulated by dyed water the volume of the water in the model test is determined by scaling the designed volume of the stored hydrocarbon product down it indicates that the total mass of the model is heavier than the scaled mass of the prototype due to the difference between the density of the fresh water and hydrocarbon product the draft of the model is also larger than the target due to this difference the design drafts of the prototype when storing hydrocarbon product and when storing fresh water of the same volume assumed are listed in table 4 the increase of the drafts is around 2 5 in partially loaded condition and 7 5 for the fully loaded condition for both fhsts the measured draft of the model sq and model rd at different loading conditions are also listed in table 4 the loading condition has been defined as the percentage of the designed storage capacity the model test facility which is the coastal basin is shown in fig 4 a the basin is 25 m long 10 5 m wide effective width 7 5m and its water depth varies from 0 1 m to 0 9 m during the model test the water depth is fixed at 0 369 m which corresponds to the water depth of 18 m in the prototype the 13 unit piston type wavemaker can generate a maximum wave height of 0 3 m and the generated wave periods vary from 0 5 to 3 5 s in model scale there is a passive artificial beach on the other end to absorb the wave energy the model test setup is shown in fig 4 b and c the model locates near the center of the coastal basin which is 11 5 m away from the wave maker and the model test system is supported by a specially designed frame five kenk capacitive wave probes wps were installed in the basin as shown in fig 4 b 8 hbm bending load cells were utilized to measure the forces on the fenders these load cells have an effective measurement range from 0 to 700 n the 6 d o f rigid body motions of the model were captured by the phasespace motion tracking system phasespace 2007 which consists of 4 optical cameras and several led markers the optical cameras are mounted on the frame as shown in fig 4 b while the 4 led markers are installed on the roof of the model the origin of the coordinate system to describe the model motion locates at the center of the water plane on the mean water level the z direction is positive upward the x axis points to the wave maker direction and the y direction follow the right hand rule all the load cells the wave probes and the motion tracking system were calibrated before the model test 4 mooring fender design in the test the mooring fender system is initially proposed as shown in fig 5 a in this system there exist gaps between the fhsts and the fenders as in practice this system was tested at first but it was found from the model test that the yaw motion of the fhst was not well behaved even under moderate environmental conditions due to the existence of free floating scenario where the fhst is not in contact with any fenders thus the fender system is improved by eliminating the gaps in the test the fenders are simulated by a set of assembled flexible aluminum beams as shown in fig 5 b the details of one of the fenders are shown in fig 6 a the flexible beams are articulated to the support frame and the load cells to reduce the friction force while the teflon parts on the end of the flexible beam can reduce the friction force between the model and the beams the reaction force can be measured by the load cell directly with the assumption that the motions of the fhst are not that large and the aluminum beam will not yield the stiffness of the beams can be derived as eq 1 the relationship between the measured force and the hydrodynamic force can be calculated by eq 2 1 k 3 e i l 1 l 2 2 l 2 3 2 f f l 1 l 2 l 1 in which k is the equivalent stiffness e is the young s modulus i is the second moment of area l 1 and l 2 are the lengths of the beam as shown in fig 6 b f and f are the force from fhst to the fender and the reaction force at the load cell support respectively the measured force has the opposite sign as the reaction force the effective stiffnesses of the beams are adjustable by either changing the thickness of the beam or the position of the pin support in this paper the thickness of the beams is chosen as 0 004 m and the width is 0 025 m the theoretical stiffness of the beam is around 875 kn m in full scale which gives the equivalent horizontal stiffness of 1750 kn m the stiffnesses of all the beams were calibrated before the model test and the pullout test gave the relationship between the load cell reading and the applied force at the end the calibration curves and the force relationship between the applied force and the load cell reading are shown in fig 6 c and d the linearity of the beam stiffness is quite good and the calibrated stiffness are close to the theoretical stiffness as designed the uncertainties in these calibration works will be introduced in part 8 5 test matrix the tests carried out in the basin include the inclining test decay test regular wave test and random wave tests the inclining tests are performed firstly to ensure the vertical cog is close to the designed value the static offset tests provide the information on the horizontal stiffness of the system provided by the fenders then the decay tests are performed for the 6 d o f motions in the calm water to identify the damping ratio and the natural period of the system can be identified however the number of peaks in the signal is not enough to accurately determine the damping coefficient as shown in zhang et al 2018 to quantify the viscous damping the decay tests are performed in the numerical simulation the time traces of the motion are then compared to the experimental response regular wave tests are performed to identify the hydrodynamic properties of the single fhst i e the transfer functions of its motions and the loads with the assumption that the waves are linear considering the environmental conditions in the coastal area the period of the generated regular waves varies from 4s to 12s with 1s interval however due to the shallow water in the coastal area the waves include the deep water waves intermediate water waves and shallow water waves to ensure the linearity and the quality of the generated waves the wave steepness is designed to be between 1 100 to 1 20 the test matrix of the regular wave tests is listed in table 5 all the regular wave tests last for 120s in the model tests including the time for ramping up the incident regular waves were calibrated before the model test the sea state with 1 year return period the specific site around singapore has significant wave height hs 1 0 m and peak period tp 5s and the sea state with the 100 year return period has hs 1 8 m and tp 7s the 1 year and 100 year sea states are defined as the maximum operational and extreme environmental conditions for the fhsf respectively the jonswap spectrum is adopted to generate random waves in both sea states with a default peakedness parameter Œ≥ 3 3 the random waves are also calibrated before the model tests considering the capability of the wave maker 1 5 h random wave model tests are performed the test matrix of the irregular wave tests is listed in table 6 one realization of the 100 year waves is shown in fig 7 c the comparison between the spectra the cumulative distribution functions of the generated waves and corresponding theoretical values are shown in fig 7 a and b good agreement with expected results can be found confirming the good quality of the waves in this coastal basin 6 numerical simulations with a properly validated numerical model numerical analysis can be performed to gain insights of the dynamic response of the coupled system for single fhst supported by mooring fender system there exist nonlinear effects in the system for example the frictional forces from the fenders nonlinear fender stiffness and the nonlinear wave excitation forces to handle the involved the nonlinearities a hybrid frequency and time domain analysis is preferred wan et al 2015 the hybrid model is proposed by cummins 1962 as shown in eq 3 for a rigid body with quadratic damping term 3 m a x t d 1 x t d 2 x t x t 0 t h t œÑ x œÑ d œÑ kx t f exc t x x in which x t x t and x t are the 6 d o f motions velocities and accelerations respectively m a and k are the corresponding mass matrix added mass matrix at infinite frequency and restoring matrix respectively f exc is the vector of generalized wave excitation forces d 1 and d 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients the retardation function which expresses the influence of fluid memory effects in the convolution term can be expressed as the following 4 h œÑ 2 œÄ 0 œâ a œâ a sin œâ œÑ d œâ 2 œÄ 0 b œâ b cos œâ œÑ d œâ where a œâ and b œâ is the added mass and damping matrix respectively b denotes the potential damping at infinite frequency which is normally zero for the offshore structure with no forward speed the matrix a b k and the force vector f exc are calculated in the frequency domain in hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 based on three dimensional potential theory results are subsequently imported into simo sintef ocean 2018 which is a time domain simulation code developed by sintef ocean the numerical model is built based on the dimensions scaled back from the dimensions of the physical models in both frequency domain and time domain numerical simulations the linear wave theory is adopted and the second order drift force is calculated based on the newman approximation newman 1974 with the mean drift forces calculated by the far field method which has better accuracy faltinsen 1993 but only the drift motions of the surge sway and yaw can be calculated there is a disputation that newman s approximation should preferably not be used in the shallow water condition stansberg and p√¢kozdi 2009 but as shown later the motions in present case are primarily driven by the first order forces the internal liquid not only has hydrostatic effects but also introduces extra dynamic effects known as sloshing the influence on hydrostatics can be considered by introducing modification on the restoring forces on pitch and roll but the dynamic effects can be a fully nonlinear phenomenon and is difficult to account for especially when wave frequency close to the resonance frequency of internal liquid malenica et al 2003 the sloshing effects will induce additional inertia loads which can be expressed as added mass force in hydrostar the problem in the internal fluid domain and the external fluid domain are solved separately and the extra dissipation is introduced on the inner wall boundary to suppress the near singular spike on added mass one may refer to chen 2004 for more details on solving the internal liquid problem in hydrostar a sensitivity study was carried out in the frequency domain to check the influence of the dissipation effect by comparing to the experimental results the damping ratio is selected as 0 05 an engineering approach of taking sloshing effect into consideration in time domain simulation has also been discussed by jin et al 2017 in frequency domain analysis a small frequency interval of 0 01 rad s is adopted to capture the potential sloshing mode and the time step is 0 01s in time domain analysis to assure numerical convergence the internal liquid is also simulated as fresh water in the numerical model at this stage to keep the same setup as in the experiments the bottom skirts have been introduced in the frequency domain model to find out their effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients both upper and lower surface of the skirt are meshed to ensure the convergence of the numerical analysis the mesh size of the bottom skirt is set to around 0 75 m close to the skirt thickness fig 8 a and b show the meshes used in the frequency domain analysis the fender model is considered in the time domain analysis in the numerical simulation point fenders are assumed and they provide both compressive normal force which is proportional to the compression displacement and the frictional forces normal to the motion direction as described in eq 5 5 f n f r c r e r r n f f Œº f n s s in which f n is the normal force r is the projected distance on the normal direction f r is the force induced by the distance r which is relevant to the stiffness curve of the fender the second term in f n is the damping force relevant to the internal damping coefficient c of the fender and this term is neglected in the numerical model in this paper as the material damping of the flexible aluminum beam in the model test is negligible f f is the frictional force Œº is the direction independent friction coefficient and s is the motion vector of the contact point as there is no available information on the frictional coefficient between teflon and acrylic the coefficient between teflon and steel is adopted instead the coefficient between teflon and steel is 0 04 as suggested by grigoriev et al 1997 as the friction coefficient is negligible so no significant impact on the results are expected the measured pre compression forces on each fender in the experiment are input to the numerical model the stiffness of each fender will be discussed in the uncertainty analysis the viscous effects on pitch and roll motions are considered as quadratic damping in the time domain numerical model the quadratic damping is estimated by the semi empirical formula presented by standing and tramoni as cited in molin 2002 from the model test on a rectangular sectional barge with w t around 5 or 10 6 b q 1 2 œÅ c d w 4 l in which b q is the quadratic damping œÅ is the density of the water w t and l are the breadth draft and length of the structure respectively c d is the damping coefficient which can be tuned by decay tests the fhst has a near rectangular section and in the shallower draft case and its w t is around 5 in the shallower draft case thus the semi empirical formula eq 6 is assumed applicable while the viscous damping in heave surge and sway are assumed in the quadratic form as the drag term in morison s formula dnvgl 2014 on the translational motions one should note the viscous damping is considered based on the empirical form which gives comparable results the estimated damping coefficient of the surge heave and pitch are plotted in table 7 the number of peaks in the decay tests is not enough to determine either the damping coefficient or the natural period thus the viscous damping is tuned based on comparison of the experimental and numerical results from decay test by comparing the time traces of the motion response for different damping values with the measured motion from the decay test the relative damping can be estimated the quadratic damping ratio in regular and irregular waves are further tuned based on the ratios obtained from the decay test in the numerical simulation the damping value is adjusted iteratively to approach comparable variances between the experimental and numerical results the detailed procedure of analysis on the viscous damping are not covered here the procedure adopted in this paper is empirical 7 results and discussion 7 1 results from regular wave tests and comparison with simulations regular wave tests were performed to obtain the response amplitude operators raos of the rigid body motions with the mooring fender system in the empty and partially loaded condition in addition to the rigid body motions the fender forces are summed to obtain the horizontal forces in x and y directions the reaction forces of fender 1 fender 2 fender 5 and fender 6 are summed and denoted as fx the sum reaction forces of fender 3 fender 4 fender 7 fender 8 are denoted as fy in all the figures below the empty and partially loaded condition will be denoted as fl00 and fl20 respectively the rao of the specific response is determined by the amplitude of obtained motion divided by the amplitude of the incident wave at the model position the raos from the numerical simulations are calculated based on the same procedure the amplitudes of the responses and the incident wave are taken as 2 times the standard deviations of the responses and incident waves respectively to ensure the accuracy of the model test results the 10 cycles of responses are determined after the responses approach steady state and before the reflected waves come to the model position 7 1 1 results in empty loaded condition and comparison with simulations for both model sq and model rd the numerical results compare well to the experimental results in surge and heave as shown in fig 9 a and b the surge natural periods of both models are larger than 11s and model sq has a larger natural period which is also caused by the existence of the bottom skirt this influence is even more obvious on heave the natural period of heave is around 7 5s for model rd and it is increased by around 20 to 9s for model sq the significant increase in heave natural period is caused by the additional added mass introduced by the bottom skirts in the wave period range between 5s and 8s which covers the peak period range of the design sea states the reduction in heave rao is very considerable which confirms that the bottom skirts are good for this concept the raos of the sum reaction forces of the fender system fx and fy are plotted in fig 9 d the trend of the raos just follows that of surge rao in other words the sum forces are mainly dominated by the surge motion in both cases fy force is small and negligible the small disturbance can be caused by the unsymmetrical of the initial pre compression forces the comparison between numerical and experimental pitch motion follows the same trend as those for heave and surge despite some difference in the actual values strong pitch surge coupling is found in the raos when the wave period is close to surge natural period pitch rao is also relatively large for example after the first peak at pitch natural period the experimental results of model rd show an increasing trend with a small plateau the numerical results also show an increasing trend when the wave period increase but the pitch decreases first after its natural period on model sq a similar difference can be found when the wave period is 12s it is suspected that the strong coupling between surge and pitch is underestimated in the numerical model when the natural periods of surge and pitch are very close if we compare the natural periods of pitch the rise of the natural period is more obvious from around 8s to around 10 5s this indicates that the influence of the bottom skirts on the pitch is also significant the added mass calculated in surge heave and pitch from the numerical simulation is plotted in the first row of fig 10 the added mass on the heave of the model sq has been increased to around 1 5 times that of the model rd and the added mass in pitch is increased even more at around 2 times that of model rd the second row of fig 10 shows the first order wave excitation forces on both fhsts an interesting phenomenon is that the wave excitation force on pitch of the model rd is much larger than that of model sq and there is a knockout point of the force on model sq the knockout is thought to be relevant to the phase cancellation the heave excitation forces are similar on both models another noticeable phenomenon is that although the raos of the 3 d o f motions of the model sq at the resonance frequencies are larger than those of the model rd the damping level is significantly different the viscous damping values applied in the numerical model for both fhst are listed in table 7 larger damping coefficients of the model sq than that of the model rd can be found due to the existence of bottom skirts furthermore both models show large viscous damping due to the existence of sharp corners where vortex shedding can occur 7 1 2 test results in 20 loading condition partially loaded condition and comparison with simulations the model tests with internal liquid were carried out at a storage volume of 1000 m3 in the prototype which is 20 of the design storage capacity fig 11 a shows the photo of model rd with internal liquid fig 11 b is the photo taken underwater the internal water was dyed so that the liquid motion can be seen in the numerical simulations the internal liquid is also assumed to be water to keep it the same as in the experiments the experimental and numerical raos of the motions and loads of both models are shown in fig 12 good agreement is found between numerical and experimental results in surge and heave in addition similar conclusions on the bottom effect can be drawn as in the previous section the square bottom performs better than the model rd in waves the fender forces are also dominated by the surge motion with the presence of internal liquid surge and pitch of the fhst are reduced significantly especially under longer wave periods for example within the tested wave periods the surge rao has been significantly reduced to be smaller than 4 m m and pitch is now all less than 4 deg m as explained before the internal liquid has both hydrostatic effects and dynamic effects the former influences the natural periods in both surge and pitch of the fhst the later split the single peak into two peaks on the surge and pitch raos due to the sloshing motion coupling if a linear sloshing model is assumed in the surge motion of the fhst the first peak is found at around 7 0s and the second peak is not captured in the wave frequency range similarly the peak on roll motion is at around 8s and the second peak is not captured lee 2008 explained this phenomenon through a simplified 2 d o f spring mass system and more detailed derivation can be found in faltinsen and timokha 2017 violent internal liquid motions were observed during the model test for wave periods from 9s to 12s which introduce strong nonlinearities to the system such nonlinear behaviors can also explain why the pitch motion shows discrepancy between experimental and numerical results the linear sloshing model in the numerical simulation tends to overestimate the raos of the pitch under regular waves for longer wave periods to maintain focus on the conceptual validation on the fhst the motions of the fhst are of interest the nonlinear sloshing effect will not be analyzed in detail in this paper and it will be investigated in the future 7 2 irregular wave test results and comparison with the simulations the tests under the 1 year and 100 year sea states are performed for the selected filling ratios for both models as listed in table 6 the duration for each irregular wave test is 1 5 h in full scale the duration is chosen to avoid the unrealistic influence from the reflections in the basin the time history of the incident wave measured without the presence of the model was input into the numerical simulation a single seed was selected in both experiment and numerical simulations as this is sufficient for the present conceptual validation after the numerical model is validated extreme response analysis will be conducted in the future with more random seeds the motions of both fhsts under 1 year sea states are very small so only results in the extreme environmental conditions will be presented in this part the dynamic response of the system in the fully loaded condition is not as severe as it is in the empty and partially loaded condition therefore the results in the fully loaded conditions are not covered here due to the limited pages 7 2 1 comparison of irregular wave test results in empty loading conditions the wave frequency responses in surge heave and pitch the sum fender reaction forces in x direction the reaction forces of fender 1 and fender 2 and the reaction forces of fender 5 and fender 6 in 100 year waves are shown in fig 13 comparative results can be found between numerical simulations and experiments in both amplitudes and phases in all three d o f motions as well as the sum fender forces the response spectra of these motions and forces are presented in fig 14 there is good agreement between numerical and experimental spectra for both models which is in line with the comparison of the time history there exist two peaks on the surge spectra of both fhsts the first peak of both spectra occurs at around 7s 0 9 rad s which is the peak period of the incident waves and the second peak of model sq s surge spectra occurs at around 10s 0 65 rad s which corresponds to the natural period of pitch because of surge pitch coupling the second peak of the surge of model rd occurs at its own surge natural period as the pitch natural period was found at around 8s around 0 79 rad s from the previous regular wave test results the surge response spectra of these two models are quite close to each other however the spectra of heave and pitch of these two fhsts show considerable differences the model sq has a much smaller spectral density of heave and pitch which are around 1 3 that of the model rd it verifies the conclusion that the bottom skirts improve the hydrodynamic performance of the fhsts it is also noteworthy that the bottom skirts only increase the bottom surface by 1 5 and contribute less than 10 of the total structural mass one should note that these comparisons are on the first order level but there also exists small second order responses for instance the pitch spectra show a small peak at 0 25 rad s on fig 14 c the statistical results in the 1 5 h duration tests are summarized in fig 15 as the numerical results are close to the experimental results the statistics from numerical results is not plotted here in these figures the statistics of the global responses and the statistics of the wave frequency and low frequency responses are provided separately here our definition of the low frequency response is the response which has a frequency smaller than 0 5 rad s where there is no wave energy in the wave spectrum from these figures we can find that even under the extreme sea states all the motions are quite acceptable especially when the bottom skirts are present the maximum surge heave and pitch are now 1 6 m 0 8 m and 3 2 deg respectively without bottom skirts by including the bottom skirts the maximum heave and pitch can be further reduced to around 0 6 m and 1 9 deg the second order motions are all less than 10 that of the wave frequency responses in surge and heave but it has a slightly larger contribution to the global response on pitch motion the fender reaction forces are not plotted here but one can simply calculate the fender force from the surge motion and the fender stiffness to estimate the level of the forces thus the maximum reaction force on a single fender is around 1000 kn which is an acceptable level for standard marine fenders 7 2 2 comparison of irregular wave test results in partially loading condition the measured response of the partially loaded fhst with and without bottom skirts are also compared with numerical simulations the comparison of the response spectra is shown in fig 16 the heave spectra show very good agreement as it is not affected by sloshing while the surge and pitch spectra show acceptable agreement with some discrepancies compared with the empty case there is a significant reduction in the surge spectra between 0 6 rad s to 0 8 rad s and there exist small peaks at around 0 6 rad s the reduction has been predicted by the numerical model as well but the numerical model tends to overestimate the small peak value at around 0 6 rad s this is also suspected to be related to the violent sloshing under the long waves in the model test as discussed the present linear sloshing model does not properly capture the nonlinear sloshing effects at longer wave period the slightly overestimated spectral density can also be found on the pitch from the numerical model when the wave frequency smaller than 0 9 rad s for both models it is also suspected to be caused by the nonlinear sloshing in the longer waves as pointed out in the regular wave tests however one should note that all these differences are very limited because the wave energy of the long waves which can cause serious nonlinear sloshing in the tested sea states is quite small from the model test video the violent sloshing is found to happen occasionally overall the hydrodynamic responses are well predicted by the linear sloshing model in the tested conditions fig 17 shows the experimental statistics of the response of both fhsts in the partially loaded condition under the 100 year waves in the partially loaded condition the surge of model sq and the heave of both models are quite close to the results in the empty case and the second order responses are small as well in this case compared to the pitch responses in the empty condition a noticeable increase of pitch can be found for both fhsts in the partially loaded condition the maximum pitch is around 4 deg for model sq and around 5 2 deg for model rd in the presence of internal liquid both maximum pitch responses increase by around 2 deg compared to those in the empty case the maximum surge of the model rd is suppressed to around 1 0 m and it is smaller than the surge of the model sq in the partially loaded case this difference is suspected to be caused by the pitch sloshing surge coupling but it should be further studied in the future as the pitch is relatively large in this partially loaded case and the violent sloshing is also found during the test some further improvement on the concept should be adopted to avoid any risks for example the sloshing can be suppressed by adopting a chamfer shape in the tank corners change the size of the internal tank and operational measures such as restricting the operation in shallow loading condition especially when seasonal weather patterns prevail 8 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis is important as all the measurements in the model test require scrutiny as pointed out by ittc 2014 the true value from the measurements might never be known due to uncertainties these uncertainties should be analyzed to confirm the quality of the obtained data otherwise the results might mislead the research the total uncertainty can be divided into the bias errors which is systematic and constant and the precision errors which are random and vary with repetitions the bias errors include the measurement error from the facility itself the equipment and the sensors etc some of these bias errors are not obvious such as the equipment induced errors and we should note that not all the uncertainties can be addressed directly it is difficult and sometimes even impossible to carry out a complete uncertainty analysis drummen 2008 wan et al 2018 therefore only the important sources of uncertainty are summarized and their effects are discussed in this paper 8 1 uncertainty on model geometrical dimension and the mass distribution there are inevitable systematic errors on the model fabrication and preparation work the uncertainties mainly include the error on the geometrical dimensions of the model the total mass and mass distribution on the model as the fhst models were made of standard acrylic tubes and standard flat plates the error on the thickness of the plates and wall of the tubes is within 0 5 mm and the overall diameter has an error less than 1 mm as suggested by ittc 2017 on manufacturing tolerances the measured dimensions are compared with the scaled value from the prototype in table 8 the weight of the models and the mass of the solid ballast are checked carefully before the model tests however it is hard to measure the moments of inertia through the swing test as the weight of both models is less than 40 kg alternatively the mass distribution is firstly calculated and then the physical model follows the same setup this approach is feasible because we were using the standard shape of materials the errors on the mass properties are listed in table 9 in both tables 8 and 9 the errors are calculated by x e x p x t a r g e t x e x p 100 x e x p and x t a r g e t are the measured and designed dimensions respectively very small difference in the total weight and a little larger difference 12 4 on the radius of gyration rzz can be observed but these differences have weak effects on the interested results 8 2 uncertainty on the calibrations the sensors beam system and incident waves before the model tests all the load cells were calibrated by applying a stepwise increase and subsequent decrease of the standard weights while the wave probes were calibrated by moving the position of the probes in static water upon and down the motion tracking system was calibrated by following the procedure from its official user manual phasespace 2007 the bias errors of this system are small one of the potential important errors is on the calibration of the fender load cell system and the installation of the fender system the stiffness of the 8 fenders and the force relationship between f and f are plotted as fig 18 a it shows that the errors are quite small and these errors are thought to be bias errors the installation can introduce errors on the position of the fenders and introduce an extra source of frictional forces although difficult to quantify such errors can be minimized by a careful procedure of double checking on installed dimensions for example the frictional forces at the hinge and the pin support are reduced by applying grease to these parts frequently during the test to ensure the incident wave quality in the basin all the incident waves were repeated at least three times before the model test as the results are taken before the reflection come to the model position in regular wave test the uncertainty in this part is limited the random waves are also documented before test and one of the generated spectra compares well with the target spectrum as in fig 7 the statistics of the wave amplitude in 100 year waves are shown in fig 18 b the errors on the results collected by wp1 to wp3 in the middle of the basin are all smaller than 10 another source of uncertainty on the irregular wave quality is the cutoff on the wave spectrum in the model test due to the limitation of the wave maker capacity the cutoff in the test happens at around 1 8 rad s around 3 5s and it causes a loss of wave energy smaller than 5 as the wave energy at this frequency range is very small and out of the resonance range of the motions very limited influence should be introduced in general the uncertainty caused by the incident waves are limited 8 3 uncertainty on the regular and irregular wave tests during the model test some of the test runs were repeated for example the regular wave test on model sq with a period of 8s was repeated four times with these repeated tests it was possible to know the level of the dispersion to some extent the raos obtained from the different runs of 8s regular wave tests are presented in fig 18 c the mean stands for the mean value of the results without the influence of incident waves while r means the results considering the reflections the maximum errors of the measured surge heave and pitch are 4 5 7 and 4 1 respectively which are all quite acceptable the influence of the reflected waves is small for this wave frequency the reflection influence may be different at the other wave periods but due to the limitation of time it was not possible to repeat all the tests 8 4 uncertainty in the numerical simulations in the numerical simulations several parameters can affect the results for example the fender stiffness and the damping coefficient as we used a similar setup in both numerical simulations and experiments most of the uncertainties have been well controlled except for one important uncertainty nonlinear damping the nonlinear damping includes both the frictional damping and the viscous damping the viscous damping is considered in quadratic form based on empirical formula and tuned by model test results from both decay and wave tests the real viscous damping is hard to quantify and simulated in the numerical model in the future a sensitivity study should be conducted to quantify the uncertainties similarly the uncertainty on the material frictional parameter is also omitted in this paper 9 conclusions and future works this paper introduces the conceptual design of an innovative floating hydrocarbon storage facility then it mainly focuses on the model tests and the numerical simulations of the single fhst concept supported by mooring fender system two fhsts configurations with and without bottom skirts under empty and partially loading and fully loading condition were tested and simulated these two fhsts have the smallest storage capacity at 5000 m3 in the conceptual design the results from the numerical simulations are compared with the experimental results in the empty and partially loading conditions the main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follow through the hydrodynamic responses of the novel designed single hull fhst it is verified that this concept at the three loading conditions performs very well even under extreme conditions both fhsts perform quite stable in the 100 year waves also the results indicate that the horizontal stiffness of the system is properly selected with the use of the bottom skirts the hydrodynamic responses are reduced especially on the heave and pitch there are increases of both heave and pitch natural period and damping the bottom skirts only increase the weight of the fhst by around 8 but reduce the motion by more than 20 this is suggested to be adopted in the conceptual design of fhst and the bottom skirts could be applied in other similar shallow water applications to reduce motions however careful study is needed as the bottom skirts also introduce additional excitation forces in the shallower draft case the comparison of the numerical and experimental results shows some discrepancy in the regular waves which is believed to be caused by the interactions of surge pitch and nonlinear sloshing the numerical model with linear sloshing tends to overestimate the pitch motions fortunately the discrepancy due to nonlinear sloshing appears to be over predicted under the periodical waves only in the more realistic irregular waves the numerical models predict the motions and loads of the fhsts well because the wave energy at the long waves are quite small the effect of the nonlinear sloshing on the motions are marginal important in the irregular waves but it still occurs occasionally as the nonlinear sloshing can cause impact inside the tank it is worthwhile to investigate further on this problem so that the concept can be extended to other sites with harsher sea states main sources of uncertainty in the tests are identified and analyzed comprehensively but the uncertainties in the numerical simulations are discussed briefly the incident waves in the coastal basin show good quality and the reflections are limited some of the model tests were repeated for several times variations among the tests are small where both the incident waves and the responses are within 10 the numerical uncertainties such viscous damping effects are identified but omitted in this paper as it is difficult to quantify in the limited pages however the good agreements between the model test and numerical results give confidence that the uncertainty should be acceptable for proving the concept in the future work it is suggested to perform a further study on mitigating the nonlinear sloshing inside the fhst in light loaded case as it can be a potential risk for the local structure secondly the horizontal stiffness from the fender system is a good modeling of the prototype design however the fenders considered in the model test are not very practical due to the following reasons the frictional forces on the plane fenders can be much larger in prototype there are gaps between fender and fhst for easy installation but the gaps are not beneficial for controlling the yaw motions a more practical mooring system should be investigated thirdly the extreme response analysis should be carried out to check the long term responses of the fhst in addition as the entire system is complex the interactions between the fhsts and the surrounding barges should be studied to ensure there is no serious green water and wave impact on the fhsts further tests are being carried out at sintef ocean to investigate these effects and will be reported separately acknowledgment this research is supported in

22779,an innovative floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf has recently been proposed the facility consists of several modular floating hydrocarbon storage tanks fhsts surrounded by floating barges with compliant mooring system hydrodynamic loads on the fhst and its dynamic response are important for the global design to validate the concept of the single fhst model tests at 1 48 7 scale is performed in the coastal basin in national university of singapore two models of single fhst with different bottom slab shapes are tested one of which has bottom skirts the mooring fenders to support the model were mimicked by a flexible beam system fresh water is used to fill the tank at different filling ratios decay tests regular wave tests and irregular wave tests under design sea states are performed the rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom and the sum fender reaction forces were measured numerical model of the single fhst is established and analyzed in frequency domain and time domain the effect of the bottom skirt internal liquid and the fender system were considered viscous damping is calculated based on the empirical formula and adjusted by comparing with measured results numerical results are comparative to the experimental results this paper shows the motions of the tested fhsts are mild even in the 100 year storm and the bottom skirts effectively reduce the hydrodynamic responses keywords hydrodynamic responses very large floating structure hydrocarbon storage tank model test 1 introduction in recent years the demand for developable land around coastal countries such as japan and singapore has increased significantly for residential purposes as well as industrial and logistics uses in addition with the sea level increase due to climate change these countries have to face the potential risk of losing land area in the coming decades one feasible option is to reclaim the land from the sea nevertheless the cost of land reclamation in deeper waters are more expensive and time consuming land reclamation may also introduce irreversible influence on the ecosystem and be limited by the territorial boundary in this case very large floating structure vlfs can provide eco friendly flexible and economical solution there have been various types of vlfs constructed or proposed worldwide for many different applications for instance the mega float project in japan watanabe et al 2004 the very large offshore aquaculture floating structures proposed by sulaiman et al 2013 the floating bridges in e39 projects in norway eidem 2017 and many other applications on floating breakwaters dai et al 2018 in singapore constructing a large floating structure is feasible because of the benign sea state conditions a successful application of a floating structure in singapore is the floating platform in marina bay wang and tay 2011 there can be many other potential applications for large floating structure in singapore such as floating fuel storage facilities floating lng regasification facilities floating cities etc as singapore locates nearby the busiest shipping strait there is a huge demand for the oil storage facilities which can occupy a considerable land area recently an innovative concept on the floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf has been developed by the joint research team from the national university of singapore nus and sintef ocean norway sponsored by l2nic directorate and jtc corporation singapore the preliminary conceptual design of the system was briefly introduced in wan et al 2018 while the updated conceptual design of the fhsf is shown in fig 1 a the concept is inspired by the successful application of two floating fuel storage facilities in japan which locate at the shirashima island and kamigoto island as shown in fig 2 a and 2 b respectively the novel fhsf concept was proposed to be at modular design aiming at the storage of different types of oil product and bring down the construction cost by modular design the facility can be easily scaled up or down according to the customer s needs for such a complicated soft connected multibody system there are challenges to investigate the whole concept in terms of hydrodynamic analysis which involves sloshing multi body interactions hydro elasticity etc which has pushed current numerical model to its boundaries in this case the hydrodynamic investigation starts from the single fhst a well designed fhst will contribute to the reduction of the hydrodynamic responses of the complete system in the initial stage a double hull concept was investigated numerically by wan et al 2018 the results show a good performance of the structure for a totally new conceptual design an experimental study is usually important for the verification work as pointed out by faltinsen 1993 a series of model tests have been designed and performed in the coastal basin of the hydraulic lab in nus for the single fhst under various environmental conditions in these tests a single fhst is supported by special designed mooring fender system the details on the mooring fender system and its behavior are investigated numerically by wan et al 2018 and han et al 2017 based on the preliminary concept while zhang et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic responses of a single fhst supported by fenders by means of experiment in this paper the latest conceptual design is introduced firstly in part 2 the detailed setup of the model test is introduced in part 3 and part 4 and the model test matrix is presented in part 5 the numerical model including the description of the bottom skirt linear sloshing model and the fender model is provided in part 6 the results from the experiments are compared with the numerical results in part 7 followed by the uncertainty analysis in part 8 finally the conclusions and the future work are summarized 2 concept description the overall dimensions of the entire fhsf system are around 300 m long by 310 m wide with a total storage capacity of 300 000 m3 the entire fhsf is composed of the floating hydrocarbon storage tanks fhsts and the floating barges there are two types of fhst proposed in the design small tank with a storage capacity from 5000 m3 to 15000 m3 and large tank with a storage capacity from 30 000 m3 to 35 000m3s as shown in fig 1 b the small fhst is composed of a central cylinder named as the central tank for hydrocarbon storage and 4 side cylinders called floaters which provide extra buoyancy and increase the hydrostatic stability as well as protect the central tank the large fhst has a similar design but with an octagonal outer shape and 8 cylindrical floaters the fhsts are single hull structures made of concrete to ensure a 60 year design life one advantage of the single hull design is the hydrostatic pressure inside and outside of the tank can balance with each other thus can reduce the wall thickness the fhsts will be restrained by the mooring system such as mooring fenders or mooring hawsers and the mooring system will be connected to the floating barges in addition to provide anchor points the other functions of these barges include protection on the fhsts against potential ship collision working as a breakwater and supporting the pipelines and daily operational access the floating barges are also made of concrete but the wave bending may cause a problem for the very flat wide concrete structure which has a length at around 310 m and a depth of around 6 8 m thus the barge is also proposed to employ modular design and the modules will be connected through flexible connectors these softer connectors are expected to reduce the sectional bending moments on the barges and the stress on the deck and bottom significantly the floating barges will be restrained by mooring dolphins connected to the seafloor and the horizontal motion of the entire floating barges will be restrained the entire system will be free floating in the vertical direction which is effective in dealing with tidal influence although the system is designed for shielded coastal water the concept can be extended to other applications in open sea it can also be extended for other different purposes with minor modifications thus it serves as an example for other modular compliant structures 3 fhst models and the test facility the fhst with a storage capacity of 5000 m3 is the prototype model tested in the experiment as it is considered to be easily affected by the environmental conditions among all the different fhsts the prototype is initially proposed to be scaled down by a scale factor of 1 48 7 based on froude scaling law the scaling factors of the main parameters under froude scaling are shown in table 1 for a single fhst its character diameter d is 30 9 m and the h s of the extreme sea state is 1 8 m by assuming h max 2 h s the keulegan carpenter number k c œÄ h max d which reflects the ratio of drag force and gravity force dnvgl 2014 is only around 0 36 it indicates that the drag force is not dominating thus adopting froude scaling is proper in this model test the single fhst tests are all performed in waves only without wind and current and the incident waves come from one direction there are two models designed and tested in the experiments as shown in fig 3 a and b the only difference between them is the bottom slab part called bottom skirts as shown in fig 3 b the idea of adding these bottom skirts is borrowed from the successful application of the heave plates on spars magee 2000 intensive research work done by molin 2011 tao and cai 2004 an and faltinsen 2013 and tian et al 2017 show the effectiveness of the heave plate on increasing the damping and added mass in heave the bottom skirts are also expected to increase the viscous damping on the pitch in the present case similar to the bilge keels on ship however it is a concern that the bottom skirt will also increase the wave excitation force in the shallower draft condition the effects from the bottom skirts should be carefully checked for ease of recognition the model with bottom skirts and its prototype will be denoted as model sq and the other one without bottom skirts will be denoted as model rd respectively the measured dimensions and the mass properties of the two models are presented in table 2 and table 3 due to the manufacture uncertainty some dimensions in model scale do not follow the scale strictly the difference is analyzed in part 8 the radiuses of gyration in table 3 are all with reference to the center of gravity cog and the vertical cog is measured from the lower surface of the bottom slab the mass difference caused by the bottom skirt is only around 8 both models are assembled of transparent acrylic tubes and plates the water tightness is ensured by checking the draft of the model before and during the model tests frequently to ensure the same structural mass and mass distributions the solid ballast was set in the floaters and the internal liquid is simulated by dyed water the volume of the water in the model test is determined by scaling the designed volume of the stored hydrocarbon product down it indicates that the total mass of the model is heavier than the scaled mass of the prototype due to the difference between the density of the fresh water and hydrocarbon product the draft of the model is also larger than the target due to this difference the design drafts of the prototype when storing hydrocarbon product and when storing fresh water of the same volume assumed are listed in table 4 the increase of the drafts is around 2 5 in partially loaded condition and 7 5 for the fully loaded condition for both fhsts the measured draft of the model sq and model rd at different loading conditions are also listed in table 4 the loading condition has been defined as the percentage of the designed storage capacity the model test facility which is the coastal basin is shown in fig 4 a the basin is 25 m long 10 5 m wide effective width 7 5m and its water depth varies from 0 1 m to 0 9 m during the model test the water depth is fixed at 0 369 m which corresponds to the water depth of 18 m in the prototype the 13 unit piston type wavemaker can generate a maximum wave height of 0 3 m and the generated wave periods vary from 0 5 to 3 5 s in model scale there is a passive artificial beach on the other end to absorb the wave energy the model test setup is shown in fig 4 b and c the model locates near the center of the coastal basin which is 11 5 m away from the wave maker and the model test system is supported by a specially designed frame five kenk capacitive wave probes wps were installed in the basin as shown in fig 4 b 8 hbm bending load cells were utilized to measure the forces on the fenders these load cells have an effective measurement range from 0 to 700 n the 6 d o f rigid body motions of the model were captured by the phasespace motion tracking system phasespace 2007 which consists of 4 optical cameras and several led markers the optical cameras are mounted on the frame as shown in fig 4 b while the 4 led markers are installed on the roof of the model the origin of the coordinate system to describe the model motion locates at the center of the water plane on the mean water level the z direction is positive upward the x axis points to the wave maker direction and the y direction follow the right hand rule all the load cells the wave probes and the motion tracking system were calibrated before the model test 4 mooring fender design in the test the mooring fender system is initially proposed as shown in fig 5 a in this system there exist gaps between the fhsts and the fenders as in practice this system was tested at first but it was found from the model test that the yaw motion of the fhst was not well behaved even under moderate environmental conditions due to the existence of free floating scenario where the fhst is not in contact with any fenders thus the fender system is improved by eliminating the gaps in the test the fenders are simulated by a set of assembled flexible aluminum beams as shown in fig 5 b the details of one of the fenders are shown in fig 6 a the flexible beams are articulated to the support frame and the load cells to reduce the friction force while the teflon parts on the end of the flexible beam can reduce the friction force between the model and the beams the reaction force can be measured by the load cell directly with the assumption that the motions of the fhst are not that large and the aluminum beam will not yield the stiffness of the beams can be derived as eq 1 the relationship between the measured force and the hydrodynamic force can be calculated by eq 2 1 k 3 e i l 1 l 2 2 l 2 3 2 f f l 1 l 2 l 1 in which k is the equivalent stiffness e is the young s modulus i is the second moment of area l 1 and l 2 are the lengths of the beam as shown in fig 6 b f and f are the force from fhst to the fender and the reaction force at the load cell support respectively the measured force has the opposite sign as the reaction force the effective stiffnesses of the beams are adjustable by either changing the thickness of the beam or the position of the pin support in this paper the thickness of the beams is chosen as 0 004 m and the width is 0 025 m the theoretical stiffness of the beam is around 875 kn m in full scale which gives the equivalent horizontal stiffness of 1750 kn m the stiffnesses of all the beams were calibrated before the model test and the pullout test gave the relationship between the load cell reading and the applied force at the end the calibration curves and the force relationship between the applied force and the load cell reading are shown in fig 6 c and d the linearity of the beam stiffness is quite good and the calibrated stiffness are close to the theoretical stiffness as designed the uncertainties in these calibration works will be introduced in part 8 5 test matrix the tests carried out in the basin include the inclining test decay test regular wave test and random wave tests the inclining tests are performed firstly to ensure the vertical cog is close to the designed value the static offset tests provide the information on the horizontal stiffness of the system provided by the fenders then the decay tests are performed for the 6 d o f motions in the calm water to identify the damping ratio and the natural period of the system can be identified however the number of peaks in the signal is not enough to accurately determine the damping coefficient as shown in zhang et al 2018 to quantify the viscous damping the decay tests are performed in the numerical simulation the time traces of the motion are then compared to the experimental response regular wave tests are performed to identify the hydrodynamic properties of the single fhst i e the transfer functions of its motions and the loads with the assumption that the waves are linear considering the environmental conditions in the coastal area the period of the generated regular waves varies from 4s to 12s with 1s interval however due to the shallow water in the coastal area the waves include the deep water waves intermediate water waves and shallow water waves to ensure the linearity and the quality of the generated waves the wave steepness is designed to be between 1 100 to 1 20 the test matrix of the regular wave tests is listed in table 5 all the regular wave tests last for 120s in the model tests including the time for ramping up the incident regular waves were calibrated before the model test the sea state with 1 year return period the specific site around singapore has significant wave height hs 1 0 m and peak period tp 5s and the sea state with the 100 year return period has hs 1 8 m and tp 7s the 1 year and 100 year sea states are defined as the maximum operational and extreme environmental conditions for the fhsf respectively the jonswap spectrum is adopted to generate random waves in both sea states with a default peakedness parameter Œ≥ 3 3 the random waves are also calibrated before the model tests considering the capability of the wave maker 1 5 h random wave model tests are performed the test matrix of the irregular wave tests is listed in table 6 one realization of the 100 year waves is shown in fig 7 c the comparison between the spectra the cumulative distribution functions of the generated waves and corresponding theoretical values are shown in fig 7 a and b good agreement with expected results can be found confirming the good quality of the waves in this coastal basin 6 numerical simulations with a properly validated numerical model numerical analysis can be performed to gain insights of the dynamic response of the coupled system for single fhst supported by mooring fender system there exist nonlinear effects in the system for example the frictional forces from the fenders nonlinear fender stiffness and the nonlinear wave excitation forces to handle the involved the nonlinearities a hybrid frequency and time domain analysis is preferred wan et al 2015 the hybrid model is proposed by cummins 1962 as shown in eq 3 for a rigid body with quadratic damping term 3 m a x t d 1 x t d 2 x t x t 0 t h t œÑ x œÑ d œÑ kx t f exc t x x in which x t x t and x t are the 6 d o f motions velocities and accelerations respectively m a and k are the corresponding mass matrix added mass matrix at infinite frequency and restoring matrix respectively f exc is the vector of generalized wave excitation forces d 1 and d 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients the retardation function which expresses the influence of fluid memory effects in the convolution term can be expressed as the following 4 h œÑ 2 œÄ 0 œâ a œâ a sin œâ œÑ d œâ 2 œÄ 0 b œâ b cos œâ œÑ d œâ where a œâ and b œâ is the added mass and damping matrix respectively b denotes the potential damping at infinite frequency which is normally zero for the offshore structure with no forward speed the matrix a b k and the force vector f exc are calculated in the frequency domain in hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 based on three dimensional potential theory results are subsequently imported into simo sintef ocean 2018 which is a time domain simulation code developed by sintef ocean the numerical model is built based on the dimensions scaled back from the dimensions of the physical models in both frequency domain and time domain numerical simulations the linear wave theory is adopted and the second order drift force is calculated based on the newman approximation newman 1974 with the mean drift forces calculated by the far field method which has better accuracy faltinsen 1993 but only the drift motions of the surge sway and yaw can be calculated there is a disputation that newman s approximation should preferably not be used in the shallow water condition stansberg and p√¢kozdi 2009 but as shown later the motions in present case are primarily driven by the first order forces the internal liquid not only has hydrostatic effects but also introduces extra dynamic effects known as sloshing the influence on hydrostatics can be considered by introducing modification on the restoring forces on pitch and roll but the dynamic effects can be a fully nonlinear phenomenon and is difficult to account for especially when wave frequency close to the resonance frequency of internal liquid malenica et al 2003 the sloshing effects will induce additional inertia loads which can be expressed as added mass force in hydrostar the problem in the internal fluid domain and the external fluid domain are solved separately and the extra dissipation is introduced on the inner wall boundary to suppress the near singular spike on added mass one may refer to chen 2004 for more details on solving the internal liquid problem in hydrostar a sensitivity study was carried out in the frequency domain to check the influence of the dissipation effect by comparing to the experimental results the damping ratio is selected as 0 05 an engineering approach of taking sloshing effect into consideration in time domain simulation has also been discussed by jin et al 2017 in frequency domain analysis a small frequency interval of 0 01 rad s is adopted to capture the potential sloshing mode and the time step is 0 01s in time domain analysis to assure numerical convergence the internal liquid is also simulated as fresh water in the numerical model at this stage to keep the same setup as in the experiments the bottom skirts have been introduced in the frequency domain model to find out their effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients both upper and lower surface of the skirt are meshed to ensure the convergence of the numerical analysis the mesh size of the bottom skirt is set to around 0 75 m close to the skirt thickness fig 8 a and b show the meshes used in the frequency domain analysis the fender model is considered in the time domain analysis in the numerical simulation point fenders are assumed and they provide both compressive normal force which is proportional to the compression displacement and the frictional forces normal to the motion direction as described in eq 5 5 f n f r c r e r r n f f Œº f n s s in which f n is the normal force r is the projected distance on the normal direction f r is the force induced by the distance r which is relevant to the stiffness curve of the fender the second term in f n is the damping force relevant to the internal damping coefficient c of the fender and this term is neglected in the numerical model in this paper as the material damping of the flexible aluminum beam in the model test is negligible f f is the frictional force Œº is the direction independent friction coefficient and s is the motion vector of the contact point as there is no available information on the frictional coefficient between teflon and acrylic the coefficient between teflon and steel is adopted instead the coefficient between teflon and steel is 0 04 as suggested by grigoriev et al 1997 as the friction coefficient is negligible so no significant impact on the results are expected the measured pre compression forces on each fender in the experiment are input to the numerical model the stiffness of each fender will be discussed in the uncertainty analysis the viscous effects on pitch and roll motions are considered as quadratic damping in the time domain numerical model the quadratic damping is estimated by the semi empirical formula presented by standing and tramoni as cited in molin 2002 from the model test on a rectangular sectional barge with w t around 5 or 10 6 b q 1 2 œÅ c d w 4 l in which b q is the quadratic damping œÅ is the density of the water w t and l are the breadth draft and length of the structure respectively c d is the damping coefficient which can be tuned by decay tests the fhst has a near rectangular section and in the shallower draft case and its w t is around 5 in the shallower draft case thus the semi empirical formula eq 6 is assumed applicable while the viscous damping in heave surge and sway are assumed in the quadratic form as the drag term in morison s formula dnvgl 2014 on the translational motions one should note the viscous damping is considered based on the empirical form which gives comparable results the estimated damping coefficient of the surge heave and pitch are plotted in table 7 the number of peaks in the decay tests is not enough to determine either the damping coefficient or the natural period thus the viscous damping is tuned based on comparison of the experimental and numerical results from decay test by comparing the time traces of the motion response for different damping values with the measured motion from the decay test the relative damping can be estimated the quadratic damping ratio in regular and irregular waves are further tuned based on the ratios obtained from the decay test in the numerical simulation the damping value is adjusted iteratively to approach comparable variances between the experimental and numerical results the detailed procedure of analysis on the viscous damping are not covered here the procedure adopted in this paper is empirical 7 results and discussion 7 1 results from regular wave tests and comparison with simulations regular wave tests were performed to obtain the response amplitude operators raos of the rigid body motions with the mooring fender system in the empty and partially loaded condition in addition to the rigid body motions the fender forces are summed to obtain the horizontal forces in x and y directions the reaction forces of fender 1 fender 2 fender 5 and fender 6 are summed and denoted as fx the sum reaction forces of fender 3 fender 4 fender 7 fender 8 are denoted as fy in all the figures below the empty and partially loaded condition will be denoted as fl00 and fl20 respectively the rao of the specific response is determined by the amplitude of obtained motion divided by the amplitude of the incident wave at the model position the raos from the numerical simulations are calculated based on the same procedure the amplitudes of the responses and the incident wave are taken as 2 times the standard deviations of the responses and incident waves respectively to ensure the accuracy of the model test results the 10 cycles of responses are determined after the responses approach steady state and before the reflected waves come to the model position 7 1 1 results in empty loaded condition and comparison with simulations for both model sq and model rd the numerical results compare well to the experimental results in surge and heave as shown in fig 9 a and b the surge natural periods of both models are larger than 11s and model sq has a larger natural period which is also caused by the existence of the bottom skirt this influence is even more obvious on heave the natural period of heave is around 7 5s for model rd and it is increased by around 20 to 9s for model sq the significant increase in heave natural period is caused by the additional added mass introduced by the bottom skirts in the wave period range between 5s and 8s which covers the peak period range of the design sea states the reduction in heave rao is very considerable which confirms that the bottom skirts are good for this concept the raos of the sum reaction forces of the fender system fx and fy are plotted in fig 9 d the trend of the raos just follows that of surge rao in other words the sum forces are mainly dominated by the surge motion in both cases fy force is small and negligible the small disturbance can be caused by the unsymmetrical of the initial pre compression forces the comparison between numerical and experimental pitch motion follows the same trend as those for heave and surge despite some difference in the actual values strong pitch surge coupling is found in the raos when the wave period is close to surge natural period pitch rao is also relatively large for example after the first peak at pitch natural period the experimental results of model rd show an increasing trend with a small plateau the numerical results also show an increasing trend when the wave period increase but the pitch decreases first after its natural period on model sq a similar difference can be found when the wave period is 12s it is suspected that the strong coupling between surge and pitch is underestimated in the numerical model when the natural periods of surge and pitch are very close if we compare the natural periods of pitch the rise of the natural period is more obvious from around 8s to around 10 5s this indicates that the influence of the bottom skirts on the pitch is also significant the added mass calculated in surge heave and pitch from the numerical simulation is plotted in the first row of fig 10 the added mass on the heave of the model sq has been increased to around 1 5 times that of the model rd and the added mass in pitch is increased even more at around 2 times that of model rd the second row of fig 10 shows the first order wave excitation forces on both fhsts an interesting phenomenon is that the wave excitation force on pitch of the model rd is much larger than that of model sq and there is a knockout point of the force on model sq the knockout is thought to be relevant to the phase cancellation the heave excitation forces are similar on both models another noticeable phenomenon is that although the raos of the 3 d o f motions of the model sq at the resonance frequencies are larger than those of the model rd the damping level is significantly different the viscous damping values applied in the numerical model for both fhst are listed in table 7 larger damping coefficients of the model sq than that of the model rd can be found due to the existence of bottom skirts furthermore both models show large viscous damping due to the existence of sharp corners where vortex shedding can occur 7 1 2 test results in 20 loading condition partially loaded condition and comparison with simulations the model tests with internal liquid were carried out at a storage volume of 1000 m3 in the prototype which is 20 of the design storage capacity fig 11 a shows the photo of model rd with internal liquid fig 11 b is the photo taken underwater the internal water was dyed so that the liquid motion can be seen in the numerical simulations the internal liquid is also assumed to be water to keep it the same as in the experiments the experimental and numerical raos of the motions and loads of both models are shown in fig 12 good agreement is found between numerical and experimental results in surge and heave in addition similar conclusions on the bottom effect can be drawn as in the previous section the square bottom performs better than the model rd in waves the fender forces are also dominated by the surge motion with the presence of internal liquid surge and pitch of the fhst are reduced significantly especially under longer wave periods for example within the tested wave periods the surge rao has been significantly reduced to be smaller than 4 m m and pitch is now all less than 4 deg m as explained before the internal liquid has both hydrostatic effects and dynamic effects the former influences the natural periods in both surge and pitch of the fhst the later split the single peak into two peaks on the surge and pitch raos due to the sloshing motion coupling if a linear sloshing model is assumed in the surge motion of the fhst the first peak is found at around 7 0s and the second peak is not captured in the wave frequency range similarly the peak on roll motion is at around 8s and the second peak is not captured lee 2008 explained this phenomenon through a simplified 2 d o f spring mass system and more detailed derivation can be found in faltinsen and timokha 2017 violent internal liquid motions were observed during the model test for wave periods from 9s to 12s which introduce strong nonlinearities to the system such nonlinear behaviors can also explain why the pitch motion shows discrepancy between experimental and numerical results the linear sloshing model in the numerical simulation tends to overestimate the raos of the pitch under regular waves for longer wave periods to maintain focus on the conceptual validation on the fhst the motions of the fhst are of interest the nonlinear sloshing effect will not be analyzed in detail in this paper and it will be investigated in the future 7 2 irregular wave test results and comparison with the simulations the tests under the 1 year and 100 year sea states are performed for the selected filling ratios for both models as listed in table 6 the duration for each irregular wave test is 1 5 h in full scale the duration is chosen to avoid the unrealistic influence from the reflections in the basin the time history of the incident wave measured without the presence of the model was input into the numerical simulation a single seed was selected in both experiment and numerical simulations as this is sufficient for the present conceptual validation after the numerical model is validated extreme response analysis will be conducted in the future with more random seeds the motions of both fhsts under 1 year sea states are very small so only results in the extreme environmental conditions will be presented in this part the dynamic response of the system in the fully loaded condition is not as severe as it is in the empty and partially loaded condition therefore the results in the fully loaded conditions are not covered here due to the limited pages 7 2 1 comparison of irregular wave test results in empty loading conditions the wave frequency responses in surge heave and pitch the sum fender reaction forces in x direction the reaction forces of fender 1 and fender 2 and the reaction forces of fender 5 and fender 6 in 100 year waves are shown in fig 13 comparative results can be found between numerical simulations and experiments in both amplitudes and phases in all three d o f motions as well as the sum fender forces the response spectra of these motions and forces are presented in fig 14 there is good agreement between numerical and experimental spectra for both models which is in line with the comparison of the time history there exist two peaks on the surge spectra of both fhsts the first peak of both spectra occurs at around 7s 0 9 rad s which is the peak period of the incident waves and the second peak of model sq s surge spectra occurs at around 10s 0 65 rad s which corresponds to the natural period of pitch because of surge pitch coupling the second peak of the surge of model rd occurs at its own surge natural period as the pitch natural period was found at around 8s around 0 79 rad s from the previous regular wave test results the surge response spectra of these two models are quite close to each other however the spectra of heave and pitch of these two fhsts show considerable differences the model sq has a much smaller spectral density of heave and pitch which are around 1 3 that of the model rd it verifies the conclusion that the bottom skirts improve the hydrodynamic performance of the fhsts it is also noteworthy that the bottom skirts only increase the bottom surface by 1 5 and contribute less than 10 of the total structural mass one should note that these comparisons are on the first order level but there also exists small second order responses for instance the pitch spectra show a small peak at 0 25 rad s on fig 14 c the statistical results in the 1 5 h duration tests are summarized in fig 15 as the numerical results are close to the experimental results the statistics from numerical results is not plotted here in these figures the statistics of the global responses and the statistics of the wave frequency and low frequency responses are provided separately here our definition of the low frequency response is the response which has a frequency smaller than 0 5 rad s where there is no wave energy in the wave spectrum from these figures we can find that even under the extreme sea states all the motions are quite acceptable especially when the bottom skirts are present the maximum surge heave and pitch are now 1 6 m 0 8 m and 3 2 deg respectively without bottom skirts by including the bottom skirts the maximum heave and pitch can be further reduced to around 0 6 m and 1 9 deg the second order motions are all less than 10 that of the wave frequency responses in surge and heave but it has a slightly larger contribution to the global response on pitch motion the fender reaction forces are not plotted here but one can simply calculate the fender force from the surge motion and the fender stiffness to estimate the level of the forces thus the maximum reaction force on a single fender is around 1000 kn which is an acceptable level for standard marine fenders 7 2 2 comparison of irregular wave test results in partially loading condition the measured response of the partially loaded fhst with and without bottom skirts are also compared with numerical simulations the comparison of the response spectra is shown in fig 16 the heave spectra show very good agreement as it is not affected by sloshing while the surge and pitch spectra show acceptable agreement with some discrepancies compared with the empty case there is a significant reduction in the surge spectra between 0 6 rad s to 0 8 rad s and there exist small peaks at around 0 6 rad s the reduction has been predicted by the numerical model as well but the numerical model tends to overestimate the small peak value at around 0 6 rad s this is also suspected to be related to the violent sloshing under the long waves in the model test as discussed the present linear sloshing model does not properly capture the nonlinear sloshing effects at longer wave period the slightly overestimated spectral density can also be found on the pitch from the numerical model when the wave frequency smaller than 0 9 rad s for both models it is also suspected to be caused by the nonlinear sloshing in the longer waves as pointed out in the regular wave tests however one should note that all these differences are very limited because the wave energy of the long waves which can cause serious nonlinear sloshing in the tested sea states is quite small from the model test video the violent sloshing is found to happen occasionally overall the hydrodynamic responses are well predicted by the linear sloshing model in the tested conditions fig 17 shows the experimental statistics of the response of both fhsts in the partially loaded condition under the 100 year waves in the partially loaded condition the surge of model sq and the heave of both models are quite close to the results in the empty case and the second order responses are small as well in this case compared to the pitch responses in the empty condition a noticeable increase of pitch can be found for both fhsts in the partially loaded condition the maximum pitch is around 4 deg for model sq and around 5 2 deg for model rd in the presence of internal liquid both maximum pitch responses increase by around 2 deg compared to those in the empty case the maximum surge of the model rd is suppressed to around 1 0 m and it is smaller than the surge of the model sq in the partially loaded case this difference is suspected to be caused by the pitch sloshing surge coupling but it should be further studied in the future as the pitch is relatively large in this partially loaded case and the violent sloshing is also found during the test some further improvement on the concept should be adopted to avoid any risks for example the sloshing can be suppressed by adopting a chamfer shape in the tank corners change the size of the internal tank and operational measures such as restricting the operation in shallow loading condition especially when seasonal weather patterns prevail 8 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty analysis is important as all the measurements in the model test require scrutiny as pointed out by ittc 2014 the true value from the measurements might never be known due to uncertainties these uncertainties should be analyzed to confirm the quality of the obtained data otherwise the results might mislead the research the total uncertainty can be divided into the bias errors which is systematic and constant and the precision errors which are random and vary with repetitions the bias errors include the measurement error from the facility itself the equipment and the sensors etc some of these bias errors are not obvious such as the equipment induced errors and we should note that not all the uncertainties can be addressed directly it is difficult and sometimes even impossible to carry out a complete uncertainty analysis drummen 2008 wan et al 2018 therefore only the important sources of uncertainty are summarized and their effects are discussed in this paper 8 1 uncertainty on model geometrical dimension and the mass distribution there are inevitable systematic errors on the model fabrication and preparation work the uncertainties mainly include the error on the geometrical dimensions of the model the total mass and mass distribution on the model as the fhst models were made of standard acrylic tubes and standard flat plates the error on the thickness of the plates and wall of the tubes is within 0 5 mm and the overall diameter has an error less than 1 mm as suggested by ittc 2017 on manufacturing tolerances the measured dimensions are compared with the scaled value from the prototype in table 8 the weight of the models and the mass of the solid ballast are checked carefully before the model tests however it is hard to measure the moments of inertia through the swing test as the weight of both models is less than 40 kg alternatively the mass distribution is firstly calculated and then the physical model follows the same setup this approach is feasible because we were using the standard shape of materials the errors on the mass properties are listed in table 9 in both tables 8 and 9 the errors are calculated by x e x p x t a r g e t x e x p 100 x e x p and x t a r g e t are the measured and designed dimensions respectively very small difference in the total weight and a little larger difference 12 4 on the radius of gyration rzz can be observed but these differences have weak effects on the interested results 8 2 uncertainty on the calibrations the sensors beam system and incident waves before the model tests all the load cells were calibrated by applying a stepwise increase and subsequent decrease of the standard weights while the wave probes were calibrated by moving the position of the probes in static water upon and down the motion tracking system was calibrated by following the procedure from its official user manual phasespace 2007 the bias errors of this system are small one of the potential important errors is on the calibration of the fender load cell system and the installation of the fender system the stiffness of the 8 fenders and the force relationship between f and f are plotted as fig 18 a it shows that the errors are quite small and these errors are thought to be bias errors the installation can introduce errors on the position of the fenders and introduce an extra source of frictional forces although difficult to quantify such errors can be minimized by a careful procedure of double checking on installed dimensions for example the frictional forces at the hinge and the pin support are reduced by applying grease to these parts frequently during the test to ensure the incident wave quality in the basin all the incident waves were repeated at least three times before the model test as the results are taken before the reflection come to the model position in regular wave test the uncertainty in this part is limited the random waves are also documented before test and one of the generated spectra compares well with the target spectrum as in fig 7 the statistics of the wave amplitude in 100 year waves are shown in fig 18 b the errors on the results collected by wp1 to wp3 in the middle of the basin are all smaller than 10 another source of uncertainty on the irregular wave quality is the cutoff on the wave spectrum in the model test due to the limitation of the wave maker capacity the cutoff in the test happens at around 1 8 rad s around 3 5s and it causes a loss of wave energy smaller than 5 as the wave energy at this frequency range is very small and out of the resonance range of the motions very limited influence should be introduced in general the uncertainty caused by the incident waves are limited 8 3 uncertainty on the regular and irregular wave tests during the model test some of the test runs were repeated for example the regular wave test on model sq with a period of 8s was repeated four times with these repeated tests it was possible to know the level of the dispersion to some extent the raos obtained from the different runs of 8s regular wave tests are presented in fig 18 c the mean stands for the mean value of the results without the influence of incident waves while r means the results considering the reflections the maximum errors of the measured surge heave and pitch are 4 5 7 and 4 1 respectively which are all quite acceptable the influence of the reflected waves is small for this wave frequency the reflection influence may be different at the other wave periods but due to the limitation of time it was not possible to repeat all the tests 8 4 uncertainty in the numerical simulations in the numerical simulations several parameters can affect the results for example the fender stiffness and the damping coefficient as we used a similar setup in both numerical simulations and experiments most of the uncertainties have been well controlled except for one important uncertainty nonlinear damping the nonlinear damping includes both the frictional damping and the viscous damping the viscous damping is considered in quadratic form based on empirical formula and tuned by model test results from both decay and wave tests the real viscous damping is hard to quantify and simulated in the numerical model in the future a sensitivity study should be conducted to quantify the uncertainties similarly the uncertainty on the material frictional parameter is also omitted in this paper 9 conclusions and future works this paper introduces the conceptual design of an innovative floating hydrocarbon storage facility then it mainly focuses on the model tests and the numerical simulations of the single fhst concept supported by mooring fender system two fhsts configurations with and without bottom skirts under empty and partially loading and fully loading condition were tested and simulated these two fhsts have the smallest storage capacity at 5000 m3 in the conceptual design the results from the numerical simulations are compared with the experimental results in the empty and partially loading conditions the main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follow through the hydrodynamic responses of the novel designed single hull fhst it is verified that this concept at the three loading conditions performs very well even under extreme conditions both fhsts perform quite stable in the 100 year waves also the results indicate that the horizontal stiffness of the system is properly selected with the use of the bottom skirts the hydrodynamic responses are reduced especially on the heave and pitch there are increases of both heave and pitch natural period and damping the bottom skirts only increase the weight of the fhst by around 8 but reduce the motion by more than 20 this is suggested to be adopted in the conceptual design of fhst and the bottom skirts could be applied in other similar shallow water applications to reduce motions however careful study is needed as the bottom skirts also introduce additional excitation forces in the shallower draft case the comparison of the numerical and experimental results shows some discrepancy in the regular waves which is believed to be caused by the interactions of surge pitch and nonlinear sloshing the numerical model with linear sloshing tends to overestimate the pitch motions fortunately the discrepancy due to nonlinear sloshing appears to be over predicted under the periodical waves only in the more realistic irregular waves the numerical models predict the motions and loads of the fhsts well because the wave energy at the long waves are quite small the effect of the nonlinear sloshing on the motions are marginal important in the irregular waves but it still occurs occasionally as the nonlinear sloshing can cause impact inside the tank it is worthwhile to investigate further on this problem so that the concept can be extended to other sites with harsher sea states main sources of uncertainty in the tests are identified and analyzed comprehensively but the uncertainties in the numerical simulations are discussed briefly the incident waves in the coastal basin show good quality and the reflections are limited some of the model tests were repeated for several times variations among the tests are small where both the incident waves and the responses are within 10 the numerical uncertainties such viscous damping effects are identified but omitted in this paper as it is difficult to quantify in the limited pages however the good agreements between the model test and numerical results give confidence that the uncertainty should be acceptable for proving the concept in the future work it is suggested to perform a further study on mitigating the nonlinear sloshing inside the fhst in light loaded case as it can be a potential risk for the local structure secondly the horizontal stiffness from the fender system is a good modeling of the prototype design however the fenders considered in the model test are not very practical due to the following reasons the frictional forces on the plane fenders can be much larger in prototype there are gaps between fender and fhst for easy installation but the gaps are not beneficial for controlling the yaw motions a more practical mooring system should be investigated thirdly the extreme response analysis should be carried out to check the long term responses of the fhst in addition as the entire system is complex the interactions between the fhsts and the surrounding barges should be studied to ensure there is no serious green water and wave impact on the fhsts further tests are being carried out at sintef ocean to investigate these effects and will be reported separately acknowledgment this research is supported in
